"Demands: Sir Bruce Keogh says there is a need to improve plastic surgery patients' safety . Beauty therapists, hairdressers and doctors will have to undergo special training before injecting women with dermal fillers, the medical director of the NHS is expected to announce. Sir Bruce Keogh, who is leading a Government review of the booming plastic surgery industry, said that a lack of expertise means patients having the popular non-surgical treatments are exposed to ‘unreasonable risks’. Unlike Botox, which smooths out lines by paralysing muscles, fillers plump up the skin, fill in wrinkles and crow’s feet and create younger-looking cheeks and lips. Once the preserve of the rich and famous, they have soared in popularity as prices have dropped. However, there is growing concern that those who inject the substances lack the knowledge and skill to do it properly. As a result, patients, who are mainly female, are suffering complications from swelling and bruising to blindness, with knock-on financial and psychological effects. The Daily Mail reported the case of a bride whose wedding was ruined after the facial fillers she paid for to look perfect for her big day left her with serious nerve damage, blurred vision, insomnia and depression. A survey of plastic surgeons last year found that up to 70 per cent have been sought out by patients with complications caused by fillers – almost three times the figure three years previously. Many of professionals who inject them will have undergone only a few hours of training, which could be as basic as watching a demonstration before practising on a friend. Sir Bruce, who is due to publish his review of the cosmetic surgery industry as a whole later this month, said there was a ‘clear need’ to improve patient safety. This could take the form of a new law which would require everyone administering the treatments to have formal qualifications. Sir Bruce said: ‘I am concerned that . some practitioners who are giving non-surgical treatments may not have . had any appropriate training whatsoever. ‘This . leaves people exposed to unreasonable risks, and possibly permanent . damage. And our research has shown that the public expect procedures . that are so widely available to be safe whereas they are largely . unregulated. Danger: The fact that doctors, hairdressers and beauty therapists are not required to undergo proper training is exposing their mainly female patients to 'unreasonable risks' ‘There is a clear need for better quality, recognised training for the people performing these operations. ‘My review will make a number of recommendations for making sure people who choose to undergo these procedures are in safe hands.’ The EU is drafting its own guidelines but these are at an earlier stage. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons gave Sir Bruce’s comments a cautious welcome. It agrees more training is needed but wants the treatments to be administered solely by medical professionals, capable of spotting and treating any resulting health or psychological problems. The crackdown on the industry, which will cover everything from breast implants to Botox, is also likely to include banning cut-price deals and the introduction of a staged process of consent to give patients time to reflect on their decision. Victim: Sarah Payne was left with permanent scars after a busted filler procedure . Sarah Payne couldn’t bear to look in the mirror after she had a facial filler treatment that went horribly wrong. Miss Payne, 58, paid for injections to plump up her cheeks. At first, she was pleased with the results. But the filler quickly splintered into tiny pieces and complications set in. Miss Payne, a mother of three from central London, developed visible, hard lumps in her left cheek and under her right eye and severe swelling. She said: ‘I became very scared as the lumps got worse. 'I had always been proud of my physical appearance but couldn’t bear to look at myself in the mirror.’ Corrective surgery five years later, in 2010, removed some but not all of the fragments of filler and she has been left scarred. Last night, Miss Payne said that better training for those giving the jabs is not the only answer to ensuring such procedures are safe. She said the Government needs to do more to ensure the safety of the substances themselves. The retired beauty clinic worker said: ‘The Government is taking the easy option.’","Injecting fillers to require special training, NHS medical director to announce .

"Amy and Jerry Pajotte love the New England Patriots just as much as they do each other, which is why last month they couldn't help but include the team in their wedding day celebrations. The couple, who moved to a house right next to Gillette Stadium four years ago,  got married in custom-made Patriots gear, included football references in their vows and made their grand entrance at the reception to the team's song. All of this garnered them attention from team owner Robert Kraft, who gave the newlyweds front-row tickets and a field pass to the Patriots' game against the Chicago Bears as a wedding gift, which Amy attended in her gown. Scroll down for video . Mr and Mrs Patriot: Jerry and Amy Pajotte's Patriots-themed wedding earned them front-row tickets to the team's October 26 game against the Chicago Bears. Pictured above at the game in their wedding attire, just two days after tying the know . Wedding gift: When team owner Robert Kraft (right) found out about the Pajotte's Patriots wedding, he gave them the free tickets as a wedding gift and even dropped by their house on the way to the game . 'This is an experience we are going to remember for the rest of our lives,' Jerry told the Foxboro Reporter. 'To be able to do this after our wedding, with Amy in her dress, and around the people that we love and the crowd and the fans that we love, there's nothing better than this.' Kraft found out about the diehard couple's nuptials after Jerry  wrote him a letter detailing their elaborate wedding. Bride Amy's 'something blue' was her shoes, Patriots blue heels with the team's Minuteman logo. Meanwhile, Jerry wore a tie and vest with the logo as well and his groomsmen donned custom-made jerseys with each of their last names emblazoned on the back. Team gear: The bride and groom were decked out in Patriots gear for their October 24 nuptials. Bride Amy seen above in a Patriots jersey with her new last name emblazoned on the back . Something blue: Amy followed bridal wear tradition with her Royal Blue heels decked out with the Minuteman logo . The groom's team: Instead of tuxedos, Jerry's groomsmen wore jerseys with their last names inked on the back . At the ceremony, the bride and groom exchanged their own vows, promising to 'stay together through touchdowns and fumbles'. 'And that's good for a Patriots first kiss,' the wedding officiant said at the end. To make their entrance at the reception, the Pajottes came in to Ozzy Osbourne's 'Crazy Train' - the same song that the Patriots use to arrive on the field before each game. 'We all got into a circle and were jumping up and down and cheering. It was almost like a real Patriots entrance,' Jerry said. 'We are still getting text messages about that entrance. It was awesome.' Honeymoon: The morning after watching their favorite team vanquish the Chicago Bears on October 26, the Pajottes boarded a plane to St Lucia for their honeymoon . Kraft found the ceremony charming, and after sending the newlyweds tickets, he made a surprise stop at their house on the way into the stadium on game day. The new Mrs Pajotte was so excited to see the Patriots owner that she ripped her wedding dress running out of the house to greet him. After that, the couple took their usual route over the railroad tracks to Gillette Stadium to see the Patriots beat the Chicago Bears 51-23. The next morning, the couple boarded a flight to their honeymoon in St Lucia.","Amy and Jerry Pajotte, who live next door to Gillette Stadium, tied the knot last month in Foxborough, Massachusetts .

"A Great White shark seals the fate of this hapless sea creature - as it launches itself clear out of the water to snatch a snack. The dramatic series of images were captured at Seal Island, off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa. Photographer Chris McLennan, from New Zealand, snapped 28 shark breaches in a single hour. The notorious shark-infested waters are said to be one of the only places in the world where sharks breach when hunting their prey - the Cape fur seal. Snap happy: A great white shark breaches the water at Seal Island, off the coast of Cape Town, South Africa. Unfortunately its dinner was a decoy seal deployed by photographer Chris McLennan to capture this amazing image .

I wanted to get the Holy Grail of shark images - the breach with a natural predation. 'Anyone who has photographed wildlife will know sightings of this type of behaviour are still rare to witness and more difficult to catch on camera.' Chris used a decoy seal towed by a boat during the second day of his trip when there was a lull in activity. But he still managed to capture real-life nature in action. Force of nature: The enormous Great White, which can weigh more than 1,000kilos, soars several feet clear of the water as it hits the decoy seal .

"Graham Wallace has resigned as Rangers' chief executive just two days after failing to stop Mike Ashley grabbing power at Ibrox. The League One champions confirmed former Manchester City executive Wallace's departure in a 7am statement to the Stock Exchange. In a separate statement made to the AIM - a sub-market of the London Stock Exchange - the crisis-hit club also announced it had accepted Ashley's £2million loan offer, effectively handing control to the Newcastle United owner. Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley's (left) loan being accepted has led to Graham Wallace's resignation . Kenny Miller (obscured, second left) scores Rangers' first goal in their 3-0 victory over Dumbarton . Mike Ashley now owns 8.92 per cent of Rangers' shares and, under a Scottish FA agreement, the Newcastle United owner cannot have boardroom influence or a shareholding or more than 10 per cent while he owns a club in England. He is not, however, the club's leading shareholder. Despite that, Ashley's emergence loan effectively gives him control due to the influence he can now exert. The Newcastle owner already has the naming rights to Ibrox and runs the club's retail division. 26 per cent of shares - Sandy Easdale (he is not on the plc board but holds voting rights for 26 per cent of shares). 8.92 per cent of shares - Mike Ashley. Wallace was brought in as chief executive last November by PLC chairman David Somers to lead the restructuring of the club. He was criticised by the fans for failing to reveal the true state of the club's fragile finances, and also found himself at odds with football board chairman Sandy Easdale - who controls a significant 26 per cent stake through shares and proxies - as he tried to push through a £16million rescue package being offered by former oldco director Dave King. Easdale, though, was determined to forge an alliance with Ashley, and the Sports Direct tycoon has now got his way. Wallace's only ally on the board, finance director Philip Nash, resigned on Friday and now he has also decided to walk. The Stock Exchange statement on his departure said: 'Rangers announces that Graham Wallace, chief executive officer, has resigned as a director and employee of the company and its subsidiaries with immediate effect. Philip Nash also resigned from his position as director from the Rangers board on Friday . Kris Boyd (left) and Miller (centre) celebrate after the latter scored Rangers' third goal against Dumbarton . 'The directors would like to thank Graham for his contribution to the club during a difficult period. 'The board has commenced the search for a chief executive officer. A further announcement will be made in due course.' Wallace's exit will come as a major blow to boss Ally McCoist, with the pair having formed a close bond in the 11 months they worked together. Ashley's £2million offer will see Rangers into the New Year and there could be future funding to follow that . News of Wallace's resignation from his £315,000-a-year role was swiftly followed by confirmation of Ashley's £2million interest-free loan. It will give Rangers some much-needed breathing space following rumours the club were due to run out of cash on Tuesday. Magpies chief Ashley - who owns 8.92 per cent of the Glasgow giants - saw off a late bid by Sale Sharks owner Brian Kennedy to put forward his own emergency loan facility and now has the Ibrox club in his iron-like grasp. Although Ashley is prohibited from owning more than 10 per cent of Rangers while owning Newcastle after he signed an agreement with the Scottish Football Association three years ago, he does run the club's retail division and holds naming rights to the stadium. The terms of his loan now gives him security over the Albion Car Park and Edmiston House facilities on the doorstep of Ibrox - and crucially gives him the power to select Wallace and Nash's board replacements. Reports have suggested Derek Llambias and Stephen Mucklow will be the men put forward. Rangers manager Ally McCoist oversaw his side's 3-0 victory over Dumbarton on Saturday . The club's second Stock Exchange statement confirmed Ashley's move had been made in the name of his company MASH Holdings Limited. It said: 'The board is pleased to announce that the company's subsidiary, The Rangers Football Club Limited, has entered into a credit facility agreement with MASH Holdings Limited pursuant to which MASH shall make available the sum of £2million for drawdown by the company. 'MASH is a shareholder in the company holding 8.92 per cent of the voting rights in the company. The facility shall be secured by standard security granted by the company over Edmiston House and Albion car park. The facility shall be for a six-month term and is interest-free. The facility will be used by the company for general working capital purposes. Under the terms of the facility, MASH has the right to appoint up to two directors on the board of directors of RFCL. 'Further to the announcement made on 8 October 2014, the company has entered into a letter agreement with MASH (the 'withdrawal letter') pursuant to which the company has invited MASH to put forward the names of two nominees of its choice for appointment to the board, such appointments being subject to all necessary regulatory approvals being successfully completed for such persons nominated by MASH. 'In addition, the company confirms that MASH has agreed the immediate withdrawal, by virtue of the withdrawal letter, of the notice served by MASH on the company on 7 October 2014 requiring the company to convene a general meeting of the shareholders of the company to put resolutions to such shareholders for the removal of Mr Graham Wallace and Mr Philip Nash as directors of the company.'

"An airplane made an emergency landing at Midland International Airport in Texas late on Tuesday after a female passenger became ill and the cabin crew grew concerned that she could have the deadly Ebola virus. American Airlines Flight 2791 from Dallas was scheduled to land at Midland just after 11 pm, but just 20 minutes before landing the captain called to alert authorities that an unnamed passenger was displaying flu-like symptoms. With the entire country on high alert over the Ebola outbreak in Texas, the crew of Flight 2791 were concerned that the passenger may have the deadly disease - despite the face she had come from Turkey and not an infected region. Scroll down for video . American Airlines Flight 2791 made an emergency landing at Midland International Airport late on Tuesday after a female passenger became ill and the crew grew concerned that she could have Ebola . The woman was vomiting - an important symptom of Ebola - but according to Public Information Officer Sarah Bustilloz she didn’t have a fever - another important symptom. Bustilloz told CBS7 that it is ‘highly unlikely’ that the woman has Ebola. Another important factor that makes Ebola unlikely is that the woman wasn't coming from an infected area. She had traveled from Istanbul, Turkey through London to Dallas and then on to Midland. 'At this point, we are considering it not to be Ebola but we never want to rule anything completely out. It's highly unlikely that it is Ebola,' said Bustilloz. The woman was transported to Midland Memorial Hospital following disease control procedures, but later released as local authorities determined it was 'highly unlikely' that she has the Ebola virus . Local authorities however were taking no chances on Tuesday night and as the plane touched down on the tarmac, emergency crews were on hand and emergency lights flashing. Midland Fire Department personnel boarded the plane in hazmat suits to assess the situation and the woman was transported to Midland Memorial Hospital following disease control procedures. After being monitored by local health and emergency management authorities, the woman was allowed to leave. Officials have contact information for all 69 people aboard the flight and have asked that if any display any flu-like symptoms they are to immediately notify their local health department as a precautionary measure.","Twenty minutes before landing the captain of Flight 2791 called ahead to say the crew were concerned about a passenger with flu-like symptoms .

"A dangerous rescue dog which was on the verge of being put down due to its vicious nature has been saved after it settled down and found love... with a goose. Rex the German Shepherd was so vicious it would take two people to feed him, one to distract him and the other to throw a bowl of food into his enclosure. But his temper changed after Geraldine the goose arrived at the animal sanctuary where he was staying. True love: Rex was once a snarling German Shepherd who couldn't be fed by hand but the influence of Geraldine has seen him become placid pooch . At first the owners at the Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue centre feared Rex would attack the bird if it strayed into his territory. But the first time they got near one another, their reaction was one of affection more than aggression. The pair are now allowed to run free together and even sleep Rex's bed every night. Staff have been surprised by how close they have become and believe the once angry bird and growling dog bring out the softer side in each. 'It's so comical to see them because they love each other to bits', said Sheila Brislin, who runs the centre near Bridgwater, Somerset. The pair were initially kept apart at their animal sanctuary, but after being allowed near one another they have now become best friends . Sheila Brislin, who runs the Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue centre, said: 'It's so comical to see them because they love each other to bits' 'She just runs around alongside him all day long and whenever we take him for a walk in the woods she has to come too. 'They are very affectionate and he's always licking her head. She snuggles into him and they sleep together every night. 'Normally any bird that crossed his path would have been eaten by now, he's that kind of dog, but not Geraldine. 'I've been doing rescue work since 1997 and seen all kinds of strange animal behaviour, but I've never seen anything like this.' Rex, aged 11, came to the sanctuary after he was found tethered by a chain in a scrapyard eight years ago. Both of the animals were rescued from owners who couldn't control them, workers at the sanctuary believe they are kindred spirits because there were both so feisty . Sheila added: 'They were going to give him a lethal injection to put him down because he had bitten everybody at his previous shelter and there was nothing they could do with him. 'They were so scared of him one worker had to distract him at the front of the run while the other threw his food in at the back.' But since Rex met Geraldine he's a changed animal. 'They snuggle down together and Rex puts his leg over her to protect her. In the morning they have breakfast together. It's really sweet to see them.' It used to take two people to feed Rex, one to distract him while another put his bowl down. But he is a changed dog since meeting Geraldine . But not everybody is smitten with the romance and Rex's former friend Vera, also a German Shepherd, is upset after being ousted by the green-eyed goose. 'Geraldine doesn't like Vera at all and makes it quite clear that Rex is hers', said Sheila. 'She goes on the attack if she comes anywhere near and Vera is scared of her. 'We've had to give Vera lots of cuddles and attention so she doesn't feel left out.'","Rex the German Shepherd was a rescue dog with a bad temper .

"Shamed Co-op Bank boss Paul Flowers was linked to a special school at the centre of one of Britain’s worst child sex abuse scandals, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Methodist minister Flowers was vice-chairman of Rochdale Council’s social services committee which oversaw Knowl View School, during a time when it was described as a ‘sweet shop for paedophiles’. Yet a series of damning reports – at least one sent to Flowers – about the crimes at Knowl View were hidden from the public. Paul Flowers was vice-chairman of Rochdale Council’s social services committee which oversaw Knowl View School, during a time when it was described as a ‘sweet shop for paedophiles’ Knowl View . The residential unit for boys  aged seven to 16 with learning and behavioural problems is now subject to a police investigation into the sexual and physical abuse of former pupils. Meanwhile Rochdale Council is conducting its own inquiry into Flowers’s years as a councillor in the light of his drug-taking, exposed by The Mail on Sunday last month. The Knowl View scandal broke last . year after the Crown Prosecution Service accepted that the school’s . founder, the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith, who knew Flowers through the . council, should have been prosecuted for child abuse. The school, founded in 1969, eventually closed in 1995, after a member of staff alerted council bosses to ongoing problems. Yet alarm bells were being rung constantly by health professionals from 1988 to 1992 when Flowers held key council posts. Whistleblower Martin Digan, whose appointment as the school’s head of care heralded its closure, said: ‘Flowers was one of many people in power in Rochdale who knew what was happening and yet did not act to close the school down. He was vice-chair of the social services committee in 1991 when the first of three reports was circulated internally about the risk to pupils in terms of sexual and physical abuse. He knew what the parents of pupils were never told – that the school was basically a sweet shop for paedophiles.’ The . current storm surrounding 63-year-old Flowers’s shocking drugs habit . prompted his arrest by police on suspicion of supplying Class A drugs, . including cocaine and crystal meth. The . Treasury is holding an inquiry into the Co-op Bank, where he was . chairman until his resignation in June, and the bank has launched its . own internal review. Flowers was suspended by the Labour Party and the Methodist Church for which he was a minister in Bradford. By . the time Flowers moved to Rochdale in September 1986 to take over the . Methodist church at Champness Hall in Drake Street, he was already a . controversial figure. In . 1981 while ministering in Southampton, he was fined £75 for ‘gross . indecency’ in a public toilet with a trucker and was moved to West . Bromwich by the church. Four . years later, he was chosen as a Labour prospective parliamentary . candidate for Meriden, in the West Midlands, but he resigned three . months later when his criminal record surfaced. 'The fat man': MP Cyril Smith in 1972 with Rochdale children not from . Knowl View School. Paul Flowers has been linked to Knowl View, founded . by Smith and at the centre  of a sex abuse scandal . Once . in Rochdale, Flowers, an ardent Labour supporter, was elected to the . council in 1988 and joined its education and social services committees. In 1988 Dr Alison Frazer, a child psychiatrist at the town’s Birch Hill . Hospital, first alerted the council to possible sexual abuse at Knowl . View. Three . years later, Phil Shepherd, of the Rochdale Health Authority Aids Unit, . was asked to go to the school to carry out a ‘sexuality’ training day . with staff. His . discoveries, penned in a report to council bosses, were shocking: ‘One . boy who is homosexual has contact with an adult outside the school. Several of the senior boys indulge in oral sex with one another. ‘Reputedly five of the junior  boys have been or are involved in “cottaging” in and around public toilets. Men as far away as Sheffield are believed to be aware of this activity and travel to Rochdale to take part. Power: The Rev Paul Flowers in 1990 when he held key Rochdale Council posts . One eight year old is thought to have . been involved .  .  . some boys have been “forced” to have sex with . each other.’ He concluded: ‘We are committed to preventing the spread of . HIV. The boys in this school look  to us to be increasingly at risk.’ One former pupil, Chris Marshall, now 41 . but aged seven when at the school, told the MoS: ‘Our lives were a . living hell. Teachers would take pupils to a public toilet in Manchester . where the boys would have sex with men who had travelled from all over . the North. Men would come to the school and we were made to have sex with them. I was forced to perform a sex act on the late MP Cyril Smith who we called the Fat Man. ‘It had such an effect on us that some of the boys have either committed suicide or are in prison. ‘I feel let down by the council because we were vulnerable children and they were supposed to be taking care of us but instead we were exposed to the most horrible acts of depravity.’ The Mail on Sunday has seen a letter, dated April 16, 1991, concerning this report from the Director of Social Services to the local health authority, copied to Flowers among others. By then, Flowers and his colleagues on Rochdale social services committee were already facing calls to resign over the Satanic abuse scandal when 16 children were wrongly taken from their parents and rehomed, some in Knowl View. Last week, Rochdale Council announced an inquiry into his time at the authority. A spokesman said: ‘We have nothing to hide and want to move on from the past. It was a dreadful period and unfortunately Rev Flowers was around at the time, although whether he was calling any shots is another matter.’ There is no suggestion that Flowers was in any way involved in criminal activity at Knowl View.However, Flowers had been going through a turbulent time. In October 1990, he suffered a suspected heart attack a day after his car was stolen and his house burgled. The following month, he was forced to come out as gay after his gross indecency conviction came to light. Last night, the MoS put the Rev Flowers’s link to Knowl View School as well as the latest text message revelations to his lawyer. Solicitor Andy Hollas said: ‘I can make no comment whatsoever. It would be in everybody’s interests  if the spotlight was turned off to let the police make their inquiries.’ Since The Mail on Sunday first revealed his debauched lifestyle,  the Reverend Paul Flowers’s fall  from grace has been accompanied by lurid text insights into a man obsessed by drugs and sex. Now a series of text messages between the Methodist minister and  a male escort throws a fresh light on the depths of his depravity and  prove that his use of hard drugs  was no aberration. As these messages show, immediately after the story of his shocking lifestyle first became public, he was planning a trip to Amsterdam with two rent boys. And his favourite method of payment for the services of young men was telephone banking. We join the minister on October 29, after he has spent the day waiting in vain to give evidence to the Treasury Select Committee, only for his appearance to be rescheduled.He is reclining with one escort  while making plans to see two more the following night... Flowers surfaced mid-afternoon and once he transferred the money for sex, his mind was soon back to his other preoccupation .  .  . hard drugs. It's the following Wednesday and his appearance before the MPs is over . With a prayer to read later that morning at Bradford’s Remembrance Day service, Rev Flowers limbered  up with an alarming unholy trinity of mind-altering substances. His post-Select Committee bender still ongoing, a friend helps the Rev find a novel new way of imbibing his favourite horse tranquilliser, ketamine. Worried by the sudden break  of contact, his friends ask if something’s wrong. It is. His  double life has been exposed by The Mail on Sunday.

"A man has been killed in a shark attack while fishing with a group of friends off the south coast of Australia. The 28-year-old victim was part of a spear-fishing group when he went missing in the water off Goldsmith Beach, which is off the Yorke Peninsula, west of the state capital, Adelaide.

Sergeant Mark Stuart said: 'Some of them did witness it.

'There wasn't a competition today but they were planning to do that somewhere tomorrow. 'They were diving loosely in a group, probably within a few hundred metres of each other."" Locals said the great white had been in the area for about a week, having been attracted by an abundance of snapper fish. The attack comes as the Western Australian Government fends off criticism of a shark culling program it introduced last month to protect swimmers. The policy allows for great white, tiger, and bull sharks larger than 3 metres to be killed, while smaller sharks are to be released. Opponents of the policy say there is no scientific evidence that killing the sharks will reduce their threat to swimmers.","Victim was spear-fishing off the Yorke Peninsula, west of Adelaide .

"Clumpy, clunky and downright dangerous. Yes, the wedge — the scourge of fashionable feet everywhere — is back this summer with a vengeance. The Duchess of Cambridge has always been a fan of this ghastly, ugly footwear, but when she was snapped jumping in a pair at the Commonwealth Games this week, I held my head in my hands. Not only because she looked so downright silly but because her insistence on wearing these monstrosities means there’ll now be an endless succession of women prepared to ruin elegant summer outfits with a pair of clodhoppers. Scroll down for video . Corker of a style mistake: Victoria Beckham in hers . Sister act: Pippa Middleton's a fan too . No medals: Kate at Commonwealth Games . Hermione and the giant wedges: Emma Watson . I’m sick of the sight of them already. The usually stylish Sharon Stone all but ruined her elegant white ensemble lunching in Los Angeles, while Princess Beatrice looked far from regal at Ascot last month in cliffs of cork. And these two are only the thin end of the wedge. However elegant the occasion, a hulking great heel has somehow become acceptable attire. And women are seemingly blind to how this brutish footwear is ruining their look. After the hours spent picking out a pretty dress, dainty jewellery and stylish handbag, they put the sartorial equivalent of bricks on their feet. Even the usually well-turned-out Joan Collins has worn the ugliest wedges I’ve ever seen. And Meryl Streep, who normally never gets it wrong, is no stranger to wedges either — despite them giving her granny cankles and somehow adding inches to her waist. Meanwhile, Victoria Beckham is often seen modelling pairs of sandals bigger than her head. No winner: Princess Beatrice at Ascot . Doing her thighs no favour: A-lister Jennifer Aniston . So why is it that so many women are heffalumping around on built-up bits of wood? Some claim they don’t sink into the grass at weddings and sports events. Come on girls, you’re usually wearing them to posh bars and restaurants. Others believe the shoes look sexy — that they do the same as a stiletto heel to lengthen the leg. Well, ladies, it’s the stiletto’s spike and curve that gives the illusion of a longer, shapelier leg. The wedge, by contrast, makes even the lithest of legs look fat and stumpy. And, like it or not, men don’t like clumpy heels. They are just a weird fashion fad guys don’t understand: yet another season ‘must-have’ that looks ugly and unsexy, yet women insist on wearing. I can’t imagine a man asking a woman to ‘keep her wedges on’ in the bedroom — he’d probably fear for his safety. Soprano shoe shocker: Katherine Jenkins . Not all-white: Actress Kate Beckinsale clomps about . Basic error: Sharon Stone in wedges . Spot of bother: Elizabeth Hurley in her huge shoes . Admittedly, even I have fallen foul of the fashionista brigade and bought the occasional pair. But this week I gave three pairs to a charity shop, virtually unworn, after my boyfriend said they made me look as though I had breeze blocks glued to my feet. The more I see celebrities photographed in them, the more I think he’s right. Just look at the stunning, stylish Emma Watson looking hideously ill-at-ease and frumpy in the biggest, ugliest black shoes you’ve ever seen. And the ever-svelte Cheryl Cole seems a little stumpy whenever she dons her beige pair. Some women claim their wedges are easier to walk in, like the summer version of Uggs. But I don’t think that’s true — I have found to my peril that they can topple sideways, taking the unwitting wearer with them. I almost broke my ankle last summer twisting over in a pair of 5 in espadrilles daintily secured to my ankles with flimsy ribbon. They, too, went to a charity shop. How could you Joan? The usually stylish Miss Collins . Wildly inappropriate: Anna Friel in animal-print shoes . Worst foot forward: Kate Hudson's heel faux pas . The weight of wedges is another issue; not only is having a slab of concrete strapped to your feet utterly inflexible, they take some lifting — making you clomp along with an inelegant, flat-footed gait. You cannot stroll with a wedge, you have to stomp. They make your thigh and calf muscles bulge with the strain; even Jennifer Aniston’s thin thighs swell in them, while svelte Kate Middleton looks like she’s been training for the weight-lifting championships. And let’s not forget that for all her love of wedges, when she first caught William’s eye (he later recalled how hot she looked), she was wearing flats.","The current ugly trend is all down to the Duchess of Cambridge .
Not only are they unfashionable but they can also be dangerous .

"Bank of England bosses thought twice about putting Sir Winston Churchill on the new £5 note – because they didn’t want to upset the Germans. Officials warned Sir Mervyn King, then Governor of the Bank of  England, that Churchill’s wartime record might make him highly controversial, documents obtained by The Mail on Sunday show. The same officials also insisted on carrying out a background check on Jane Austen, the prim spinster author of Pride And Prejudice who will appear on the £10 note from 2017, to reassure themselves there were ‘no issues in her private life’. Defiant: A Bank of England illustration of how the Churchill £5 note will look in 2016 . Previously classified documents, obtained under freedom of information laws, shed light on the hitherto secret process of how the Bank of England decides which historic figures are honoured. In a memo dated April 11, 2012, Sir Mervyn was advised Churchill will be a popular choice because of his ‘broad name recognition’ and the public’s ‘very affectionate view’ of him as a wartime leader. But officials also warned him that ‘the recentness of World War II is a living memory for many here and on the Continent’. The rest of the comments, which relate to Britain’s relationship with its former wartime enemies, have been redacted from the files. A source at the Bank last night said: ‘Public bodies are obliged to redact any material which might impact on Britain’s international relations with another country, and this is what has happened here.’ Andrew Roberts, Churchill’s biographer, said: ‘The comments redacted would have been about irritating the Germans. I don’t think a German or Japanese tourist would be in the slightest bit put off by the fact there is Churchill on a £5 note and he is the man who flattened Dresden and Hiroshima. ‘They appreciate he’s the greatest Englishman who ever lived so you put him on the currency. It’s surprising this hasn’t happened earlier.’ No issues: Fortunately Austen's prim and proper lifestyle did not stand in the way of her portrait being approved for the £10 bank note . Officials also warned Sir Mervyn of Churchill’s ‘disastrous’ decision to return Britain to the gold standard in the 1920s. Churchill’s critics at the time claimed the move, with the backing of the Bank of England, produced the mass unemployment, deflation and industrial strife of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Bank staff who conducted ‘considerable research’ into Churchill’s role in the debacle noted: ‘If academics do pick up on the move to the gold standard it is likely they will refer to the role of the Bank and Churchill’s own criticism of the Bank.’ Austen was considered in 1984 but ruled out because there was ‘a lack of suitable art work’. The fact no new art work has come to light since will lead to concerns she was ruled out because she was a woman. Officials also said ‘name recognition’ for the novelist – whose works are often GCSE set texts – had increased significantly thanks to film and television adaptations. The papers note the writer’s ‘high-brow, middle-brow and mass appeal’; and confirm ‘they have found no issues in her private life’. The interest in Austen’s private life may strike some as odd given fellow writer Charles Dickens, who appeared on the £10 note from 1992 to 2003, had at least one mistress. Maureen Stiller, of the Jane Austen Society, said: ‘I love the fact they went to the trouble of checking her private life. But there is absolutely no controversy there.’ Churchill will appear on the £5 note from 2016. A Bank spokesman said: ‘We have taken great care to ensure men and women chosen are admired by the British public.’","Officials worried that Churchill's wartime record might make him controversial for visitors from Germany and Japan .
They also investigated Jane Austen's private life checking for 'issues'"

"Zanib Khan pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court, was jailed for 12 months yesterday after exchanging sexy letters and phone calls with seven inmates at Brixton prison . One prison officer every week is being caught having an ‘inappropriate relationship’ with an inmate, official figures show. More than 120 prison staff faced disciplinary action for getting too close to a prisoner over a 33-month period. But less than a third were dismissed, and most were simply moved to another job with only a handful prosecuted. Earlier this week a woman prison officer was jailed for swapping erotic letters and phone calls with four serving convicts. Zanib Khan, 27, was given a 12-month term after a court heard she made ten hours of amorous calls to drug dealers and robbers. Among other staff exposed in recent years are several who had sex with prisoners, sent racy texts or letters, or had contact with criminals outside work, on the phone or online. At one prison, HMP Onley, five female prison officers resigned in six years. Tory MP Philip Davies, who uncovered the figures, said: ‘Not all inappropriate relationships are sexual, but this is still a big issue. 'Many prisoners are very manipulative people and do actively set out to manipulate prison officers. ‘Some want physical relationships or often it’s to get special favour while they are in prison. ‘There are very serious implications for security in prisons.’ Prisoners enjoying some leisure time at Aylesbury Young Offenders Institution in Buckinghamshire where six female prison officers were either sacked or forced to resign during a three year period for having relationships with inmates . In one of the worst cases, six women officers were forced to resign or were sacked from Aylesbury Young Offenders’ Institution in Buckinghamshire after forming relationships with prisoners over three years. One, Kelly-Anne McDade, was jailed for 30 months in November 2010 after she had a baby with an inmate. Prison volunteer Alice Belton, 23, had ‘phone sex’ with inmates at Parkhurst jail on the Isle of Wight and was arrested after smuggling in a mobile phone. She was given a suspended sentence after a probe uncovered explicit photos of her on inmates’ mobiles. Ministry of Justice figures show that between January 2008 and October 2010, some 126 prison workers were investigated and found to have had inappropriate relationships with inmates at jails in England and Wales. Five were convicted, 85 moved to other jails and 36 dismissed. The Prison Service says it has strict guidelines about what constitutes an inappropriate relationship between staff and criminals, and anybody breaking the rules will face the toughest sanctions. The HM Prison Service conduct and discipline guidelines state: ‘Staff must exercise particular care to ensure that their dealings with prisoners, former prisoners and their friends and relations are not open to abuse, misrepresentation or exploitation on either side.’ Steve Wagstaffe, director of Public Sector Prisons, said: ‘We remain committed to identifying and eradicating all forms of staff wrongdoing. 'Where staff develop an inappropriate relationship with a prisoner they put themselves and their colleagues at risk, potentially undermining the safety of the prison.’","120 prison officers were disciplined over 2.5 years .

"Tragic: Soldier David Collins stabbed to death at an Ayia Napa night club . A soldier was murdered in a brawl with British tourists in Cyprus yesterday – less than 24 hours before leaving for Afghanistan. David . Lee Collins was stabbed in the early hours after becoming embroiled in a . row. Three men – all British passport holders with Pakistani and Somali . backgrounds – will appear in court this morning in relation to the . incident. Last night there was growing concern the 19-year-old may have been targeted by anti-Western fanatics. Mr . Collins, from Manchester, had left his base at Dhekelia, with three . other off-duty soldiers from 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, . for a final night out after their mission was delayed. But . the infantryman was stabbed in the chest following a row with three . Britons aged 17, 18 and 19 at the popular Black & White Club, in the . resort of Ayia Napa, an area off-limits to British troops. Mr Collins . was given first aid but was pronounced dead on arrival at Famagusta . General Hospital in nearby Paralimni. The tourists, two of Pakistani and one of Somali origin, were arrested by Cypriot police and were last night in custody. A fanatical attack on off-duty British soldiers is one motive being considered. Patrick . Mercer MP, the former chairman of the House of Commons . counter-terrorism committee, said: ‘The possibility that off-duty . British soldiers have been targeted by fanatics is extremely worrying. I . hope this does not prove to be  the case.’ Last . night one Cypriot TV station speculated the row which led to the . stabbing was over race. Cypriot police spokesman George Economou said: . ‘Today at around 3.30am (01.30am GMT), while a group of British soldiers . from Dhekelia garrison were enjoying themselves at a club in Ayia Napa, . they had a confrontation with three of their compatriots. ‘During the confrontation one of the three drew what is believed to be a knife, injuring the 19-year-old soldier in the chest.’ A knife was recovered at the scene and it has been sent to a forensic laboratory for tests. Mr Collins’s family have been informed of his death, the Ministry of Defence said. Scene: The stabbing took place during a fight between four soldiers and three British tourists at this nightclub . A source close to the battalion . described the soldiers’ anger that their comrade had been murdered and . frustration at the delay that led him to be at the nightclub. The source said: ‘The whole of the base is on lock-down. Feelings are running very high. ‘No . one is allowed out because it is feared that his comrades would take . matters into their own hands and track down the culprit. It’s absolutely . tragic. The battalion was meant to leave for Afghanistan on Saturday . but the mission was delayed for 24 hours. ‘If they had left on time the lad would be alive today. ‘David was not drunk. He got into an argument with these three guys and when he walked away he got stabbed. ‘You have got to ask yourself, who goes to a nightclub with a knife in their pocket? ‘They . are not supposed to go to Ayia Napa but it’s got to be wrong that he . would have been safer in Afghanistan than in a nightclub in Cyprus.’ Ayia Napa Square, where the . stabbing occurred, is off-limits for British soldiers because of past . trouble. The ban was imposed by military authorities on all army . personnel and their relatives stationed on the island following the rape . and murder of 23-year-old Danish tour guide Louise Jensen in 1994. Three . soldiers – Allan Ford, Justin Fowler and Geoffrey Pernell – were . sentenced to life imprisonment but were freed on appeal in 2006 after . serving 12 years. The . ban was partially lifted in 2009 allowing troops to visit the bar-filled . square during daylight hours. British Military Police patrol the resort . at night. The 2nd Battalion, Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, are currently the ‘theatre reserve battalion’ for Afghanistan. Based . at Camp Bastion, the battalion will undergo training to orientate . troops for potential deployment into the field of combat. In . Cyprus the battalion is based in Dhekelia, one of two bases Britain . retained after the former colony was granted independence in 1960.

"The disturbing world of amateur pornography has been laid bare by a new documentary called 'Hot Girls Wanted,' which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on Saturday. The insightful look at the world of pornography shows just how easy it is for teenagers, in particular, to get caught up in a sex trade that promises big bucks and fame. But in a revealing peek into the billion dollar industry, documentary filmmakers exposed how professionally produced films are being made to look like home movies. Scroll down for video . Girls: In a revealing peek into the billion dollar industry, documentary filmmakers exposed how professionally produced films are being made to look like home movies . Hot Girls: The director/producer Ronna Gradus, actress/producer Rashida Jones, center, and director/producer Jill Bauer from 'Hot Girls Wanted' 'Hot Girls Wanted,' was shot by Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus, and produced by Rashida Jones. It showed how Craigslist ads which promised free flights to Miami bring in a constant stream of would-be porn stars. During the film, Riley, a 23-year-old 'agent' hosts half a dozen young women eager to enter the industry at his Miami home. He says casually: 'Every day, another girl turns 18.' But the brutal world of pornography only gives girls aged 18- to 21 a career span that typically lasts just three months, due to high turnover. Tressa, an 18-year-old girl featured in the film, admits she was attracted to porn as a way to escape her Texas hometown. Tressa Silguero  in 'Hot Girls Wanted': The 18-year-old featured in the film and admits she was attracted to porn as a way to escape her Texas hometown . Film subjects Kendall Plemons and Tressa Silguero attend the 'Hot Girls Wanted' Premiere during the 2015 Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2015 in Park City, Utah . She said she earned $25,000 in her four months in the industry, but after paying for lingerie, manicures, makeup and biweekly STD tests, she only had about $2,000 in her bank account when she quit the business. 'It's easy to take advantage of an 18-year-old girl,' she said. However, for some teenagers, the allure proves just too much, and many, who have grown up in the age of the Internet don't have many hang-ups about becoming adult stars. Worryingly, many appear to think that there is nothing wrong with being shot on film and have the attitude 'Why not get paid? We're doing it anyway.' And as pop culture has become more and more sexualized, it can even be seen as a badge of honor to partake in the sex industry. According to online porn sites, 'teen' is the most searched term in online pornography, and thousands of young people enter the amateur porn industry every day. The filmmakers said that according to current laws, it's legal for anyone with a camera who calls himself a porn producer to solicit sex. The woman is technically being paid for her 'performance,' not the sex act.","Film produced by documentary filmmakers Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus .

"Great white sharks are one of the few species known to regularly poke their heads above the surface to survey the scene. And this huge female is no exception as she rises from the ocean just yards from a cage full of stunned divers. The image was captured by British photographer Dale Morris, 40, during a cage diving trip in Mossel Bay, South Africa. The great white shark investigates a cage filled with a potential human banquet feast . The shark breached the surface several times as it 'sniffed the air' in a bid to discover its next dinner . He said: 'Some were five metres long and a five metre great white shark is usually a very fat creature. 'They appeared to be bigger than the small boat we were in. Some would breach and stare right into our faces as they came up. 'When these really big sharks turned up, the smaller ones would vanish. One shark in particular was very crafty. She drifted past the boat several times before swimming away from us. 'It was if she made a show of letting us know she was going. Then, within seconds of us losing sight of her moving away from the boat, she would suddenly burst out of the water right next to us from a completely different direction.' The stunning photographs were taken by Dale Morris in Mossel Bay, South Africa . Great white sharks, which often hunt seals, are known to poke their heads above the surface to spot prey. Another theory is that they are smelling for whale carcasses above the water, as scent travels faster through air than through water. And in order to attract them to the boats, the tours will chum the sea by dropping mixtures of blood and rotten fish into the water. Dale Morris, who took the photographs, said he once witnessed a great white shark get its teeth stuck in the bars of a diving cage, although he said he is unaware of sharks eating any tourists using similar protection . But despite their huge size and power, cage diving with great whites is considered a safe activity. Mr Morris, who hails from London but now lives in South Africa, added: 'There have been no incidences of sharks eating tourists who go on a shark cage dives, although I did once witness a shark get its teeth stuck on the cage. 'Its thrashing nearly pulled the cage away from the boat. I was inside at the time and had a very good view of what it must feel like to be a seal in its last moments of life.'

"A brave surfer has revealed how he was sent 'flying' by a great white shark that attacked him from underneath while surfing with friends off the South Australian coast on Wednesday. Andrew 'Monkey' McLeod was thrown into the air by the pointer on South Australia's West Coast while he was catching waves with two friends - and the shark left its mark on his board.

The 35-year-old revealed how the great white left two huge bite marks and blood stains on his board but thankfully did not harm him. 'I just felt this massive force and heard this massive sound,' he told Adelaide Now. Mr McLeod, a pharmacist, added: 'I went flying and Ty thinks that the shark might have totally breached the surface because there was a huge splash. 'After I climbed back on my board I saw its tail fin right next to me and it must have been five foot high. I'd say the shark was 15 foot long. I yelled out ""it's a pointer!"".' Survivors: Mr McLeod was surfing with his friends Tyrone Swan and Sam Jervis, who made sure they all paddled back to shore together safely . The three friends quickly hatched a plan for their safe escape. Mr Swan and Mr Jervis waited for Mr McLeod to paddle over to them before they began a terrifying long paddle back to shore as a group. Despite his close call, Mr McLeod and his friends have promised to surf again - but perhaps not in the same area. Elliston is a seaside town which boasts spectacular rugged coastline and picturesque cliff tops. Terrifying: The great white shark was 2km off shore on the Elliston Bar when it attacked the surfer . It is also the place where 17-year-old Port Lincoln surfer Jevan Wright was killed in 2000 while surfing at Blackfellows. However, although shark attacks seem common, the chances of encountering one in Australia are still relatively rare. There have been 892 shark attacks in Australia since records began in 1791, according to the Australian Shark Attack File, kept by researchers at Sydney's Taronga Conservation Society.

"James Cameron has announced that he will make three sequels to sci-fi blockbuster Avatar. The Titanic director revealed he will shoot the movies in New Zealand, as he attended a press conference with New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key in Wellington on Monday. The films, which will be made by Cameron's Lightstorm Entertainment and Twentieth Century Fox, have been welcomed in the country and the first sequel will be released in 2016. Scroll down for video . Follow up stories: James Cameron has revealed he will be making three sequels to his hit 2009 movie Avatar . The following sequels will be released in late 2017 and then late 2018. Cameron said of the plans: 'It's quite a thrill to be officially saying that we're bringing the Avatar films to New Zealand. 'We had such a wonderful experience here making the first film.' Economic Development Minister Steven Joyce said: 'The Avatar sequels will provide hundreds of jobs and thousands of hours of work directly in the screen sector as well as jobs right across the economy.' Revealing all: Director James made the announcement at a press conference in Wellington, New Zealand, on Monday . On location: James will shoot the sequels in New Zealand, where the first film was made . Avatar, starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and Sigourney Weaver, was the highest-grossing film in history and made $2.7billion worldwide, along with winning three Academy Awards. Cameron added that a core team has been developing new software for the sequels, adding: 'It's going to be a lot of new imagery and a lot of new environments and creatures across Pandora. 'We're blowing it out all over the place. At first I thought I was going to take it onto other worlds as well, in the same solar system, but it turned out not to be necessary. I mean the Pandora that we have imagined will be a fantasy land that is going to occupy people for decades to come, the way I see it.' Starring roles: The 2009 film starred Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Sigourney Weaver and Joel Moore. Casting for the new movies has yet to be announced . Cameron said the films will explore different Na'vi cultures as well the cultures of other Pandora creatures. He said: 'There's a fair bit of underwater stuff. It's been inaccurately said that the second film takes place underwater. That's not true. Change of scenery: This time around, a lot of the film will be set underwater . 'There are underwater scenes and surface-water scenes having to do with indigenous ocean cultures that are distributed across the three films.' And Cameron added that while the first film focused on the main character, Jake Sully, the follow up films will tell the stories of his family. He said: 'We spread it around quite a bit more as we go forward. It's really the story of his family, the family that he creates on Pandora. His extended family. So think of it as a family saga like The Godfather.' Cameron and fifth wife Suzy Amis bought a farm about 90 minutes' drive from Wellington where they spend some of the year with their three children, and the director said the farm feels like 'closing a loop' after he spent summers on his grandfather's farm in southern Ontario. He said: 'The kids love it here. They love that combination of freedom and responsibility that you get here because you can run freely. There are no predators and snakes and that sort of thing. We just let them go out with a walkie-talkie, and as long as they are back by dinner, we don't care where they are.' He said he plans to bring his own helicopter from California to help make the commute from the farm to Wellington when he's working on the movies. Living locally: Cameron and fifth wife Suzy Amis bought a farm about 90 minutes' drive from Wellington, where they spent some of the year with their three children . Before then, he said, he'll be throwing a Christmas party for the community around his farm. He said about 95 people turned up last year but he worries that numbers could be down this year because it's going to be an all-vegan menu, a lifestyle his family recently adopted. Producer Jon Landau revealed earlier this year that the director and crew will be shooting the second and third film back-to-back, with Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington rumoured to be returning as lovers Neytiri and Jake Sully. Although Cameron hasn't announced an exact budget for the movies, he expects economies of scale will help the films cost less then $1billion together.","Cameron announced the news at a press conference in Wellington .

"A global pandemic is one of the most serious threats to the future of the human race and now scientists have made a video showing how a deadly virus could spread from London’s busy Heathrow airport. German researchers have developed a breakthrough system for predicting how rapidly an outbreak might spread and where. While in times past diseases typically . spread within local areas, modern pandemics cross borders rapidly via . the complex network of global flight patterns and busy aviation hubs and can spread across the world in a matter of weeks. Scroll down for video . This map and diagram - a still from the beginning of the video - shows a simulated global epidemic that spreads on the worldwide air-transportation network with an initial outbreak location in London. It establishes outbreaks in cities in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Greenland in the first instance . They are part of a new model for predicting the arrival times of the next global pandemic in different parts of the world. The models rely on the concept of ‘effective distance,’ and the belief that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries than between cities and more rural areas in the same country. The maps show various routes travelling from a given airport which is the source of the contagion (in this case London Heathrow). Circular diagrams show the radial distance from the disease source and the expected spreading path a contagion phenomenon will take - including other airports that might become gateways for the disease. By using data from the 2003 SARS outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, theoretical physicist Dirk Brockmann and his colleagues from Humboldt University, Berlin, have devised a new model for predicting the arrival times of the next global pandemic in different parts of the world. The model relies on the concept of ‘effective distance,’ and the belief that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries than between cities and more rural areas in the same country. Here, the disease has spread to cities in Europe, Africa, the East Coast of the U.S. and even Asia. The diagram below the map shows the radial distance from London Heathrow and the expected spreading path a contagion phenomenon will take . Members of Hong Kong's Health Department wear protective suits during an exercise held at the airport to simulate a scenario in which a highly contagious disease such as SARS is suspected to have infected a passenger on board a flight . He wrote: ‘For example more people travel each day between London and New York than for example, London and some small town in the UK. ‘So would it not make sense to think of London and New York as being close neighbours and London and a small town in the UK be far apart?’ The model itself does not predict how long a virus would take to spread from A to B. Professor . Brockman told MailOnlne: 'Only relative time is important and the . message of the video is that the pattern has a circular shape when we . look at the disease spread with our new method. He . said scientists need specific information about a given disease to work . out how long it would take to spread to certain places and populations. The video shows how the virus swiftly spreads from Heathrow to European cities, Greenland and the north coast of Africa, before reaching the east coast of the U.S. and India. As Europe is engulfed by the fictional contagion, it continues to spread to the west coast of the U.S. Thailand and Russia and then to South Africa, India and Asia before it hits Australia and New Zealand. 'The air transportation network is used as a proxy for the probability that infections get carried from one place to the next,' Professor Brockmann said. While it is impossible to accurately calculate the spread of a contagion, figures from the Department of Health suggest it takes as little as two to four weeks for a virus to reach different countries from its origins. However, as 1,288 flights depart from London Heathrow to 80 countries every day and an average of 191,200 people arrive and depart from the airport every day, it is easy to imagine that the spread could be more rapid. The pattern of the outbreak quickly becomes very complex, according to the scientists, but here it is easy to see how the fictional outbreak has taken hold of Europe and parts of South Africa and the East Coast of the U.S. Once in a country such as the UK, a virus is likely to spread to all densely populated areas within one to two weeks and peak 50 days after its initial entry, experts said. ‘In the modern world that’s so connected, old school, conventional geographic distance is not so meaningful anymore,’ Professor Brockmann told Fast Company. He and his colleagues have spent the past decade testing how ‘effective distance’ might work by building theoretical pandemics and models that predict their theoretical spread. Three-years-worth of airline data was analysed to see how these distances interact with the aim of developing a universal equation that would account for the arrival times of any disease across the globe. The simulations show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city. Although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works, it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission. Masks and hand sanitiser were recommended during the bird flu outbreak . As the outbreak begins to subside in Europe, it continues to spread rapidly across the U.S. and in more cities in Asia . Professor Brockmann and his co-author Dirk Hebling published a paper in Science today, which shows that the jumbled, erratic spread of disease can be reduced to simple, constant wave patterns, riding on effective distances, rather than geographic ones, through a ‘global mobility network.’ When Professor Brockmann plotted the SARS and H1N1 epidemics’ actual arrival times in different cities against their effective distances, he found strong positive correlations. ‘So we don’t need to know anything about the disease,’ Professor Brockmann explained. ‘If you throw a rock into the water, you’ll see a concentric wave. If you throw a big rock into the water, you will also see a concentric wave. 'If you throw a rock into honey, or some different liquid, you will see a wave that is propagating slower, but it will still be a concentric wave,’ he said. Regardless of the transmission method, Professor Brockmann argues that his global mobility network represents the wave pattern, while the rock and the liquid show the launch and spread of the disease. Now the outbreak appears to have completely disappeared from Europe but it has spread to Australia and New Zealand as well as throughout Asia and down the west coast of South America . Using the global mobility network, we can see how a disease launched in one city might spread to the rest of the world. Professor Brockmann developed visualisations of this phenomenon in Mexico City, Chicago and London. Unfortunately, they also show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city. Although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works, it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission. The Department of Health said that when flu epidemics occur, many millions of people around the world can become ill,and a proportion will die from the disease itself or from complications such as pneumonia. It believes half the UK could develop an illness from a pandemic and there could be 50,000 and 750,000 additional deaths that would not have occurred over the same period. Professor Bockman told MailOnline: 'I think that emergent infectious diseases are something that we should take very seriously, as researchers and public health authorities do.' Here, the virus is on its last legs, but the video shows how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city .","German researchers have developed a breakthrough system for predicting how rapidly an outbreak might spread and where .

"These pictures show how blind Alaskan husky dog Gonzo overcame his handicap to do what he does best - pulling tourists on 50 mile overnight sled tours across New Hampshire's North Country. With the help of his brother Poncho, who acts as his eyes, Gonzo has kept his place in the eight-dog teams, although admittedly not as a front runner. Gonzo is one of 120 dogs at Muddy Paw Sled Dog Kennel in New Hampshire, a temporary home for  retired professional sled dogs and rescue dogs. Scroll down for video . Sled dogs Poncho, left, and his blind brother Gonzo (right) are hooked up for a . run at the Muddy Paw Sled Dog Kennel,  in Jefferson, N.H. Poncho has . taken to helping his blind brother on regular runs . The eight-dog sled teams take tourists out on runs that last from 20 minutes to overnight and are made up of retired professional sled dogs and rescue dogs. All wear booties . Muddy Paw Sled Dog Kennel houses dogs until owners are found for them. Sadly many people consider retired sled dogs to make poor pets, although kennel owner Neil Beaulieu says this is nonsense . Together they make up multiple eight-dog sled teams that pull tourists across trails that can run from 20 minutes to 50 miles overnight tours. Staff first noticed something wasn't quite right with Gonzo when he started to trip over his food. Once blindness was diagnosed the vet's advised that rather retiring Gonzo he should be kept running and that's exactly what he's been doing. 'Even though he's blind, he still knows . when hook-ups are happening. He's still very aware,' Kennel manager . Ben Morehouse told Associated Press. 'When you have a dog such as Gonzo, with such a want and . a drive and a desire you try it, you hook up, you see what . happens.' Kennel owner Neil Beaulieu  described a time when Gonzo's brother Poncho plucked him out of the snow by grabbing his harness with his teeth. The dogs are said to love getting harnessed up and taken out. Those that don't make the eight-dog team on any given day will go back to their kennels and howl . Sled dogs howling in the snow. Some sit on top of their kennels, others choose to wait inside until they hear the familiar jangling sound of the harnesses which means they might be in with a chance to get a run out . Tourists come from all over to experience being pulled along by a team of sled dogs in New Hampshire . Beaulieu said. 'I've run dogs in a lot of places, all over the country, . and it was the most amazing thing I've ever seen sled dogs do.' Now Gonzo leans into his brother when out on sled runs and uses him to get a feel of the direction and pace of the run. 'At first, he'd be a little bit . nervous when Gonzo would lean into him. And then somehow - I don't know . how dogs communicate - he learned that he was utilising him to determine . where the turns are and how fast they were going. And he would let him . do that — he wouldn't get as grumbly as he did in the beginning,' Moorhouse added. The pair are always partnered together and usually towards the back of the eight-dog team. While all the other dogs look . straight ahead when they run, Gonzo tilts his head to the right, to make . the most of his sense of smell and hearing. Kennel owner Neil Beaulieu (left) and kennel manager Ben Morehouse (right) Mr Beaulieu got into the dog sledding business after he volunteered to take care of a team of dogs on the 1,000 mile Iditarod dog sled race ten years when the dogs' owner dropped out. The same owner then said she never wanted to see a sled dog again and he found himself taking them on full time. He later gained experience helping a friend run sled tours from a hotel before starting his own business. The money he makes now from running tours is used to find loving homes for sled dogs that sadly so many owners consider unadoptable. 'For myself and the entire crew . here, we know that's false. They are very adoptable,' he said .

"Women should stay at home and have three or four children to help solve Germany's predicted population crisis, according to a cardinal. Cardinal Joachim Meisner, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Cologne, has criticised German Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy of trying to attract immigrants to work in the country. He said women should be encouraged to produce more children to increase the German population and said Merkel was using immigration to solve Germany's demographic problems. Cardinal Joachim Meisner said women should have more children to boost Germany's dwindling population and said German Chancellor Angela Merkel is relying on immigration . In a wide-ranging attack on Merkel's . policies, the cardinal told German newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung: 'We are a dying people . but have a perfect legislation for abortion. Is not that the suicide of . society?' Germany has the lowest birth rate in Europe at just 1.36 children per woman and forecasters predict the country's 83million population will shrink to 70million by 2050 if the birth date does not increase. Cardinal Meisner, 79, said: 'Where are women really encouraged publicly to stay at home and bring three, four children into the world? 'This is what we should do and not - as Mrs Merkel is doing now - only present immigration as a solution to our demographic problems,' he said in an interview with Stuttgarter Zeitung. The German government spends millions of euros a year trying to encourage women to have more children. Berlin has increased monthly subsidies to families in recent years but it has had little effect on the birth rate. Cardinal Meisner said there was an urgent need to 'create a climate' in Germany that encourages women to have more children. The cardinal said greater value should be placed on role of mother and father in German society . He . said more value should be placed on the role of mother and father and . compared Merkel's government's family policy to that in East Germany. He said under Communist rule, women who chose not to work in order to bring up children were classed as 'demented'. Cardinal Meisner's comments have drawn criticism from German women. Annegret Laakmann, president of the Catholic group Women's Dignity, told the Daily Telegraph: 'Age doesn't always bring wisdom. 'The Church can't drag women back into the kitchen. We don't live in the 1940s.' Germany has organised a mass apprentice scheme for unemployed young people from Spain and Portugal. But Cardinal Meisner said the policy was taking 'away the youth and future' from the two countries. He argued that the 5,000 people on the scheme should be trained and then sent back to their countries to help rebuild after the devastating effects of the banking crisis and subsequent austerity.","Joachim Meisner said women should be encouraged to stay at home .

"Scroll down for video . She recently went to the U.S. to launch her daughter as a beauty pageant star. But Sarah Burge has made a swift return to the UK after being condemned on live television for giving her teenage daughter Botox injections. But instead of shying away from the . cameras the 51-year-old, self-confessed plastic surgery addict stepped . off the plane and shuttled straight to a London television studio to appear on ITV's Daybreak. Sporting a bronzed complexion and peroxide blonde hair the mother-of-three wheeled her youngest daughter Poppy, 8, out of Heathrow airport with a sparkling beauty pageant crown and certificate proudly on display. Sarah and Poppy Burge arrive back from U.S. after being slammed by Anderson Cooper on live TV . The duo later appeared on breakfast television to discuss their time in America. Miss Burge, who opted for a thigh skimming red dress met with Daybreak hosts - and this time her screen time wasn't cut short. Last month American talk show host Anderson Cooper decided to stop his interview with her as she justified giving her 15-year-old daughter Botox injections. 'I . would prefer to oversee my daughter's Botox than have her going . underground finding a voodoo witchdoctor or getting it off the internet . and administrating it herself,' she said defiantly. But appalled by her behaviour, Anderson shook his head in disbelief stating: 'I try and to be really polite to all my guests. I just think you're dreadful and I honestly don’t want to talk to you anymore, so I’m just going to stop.' Sarah and Poppy snapped outside the London television studios . Poppy won one beauty contest and revealed her sparkling crown on television . She decided to relocate to the U.S. to launch Poppy as a child beauty pageant star, believing she could give the stars of the controversial show Toddlers & Tiaras a run for their money. However her insistence on teaching her young daughters to pole dance, giving them vouchers to spend on plastic surgery and throwing them Botox parties has proved unpopular on both sides of the Atlantic. Following the show Anderson added: 'I regret having here on in the first place. I think encouraging her little daughter to pole dance and giving her plastic surgery vouchers and then telling the media about it... I wish her the best, I certainly don’t want to be rude to anybody.' But today on Daybreak Miss Burge portrayed her time in the U.S. in a posistive way and also revealed that she has secured a deal to front her own reality show. Talking about her appearance on Anderson Copper's show she said: 'It was just drama, drama,  drama. We were actually over in America filming our own reality show. 'We were invited on the show and in my opinion he actually wanted to throw me off before I actually got on there. Everything gets distorted in the press. People only hear half the story.' Poppy, 8, with her mother Sarah on ITV show Daybreak . 'Well I really liked that one because I won it,' Poppy said when asked about her beauty pageant experience . The mother and daughter discuss their time in America . Miss Burge, who has spent more than £500,000 on her own surgical enhancements, first made headlines in 2010 when she confessed to teaching her then six-year-old daughter to pole dance. And she has since been in the spotlight numerous times - for all the wrong reasons. Last year Miss Burge, who then resided in a £500,000 four-bedroom home in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, boasted that she gave a £6,000 breast enlargement voucher to her daughter. She said in an interview with Closer magazine at the time: 'Poppy begged me for a boob job, so I gave her the voucher so she can have it after she's 16, when it's legal. If she develops naturally big boobs, she can have something else done with it.' The voucher was part of a £12,000 'exotic pamper party' that she organised to mark her daughter's birthday. Poppy and seven friends had manicures, pedicures and makeovers. They dressed up with fake tattoos, drank pretend champagne in the back of a pink pamper bus and ate a designer cake costing £250. 'I honestly don't want to talk to you anymore so I'm just going to stop,' Anderson told Miss Burge . Poppy wore a £300 dress for the party, adding nail varnish, eyeshadow and hair extensions. Miss Burge said: 'Poppy isn't interested in bouncy castles or pass the parcel, so I splashed out on something a little more grown-up. 'The girls got lots of attention from our neighbours. They love having all eyes on them and were posing and pouting for photos,' she said. As well as the breast enlargement voucher, Miss Burge bought her daughter thousands of pounds worth of gifts, including a £250 computer, a £450 pink Swarovski crystal ring and necklace set and the promise of a £4,000 spa break. The main event though, was the breast enlargement voucher. Poppy said: 'I wanted a new computer, a holiday and a voucher for surgery. When I got it all, it was a dream come true. All my friends were jealous. I can't wait to be like Mummy with big boobs. They're pretty.' Anderson also asked Burge to explain the photos of her eight-year-old daughter (who was seven at the time) on a stripper pole, and points out, 'It doesn't just happen to wind up in the paper, you contact the British tabloids, you contact the papers and let them know about this stuff.' Burge responded: 'I let people know that it's good, it's good exercise and in fact, more people should actually try it than stuffing their faces with burgers.'

His hobby got so out of control he then added five extra basements to his home to house his collection until he finally raised the money to create Northlandz. He says he has sunk 'several million' dollars into the project, which has been open to the public since 1997. 'I worked 18 or 19 hours a day, seven days a week, non-stop,' Bruce said. He said the attraction is recognized by Guinness World Records as the biggest of its kind on the planet. Ex-SPAN-sive: Forty-foot bridges span 30-foot canyons in Northlandz . Altitude: The tallest peaks in Northlandz clock in around 30 feet . Serpentine: 50,000 feet, or 8 miles of track, wind around Northlandz . Bridge and tunnel: There are about 400 bridges and trestles throughout the giant model railway . Perspective: Northlandz' many spans are even more impressive when viewed from below . It has even attracted several celebrity visitors - including famed model railroad fan, rocker Rod Stewart, and Neil Young, who went to the attraction in disguise. 'We didn't even know he was there until the next day,' said Bruce. Stewart and other stars signed a special 'celebrity wall' inside the exhibit. The path through the exhibit - spread across 16 acres - is almost one mile long. Cross-section: This view shows the range of environs the Northlandz' 100 trains crisscross for delighted spectators .

"The first test between Australia and India has been postponed to allow his team mates to mourn the death of Phillip Hughes at his funeral on Wednesday, Cricket Australia said on Saturday. The test was scheduled to start in Brisbane on Thursday, a week after batsman Hughes died at the age of 25 as a result of being struck on the head by a ball at the Sydney Cricket Ground two days earlier. Given the close proximity of the funeral in his hometown of Macksville to the start of the four-match series, CA said it would be unreasonable for the Australian players to be expected to play.

"A murdered schoolgirl who vanished ten years ago was sexually abused by as many as 100 men in the run-up to her death, it emerged yesterday. Charlene Downes, 14, had been a victim of child sex gangs in Blackpool, many of them centred on takeaway restaurants. New probe: Police have relaunched investigations into the murders of Charlene Downes (left) and Paige Chivers (right) in Blackpool in the past ten years . In 2007 two business partners were . tried for murdering Charlene and disposing of her body using a mincing . machine, before putting it into kebabs. However, . a jury failed to reach a verdict and the case collapsed. Iyad . Albattikhi and Mohammed Reveshi later received six-figure compensation . sums for false imprisonment. To . mark the tenth anniversary of Charlene’s disappearance, police . yesterday announced they have appointed a dedicated full-time senior . investigating officer to the case. The . team will also look into the disappearance of another teenager from . Blackpool, Paige Chivers, 15, who vanished in August 2007. Charlene’s . parents are not co-operating with the police inquiry and will today . take part in a BNP march, having shared platforms with leader Nick . Griffin accusing ‘Muslim paedophile gangs’ of targeting their daughter. But they are prepared to participate in a relaunch of the inquiry. However, . it emerged that police drew up a list of 100 ‘people of . interest’, suspected of abusing Charlene, including a succession of . older white men. Yesterday, Charlene’s mother Karen told the Daily Mail the allegations were ‘exaggerated and widely untrue’. Assistant Chief Constable Andy Rhodes said Lancashire Constabulary had never given up the search for either girl, but hoped the fresh investigation would jog people's memories. Renewed appeals: The two teenagers vanished without a trace but may have been murdered by a paedophile . Cold case: This kebab shop was at the heart of Charlene's case. Its then owner was falsely accused of killing her and chopping her up. He and another man were paid compensation after the case against them collapsed. It is believed to be under new ownership and changes its name . 'There is nothing evidentially that . links these cases at present although we would never rule it out but as . with Charlene, I would also ask people to remember Paige and, again, let . us know if there's anything they have been keeping to themselves about . what happened to her,' he said. 'We . know that people are more confident in coming forward to report . historic information nowadays and this may be the case here. 'Charlene . and Paige's friends, obviously just teenagers at the time they went . missing, will now be grown up and may have their own children. I would . hope they may be more confident now in coming forward and telling us . what they may know. He added: 'We . appreciate that a considerable amount of time has passed since both . Charlene and Paige went missing but we would still encourage anyone with . information to come forward and speak to us as it could assist in our . inquiries, and help bring the killer or killers to justice.' Lancashire police and crime commissioner Clive Grunshaw said he had seen many cases where information years later resulted in successful prosecutions. Mr Grunshaw specifically mentioned the case of former BBC presenter Stuart Hall, who was jailed for child sexual abuse against 14 girls between 1967 and 1985. 'I hope, in the cases of both Charlene and Paige, there is someone out there who now feels comfortable enough to come forward and tell the police what they know,' he said. 'Charlene and Paige's families have a right to know what happened to their children, and I would urge anyone who thinks they might know something - no matter how small - to take this opportunity and contact the police.' Prosecutors in the 2007 trial of takeaway owner Iyad Albattikhi, accused and later acquitted of Charlene's death, claimed her body was chopped up and had 'gone into kebabs'. The court heard Charlene was one of a number of young white girls who gravitated to Blackpool's takeaways to have sex with older men. Mr Albattikhi was formally cleared of Charlene's murder while co-defendant Mohammed Reveshi was acquitted of helping to dispose of her body. Both of the accused were later reported to have received six-figure compensation sums for false imprisonment. Paige had also been linked to sex exploitation in the area. Over the years, police have made four arrests on suspicion of Paige's murder but all have been freed without charge.","Charlene Downes, 14, disappeared in Blackpool ten years ago today .

"Conjoined twin baby girls have been abandoned at an orphanage in China after it is believed their parents could not afford to care for them. The girls, who are only about three months old, are connected by their abdomens and lie face-to-face. They are awaiting specialist treatment in Beijing where it is hoped they can be separated. Conjoined twins Zheng Hanjing and Zheng Hanwei were abandoned at an orphanage in Pingdingshan City, Henan . The baby girls are joined by the abdomen and specialists will carry out tests to determine if they are share any vital organs . The girls were handed to the organisation in Pingdingshan City, Henan Province, on August 11 and have since been named Zheng Hanjing and Zheng Hanwei. However, it is not known exactly how old they are. Hanjing and Hanwei have been transferred to a children's home in Beijing while they await a variety of tests to determine if they share any vital organs. They are being cared for by Mercy Corps . children's home and staff member Deng Zhixin said that from 140 rescued . children, this was their first case of conjoined twins. She told Chinese news site Fawan that she refused to 'judge' the twin's mother for abandoning them. Staff at the Beijing children's home, where they are being cared for, said the girls were happy and 'lively' The girls were abandoned on August 11 but their exact age is not known . She said it was likely their mother may have been forced to give up her children because of poverty and being unable to afford proper medical care. Deng said the pair are 'lively' and they are turned by staff every hour as they cannot roll by themselves. It is hoped the twins could be separated as early as this month but surgeons still need to determine what, if any, organs the babies are connected by. Next week the babies will be given a heart examination and abdominal ultrasounds to see if any organs are shared. About one in every 200,000 live births worldwide result in conjoined twins. Children's home staff said it is likely the girls were abandoned because their parents could not afford to care for them . Around 40 to 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and about 35 per cent survive only one day and long-term survival is between five and 25 per cent. The condition is three times more likely to occur among females than males and a third of conjoined twins are attached at the lower chest, sharing organs. Although success rates have improved over the years, surgical separation is still rare. Since 1950, at least one twin has survived separation about 75 per cent of the time.","Baby girls left at the institution in Pingdingshan City, Henan, in August .

"A polygamist Israeli cult leader whose 21 wives bore him dozens of children has been convicted of a string of sex crimes. Goel Ratzon was convicted of rape, incest and other offences, at the Tel Aviv District court after it emerged that he kept the harem of women in a state of 'near total obedience'. But the court acquitted him of an enslavement charge, sparking cries of outrage in the courtroom. Scroll down for video .

Herman had lived with Ratzon for 12 years and had 5 children with him according to the station.

"They may have headed to the 'Land of the Free' for a better life, but a set of poignant black and white pictures illustrate the brutal hardships endured by immigrant families in 19th century New York. The images captured by Jacob A. Riis provide a window into the squalor, deprivation and poverty of a bygone age. The stark photos of sweat shops, shanty towns and slums provide an image of an unrecognisable city. Shades of the Wild West: In an astonishingly atmospheric image taken in 1887, a group of men loiter in an alley known as 'Bandit's Roost' off Mulberry Street . Charity: A group of men and young boys stand outside the front entrance of the Children's Aid Society's central office, at 24 St. Mark's Place, circa 1895. The children hold satchels with their belongings. They children were preparing to travel west, subsidized by Mrs John Jacob Astor . Cold night: Three young street children huddle together over a grate for warmth in an alleyway off Mulberry Street, Manhattan . For many immigrants the . new life was a tough one- some of the streets where they had made their . home were notorious for violent crime. Riis took advantage of the newly-invented flash photography to document the city’s dark side in these incredible pictures of slum life among the immigrant underclass. In one heart-wrenching picture three small barefoot children huddle together for warmth over a grating. Others show street children huddling close together for warmth, or working the streets as shoeshines and beggars. During the rime reporter and reformer's late-night visits to the . slums, the new medium of flash startled people but managed to capture the chaos of poverty as it had never before been seen in photographs. Newly arrived immigrants slept 12 to a . room, while street children roamed the alleys and tenement blocks of a . Third World downtown Manhattan. Harsh conditions: A young girl, holding a baby,  sits in a doorway next to a garbage can. Riis was a great reformer and his work helped to draw attention to the plight of the deprived . Slumdogs: The sight of Italian immigrant families in New York on Jersey Street, living in shacks could be a scene from the developing world today . Shanty town: A dilapidated wooden shack sits in an empty lot surrounded by tenement buildings in 1896 . Living on the edge: View of a back-lot house on Bleecker Street between Mercer and Greene Streets, almost toppling into an excavation site . Unfettered squalor: An Italian immigrant smokes a pipe in his makeshift home under the Rivington Street Dump . Dangerous life: A man and a young girl peer into the courtyard of a tenement complex in 'Bottle Alley,' 1901. The photograph was used as evidence in a murder case. An 'X' is marked on the side of a staircase (right) to indicate the location where the murderer fired shots . As these images show, there were . moments of light relief. Riis also captured the city’s poorest at . leisure - playing ball, breaking the incessant gloom with a few tunes on . the fiddle or splashing about in the bathhouse on the Hudson River. At times Riis also documents the other side of New York - the white picket fences, the prim schoolgirls. Riis's celebrated 1890 work of early . photojournalism, How the Other Half Lives, brought to public attention . the desperate lives of urban immigrants and created a place for him in . photographic history, according to The New York Times. A Danish immigrant who became a police reporter, Riis was an evangelical, a conservative, and a reformer who wanted to improve conditions in the congested slums. He arrived in the U.S. in 1870, . having . left Denmark as a carpenter’s apprentice, and began life in New York as . a casual worker, later working as a crime reporter for The New . York Tribune. Makeshift home: A man sorts through trash under the 47th Street dump where he has made his home in around 1890 . Hard labour: In a picture taken in 1890 a Bohemian family of four roll cigars at home in their tenement. Working from six in the morning till nine at night, they earn $3.75 for a thousand cigars, and between them could turn out three thousand cigars a week . Working till they dropped: Mrs Benoit, a Native American widow, sews and beads while smoking a pipe in her Hudson Street apartment, New York City, while right, a dishevelled shoeshine boy named Tommy takes a break from business . Handiwork: A Native American, Mountain Eagle, and his family make handicrafts while one son plays violin in their tenement at 6 Beach Street in this image taken in 1895 . Grafting: Men and women make neckties inside a tenement on Division Street, Little Italy . He did not take his first photograph . until 1888, more than ten years after he began work as a reporter and he . stopped taking photos four years later, the New York Times said. While Riis saved all his papers . diligently, he took little care over his photographs which were for him . mere accompaniments to his written work and lectures. Only . in the 1940s, when photographers tracked down Riis’s youngest son and . asked him to search the attic of the family home, were the pictures . found. The Museum of the City of New York has a substantial collection of Riis’s photographs. Line up: A group of prisoners in striped suits and hats at The Lock-step Penitentiary on Blackwell's Island around 1890 .

"A world-renowned plastic surgeon has invented a bra which supports your breasts while you sleep to stop them dropping over time, dubbed the NightLift. According to its creator Dr. Randal Haworth, based in Beverly Hills, California, gravity takes its toll on your breasts over years of sleeping supportless, leading to 'flattening and splaying' of the tissue, as well as 'vertical chest wrinkles' when we doze on our sides. The $98 NightLift's slightly odd appearance is down to its 'sling configuration', which cradles each breast individually and keeps them separate to avoid one putting pressure on the other, regardless of sleeping position. Scroll down for video . Sleeping bra: The NightLift's slightly odd appearance is down to its 'sling configuration', which cradles each breast individually and keeps them separate to avoid one putting pressure on the other (pictured) 'Essentially, I created a bra for each breast as opposed to a bra for a pair of breasts,' Dr Haworth tells MailOnline. Having taken Dr Haworth's NightLift bra for a sleepy test drive, I was surprised to find it felt extremely comfortable and looked much sexier than I expected it would. It's far too soon, of course, to tell whether this contraption will compete with gravity on an ongoing basis, but I'll certainly be wearing it at night from now on, if just for the snugness alone. Dr Haworth, who has performed over 2,000 breast surgeries, many of them on unnamed celebrities, claims that when worn every night, the NightLift can actually prevent the need for a breast lift further down the line. 'Prevention is what the NightLift does most effectively,' he says. 'If you’re sagging a little, our bra can’t tighten tissue that’s already stretched, but can certainly help prevent it from further stretching and sagging.' He adds: 'Yet we have had more than a few of anecdotal reports from women stating that their breasts sit higher in the morning after sleeping in a bra.' Daytime only: Conventional  bras (pictured) use shoulder straps to lift the breast weight and often underwire as re-enforcement, both of which allegedly do 'nothing' when the wearer is lying down . Harness-like: The Nightlift, which has no wiring, supports the breasts from every position and has an extra pair of J-hooks so the straps can be adjusted in seven different places to fit the wearer snugly . Stop the clock: Dr Randal Haworth, who invented the NightLift (pictured), claims that worn every night, it can actually prevent the need for a breast lift further down the line . Mr Haworth first had his eureka moment back in 2008, when he noticed a pattern in his patients after years of private practice. 'No matter who the patient is, how old she may be, or even her cup size, those few women who make a habit of sleeping in a bra - for some reason European actresses top the list here - invariably have a higher, firmer bust-line and smoother, firmer cleavage than those who don't,' he says. Conventional everyday bras use shoulder straps to lift the breast weight and often underwire as re-enforcement, both of which do 'nothing' when the wearer is lying down, according to Dr Haworth. His patented system, the result of six years development and more than 47 prototypes, is called BUST (Bilateral Uplift Support Technology), and features 'cradle-shaped' outer wings to support each breast from every angle. Secret? Dr Howarth noticed that clients who slept in bras - mostly European actresses he notes - had higher, firmer bust-lines. Pictured from left, Spaniard Penelope Cruz, Brit Liz Hurley and Italian Monica Bellucci (right) Coming soon: The NightLift will launch next month in three designs; the $98 bra (pictured), the $120 Cami and the $120 Nightie, all available in standard bra sizes in either black, nude or lace over nude . The Nightlift also has an extra pair of J-hooks so the straps can be adjusted in seven different places to fit the wearer snugly, and no wiring. Well qualified: Dr Haworth (pictured) has performed over 2,000 breast surgeries . 'Wiring, which gives larger bras their structure while keeping the bra close to the rib cage, works very well for vertical support from underneath the bosom, that is, for bras worn during the day,' Dr Haworth explains. 'At night, unique gravitational forces are imposed upon the breasts which, in turn, require unique kinds of support - lateral and medial - that wiring simply can’t provide. 'Plus a lot of women find wiring uncomfortable and comfort was one of our foremost priorities.' With comfort in mind, the bra is also crafted from foam and soft microfibers. So could the NightLift be beneficial when worn during the day too? 'Some of our test wearers have made it their ""go-to"" brassiere during the day as well,' Dr Haworth remarks. And as for wearing a regular bra at night, he says: 'A normal bra at night is better than nothing but it doesn't protect the breasts from falling to the sides when lying on your back or side.' The NightLift will launch next month in three designs; the $98 bra, the $120 Cami and the $120 Nightie, all available in standard bra sizes in either black, nude or lace over nude.","The $98 NightLift bra features 'cradle-shaped' outer wings to support each breast regardless of sleeping position .

"Queens Park Rangers co-owner Tony Fernandes has confirmed the club will fight the prospect of a £50million fine. Sportsmail revealed on Saturday how QPR chiefs had started seeking legal advice in preparation for a costly courtroom battle as they plan to fight sanctions for breaching Football League Financial Fair Play regulations. VIDEO Scroll down for Tony Fernandes: It's like something from the movies . Celebration: Joey Barton carries QPR owner Tony Fernandes after beating Derby to secure promotion . In March, the club posted a staggering £65.4million loss for the year ending May 2013. Under the rules, clubs are only entitled to make an £8million loss per season. After clinching promotion by beating Derby 1-0 in the Championship play-off final, Rangers are now facing a fine of up to £50million for breaking the financial guidelines. But Fernandes has confirmed the newly-promoted club will fight the sanctions in the law courts. 'Will we fight the fine? What do you think? After all we've been through, it's my middle name – Fight It Fernandes,' he said . Relief: QPR owner Tony Fernandes celebrates with the fans at Wembley Stadium . 'My view is consistent, that it is very unfair for a club that has been relegated as the wage difference between the Premier League and Championship is impossible. There should be a period for clubs to rectify their salaries. 'If we were in the Championship in two years with that wage bill it wouldn't be right. I'm in favour of FFP but it is unfair for a club coming down.' The club will not be punished for their financial results during the 2012/13 season - but will for the current campaign.

Rangers are not required to reveal those figures until December - but given they recorded a £65.4million loss, it seems hugely unlikely that they'll be able to reel in their deficit to the £8million threshold. And it is understood the club have already opened dialogue with their lawyers as they plot a way to fight against a crippling fine. The threat of financial sanctions will play a significant role in the club's summer spending plans.

"Rick Scott, the governor of Florida, rescued a Labrador retriever during the 2010 GOP campaign, but gave him back after he was inaugurated, it was revealed Monday. The Republican governor only had the dog, Reagan, for the duration of his gubernatorial campaign, and gave the retriever back after he was sworn into office. Scott had adopted the retriever shortly after his GOP nomination two years ago. The candidate posted photos of the dog to his Facebook campaign website, asking constituents to help name the newest member of his family. Adopted: Gov. Rick Scott adopted this Labrador retriever, Reagan, ahead of his GOP nomination in 2010, and gave him back to his previous owner only a year later . Scott posted photos of the dog on his Facebook during the campaign and had constituents name the pooch . They decided on Reagan, after the 40th president of the U.S. Scott was routinely congratulated for adopting a rescue and not buying a purebred, such as President Obama’s dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog. However, reporters from the Tampa Bay Times noticed that Reagan had not been seen since Scott’s 2011 inauguration. After some digging, the reporters realized there were no photos of Reagan since before the election. Images  of the dog had been removed from Scott's gubernatorial campaign website as well. Last Wednesday, they reached out to Gov. Schott’s campaign communications director Brian Burgess, who said: ‘Take it in the bank I’m getting you every bit of info I can lay my hands on,’ adding that there would be ‘the potential for a PR nightmare’ if no information was received on the canine. Not satisfied with the response, the reporters dug further and contacted Melissa Sellers, Scott’s current communications director. Ms Sellers responded that she was ‘far too busy to find an answer to the question,’ according to the Times. A spokeswoman for Mrs Scott would only confirm that the family has one dog, Talle, a seven-year-old rescue lab. Bad fit? Gov. Scott said that Reagan would bark . constantly if anyone was carrying something; he was elected Florida's . governor in 2010 and sworn in a year later . Stumping: Rick Scott pictured holding a child on the campaign trail in 2010 . On Monday, reporters confronted Scott about the case of the vanishing dog. The governor said that Reagan ‘scared the living daylights’ out of everyone living at his Tallahassee mansion and that it wasn’t working out. The dog, he said, would not stop barking if he saw a person carrying something. Scott said that because of Reagan’s temperament, he had no choice but to return him to his previous owner. As Gawker notes, each rescue dog comes with its own set of personality quirks, and may not be adjusted for living with certain types of families. The website ponders if Scott or anyone on his campaign spent time with Reagan before adopting him to find out if he was a good fit for the politician. A survey released in December by Quinnipiac University revealed that the GOP leader was unpopular and many Republican voters wished for another candidate come the 2014 primary, according to NBC Miami. Speaking last week at the GOP’s annual meeting, Scott said that his time in office has proven that he deserves a second term. ‘Anybody who believes that they want to improve themselves should be a Republican,’ he told supporters.","Rick Scott adopted rescue dog Reagan during the 2010 campaign for Florida governor .

"Last week, I stood outside the school gates and had a frantic whispered conversation with my bank manager on my mobile phone. I needed to cancel the £97 due to go out the next day to pay the gas bill or I wouldn’t have enough money to buy food. The reason I was whispering? My seven-year-old son Ed attends an exclusive prep school in Chelsea, West London, and one of the other mums was walking towards me. Where DOES all the money go? Despite her husband's £100,000 salary Mel Fallowfield says her designer purse is empty . Not for the first time I was painfully aware of the contrast between us. She looked elegant in designer clothes and salon blow-dried hair. I was hot and scruffy, having walked for over an hour from my house to the school — to save on the bus fare. It sounds ridiculous to admit that with a child in private education I can’t pay an essential bill without risking going hungry or scrape together the price of a bus ticket. After all, my husband, who’s head of client strategy for an IT company, and I earn £100,000 between us. Home is a lovely apartment in Kensington, just a few streets away from where David Cameron lived before moving to No 10. Victim of circumstances: Mel says she is one of the squeezed middle class . We have an Audi A4 estate parked outside, I went to the Dominican Republic for half-term in February and we enjoy skiing holidays. A few weeks ago we were at the opera and I wore a Moschino cocktail dress. I’ve got a Mulberry handbag and Cartier watch. Not forgetting the fact that Ed attends a school where the parents include at least one supermodel and a world-famous footballer. But scratch the surface of these trappings of wealth and a very different picture emerges. The Mulberry handbag was a present for my 40th from a generous friend, who also took us to the opera, and the designer dress is 20 years old. The trip to the Caribbean was a work junket and we can only go skiing because we stay for free at my brother’s home in Austria. And my Cartier watch? Well, I took it to be repaired four years ago, but I’ve never been able to collect it as I can’t afford the £250 bill. Sometimes I don’t have a penny in the world — scrabbling down the back of the sofa yields nothing. It’s always touch and go whether the school fees, which are £11,000 a year plus extras such as uniform and trips, get paid. I have nightmares about the teachers saying: ‘I’m sorry. Until you’ve paid the fees, Ed can’t come back.’ They don’t, of course. Instead I get a discreet letter a few weeks into term reminding me to pay. Then my husband’s salary drops into our account and we’re able to scrape together the cash. Crammed in: Mel says her family's 'modest' £600,000 Kensington flat is too small for her family . I have no savings while a pension is a distant dream. And though our flat is in a desirable part of London, we’re crammed in as it only has two bedrooms. It might be worth £600,000, but that’s a modest amount in London. The kitchen sink is leaking and the bathroom is falling apart. Needless to say, we can’t afford to get either of them mended. We haven’t been on a two-week summer holiday since Ed was born; instead we descend on my long-suffering parents in Dorset. One in five over 65-year-olds has more than £500 disposable income each month . So, where does our generous income go? The school fees swallow up a huge chunk and I know people will be baffled as to why we send our children to a private school when we’re so stretched. Partly it’s because I want the boys to enjoy the privileges I had as a child. My father had his own financial services business and I grew up in Dorset with ponies, dogs and cats. I was educated at St Mary’s, Ascot, one of the country’s leading girls’ boarding schools. I assumed that my children would go to public school, too, and benefit from small classes and superior teaching.In the state schools near me there would be 30 children in a class; in Ed’s school, there are 15. Then there’s four-year-old Bertie. His lovely pre-school costs more than £400 a month. My freelance writing job means the fees can be more than I take home some months, but he’s made wonderful friends, so I don’t want to move him. And come September, his education will cost a lot more. Somehow we’ll have to find the money for him to go to Ed’s school — otherwise it’s not fair that only one gets the advantages. But I’ve had a few sleepless nights wondering how we will do it. Crumbling finances: Mel has nightmares about not being able to pay her son's school fees . Then there’s my mobile phone: it’s always more than £100 a month. Gas and electricity are £140 a month and I can’t swap the providers because I owe them too much money after discovering our bills had been under-estimated. Broadband, landline and cable TV comes to £100 a month. When it comes to our mortgage, we’re tied into a fixed rate costing well over £1,000. Unlike other more financially savvy people, we didn’t get a tracker that would have saved us hundreds because of low interest rates. People will wonder why we don’t move out of London where houses are cheaper. But I love where we live and my husband hates the idea of commuting. We feel we had to have an estate car because of the children, and the Audi dealership near us was offering a good deal, so it seemed logical to go there. In any case, it’s been bought on a finance plan, so we can’t sell it. I don’t like to compromise on cosmetics either. I’ll happily spend £50 on a pot of Clarins moisturiser. But when I can’t afford it, I go round the Clarins concessions in different department stores, pretending that I’m going away and can’t fit my big pot into my luggage, and ask for samples. Recently, that ruse kept me going for over a month. I have to confess I smoke — though I have switched to Chesterfield at £6.25 a packet from Marlboro, which cost more. I’m also rubbish at budgeting with the food shopping: I really couldn’t tell you how much a pint of milk costs. I always fall for the three-for-two offers, not taking into account that we probably don’t want to end up eating roast chicken three nights in a row. No sympathy: 'I fully admit it's my fault. If I have money, I can't help spending it' I’m under no illusion that I’m going to get any sympathy for my predicament. And I fully admit it’s my fault. If I have money, I can’t help spending it — chucking steaks in my shopping trolley and then wondering why the bill is more than £100. I find it impossible to stick to a tight budget. But I believe I’m the victim of economic changes that have squeezed the middle classes. While in the past those with a household income equivalent to  £100,000-plus would expect to own a decent-sized home, enjoy good holidays and be able to put their children through private school, static salaries combined with rising house prices and school fees have made it almost impossible. Disaster: Rising house prices and school fees have made Mel's life almost impossible . At least I’m not alone in being incapable of matching my lifestyle to reality. One of my neighbours is planning to swap nurseries as she’s so embarrassed to be known as the ‘woman who’s always late paying the fees’. Another friend’s husband has become a so-called ‘freegan’, rifling the bins at the local delis in Notting Hill Gate in the early hours to find thrown-out food for his family. I’m thrilled he shares his spoils with me. Some days it’s armfuls of  perfectly good lettuces, other days punnets of strawberries. It’s always welcomed, because the fridge is often bare. While the boys are fed nutritious meals, such as home-made (cheap) vegetable soup, my husband will often ask what’s for supper, only to be told ‘scraps’ or ‘leftovers’. Scrambled egg on toast is a regular meal for us, though I’ve also served him cold fish finger sandwiches left over from the boys’ tea. If he’s away for work, I’ll skip supper and just have a handful of nuts. Meanwhile, the boys’ after-school snack is often free pretzels we get from a stall in upmarket Westfield shopping centre. I know I need to pull myself together and learn to be thriftier and not imagine that it will somehow all magically get better. It’s not as if either my husband or I stand to inherit a fortune. Neither of us have parents with oodles stashed away. I worry that our precarious finances will finally crumble. While many women might dream about George Clooney, I fantasise about an accountant arriving at my flat to sort me out. Until he does I will doubtless continue lurching from one financial disaster to another. So, the next time you spot a woman with a designer purse, just remember that it might have been a present (mine was) and it might well be empty — mine definitely is!","Vast expenses, including two sets of school fees and a flat in Kensington, leave Mel Fallowfield with little of her husband's £100,000 salary .

"Take a look at these ‘street ornaments’. Now please try to stop sniggering. Businesses in a region of Manhattan, New York, are getting rid of these stone street barriers resembling breasts as they find them an eyesore. The bollards have turned into the Meatpacking District’s laughing stock, so locals want them removed and the street plazas they occupy redeveloped. Not welcome: Stone street barriers resembling breasts are being removed from plazas in the Meatpacking District region of Manhattan, New York . ‘They’re the breasts,’ Gaslight Lounge bar owner Matt DeMatt told the New York Post. ‘They just sit out there and do nothing.’ The barricades were put up in 2008 and since the High Line raised park was opened last year they can be seen more obviously from above. Now a neighbourhood business group says it wants to get rid of the installations at six plazas to improve the look and feel of the area. City officials opened the plazas as an experiment and they have since spread to different areas of the city, reported the New York Post. The project to overhaul the area and remove the bollards will cost $500,000 and this is being split between the city and a business group.

"Ed Miliband yesterday insisted he can ‘defy the odds’ and win the next election – despite mounting criticism from senior colleagues and dire results in the polls. The Labour leader admitted he faces a tough fight to take his party to victory next year and said he always knew it would be no ‘walk in the park’. Launching new welfare proposals that were immediately savaged by both left and right, he claimed he was relishing the prospect of arguing the case for a Labour government over the next ten months. The latest YouGov survey for The Sun shows just 19 per cent of people think Mr Miliband would make the best Prime Minister, down from 21 per cent two weeks ago . His optimism came despite a YouGov poll suggesting only one in five voters thinks he is up to the job of being prime minister. His . personal ratings have been lagging significantly behind those of David . Cameron, while a poll for Prospect magazine found voters thought his . brother David would make a better prime minister. To . add to the Labour leader’s humiliation, Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman . bowed out on Wednesday night claiming polls show he ‘has about as much . appeal as a flatulent dog in a lift’. It . came as a series of party grandees lined up to criticise his . leadership. Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said Mr Miliband could . not connect with voters as well as his brother, and Gordon Brown’s . former spin chief Damian McBride said there were no ‘fighters’ in his . top team. Former Business Secretary Lord Mandelson appeared to offer . only lukewarm support, saying he was ‘the leader we have’. Mr Miliband tried to shrug off the comments, saying: ‘I always welcome advice, whatever source  it comes from.’ But . he insisted that his party could not act as ‘continuity Labour’, . picking up from where it left off in 2010. Instead, it must respond to . problems of inequality and  poverty among those in work, which had not . been solved by New Labour. Asked . about his poll ratings, Mr Miliband said: ‘I knew when I took this job . on that we were going to have a tough fight, because we are trying to . defy the historical odds, which are that governments who lose elections . don’t tend to be one-term oppositions.’ He . added: ‘In the end, I have a big cause that I am fighting for and it is . a tough fight, but I am determined that we win this fight. ‘I . didn’t take this job because I thought it would be a walk in the park, I . fought for this job because I thought it was important and I thought I . had something distinctive to say about how we can change this country. ‘I relish the next ten months, I relish the opportunity to fight for my vision for the country.’ Lord . Mandelson told BBC2’s Newsnight Mr Miliband had brought forward . eye-catching policies. But he added: ‘Having policies without those . being drawn together into a convincing vivid narrative, a story about . yourself, who you are, what you stand for and what you are going to do . for people in the country, is really not enough.’ Asked . whether Mr Miliband was the best leader the party could have, he . replied: ‘In my view he is the leader we have and therefore the leader I . support, and somebody who I believe is capable of leading the party to . victory.’ Former Labour minister Lord Mandelson said Mr Miliband was 'confused' on business and lacked the 'narrative' to win over voters . Deputy leader Harriet Harman . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman has been 'shut out' of the election campaign, according to reports. She is said feel sidelined after complaining about the lack of women sharing a platform with Ed Miliband, the left-wing New Statesman magazine said. It is said she 'went crazy' at shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander over his running of the general election campaign. 'She feels shut out from it all,' a source said. Meanwhile, Mr . Johnson told the New Statesman magazine that the Labour leader was ‘not . as able to connect (with people) as strongly’ as his brother David. ‘It’s not his strong point,’ he said. ‘I . can’t pretend that, knocking on doors, people come out and they’re . really enthusiastic about Ed.’ In another sign of the discontent in the . party, the magazine said  deputy leader Harriet Harman feels that she . has been ‘shut out’ of the  election campaign. And . in his blog, Mr McBride said Mr Miliband was ‘guilty of recruiting his . innermost circle of advisers entirely in his own image’. ‘There . are many positive things to say about the people managing Ed Miliband’s . operation and running Labour’s campaign,’ he said. ‘But what they are . not is fighters.’ Mr . Miliband’s comments came as he launched proposals to strip unemployed . youngsters of handouts unless they agree to training in vital skills. He . called for 18 to 21-year-olds to be given a ‘youth allowance’ instead . of out-of-work benefits. It would be conditional on them signing up to . learn key skills, and they would not get it if their parents were . relatively well-off. Tory . chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘This is just a recipe for more spending on . welfare, more borrowing – and more taxes to pay for it. That’s exactly . how Labour got us into a mess in the first place.’ But . Unite, Britain’s biggest trade union and Labour’s largest financial . backer, accused Mr Miliband of using ‘Tory rhetoric of sanction  and . punishment’.","String of opinion polls make grim reading for the the Labour leader .

"A young man has told how he drove for his life after coming face to face with the huge tornado that devastated towns and villages along a 100km stretch of Victoria, Australia yesterday. The tornado struck just before 8pm AEDT and tore across north-eastern Victoria, leaving houses, businesses and vehicles destroyed and injuring more than 20 people, two of them critically. Daniel Clarke, 24, was driving along a country road from Mulwala to Barooga with a friend when they saw the sky go black and realised they were driving into the heart of a twister. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The scale of the tornadoes can be seen in this grab from the footage filmed from Mr Clarke's car . Daniel Clarke had to reverse at top speed when he realised his car was driving into the tornado's path . With no time to turn the car around, . Mr Clarke simply put the car into reverse and put his foot down, while . his friend filmed the tornado on their tail. Mr Clark, whose terrifying footage . can be seen below, said: 'I've never seen the devastation of Mother . Nature like that before.' He and his friend, who eventually . escaped being swept up by the twister, estimated that the tornado was at . least 50m wide at its base. Witnesses who reported seeing two tornadoes . tearing through the north-eastern part of state described houses being . 'blown apart' by the force of the storm that struck at about 8pm AEDT on . Thursday. The mayor of Moira Shire, which was hit by the tornadoes, described the scene as looking as if a bomb had gone off. Brian Keenan told The Australian: 'It was incredible, you would think an atom bomb went off.  How there wasn't lives lost is beyond me.' A caravan park that lay in the path of the tornadoes was devastated by its force, with many homes obliterated . Amateur footage shows the sky going black as the storm approaches, destroying everything in its path . The tornadoes touched down in a 100-kilometre line stretching from Cobram to Rutherglen just after 7pm (AEDT) yesterday. Murray River towns including Bundalong, Yarrawonga, Mulwala, Rutherglen, Koonoomoo and Cobram were all hit by the storm. Buildings in the historic town of Rutherglen were severely damaged, with awnings ripped off and windows smashed. Caravans, cars and trees whirled through the air as the storm raced across the countryside near the border with New South Wales, and there were reports that several homes at Bundalong were destroyed. This image was filmed on a mobile phone as Daniel Clarke drove away from the tornado . ATwo men said to be in their 50s were . flown to hospitals in Melbourne for treatment for injuries sustained in . the storm - today authorities said they were in a critical condition. Around 20 people were thought to be injured in the storm that witnesses said was over in five minutes as it passed over the landscape. A receptionist at Sun Country Holiday Village at Mulwala said most caravans at the park had been damaged and at least two had been picked up and blown away. Sixty-foot trees were uprooted by the winds, damaged buildings and vehicles as they fell . Residents said the storm passed over them in as little as five minutes but left an unimaginable scene of devastation . One man said his back verandah was ripped off and carried over the street. He added: 'A couple of houses down the road ... were literally blown apart by the force of the wind.' And another witness described the scene left in the storm's wake as looking like 'a lawnmower has gone across the tops of trees - trees 50ft high.' Trees were uprooted and debris flew through the air as the tornadoes whipped through north-eastern Victoria . Buildings were destroyed like children's toys as the storm tore across the Australian countryside . Fish and chip shop worker Dawn Leahy said: 'It was like a bomb went off. 'I was holding onto the front door of my shop watching things flying past.' Many are still without power as a result of the storm, which meteorologists believe may have involved more than one tornado because the path that it took was not straight. Senior forecaster for the Bureau of Meteorology, Terry Ryan, told The Age that it was initially assessed as between F1 and F2 on the Fujita scale for tornado strength, meaning they had wind speeds between 117 and 253km per hour. This home was at least left standing after the tornadoes had passed - although the trees, and other houses nearby - weren't so lucky .

"It's renowned for its cheap flights and no-frills service. But budget airline Ryanair has announced it is set to launch its own package holiday brand. The move, which follows in the footsteps of rival carrier easyJet, could happen within five years, according to Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer. Scroll down for video . Ryanair has already planned to merge its flights and add-ons to create a package holiday . Mr Jacobs revealed that the Irish airline - which has been on a charm offensive in a bid to change its image - could merge its existing holiday add-ons, such as car hire and hotels, into an over-arching low-cost holiday brand. Mr Jacobs told trade paper Travel Trade Gazette: 'If it becomes Ryanair Holidays at a point in time, it is a logical way for the brand to go. 'We do a version of it already. We can certainly do it better than we do. The way customers are responding to the new improved Ryanair, I think it will go forward.' Mr Jacobs added: 'I can see us launching this in the next five years. People will say you will not have been able to do that with the old Ryanair.'

The commemorative cereal box features an image of the Mount St Joseph freshman playing in Sunday's game, during which she scored the first points of the winning match. 'Lauren may have just hit the big time!' read a message on her Facebook support page on Wednesday, with a picture showing her holding the cereal box. Hill was diagnosed last year with an inoperable brain tumor and was told she had years to live. Scroll down for videos . Champion: Lauren Hill, 19, holds up her commemorative box of Wheaties, which shows a photograph of her playing in her first college game on Sunday. She has terminal cancer and has just weeks to live . Celebration: The box - which has the slogan 'the Breakfast of Champions' - shows her in the winning game . But in September, doctors had a grim update - she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA approved a waiver for Mount St Joseph to start its season two weeks earlier, and the team tipped off against Hiram College with Hill on the court. NBC Sports reported that Mount St Joseph's had trouble with the practice drills for the first play they were planning for the game. When they finally ran it for real, it all ran smoothly, with Hill finishing under the basket where sank a layup to put Mount St Joseph on the board.

Basket: Hill sunk the layup for the first score of the game before heading to the bench, though she came in later . Hill is the last person trying to focus on her condition, though, saying to an interviewer, 'Let's not call it my last game. This is my first collegiate game.' She was awarded the USBWA Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award at halftime as Summitt, the coach with the most ever wins in NCAA basketball, stood by her. 'I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,' Hill told Local 12 before the game. Hill learned she would secure a chance to play on October 1 during a surprise birthday party, the school informed her they'd gotten the NCAA waiver.

"Our risk of blackouts this winter is at its highest for six years because Britain’s reserves of electricity have halved in 12 months, National Grid warned yesterday. The number of coal-based power plants operating across the UK has fallen sharply because of EU legislation which has caused older, polluting, fossil fuel plants to be turned off. The situation has been exacerbated as plans for some gas-fired plants have been suspended due to economic pressures. Britain is at its highest risk of winter blackouts in almost seven years, figures released by the National Grid have revealed . Yesterday National Grid director Chris Train said: ‘Things will be tighter than they have been historically.’ The report said Britain will have ‘margins’ of only 5 per cent, the lowest since 2007, as it heads into the freezing months. The margin is the difference between the peak demand and the available supply from the UK’s power stations and import pipelines. If it gets too low, National Grid can issue warnings to generators to begin producing more electricity to prevent a shortfall developing. But if these warnings do not work and the margin between supply and demand reaches zero, then parts of the country could experience blackouts. London landmark clock tower Big Ben is partly lit during a major power failure in the British capital in 2003. There could be more like this on the way . The country’s gas supplies also face ‘considerable uncertainty’ as dwindling North Sea reserves now account for less than half of the UK’s supply, the company warned in its annual winter outlook report.A sharp and unexpected fall in wind power could push margins even lower. But Mr Train continued to insist last night that the lights would not go out. ‘While there have been power station closures since last winter, the information suggests that the market can meet demand in cold weather,’ he said. ‘But as the system operator, we’re never complacent.’ One fifth of the UK’s coal capacity has been closed down in the last year because of the EU’s emissions rules, even though it remains the cheapest way of producing electricity. Last month, at the Labour Party conference in Brighton, Ed Miliband pledged to freeze energy prices for almost two years following the next election if Labour wins. But industry experts have said it will deter investment at a time when Britain needs £110billion spent on new energy plants and updating the national grid. A prolonged cold snap, such as the one seen earlier this year, is likely to drain the UK’s gas reserves as millions of families keep the heating on to ward off the chill. The amount left in Rough, the UK’s largest store, hit a record low earlier in the year after freezing temperatures lasted longer than expected. Last March Britain came within hours of running out of gas after one of the under-sea pipes that imports gas from the Continent broke down. Critics said it showed that the country needed to build more gas storage facilities. Currently the UK has enough gas storage for only 21 days, while European neighbours can hold enough gas for 100 days. But last month ministers refused to offer subsidies to companies to build new storage plants.Last night fears over a future energy gap increased as industry sources told the Mail up to 15 planned gas fired power stations may never be built. The Government was banking on 30 new gas power stations to produce a quarter of the UK’s energy and plug the gap left by coal closures. It comes after the UK has failed to build enough new wind farms and power stations to replace the mothballed plants. But National Grid experts said extra supplies of energy would come from the Continent if the country risked a supply shortage . But now industry sources say energy companies are planning to pull the plug on up to 15 of the projects, worth a combined total of £19billion. Angela Knight, chief executive of industry body Energy UK, said: ‘National Grid has demonstrated that the UK’s demand for energy is getting closer to the amount we can produce or buy in. ‘We have enough energy now but this timely report shows that investment is urgently needed to ensure we build the new power stations we are going to need.’ A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘As the National Grid have said, we have enough energy to meet our needs this winter. ‘Our infrastructure can deliver more than we need and has coped well during recent very cold winter spells.’","UK's electricity safety 'cushion' is just 5 per cent - half last year's figure .

"While the U.S. has always been a beacon of medical advancement for the world, American women today are expected to live shorter lives than their mothers. Two recent studies found that life expectancy for women have decreased the last two decades. Since these women are more likely to be unemployed or working low-wage jobs, researchers believe the new health care law may combat this backwards slide, but point out that it might not solve the underlying problem. 'Health care is far from the whole . story,' David Kindig, co-author of one of the studies, told the Atlantic. 'More and more people are beginning to realize that the . non-health-care factors are at least as important.' Backwards: Life expectancy rates among women have been worsening in about half of all U.S. counties. Above, red signifies the counties where the life expectancy rate for women is declining . Kindig was the co-author of a University of Wisconsin study . published in March which reported that for the last two decades, the mortality . rate for women had increased in half of U.S. counties, while the male . mortality rate only increased in 3 per cent. Kindig said he was so shocked by it's outcome, that he and his research partner went back and did the numbers again just to double check. Get the diploma: White, female high-school dropouts are expected to die five years before the previous generation . But their initial calculations were right and soon confirmed by a study by the University of Washington which found that female life expectancy either stagnated or declined in 45 per cent of U.S. counties between 1985 and 2010. The studies agreed that women were living shorter lives, but researchers still don't know what to blame. 'Clearly something is going on,' Kindig told the Atlantic. 'It could be cultural, political, or environmental, but the truth is we don't really know the answer.' There is a noticeable connection between where women live and how long they live. Kindig discovered this by coloring each county on a map according to whether female life expectancy had substantial improvement, minimal improvement or was worsening (colored red). The most troubled area for women . seems to be in the Southeast, where there is the highest density of red - . especially in the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, Arkansas and . Tennessee. The red travels . up to the Midwest states of Nebraska and North Dakota before tapering . out in the Pacific Northwest. The Northeast and Southwest are the areas . with the least amount of red. Other researchers have pointed out the role that education plays in female mortality rates. According . to a Health Affairs study published in August 2012, life expectancy . among white high-school dropouts has taken a dive in the last 18 years . and now these women are expected to die five years earlier than the . previous generation.

"A police officer today accidentally revealed plans to seize Julian Assange 'under all circumstances' if he steps outside the Ecuadorian embassy. The document - headed 'Restricted' and 'Decisions - Supporting Rationale' was carried by the officer and made clear their determination to arrest the WikiLeaks founder should he leave the building in central London. The top-secret paperwork, captured by Press Association photographer Lewis Whyld, was recorded at a briefing and appears to order police to make the arrest if Mr Assange attempts to leave in a diplomatic bag or vehicle. It suggests he should be arrested if he emerges from the embassy . either with a 'dip' (diplomat), in a 'dip' car, or even if he is . smuggled out in a 'dip' bag.

"The police chief leading the investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ over how its journalists learned the star’s house would be raided. The Corporation received 762 complaints over its live coverage of the raid, which related to a historic allegation of sexual abuse of a boy under 16. The BBC has refused to reveal its source, but says it did not find out from South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid. Scroll down for video . South Yorkshire Police sources claimed officers in the Metropolitan Police working on Operation Yewtree, investigating historical claims of sex abuse,  leaked details of the raid on Cliff Richard's house to the BBC . Last night South Yorkshire Police sources blamed staff working on Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police-led inquiry into historic sexual abuse, for the leak. Yesterday the furious police chief leading the case accused the BBC of a ‘cover-up’ of the ‘improper and unauthorised’ way journalists had learned that officers were set to search Sir Cliff’s £3million home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, last Thursday. Chief constable David Crompton said he had complained to the BBC about an article on its website stating the force had deliberately attempted to ‘ensure maximum coverage’. He added: ‘This appeared to be an attempt by the BBC to distance itself from what had taken place and cover up the fact that it had initiated contact with the force about the story.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, has summoned BBC director general Lord [Tony] Hall and South Yorkshire Police to face MPs on September 2. Yesterday Mr Crompton responded defiantly to questions by Mr Vaz, saying his force had only taken control of the investigation on July 3 – even though Scotland Yard had received an allegation of sexual assault last year. Labour MP Keith Vaz has summoned BBC director general Tony Hall to parliament to answer questions . He said the BBC rang South Yorkshire on July 14 with details ‘that mirrored the information held by my offices in almost every respect’ – even though only six members of South Yorkshire Police knew when the raid would take place. A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘The suggestion that the source of this story being leaked to a media outlet was a member of the Metropolitan Police Service is one that we take seriously. An assessment will be made as to how this issue should best be progressed.’ Yesterday Sir Cliff, who has denied any wrongdoing, showed no signs of returning from holiday in Portugal, despite detectives saying they want to speak to him as soon as possible. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We have set out our position. The story was clearly in the public interest.’","The BBC has been accused of covering up details of the controversial raid .

"We’ve all been there – accidentally swearing in front of a child before realising what we’ve done. But a new study by Dr. Timothy Jay, a psychologist and expert in swearing, says our efforts to keep our language clean might be futile. He claims that kids pick up bad language from all over the place and there’s not much you can do about it. Don't look so surprised: A new study suggests kids are going to learn taboo language whether you like it or not . Dr. Jay, of the Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, made the claims in his paper A Child’s Garden of Curses in the American Journal of Psychology. He discovered that by the age of six, children have a pretty broad vocabulary of swear words. ‘By the . time children enter school they have the rudiments of adult swearing,’ Dr. Jay writes, ‘although children and adults differ in their . assessments of the inappropriateness of mild taboo words.’ Between the ages of one and two, Dr. Jay found boys knew an average of six taboo words, and girls eight. By the age of six boys knew 34, while girls were aware of 21. Our attempts to hide swear words are apparently in vain, but it does help to give the children context for the words. Namely they are more aware of the social implications of such words, and are thus more likely to remember them, even if they don’t utter them all the time. Adults . Children (ages one to 12) F*** . 613 . S*** . 587 . (Oh my) god . 421 . Hell . 242 . (Jesus) (Christ) 178 . Damn . 146 . Ass . 132 . Suck(s) 99 . Goddamn . 79 . B*tch . 65 . S*** . 116 . F*** . 103 . (Oh my) god . 102 . Stupid . 82 . Damn . 51 . Jerk . 42 . Suck(s) 34 . Crap . 32 . Hell . 32 . B*tch . 31 . To obtain . the data, one man and six women with training in research methods and . statistics who had frequent contact with children monitored their . language over a calendar year. They . were insutructed to record all taboo utterances occurring spontaneously . in context, such as in day care, at school or at a sporting event. Utterances were to include offensive words and insults or name calling. They also noted the ages and gender of each child that spoke a taboo word or phrase. The same study was also done for adults. In total, 3,190 utterances from adults were recorded - by comparison, children spoke offensive words or phrases 1,187 times, with boys resorting to swear words more often than girls. For . three to four-year-olds, words ranged from the tenth popular ‘poophead’ (heard nine times) to ‘jerk’ at the top end, which was heard 18 times. As they got older the words became more ‘offensive’ with 11 to 12 year-olds preferring words such as 'f***' and 's***'. This relates to the second study, where adults and children were asked to rate how ‘bad’ they thought certain words were. This . ranged from 100 per cent of children thinking ‘asshole’ was a bad word . to only 68 per cent thinking ‘Jesus Christ’ had negative connotations. For adults, ‘bitch’ topped the list with 100 per cent thinking it was bad, while only 44 per cent deemed ‘dork’ offensive. In the study it was pointed out that swearing need not always carry negative connotations - it can be useful in some instances, such as expressing happiness or surprise . ‘As soon as kids start talking, they pick up this kind of language,’ Dr. Jay told NPR. ‘They’re like little language vacuum cleaners, so they repeat what they hear.’ Dr. Jay, however, argues that swearing in front of children is not necessarily a bad thing. 1. A**hole2. B*tch3. Goddamn4. S***5. Ass6. Fag7. Piss8. Damn9. Hell10. Stupid . (*Note: some words were omitted at the request of parents and caregivers) He says it helps them to learn about how adults handle emotion, showing them swearing is just a part of being angry or happy, for example. It is the parent’s job to teach their children the nuances of swearing, and let them know what is and isn’t appropriate in certain situations. ‘Expect your kids to be angry and frustrated at times, and sometimes this language seems kind of natural to them,’ he says. But Dr. Jay also views our ability to swear as a beneficial trait in humans. ‘A lot of times you don’t get to the argument about the positive uses of these [words],’ he adds. ‘Their use in humour, their use in bonding, their use as a relief from pain or venting or frustration – I look at this as an evolutionary advantage. ‘Why would we have this language? It must do something for us.' Dr. Jay, however, does note some limitations in his study. ‘A larger pool of adults and children is necessary for analysis of parent-child or caregiver-child gender interactions,’ he writes. He also adds that ‘a significant limitation here and in taboo language in general is that the sampling is limited to primarily white, middle-class speakers.’ Perhaps a bar of soap isn't the answer: Dr. Jay says we should teach children when and where it is appropriate to use certain words, and how they can be said in certain context .","Dr. Timothy Jay's new study monitored swearing in children and adults .

"With its extravagant buildings and masses of multimillionaires, Dubai can certainly not be accused of being understated. But the United Arab Emirates state could soon have an addition to its array of opulent dwellings, with the introduction of the world's largest underwater hotel. Already featuring some of the world's most extravagant resorts, the Water Discus hotel will allow guests to enjoy the high life at a subterranean level. Plans: Designs for the Water Discus hotel, which is due to be built in Dubai . Luxury: The hotel has been designed by Polish company Deep Ocean Technology . Room with a view: Interior designs for the hotel, which will be made of up two huge discs, one below water and one above . The hotel is the brainchild of Polish company Deep Ocean Technology, assisted by Swiss firm BIG InvestConsult AG. The bizarrely shaped building, looking more akin to something you would travel to space in rather than go for a luxury break, comprises two large disc-shaped sections, connected by a long narrow shaft containing stairs and a lift. Five legs will separate to two main components, one of which is located underwater, when it is built. Guests will be able to stay in the hotel's 21 rooms, designed to 'integrate with the underwater world as closely as possible'. Those willing to delve below the surface will also be greeted by a dive centre and an underwater bar. Sleeping with fish: The hotel will feature 21 luxury suites . Subterranean drinking: The underwater facilities also include a dive centre and bar . Investment: The project has also been backed by Swiss company BIG InvestConsult AG. Incredibly, the hotel designers say that its modular design means it is transferable and can be moved in case of environmental or economic concerns. The upper pods are also buoyant and detachable from the main building, doubling as lifeboats, if the hotel is struck by a natural disaster. The Water Discus is not the first hotel to venture underwater - the three-room Jules Undersea Lodge off Key Largo, Florida, features three underwater rooms, while the Maldives also has a number of underwater ventures. Disaster: The designers claim the individual pods are buoyant and will be able to float in case of a natural disaster . Night view: The underground and subterranean sections are separated by a main shaft, containing stairs and a lift, and five legs . Boardroom: Although the hotel could  the most expansive underwater hotel, other hotels across the world have underwater rooms . But the Dubai creation is certainly the most innovative. Bogdan Gutkowski, President of developer BIG, said: 'Water Discus Hotel project opens many . new fields of development for the hotel and tourism sector, housing and . city sector in the coastal off-shore areas, as well as new . opportunities for ecology support by creation of new underwater . ecosystems and activities on underwater world protection. 'Additionally we would like to . create here in the UAE the International Environmental Program and .

"Manchester United have already agreed the personal terms of a proposed summer transfer for loan signing Radamel Falcao in a bid to avoid a repeat of the wage wrangle they had with Carlos Tevez five years ago. United signed the Colombia centre forward on loan from Monaco on the last day of the summer transfer window. Having paid a loan fee of £6million to the French club for the 28-year-old, United have also agreed to a transfer fee of £43.5m if they decide to take the striker permanently at the end of the season.

United are keen to avoid a battle similar to the one they had with Tevez in 2009. Back then, the striker had been loan at Old Trafford for two seasons and the club had agreed to meet a £25m buy-out clause with the Argentine’s owners at the end of it. However, the deal collapsed when they couldn’t agree personal terms with Tevez and he eventually joined rivals Manchester City. United saw Carlos Tevez leave for Manchester City in 2009 after failing to agree personal terms . Louis van Gaal (above) will be hoping his club can secure a permanent deal for Falcao . This time, United have nailed down terms with Falcao to ensure that there is no room for negotiation should the player’s representatives seek more money next May. United will decide whether to take the player permanently based on his form over the next eight months but also his injury record, given that he missed the World Cup after surgery on cruciate ligament damage.

"'Could be modernised': Lord Hall, the BBC Director General, said that £145.50 fee could be changed to account for using the iPlayer . Viewers who avoid the licence fee by only watching catch-up shows on iPlayer could have to pay up, the BBC’s director general warned yesterday. Lord Hall’s comments come amid growing concerns that younger viewers are using free catch-up services to dodge the £145.50 annual charge. He insisted that the licence fee has ‘plenty of life yet’ but admitted it could be changed. Currently, a loophole means viewers who only watch catch-up shows instead of on TV as they are broadcast do not have to pay the licence fee. Lord Hall said: ‘It could be modernised again so it applies to watching BBC programmes both live and on iPlayer. This is for the Government to decide, but worth considering.’ In June, the Daily Mail revealed that 463,846 people avoided buying a TV licence by declaring they had not owned a set or watched live shows in the past year. According to recent figures from media regulator Ofcom, growing numbers of young people watch TV online, on devices such as tablets, smartphones and laptops, rather than on traditional sets. Those aged 16 to 24 spend just half their viewing time watching shows live as they are screened. The rest of the time they use free catch-up services such as BBC iPlayer as well as DVDs, recorded TV shows or films, and programmes they have bought and downloaded from the internet. Scroll down for video . The trend has piled pressure on the BBC to extend the TV licence to cover all viewers. There is concern that older watchers are effectively being penalised for watching on TV sets rather than on computers and other devices. However, Lord Hall downplayed concerns that the loophole could threaten the Corporation’s funding, saying the vast majority of viewers still watch live TV. Writing in the Daily Mirror, he said: ‘The other charge people make is that the licence fee must be broken because technology is moving so quickly. Live and kicking: Lord Hall said events such as England's World Cup game against Italy still draw millions of live viewers . ‘Why pay the fee when you can watch everything on iPlayer? Whilst we now have a huge choice of programmes to watch on catch-up, close to 90 per cent of all TV viewing is still live. ‘When England played Italy in the World Cup, more than 15million people watched at nearly midnight because they wanted to share the experience. Fewer than 2 per cent of households only watch on-demand programmes and this is growing only slowly.’ A change to the licence could be made when the BBC charter is renewed in 2017. An option is for viewers to enter a code on the iPlayer website before catching up on shows to show they have paid. British television is being bought wholesale by rich American corporations, Channel 4’s chief executive warned last night. David Abraham said internet giants such as Netflix and Google could invest here to cut their domestic tax bills and be making our favourite shows in the future. US giant Viacom now owns Channel 5 and Liberty Global has a 6.4 per cent stake in ITV. Unrepentant: Jeremy Clarkson stands by his language . Jeremy Clarkson remains unrepentant for sparking a series of race rows, the BBC’s television chief has revealed. The Top Gear presenter still ‘doesn’t see the problem’ with using words like ‘n*****’ and ‘slope’ despite the public outrage they caused, director of television Danny Cohen said. Mr Cohen declined to say whether Clarkson would be fired, but said he found his behaviour ‘entirely unacceptable’, adding: ‘No one show or person is bigger than the BBC.’ Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, he said: ‘I was very, very clear in public and in private with Jeremy I was incredibly unhappy with his language. ‘Jeremy knows that that’s my position and that that’s going to impact on the way the show is thought about in future. People have different views on Jeremy Clarkson. Obviously loads of people think that me being so angry about it is an overreaction. I don’t think it was an overreaction. ‘He disagrees. He doesn’t see the problem with some of the language he used.’ Clarkson, 54, escaped the sack in May despite being forced to apologise for apparently using the word ‘n*****’ during a Top Gear outtake. Clarkson initially denied he used the word, but later issued a humiliating video message in which he said he was ‘mortified’ by the upset he had caused, and ‘begged forgiveness’ of his fans. It followed a racist joke made by the £1million-a-year host in an episode which screened in March, involving the term ‘slope’. Asked if the hit BBC2 show and its lead presenter were ‘untouchable’, Mr Cohen said: ‘It is like football, no one is bigger than the club.’","Tony Hall, BBC Director General, said annual fee could be modernised .

"Incredible photographs show the horrifying moment a government tank blast killed three rebel fighters in the battered Syrian city of Aleppo. The series of haunting images tell a tragic tale, first showing a calm street scene, then the terrifying moment the tank fire lands, followed by the chaotic aftermath of the hit. The powerful photographs, which shine a harsh light on the brutality of daily lives for Syrians under President Bashar Assad’s regime, were captured by Tracey Shelton, a correspondent for the GlobalPost. Scroll down for video . Preparation: Syrian rebels in the city of Aleppo manning a checkpoint grab their weapons in readiness, just seconds before their position is targeted by an army tank . Moment they died: The photographer captures the split second the tank shell hit the check-point killing three men as it detonates . Shelton wrote about her experience of getting the photographs, explaining how she spent time camping with members of the Noor Den al-Zenke battalion who man a block of streets which now form the final battle line between government troops and opposition forces. She described how on the morning of the attack, the men were relaxed and joked around as they cleared up the area after a tank attack from the previous day. During that attack, the tank had fired too short, she explained. But this time, the assault took the men by surprise and killed three men. Shelton describes in heart-rendering detail how they ran back from the clouds of smoke and waited for others to escape through the debris. No time to move: The soldier in the foreground remains rooted to the spot as his three comrades are obliterated by the blast . Survivor: This man was the only person who managed to escape, running away from the smoke-filled scene . 'As the cloud of smoke engulfed the street we ran back and frantically waited for the others to escape through the cloud of smoke and debris. But no one came. In that split second, three men were reduced to broken, bleeding masses,' she writes. The harrowing photos come as the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that more than 26,000 people have been killed in the country since the revolt began in March last year - more than two-thirds of them civilians. It has been another deadly week for Aleppo residents with government forces launching a devastating air strike on Monday. Local residents say the attack was launched by Syrian government forces onto a densely populated area of the city and that further assaults followed. It is believed that in one of the deadly attacks this week, seven children were killed. Rebels scored a major victory late Friday when they seized part of the Hanano barracks, one of the army's largest posts in the area, activists said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels were able to reach the edge of the barracks, which house more 2,000 than soldiers including many reinforcements brought from other parts of Syria. Aleppo activist Mohammed Saeed said rebels also were able to free scores of detainees from the sprawling barracks, which is close to the city center. Rebels also attacked a main army checkpoint linking Aleppo with Turkey, where many Syrians have taken refuge from the fighting. The Observatory said six rebels were killed in the attack. Haunting: Having survived the deadly blast, the soldier checks his injuries . The Observatory and another activist . group known as the Local Coordination Committees also reported fresh . clashes in the Damascus neighborhood of Tadamon, claiming an army . helicopter had been shot down. Syria's civil war witnessed a major . turning point in August when Assad's forces began widely using air power . for the first time to crush the revolt. Several warplanes and . helicopters have been shot down over the past weeks. The fighting also reached Aleppo, . which had been relatively quiet for most of the 18-month-old revolt. While the military largely was able to quell a rebel offensive launched . in Damascus in July, it is still struggling to stamp out the push to . take control of the northern city of Aleppo. Today a major water pipeline in Syria's . largest city was damaged during intense fighting, leaving several Aleppo . neighborhoods without drinking water. The Syrian government and opposition traded blame over the damage to the water pipeline in the central neighborhood of Midan. The LCC and Aleppo-based activists said a Syrian army warplane hit the pipeline with a missile. The Observatory said the pipeline was . hit as warplanes bombed the area while clashes raged on the ground, but . it said it was not immediately clear exactly what caused the damage. 'Water was completely cut from several . neighborhoods in the city,' Saeed said via Skype. 'Electricity was cut . and now water. This will only increase the suffering of people.' Devastation: Three men died in this particular attack; the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimates that more than 26,000 people have been killed in the country since the revolt began in March last year . Aleppo's governor Mohammed Wahid Akkad . said two water pumps were subjected to an act of sabotage by . 'terrorists,' the term used by the regime for the rebels. Akkad was quoted by state-run news . agency SANA as saying that water was cut in the neighborhoods of Midan, . Suleimaniyeh and Aziziyeh and work is under way to repair them. Amateur videos posted online showed . one of Midan's streets after it was turned into a small river by the . flow of water gushing from the pipeline. The authenticity of the video and . activist claims could not be independently confirmed. The regime has . strictly limited independent reporting in the country. The uprising against Assad began in . March 2011, when protests calling for political change were met by a . violent government crackdown by government troops. Many in the . opposition took up arms, and activists say more than 23,000 people have . been killed. The government says more than 4,000 security officers are . among the dead. The Observatory and the LCC also . reported clashes in the Damascus suburbs as well as the northern . province of Idlib, the southern province of Daraa and central Hama and . Homs. In Damascus, the Observatory reported . intense fighting Saturday in the Palestinian refugee camp of Yarmouk, . which had been subjected to government shelling the day before. When Syria's unrest began, the . country's half-million Palestinians tried to stay on the sidelines. But . in recent months, young Palestinian refugees, enraged by mounting . violence and moved by Arab Spring calls for greater freedoms, have been . taking to the streets and even joining the rebels.

"Lance Armstrong has accused world cycling chief Brian Cookson of showing too much leniency in the sport’s ongoing battle against drugs. Cookson, the former head of British cycling, has left himself open to such accusations after the International Cycling Union allowed Astana to retain their World Tour licence despite five of their riders testing positive for banned substances. And Armstrong even cited the UCI’s decision to ‘rush’ through Team Sky's request for Chris Froome to get emergency steroid treatment for asthma. Lance Armstrong has blasted world cycling chief Brian Cookson role in the sport's fight against drugs . Armstrong believes Cookson (pictured) has been too lenient and has lamented him for certain decisions . Cookson's predeccesor Pat McQuiad (pictured) would have been 'lynched' for decisions, says Armstrong . Speaking in his latest interview, this time with the BBC, Armstrong said Cookson’s predecessor – Pat McQuaid – would have been ‘lynched’ had it happened on his watch. ‘If McQuaid had made the same decisions Cookson has made in his first year, he would have been lynched,’ said the man stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for drug use. Do we like what we have got so far?’ Armstrong rode for Astana after a four-year break from the sport in 2009, but the team that is run by convicted drug cheat Alexander Vinokourov have seen five of their riders caught by testers in the last year. It is also the team that boasts the winner of last year’s Tour, Vincenzo Nibali. Armstrong said ‘everybody thinks’ Astana should have been kicked off the World Tour, while he also criticised Cookson for failing to get team managers like Vinokourov and Tinkoff-Saxo's Bjarne Riis (another former doper) to cooperate with the panel set up by the UCI to investigate cycling’s drug culture. Armstrong was banned from the sport and stripped of his seven Tour de France titles in 2012 . The American has talked to the Cycling Independent Reform Commission twice and is now waiting to see if his efforts will be rewarded with a recommendation that his lifetime ban from sport should be reduced when CIRC delivers its report next month. But he is disappointed there has not been more pressure on Vinokourov and Riis – successful riders from the Armstrong era – to also give evidence. Armstrong certainly has a point. ‘If I'm Brian Cookson, I would make it a deal point that you have to come in and talk,’ he said. ‘So if Riis doesn't talk to you, or Vinokourov doesn't, there should be consequences. I don't know those to be examples, but I can imagine. ‘If you don't come in to talk, you don't just get passed.’ Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France .","Astana have been controversally allowed to retain their World Tour licence .

"A retired barber accused of shooting a California urologist to death in his exam room suffered from prostate problems and was angry about his incontinence, according to neighbors. Stanwood Fred Elkus, 75, was jailed on $1million bail after police say he shot Dr. Ronald Franklin Gilbert multiple times on Monday at a medical office in Newport Beach. Police would not say if the 52-year-old Gilbert was Elkus' doctor, but the suspect’s neighbors said on Tuesday that the man was upset by a surgery that left him running to the bathroom constantly, sometimes in mid-conversation. Suspect: Stanwood Fred Elkus, 75, of Lake Elsinore was arrested yesterday suspected of killing Dr Ronald Franklin Gilbert, 52, of Huntington Beach at the medical office . A retired barber accused of shooting a California urologist to death in his exam room suffered from prostate problems and was angry about his incontinence, according to neighbors. Stanwood Fred Elkus, 75, was jailed on $1million bail after police say he shot Dr. Ronald Franklin Gilbert multiple times on Monday at a medical office in Newport Beach. Police would not say if the 52-year-old Gilbert was Elkus' doctor, but the suspect’s neighbors said on Tuesday that the man was upset by a surgery that left him running to the bathroom constantly, sometimes in mid-conversation. ‘One day we were talking about other things outside and he says, “Oh hold it right there!” and he was rushing to his house and when he came back, he said, “I have a problem with my prostate,”’ recalled Miguel Soto, who lives across the street. ‘He said, “I had surgery and now I am worse than before the surgery.”’ Soto said Elkus never named his doctor, and Soto did not know if it was Gilbert. A few weeks ago, Elkus said he would be away from home because he was checking into a hospital again, but when Soto saw him last week, he didn't mention his health. Neighbor James Lord said Elkus mentioned Sunday that ‘he wasn't going to be around much longer.’‘I told him, “No Stan, you're gonna outlive me,”’ Lord said. Police said on Monday, they found Elkus and Gilbert in a second-floor room after several 911 callers reported six or seven shots fired. A gun was found at the scene. The doctor had been shot several times in the upper body and was pronounced dead at the scene in Newport Beach. Victim: The slain doctor was identified as Ronald Gilbert, 52, who was a urologist in Newport Beach, California . Elkus had been undergoing treatment for prostate problems, neighbors told the Los Angeles Times. He frequently visited Gilbert, neighbor James Lord said. Dr Gilbert is also the founder and . chief scientist at Absorption Pharmaceuticals LLC, the makers of a drug . called Promescent, which is dedicated to curing premature ejaculation. An autopsy was planned today and Elkus was scheduled to appear on Wednesday in court. Police searched his home but declined to disclose what they found. At Gilbert's home in Huntington Beach, mourners arrived as distraught family members and a rabbi went in and out of the house just blocks from the water. The family declined comment and asked a reporter to leave. Gilbert, a married father-of-two, appeared to be the only target of the attack, police spokeswoman Kathy Lowe said. Dr Jeffrey Lauber, a dermatologist, said he frequently referred patients with cancer symptoms to Gilbert. 'He's the best there is,' Lauber said. 'Not only is he a very good urologist, he's a pillar of the community.' Lauber couldn't imagine why anyone would want to shoot Gilbert. 'This doesn't happen down here,' he said of the wealthy enclave 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Gilbert dealt with general urology, sexual dysfunction and related surgical techniques including vasectomies, bladder and prostate cancer, according to his biography on the website of the Orange Coast Urology Group, which he joined in 1993. One of his specialties involved using a laser to vaporize prostate tissue blocking the urinary tract. His biography called him a 'people person' and said he enjoys helping people. He decided to become a doctor mainly because his father is a doctor, the biography said, adding that Gilbert had been a stockbroker and a singer in a rock band. He had worked for 20 years at Hoag Hospital and was its former urology chief. Murder: A doctor was shot dead inside an examination room at a medical office near Hoag Hospital in Orange County . Lake Elsinore resident James Lord, Lord said Elkus forced him to take this tool off him and said: 'I might not be alive much longer' Shooting: Police and medical personnel stand outside a medical office near Hoag Hospital where a doctor was killed on Monday afternoon .

"They may resemble magical-looking toadstools or alien structures, but these stunning images in fact capture the precise moment a droplet of water is shot with a pellet gun. As the droplet falls and splashes into a tray of water below, a pellet cuts through the artificially-coloured liquid and elegant shapes are created. To capture the moment, the photographer took many hundreds of images and then trawled through them all to select the most striking shots. Francois Loubser, 42, from South Africa, snapped the moment of impact by constructing a complicated set-up to take the photos. The businessman said: 'I build a rig with a computer control board that helps with the timing aspects.' He explained his process is 'all about timing. From the first drop there is about 70 milliseconds to the second and 40 milliseconds for the third. 'I use water softener in the tray below to break the water tension. That makes your plume jump higher. 'This [also] makes the water stronger [so it does] not break up as easily which gives you better shapes. Every day is different. When you start, you first have to get the initial impact. Once the set-up is perfect, Mt Loubser said that he starts to shape his shots using timers. 'It can take 100 to 200 shots to start. Then you start taking proper images.

"Fugitive accused cop killer Eric Frein is using diapers as he hides in the woods from up to 1,000 officers determined to track him down, police revealed Wednesday. Now authorities are testing the soiled diapers to be absolutely sure the man they have cornered in woods in the Pocono Mountains is in fact Frein, who has now been on the run for 12 days. 'Diapers are in the sniper training that he received or self-taught,' Lt. Col. George Bivens of Pennsylvania State police told reporters at a briefing. 'That is one of the tactics that we know he has read about so he can stay in position for a longer period of time.' Scroll down for video . Lethal: Frein, 31, has been described as a survivalist with an intense hatred of law enforcement. Now authorities are testing the soiled diapers they have found to be absolutely sure the man they have cornered in woods in the Pocono Mountains is Frein . 'Diapers are in the sniper training that he received or self-taught,' Lt. Col. George Bivens of Pennsylvania State police told reporters at a briefing. 'That is one of the tactics that we know he has read about so he can stay in position for a longer period of time.' Recovered: Police released photos of the green 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport that Frein abandoned in the woods. Bivens would not comment on the suggestion that Frein specifically targeted one of the troopers before he attempted to flee. The car was registered to Frein's father Michael, a retired US Army major . Other items found in the woods south of Canadensis, Pennsylvania include packets of a rare type of Serbian cigarettes that Frein — a heavy-smoking war games enthusiast with a fascination for the former Yugoslav republic — is known to smoke. King-sized, filtered Drina cigarette butts found in the area are also being tested for Frein's DNA, said Bivens. Frein was active in Istocni Vuk, a group of military simulation enthusiasts who specialized in eastern European and Cold War conflicts. The name is Serbian for Eastern Wolf. King-sized, filtered Drina cigarette butts found in the area are also being tested for Frein's DNA, said Bivens. Cops are convinced they have Frein, 31, surrounded in a five square mile area of dense woods close to the home he shares with his parents — and despite failing to get their man yet, they are convinced they have him trapped. 'It's just a matter of time. We are on the right track,' he said. Frein, who has taken survivalist training, has been on the lam since the shooting death of Trooper Bryon Dickson, 38, on September 12. Another trooper, Alex Douglass, 31, was critically injured during a shift change at the Blooming Grove Police Barracks in rural northeastern Pennsylvania. Dickson, an ex-Marine with two young children, died on the scene. Douglass was able to crawl inside the barracks after being hit. He has undergone several surgeries. 'He continues to make steady progress,' said Bivens. 'He is still hospitalized and is in good spirits. Awesome: The Rook, above, was seen being delivered yesterday to authorities on the 11th day of the manhunt . Lethal: Frein, 31, has been described as a survivalist with an intense hatred of law enforcement . 'Our troopers are visiting him regularly and he is in our thoughts.' Bivens would not comment on the suggestion that Frein specifically targeted one of the troopers before he attempted to flee in a green 2001 Jeep Cherokee Sport registered to his father Michael, a retired US Army major. But he failed to negotiate a junction and plowed into a swamp close to the barracks. Police say he then walked up to 20 miles through thick forest to get close to his home. Bivens said cops and locals have made 'numerous' sightings of black-clad Frein in the woods, the most recent on Tuesday afternoon. But they have never been close enough — or made an absolutely 100 percent positive ID — to arrest or shoot him. He confirmed that officers are authorized to use lethal force if Frein refuses to surrender. 'We have had sightings by law enforcement at a significant distance,' Bivens said. 'We are also getting reports back from members of the public. 'Based on the sightings and based on the items that we have found, we believe he is in this area.' Bivens said there is evidence that Frein — who is known to hold a huge grudge against law enforcement — is taunting police by coming close to the perimeter of the search area but staying far enough away that they cannot get a clean shot at him. ''He has kept himself far enough away far enough way so no-one could get to him, but he has made himself visible.' Tense: Police keep watch at the edge of a perimeter set up in a residential neighborhood in Canadensis . Bivens said officers have not fired any shots but they believe Frein has used the .308 rifle that he took from his parents' home. But he would not speculate whether the gunman had aimed at the cops who are searching for him, or whether he was hunting for food. Catching Frein has been made more difficult by the lay of the land abutting the Delaware State Forest. 'It's extremely rugged,' said Bivens. 'it's rocky with very dense vegetation, ferns that are thigh-high, and mountain laurel. 'It's very difficult to establish a perimeter in the area,' he added. He said the area contains numerous caves, crevasses that would give shelter. He said searchers had 'kicked out' numerous bears in their hunt for Frein. Bevins refused to estimate a cost of the 12-day operation that has involved members of the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Federal Marshalls, local police and officers from neighboring New York and New Jersey. 'We have thrown a lot of resources and talented people at this,' he said. He said police are still convinced that Frein only wants to kill cops and that members of the public are not likely targets, but he warned that civilians should take no chances and should stay out of the woods in the area . And he said there is no evidence that anyone is helping the fugitive, but said that police would not hesitate to charge anyone who does. Frein's family, he said, has been cooperating in the inquiries. He refused to answer questions as to whether the searchers have used pings from Frein's cellphone to help pinpoint the exact location of the alleged killer. Tons of expensive hardware has been used in the search including helicopters and light planes, armored vehicles and 'The Rook,' a specialized 6-ton siege vehicle which allows officers to stay protected as they walk behind an armor-plated platform. Protection: An armored truck at the perimeter of the search area. Much of the area has been on lockdown with some residents being unable to return to their homes during the manhunt . But Bivens said the thick canopy of leaves in the area has hampered the use of thermal imaging equipment. Police believe that Frein had been planning the attack 'for months if not years.' A copy of the book, 'Sniper Training and Employment,' was found in his bedroom, during a search. He had his hair cut into a Mohawk with shaved sides shortly before the attack on the barracks, in a move that police believe was part of his mental preparation. Following the shootings, the FBI placed him on its 10 Most Wanted List. Its wanted poster describes him as 6'1"", 165lb. State police said he changed his look, cutting his hair into a wide Mohawk as he prepared for his attack. He was also described as a heavy smoker. Police on Tuesday brought in an armored siege vehicle as the hunt for alleged cop killer Eric Frein moved into its 11th day. 'The Rook,' described by its manufacturers as 'six tons of pure responsive force' will allow officers to shield themselves as they hunt for Frein in dense woodland in northeast Pennsylvania. The tracked vehicle was brought to a police staging post just south of the village of Canadensis where police are focusing their search. The Rook is the latest piece of equipment to be brought in to try to find the missing man. Made by Ring Power, a company based in St. Augustine, Florida, the 13,000-pound tracked vehicle can punch holes in walls, remove cars and shield cops, and costs $245,000 and $445,000, depending on extras.

"Babies learn how to anticipate touch while in the womb and how they touch their face and head can be an indicator of how well they are developing physically and psychologically before they are born. For the first time, psychologists discovered that foetuses were able to predict, rather than react to, their own hand movements towards their mouths as they entered the later stages of gestation compared to earlier in a pregnancy. The researchers believe their findings could improve understanding about babies, especially those born prematurely, their readiness to interact socially and their ability to calm themselves by sucking on their thumb or fingers. Being able to predict, rather than just react to touch is a characteristic normally seen in the later stages of pregnancy. Here, a foetus can be seen opening its mouth before placing its hand inside at 32 weeks . They also said the results could also be a potential indicator of how prepared babies are for feeding. Scientists believe anticipation is a key marker in a healthy baby’s development and it could be a sign of illness if babies don’t do it by certain points of the pregnancy. Only when the ability to anticipate touch and move with intention - for example opening the mouth to suck - has developed is a baby ready to leave the safety of the womb, they added. The 32 week-old foetus begins by parting their lips in the anticipation of touching their mouth area with a limb (pictured left) then the foetus begins to stretch open its mouth (pictured right) Psychologist Dr Nadja Reissland explained: 'Increased touching of the lower part of the face and mouth in foetuses could be an indicator of brain development necessary for healthy development, including preparedness for social interaction, self-soothing and feeding.' The discovery comes after a previous study found babies make faces in the womb, potentially as practice before coming in to the world. Dr Reissland and a team of researchers from Lancaster University and Durham University, which led the study, used '4D' ultrasound scans - 3D scans that can be seen in real time - to image eight girls and seven boys once a month between the 24th and 36th week of pregnancy. As the apex of the mouth stretch is reached, the left hand begins to come up towards the mouth (pictured left) In the right-hand scan, the mouth stretch gets wider as the foetus anticipates a touch of the mouth area (pictured right). The foetus is pictured at 32 weeks . Both boys and girls showed the same rate of development during the study. In the earlier stage of gestation they saw babies touch the upper part and sides of their heads, although later on they began to touch the the lower, more sensitive, part of their faces and mouths. By the 36th week the majority of fetuses were seen opening their mouths before they touched them, which scientists say is a sign that they were anticipating touch. As the apex of the mouth stretch is reached, the 32 week-old foetus lifts its hand and begins to insert it into its mouth (pictured left) and then touches its lips with its left hand (pictured right) They added that, in healthy foetuses, sensitivity of the area around their mouths increases as they develop, which could mean they have increased awareness of mouth movement. Scientists believe that moving in sequence, opening mouths before sucking on a finger or thumb, shows intention is developing in the fetuses. The latest research, published in the journal Developmental Psychobiology, sheds more light on when a baby is ready to be born, according to Dr Reissland. A reaction sequence of a foetus at 25 weeks moving its hands as well as its mouth. A previous study found babies make faces in the womb, potentially as practice before coming in to the world . She said: 'What we have observed are sequential events, which show maturation in the development of foetuses, which is the basis for life after birth. 'The findings could provide more information about when babies are ready to engage with their environment, especially if born prematurely.' It could also go some way to explaining why some babies are more ready to interact socially and their ability to calm themselves by sucking on their thumbs and fingers. At 25-weeks-old, the foetus moves its hands and puckers and stretches its mouth but the movements do not seem to be connected like in the sequence of the 32-week foetus . Brian Francis, Professor of Social Statistics at Lancaster University, added: 'This effect is likely to be evolutionally determined, preparing the child for life outside the womb. 'Building on these findings, future research could lead to more understanding about how the child is prepared prenatally for life, including their ability to engage with their social environment, regulate stimulation and being ready to take a breast or bottle.' As an expert in the field, Dr Reissland has carried out previous studies showing that inborn babies yawn, suggesting it is a developmental process that can be used as a marker for healthy growth.","Researchers led by Durham University said touching different parts of face can indicate a baby's physical and psychological development in the womb .
Scientists, also from Lancaster University, said babies could be ill if they are not able to anticipate touch by certain points of the pregnancy .
The study is the first to demonatrate that foetuses can predict and not just react to touch and sheds more light on when a baby is ready to be born ."
"The baseball off-season is in full swing, and it seems like former Washington Nationals first baseman and current free agent Adam LaRoche has found just the hobby to occupy his time - hunting. And unlike his team's bid to make the World Series this year, LaRoche seems to actually be pretty good at hunting, successfully bagging himself a Rocky Mountain Elk, something he decided to share with all his fans by posting a photo of his kill to his Twitter. Not so stoked however, was LaRoche's former Nationals teammate, and current Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher, Dan Haren. Big catch: Baseball player Adam LaRoche posted a photo to his twitter account after killing a large elk (above) on Wednesday . Not cool man: Soon after, LaRoche's former teammate Dan Haren (above) took to Twitter to sham him . Funny stuff: Haren's tweet (above) seems to be in jest, quoting the classic 90s film My Cousin Vinny . Haren responded to LaRoche's tweet on his own Twitter, writing, 'poor elk, just minding his own business eating some leaves and boom, dead. At least you're having fun.' The jab seems to be in jest however, as it is a near direct quote from the 1992 film My Cousin Vinny. In that film, the character player by Marisa Tomei mocks the desire of her lawyer husband, played by Joe Pesci, to go hunting by telling him, 'Imagine you're a deer. You're prancing along, you get thirsty, you spot a little brook, you put your little deer lips down to the cool clear water... BAM! A fu**in bullet rips off part of your head!' The role would win Tomei an Academy Award. BAM: In the film My Cousin Vinny, actress Marissa Tomei (above) plays a woman who tries to dissuade her husband from hunting by saying the same thing Haron did on twitter . Free agent: LaRoche no doubt needs to unwind after his team had a disappointing post-season, and now being a free agent . As for Haren, he seems to be having a more difficult time relaxing during the off-season, writing last month, 'I miss you Baseball. I also hate you Baseball.' Maybe Adam can take him hunting.","Adam LaRoche posted a photo on his Twitter after he killed a Rocky Mountain Elk during a hunting trip .

It's not like strangers ever guess in restaurants or at the shops. 'I don't know when we will start to tell them, maybe when Kai is around six, but they will need to be old enough to understand. 'It is important they know because it's a big secret to keep from your children and if they found out another way they could hold huge resentment. 'But I don't worry about how they will react. We will not treat it as a 'bad' thing. And young kids are accepting and non-judgemental.' She adds: 'Being transsexual doesn't define who we are , just as being black or white or skinny or fat doesn't define you either.' Nick says he had always felt that he was different from a young age. The couple pose with Kai their eldest child.  The transgender couple still have their original sex organs because they cannot afford reconstructive surgery . He says: 'I was born a girl, but I never felt female. 'I was a tomboy and wanted to dress in jeans and t-shirts. I came out as a lesbian when I was 17, but when I spoke to other lesbians they said they liked being a girl, whereas I hated it. 'My whole life I wanted to look like a boy. 'It was only when I was 20 that I found out about transgenderism and realised I'd been born in the wrong body.' After that, Nick started living as a man and changed his name. He told his parents four years ago and, although they took a while to get used to it, they are now fully accepting. Bianca, who was born Jason, transitioned 13 years ago, and had breast augmentation in 2003, as well as laser hair-removal, but didn't need female hormones because she naturally looks and sounds feminine. She says: 'I knew there was something different and effeminate about me. When I was 17 we had a school pageant and all the boys dressed in drag. I loved it. 'When I was 18 I started working as a drag act. I met lots of transgender entertainers and started transitioning myself. The couple were both open to dating other transgender people and when they met in 2009, they hit it off immediately.

The couple were both open to dating other transgender people and when they met in 2009, they hit it off immediately . Nick says: 'We talked about having children quite early on in our relationship because Bianca was thinking about having genital reconstruction.' While Nick and Bianca could have used a surrogate, they were reluctant because it's expensive. Nick says: 'We have a healthy sex life and we wanted a biological child - this was the only way we could do it.' Nick fell pregnant with Kai in 2010, but struggled to cope with living as a man with a baby bump. He says: 'I didn't enjoy it. I'm a man and it's just not easy doing something so feminine, but I coped and we were both so happy when Kai came along. 'We always wanted Kai to have a sibling, and the second pregnancy was tough too. I had terrible morning sickness and I was really tired. 'When I had Kai I'd only recently transitioned, so I didn't look so manly and people just thought Bianca and I were lesbians. 'But, when I was a pregnant with Pax, people were really staring at me, which made me feel very self-conscious. 'I couldn't handle the whispering and pointing and by the time of the third trimester I couldn't leave the house. 'I only left for doctor's appointments. People are afraid of what they don't understand. Nick fell pregnant with Kai in 2010, but struggled to cope with living as a man with a baby bump . The pair, who married in a quiet ceremony in November 2011, say they won't have any more children. But only because the two they already have are a handful . 'It was a daily struggle. I hated the way my body was changing. It did not match my inner feelings.' Unable to bear the thought of natural birth, Nick opted for caesarean. 'It cut out part of the very female process of giving birth. 'But It's all been worth it, regardless of how difficult it was.' Bianca did not mind missing that part of being woman. She says: 'I was very happy not to carry the children. It was great to get out of it - the inconvenience, the physical changes, the pain of birth. Bianca says that although they dislike still having their biological genitalia, having sex has never been a problem. 'We have the parts so we will use them,' she says. 'If we could change them we would, and they would be the other way around - but we cannot afford it and the children come first.' Nick says: 'Kai always calls Bianca, Mum and me, Dad. 'And Bianca is definitely the typically clucking and over protective mum - in that respect we certainly conform to the stereotypical parents. 'We'll tell the children the truth when it's the right time - we've got nothing to hide. 'Our family and friends are really happy for us - not least our parents, because when we both came out as transgender they thought they wouldn't have grandchildren!' The pair, who married in a quiet ceremony in November 2011, say they won't have any more children. But only because the two they already have are a handful. 'It's exhausting,' says Bianca, who still works as an entertainer, while Nick is a bar manager. 'But we love raising children. 'Having them is what I always wanted. I just didn't dream I would find anyone to do it with me.'","Nick, 27, who takes on the role as their father, is actually their birth mother .

These fascinating creatures spend their lives diving inside the mouths of fish to remove the parasites that lurk there. Russell Laman imitated the behaviour of the surrounding fish swarm to entice the cleaner shrimp into his mouth whilst snorkelling with his father Tim Laman in Bali, Indonesia. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sea-ing is believing: These unique photos capture the moment a boy has his teeth picked clean by amazing underwater shrimp . Water sight: Russell Laman imitated the behaviour of the surrounding fish swarm to entice the cleaner shrimp into his mouth . The 13-year-old queued with the waiting fish and then opened his mouth when the shrimps came near. The shrimp then incredibly started to clean Russell's mouth and remove food from between the boys teeth whilst Tim took photographs. Russell Laman, from Lexington, Massachusetts, said: ‘It felt like tiny little dentists picking away at my teeth and scuttling around my mouth, it tickled a little but not too badly. ‘I had watched fish getting cleaned at cleaning stations before and decided to try it out myself.‘I thought it would be really cool to experience shrimp in my mouth first hand.

Open wide: Russell, who has been diving with his father for seven years, is unfazed by the dangers of holding his mouth open underwater . ‘It is a large part of the ecosystem underwater and many fish rely on the shrimp so I decided to rely on them as well.’ Father and son discovered the fish 'cleaning station' where the shrimp wait for customers, in a beautiful outcrop of sponges growing from some rocks. The area was loaded with cleaner shrimp and surrounded by hoards of fish. Hard to spot: Capturing the cleaner shrimp doing their good work on a human mouth is rare . Quick-witted: The shrimp dart out of the mouth as soon as it begins to close . Russell who has been diving with his father for seven years is unfazed by the dangers of holding his mouth open underwater. He learnt how to get the shrimp out of his mouth when he needs to breathe, by imitating the behaviour of the fish.

Tim said: ‘It really is pretty amazing that these little shrimp immediately recognize a human mouth as analogous to a fish mouth and go in looking for bits of food. ‘It takes a relaxed diver to take out his regulator at 23 metres deep and present your mouth wide open to some shrimp. ‘You have to hold your breath for I'd say at least 30 seconds to have a reasonable chance, and Russell calmly held his breath for over 40 seconds. ‘It is pretty unusual for a kid of Russell's age to be able to do it.’","Russell Laman imitated the behaviour of .

"A baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex ceremony must serve gay couples despite his religious beliefs or face fines, a judge said Friday. The order from administrative law judge Robert N Spencer said Masterpiece Cakeshop in suburban Denver discriminated against a couple 'because of their sexual orientation by refusing to sell them a wedding cake for their same-sex marriage'. The order says the cake-maker must 'cease and desist from discriminating' against gay couples. Although the judge did not impose fines in this case, the business will face penalties if it continues to turn away gay couples who want to buy cakes. Scroll down for video . Ordered to accept: Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Bakeshop was told by a Colorado judge today that he can't discriminate against same-sex customers, unless he wants to pay a fine . Refusing service: Phillips found himself the center of a lawsuit when he refused to make a wedding cake for same-sex couple Charlie Craig (left) and Dave Mullins (right) in June 2012 . The American Civil Liberties Union filed a complaint against shop owner Jack Phillips with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission last year on behalf of Charlie Craig, 33, and David Mullins, 29. The couple was married in Massachusetts and wanted a wedding cake to celebrate in Colorado. Mullins and Craig wanted to buy a cake in July 2012, but when Phillips found out the cake was to celebrate a gay wedding, he turned the couple of away, according to the complaint. Nicolle Martin, an attorney for Masterpiece Cakeshop, said the judge's order puts Phillips in an impossible position of going against his Christian faith. His religion: Phillips said he wouldn't make the cake because of his Christian religious beliefs . Not fined: In the judgement handed down Friday, Phillips was told he can't discriminate against same-sex customers but no fines were levied against his business . Let them eat cake: Mullins and Craig are pictured protesting the bakeshop . 'He can't violate his conscience in order to collect a paycheck,' she said. 'If Jack can't make wedding cakes, he can't continue to support his family. And in order to make wedding cakes, Jack must violate his belief system. That is a reprehensible choice. It is antithetical to everything America stands for.' The Civil Rights Commission is expected to certify the judge's order next week. Phillips can appeal the judge's order, and Martin said they're considering their next steps. Mullins said he and Craig are 'ecstatic'. 'To a certain extent, though, I don't think that this is necessarily a surprise,' he said. 'We thought it was pretty clear cut that he had discriminated against us.' Good News: Mullins said he and Craig were 'ecstatic' at the decision . Mullins said he hopes the 'decision will help ensure that no one else will experience this kind of discrimination again in Colorado'. A similar is pending in Washington state, where a florist is accused of refusing service for a same-sex wedding. In New Mexico, the state Supreme Court ruled in August that an Albuquerque business was wrong to decline to photograph a same-sex couple's commitment ceremony. Colorado has a constitutional ban against gay marriage but allows civil unions. The civil union law, which passed earlier this year, does not provide religious protections for businesses. 'At first blush, it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses,' Judge Spencer said in his written order. 'This view, however, fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are.' ACLU attorney Amanda Goad said no one is asking Phillips to change his religious beliefs. 'But treating gay people differently because of who they are is discrimination, plain and simple,' she said. Pretty clear: Mullins said that the decision wasn't necessarily a surprise since 'it was pretty clear cut that he had discriminated against us'","Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Denver, Colorado refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple .

"As baby George makes the first in what is to be a string of public appearances, we can see clearly that he appears to have inherited his father's sandy locks, rather than Kate's dark mane. Of course, many babies start off blonde, then darken as they get older. So he may well end up with his mother's chestnut locks.

"The Catholic church in Los Angeles is to pay nearly $10 million to settle four cases of abuse by a paedophile priest, which were allegedly covered-up by a leading U.S. cardinal who is now in Rome helping to elect the next Pope. The cases involving ex-priest Michael Baker span 26 years from 1974 to 2000. Two had been set for trial next month until the deal was struck. However attorneys have confirmed that Baker admitted to Cardinal Roger Mahony nearly 30 years ago he had molested children. Abuse: Former Catholic priest Michael Baker in a 1974 file photo (left) and Cardinal Rogery Mahony who was accused of helping him escape justice . Mahony, who retired as Los Angeles archbishop . in 2011 and is now in Rome taking part in . choosing a new pope, was accused of helping Baker evade law enforcement by sending him out of state to a Church-run . treatment center, then placing the priest back in the Los Angeles . ministry. Two of the claims named Mahony and alleged he didn't do enough to stop Baker from abusing children, said plaintiff's attorney John Manly. Mahoney was rebuked by his successor, Archbishop Jose Gomez, last . month after confidential church files showed how he had worked behind . the scenes to shield molesting priests and protect the church from . scandal. Mahony has been made aware of the settlement, said J. Michael Hennigan, an attorney for the  LA archdiocese. Cardinal Mahony, who retired as Los Angeles archbishop in 2011, is now in Rome taking part in choosing a new pope . 'We have for a long, long time said that we made serious mistakes with Michael Baker, and we had always taken the position in these cases that whatever Baker did we were responsible for,' he said. 'That was never an issue.' Baker could not be reached for comment. Two of the plaintiffs, a pair of brothers, will get $4 million each, and the two others will get nearly $1 million each, Manly said. Confidential files show that Baker met with Mahony in 1986 and confessed to molesting two boys over a nearly seven-year period. Mahony removed Baker from ministry and sent him for psychological treatment, but the priest returned to ministry the following year with a doctor's recommendation that he be defrocked immediately if he spent any time with minors. Despite several documented instances of being alone with boys, the priest wasn't removed from ministry until 2000 after serving in nine parishes. Baker was convicted of child molestation in 2007 and paroled in 2011. Authorities believe Baker may have abused more than 20 children in his 26-year career. 'The person who could have stopped this in its tracks and prevented three out of four of these children from being sexually assaulted is now sitting in Rome voting for the next vicar of Christ,' said Manly. 'I find that terribly troubling.' Mahony has apologized repeatedly for his handling of clergy abuse cases. The cardinal was sequestered for the papal conclave and could not be reached for comment Tuesday. The archdiocese settled more than 500 clergy abuse lawsuits in 2007 for a record-breaking $660 million. Baker was charged in 2002 with 34 counts of molestation involving six victims, but those charges were dismissed because they fell outside the criminal statute of limitations.","The cases, spanning 26 years, involve ex-priest Michael Baker .

"A black civil rights activist was 'tortured and murdered by militant members of the American Indian Movement' in the 1973 occupation of Wounded Knee, newly released FBI documents claim. Hundreds of pages of reports provided to Buffalo, New York, attorney Michael Kuzma shed new light on the 40-year-old case of Ray Robinson, an activist and follower of Martin Luther King Jr. The father of three from Bogue Chitto, Alabama, traveled to South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in April 1973 to stand alongside Native Americans in their fight against social injustice. Tragic: This 1971 photo provided by the Robinson family shows civil rights activist Ray Robinson with his two oldest children, Desiree, left, and J. Marc at the family's farm at Bogue Chitto, Alabama. FBI documents have confirmed he was killed two years later at Wounded Knee . The 71-day standoff between AIM members and federal agents at Wounded Knee left at least two tribal members dead and a federal agent seriously wounded. The occupation is credited with raising awareness about Native American struggles. He never returned and his body was never found. Kuzma sued the U.S. Justice Department in June in an effort to help Robinson's widow, Cheryl Buswell-Robinson, and their children get some closure. Buswell-Robinson, of Detroit, said her husband's nonviolent approach conflicted with the violent situation at Wounded Knee, and it's possible AIM members suspected he was a federal informant. The personable, 6-foot-2 black man with a deep baritone voice would have stood out on a Midwest American Indian reservation, she said. Robinson's family just wants to bring his remains home for a proper burial. Fighter: Ray Robinson, 40, pictured left and right, was an activist and follower of Martin Luther King Jr. Similar cause: The father of three from Bogue Chitto, Alabama, traveled to South Dakota's Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, pictured in April 1973, to stand alongside Native Americans in their fight against social injustice . 'My daughter Desiree wants a place to go so she can sit and talk to her father,' Buswell-Robinson told The Associated Press. 'She remembers him. She's the oldest.' According to the FBI documents, an unidentified cooperating witness told agents that 'Robinson had been tortured and murdered within the AIM occupation perimeter, and then his remains were buried ""in the hills.""' The location of Robinson's remains is a mystery, and any search or excavation attempts would likely be complicated by the reservation's sovereign status. Buswell-Robinson and her two daughters traveled to Wounded Knee in 2004 to walk in an area rumored to be Robinson's possible resting place and the site of the Denby bunker, where witnesses say Robinson engaged with AIM members. Another witness told agents that Robinson was in Wounded Knee for about a week and seemed to have difficulty adjusting to the conditions of having no food, the area constantly being under fire and unilateral AIM command. That witness said Robinson immediately wanted to open discussion in the bunker about AIM's strategies but no one listened or took him seriously. Family: In this April 26, 2004 file photo Cheryl Robinson, center, and her two daughters, Desiree Marks, left, and Tamara Kamara read a map outlining various landmarks at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. FBI documents released this week confirm Ray Robinson, Cheryl's husband and Desiree and Tamara'a father, was killed at the site during a 71-standoff between the American Indian Movement and federal agents in 1973 . Tortured: According to the FBI documents, an unidentified cooperating witness told agents that 'Robinson had been tortured and murdered within the AIM occupation perimeter, and then his remains were buried ""in the hills.""' This image shows a monument in the town Wounded Knee, where Robinson went to help . The witness said Robinson got into a heated exchange with another person and was taken to a house by a security team. When Robinson grabbed a butcher knife from a table, security formed a full circle around him, according to the witness. 'The next thing, I heard a loud bang and saw Mr. Robinson's lower leg spin from the knee and rotate outward as he started to fall forward,' the witness said. 'His eyes rolled up as he went down.' Buswell-Robinson, 69, questions that account and believes Robinson was in the Wounded Knee occupation area for hours, not weeks. She said the most likely account of her husband's death is one passed on to her by Barbara Deming, a writer and political activist who was asked by Buswell-Robinson in the mid-1970s to look into the killing. She relayed the story to Buswell-Robinson in letters years after the disappearance. According to Deming's account, Robinson was eating oatmeal one day but hadn't yet checked in with an AIM leader. He was ordered to report to the leader immediately but said the check-in had to wait until he was done with the meal. He was then shot, according to the story. 'Ray did not respond well to that authoritative direction,' Buswell-Robinson said. Other parts of the documents relate to the knowledge of the incident by leaders of American Indian Movement, which was founded in the late 1960s to protest the government's treatment of Indians. For decades, AIM leaders have denied knowledge of Robinson's death. One witness told agents that AIM leader Vernon Bellecourt expressed knowledge and awareness of Robinson being killed during the occupation. The witness said Bellecourt 'made a statement to the effect that AIM had ""really managed to keep a tight lid on that one"" over the years.' Bellecourt died in 2007.","Hundreds of pages of reports shed new light on the 40-year-old case of Ray Robinson, an activist and follower of Martin Luther King Jr .

Experienced traveller: Eric was completing his GO with Eric charity trek, a challenge to visit every country in the world in less than 1,200 days, at the time of his passing . He appeared comfortable with the 26-year-old Assistant District Attorney from Georgia, and at one point reportedly flipped her in the air.In a still from the show, Eric is dressed in a smart suit jacket and a red tie as part of a group date, in which he and other suitors styled themselves after vocal group Boys II Men and serenaded Andi in Santa Barbara, California. The Bachelor producers have also expressed their upset at Eric's passing.   In a statement to MailOnline, they said: 'We are deeply saddened to hear about the tragic passing of our friend, Eric Hill. 'Eric inspired us every day with his passion, his courage and his adventurous spirit, and for that we are very thankful.

The adventurer had taken time out from his GO with Eric, The Global Odyssey charity trek, a challenge which saw him attempting to travel to every country in the world in less than 1,200 days to film the show in March. Scene of the accident: A local news report by KUTV showed the terrain at Point of the Mountain in Draper, Utah, where Eric was paragliding at the time of his fatal crash . Safety first: Even though he was an experienced paraglider and had taken all necessary safety precautions, adverse weather caused the 23-year-old's parachute to collapse . 'He . experienced a partial parachute collapse, which swung him into the . mountainside with some velocity,' Unified Fire Authority Battalion Chief . Brian Anderton told KUTV. 'It doesn't seem like he fell an extremely . long distance, but the velocity that he went into the hillside was . enough to cause some trauma.' According . to a friend, Eric was an experienced paraglider and KUTV reports that . he was often in Utah where the activity is widely popular. 'He's . well experienced. He knows what he's doing,' the friend, Derek Mazur, . told KUTV. 'Just kind of that time of year. Spring, the air is really . rough and a lot of turbulence.' Tribute: The adventurer's sister wrote a poignant Facebook message about how much he lived life to the full . But Brian warned that safety gear and experience aren't always a match for mother nature. 'Pay attention to the weather conditions and be familiar with what they're getting into,' he warned.

"Prosecutors attempting to convict a man for allegedly killing his wife during a scuba diving trip on their honeymoon clashed with the judge presiding over the case today. Judge Tommy Nail barred testimony from two witnesses as he questioned defendant Gabe Watson's alleged motive in open court. Watson is accused of turning off Tina Watson's air supply and attempting to cash in on her death by selling her possessions and collecting on a $130,000 insurance policy after she drowned in Australia in 2003. He is facing a life sentence without parole. Support: Gabe Watson, centre, and his new wife Kim, second left, pictured last week at his trial in Alabama where he is accused of murdering his first wife Tina . As ABC News reports, Don Valeska called funeral home director Sam Shelton to testify in the Alabama court of how Gabe Watson retrieved his wife's engagement ring from the casket, when Nail interrupted the testimony. 'I took my grandmother's engagement ring when she was buried. I think it's quite common,' he said, asking the witness if that was in fact true. Shelton said the practice was 'quite common'. He noted Gabe Watson asked his wife's wedding ring be left on. Nail ordered the jury out of the courtoom and proceeded to question Valeska's argument. Couple: Gabe and Tina Watson were married for 11 days before she drowned in Australia in 2003 . 'You mean to tell me that [Gabe . Watson] bought the engagement ring, married her, he and his family paid . for a wedding, he planned and paid for a honeymoon halfway around the . world, all so he could kill her to get an engagement ring he bought in . the first place?' the judge asked. Judge . Nail also barred testimony from from Alanda Thomas that the defendant . said he and his wife discussed her funeral preferences on the flight to . Australia, calling it hearsay. Today's testimony followed an emotional day in court on Tuesday as Tina Watson's sister, Amanda Phillips, Mrs Watson's maid-of-honour, took the stand. Ms Phillips recounted a bizarre remark Gabe Watson made when he viewed his bride in her coffin, allegedly saying: 'At least her breasts are perky', as the pair paid their last respects at the wake. . Following the funeral, Ms Phillips said . her suspicions were aroused by Watson's actions. At his home after the . service, he reportedly showed pictures of his late wife next to a sign which read . 'Caution: Drowning'. Ms Phillips said her best friend had broken up with Gabe Watson in the months before their wedding . after she fell for another man. However she later returned . to Watson, reported the Courier-Mail. Ms Phillips said initially she had been convinced that her friend's death in the Great Barrier Reef, 11 days after she . married, was a tragic accident. The defence contends Mrs Watson's death was an accidental drowning. Judge: Adam White (centre), a scuba tech from Melbourne, testifies for the prosecution on Monday, as Judge Tommy Nail looks on . Prosecutor: Don Valeska listens to testimony during the Gabe Watson murder trial at the Mel Bailey Criminal Justice Center in Birmingham, Alabama on February 17 . Remembering details: Amanda Phillips, Tina . Watson's best friend, testifies to the Alabama court (left) along with . Wade Singleton (right) who lead the fateful diving trip in 2003 . Gabe Watson served 18 months in prison in . Australia after pleading guilty to a manslaughter charge in his wife's . death but that charge involved negligence, not an intentional killing. The accused's allegedly odd remarks about his dead wife came to light as another witness testified today that the diving firm violated its own rules in . preparing the woman for the fatal trip in 2003. Wade Singleton, who was dive master on the . trip, said 26-year-old Tina didn't get a . private briefing or an orientation dive before going into the water with . her husband - despite policies that require both. Mr Singleton admitted that he and . other crew members didn't ask a number of questions of Mrs Watson - a . novice with only 11 previous dives. Government . regulations in Australia required professional diving teams to make . in-depth, individual assessments of divers' skills. However employees on the boat, the Spoilsport, didn't perform all the checks on Tina Watson or other divers, Mr Singleton said. Defense lawyer Brett Bloomston asked: 'Were you not aware that she had never been in the ocean in an open water dive?' Horrific death: Tina Watson is seen lying on the bottom of the sea in this chilling photo as a rescuer rushes to save her in October 2003 - this photo was shown in court . Happiness: Gabe and Tina Watson on their wedding day in 2003 - 11 days before Mrs Watson drowned during a honeymoon diving trip . Mr Singleton, who now works as a paramedic, said: 'No, I was not.' The . former dive master said Mrs Watson's new husband Gabe was considered an . experienced diver because he had 55 previous dives, including more than . a dozen in the ocean. Both he and his wife declined an orientation dive on the Great Barrier Reef site with an expert. The prosecution asked Mr Singleton: 'You can't make them take the dive if they don't want to take the dive?' I said she looked pretty in her dress. Gabe said, 'At least her breasts are perky.' Amanda Phillips' exchange with Gabe Watson at his wife's funeral . He responded: 'No, I can't.' The . jury of eight women and six men have previously looked at a haunting . underwater photo taken by another diver of the death scene. It . showed Tina sprawled in deep water as Watson swam to the surface. Prosecutors appeared to attempt to cast doubt on Watson's version of . what happened. They believe . Watson turned off his wife's air supply while both were underwater and . held her in a bear-hug until she lost consciousness - before turning the . air back on and letting her sink. Tina Watson's father, Tommy Thomas, left the courtroom in tears today as an Australian medical examiner showed jurors autopsy photos. Dr David John Williams said an examination determined the woman drowned and he ruled out other factors including a heart problem that she'd had several years earlier. Prosecutors contend Watson killed his wife in hopes of collecting $210,000 in insurance benefits. Caesar Lamonica, a manager at the store where Tina Watson worked, testified that Watson came in less than a month after her death asking about a life insurance policy. The defense has argued that Watson did not stand to make financial gain because Tina Watson's father was the beneficiary of her life insurance policy and a travel insurance policy only covered expenses. The trial continues.","Gabe Watson accused of turning off wife's air supply and leaving her to drown .

"A former daycare worker in Illinois convicted of murder in the shaking death a 14-month-old girl who was in her care was ordered released from prison on Monday as the court tries to sort out her 'substantial' claims that she is innocent. Jennifer Del Prete, 43, has been in prison for nearly a decade after she was found guilty of first-degree murder in the 2003 death of Isabella Zielinski, who was only four months old when Del Prete allegedly shook her. The girl died 10 months later. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly acknowledged in his ruling that it's rare to release someone from custody who already has been convicted - even as they wait on an appeal of their original conviction. Scroll down for video . Doubt: New evidence casts doubt on the guilt of Jennifer Del Prete in the shaking death of a 4-month-old girl . However, in Del Prete's case, new evidence has been presented that calls into question the science in diagnosing 'shaken baby syndrome' - which is what helped prosecutors convict her in the first place. According to the Chicago Tribune, the judge ruled that based on the new evidence, 'no reasonable juror' would convict Del Prete of first degree murder, and that the evidence is so compelling that he is taking the unusual step of releasing Del Prete on bond as her appeal in state court is pending, which could take years. 'Del Prete should not have to wait in custody for this claim to be exhausted in the state courts,' Kennelly said. U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly made the rare move of releasing Del Prete from prison as she awaits her appeal . Del Prete, who has two children of her own - ages 23 and 16 - was sentenced to 20 years in prison for murdering Zielinski. The day of the alleged shaking, Del Prete noticed the baby wasn't breathing and got 'panicky,' she told police.Del Prete called 9-1-1 and performed CPR on the girl. She admits that she may have shaken Zielinski gently to try and get her to wake up. 'I remember holding her and she doesn't wake up,' Del Prete told MyFoxChicago in a 2013 interview. 'I picked her up like this and said her name, ‘Isabella, Isabella' because she was limp. She seemed limp.' The baby would never again regain consciousness and died 10 months later. Much of the prosecution's case relied on the testimony of a pediatrician who determined that the injuries the girl suffered could only have been suffered on the day she was left with Del Prete. The judge ruled that the doctor ignored evidence that showed the girl suffered an unexplained brain injury days earlier. Additionally, Judge Kennelly referred to a . memo written by the lead detective investigating the baby's death who . worried that the pathologist who conducted the autopsy didn't believe . the baby had suffered shaken baby syndrome - a fact that would hurt the . prosecution's case against Del Prete. New evidence shows that there is nothing to support the prosecution's theory that the only time the baby could have been injured was while she was in Del Prete's care . Some of the new evidence was discovered by students involved in the Medill Justice Project at Northwestern University. Kennelly said in his decision that he feels the new evidence gives Del Prete a good chance at winning her appeal. 'The scientific basis for the prosecution's testimony is indeed highly suspect,' Kennelly wrote.","Jennifer Del Prete was convicted of murder in the 2003 shaking death of 4-month-old Isabella Zielinski .

"Angry: Ian Richardson, who recently retired after 30 years in the Metropolitan Police, said it was a 'nonsense incident' that spiralled out of control and accused others of 'jumping on the bandwagon' The senior PC on duty on Downing Street during Andrew Mitchell's 'toxic' 'f****** pleb' outburst said today he felt sorry for the MP and criticised Scotland Yard's handling of the case. Ian Richardson, who recently retired after 30 years in the Metropolitan Police, said it was a 'nonsense incident' that spiralled out of control. No-one should have lost their job over what happened at the gates of Downing Street and the Police Federation 'jumped on the bandwagon', using the incident as a 'hook to hang their grievances on', he said. He also criticised Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe's handling of the affair: 'I was a lowly PC. I think he could have done more at the time, but who am I to say that.' Mr Richardson also said that the Commissioner's letter in response to his complaints was 'not worth the stamp'. Earlier he told the High Court this week the 'Plebgate' row was 'just a quirky incident with a gentleman on a bicycle who had the hump'. Yesterday High Court judge decided that former chief whip Mr Mitchell did call Pc Toby Rowland a 'pleb' because the officer did not have the 'wit, imagination or inclination' to invent it. Mr Justice Mitting said he had reached the 'firm conclusion' that the 58-year-old MP used the 'politically-toxic' word in Downing Street that evening in September 2012 when he was not allowed to cycle through the main vehicle gates. Mr Mitchell, who resigned as whip a month after the altercation, vehemently denied during his two-week libel action against News Group Newspapers (NGN) that he had said: 'Best you learn your f****** place - you don't run this f****** government - you're f****** plebs.' He said he would never call a policeman a pleb 'let alone a f****** pleb' although he agreed he muttered audibly under his breath 'I thought you lot were supposed to f****** help us' - but not directed at the officer. Mr Mitchell, who now faces a hefty legal bill, said he was 'bitterly disappointed' with the ruling. Ruling: A judge yesterday rejected 'absurd' claims by millionaire Mr Mitchell that police officer conspired to discredit him - but Mr Richardson said today it was a 'nonsense incident' and he felt sorry for the MP . Battle: The policeman and the MP clashed at the gates of Downing Street and the 15-second exchange has sparked criminal and civil cases and left Mr Mitchell with a £3million bill . Mr Richardson, who heard part of the exchange and gave evidence in the High Court case, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Met should have drawn a line under the incident, which had been leaked to the press. 'I said in my evidence in chief last week that it was a nonsense incident that shouldn't have cost Mr Mitchell his job, certainly shouldn't have cost the officers who were whistleblowers or - whatever your opinion of them is, whether they were leakers or whistleblowers - it shouldn't have cost them their jobs. 'But here we are, with that. Mr Mitchell lost his sense of humour. Who hasn't lost their sense of humour at work?' Asked if he felt sorry for Mr Mitchell, Mr Richardson said 'I very much do', but also expressed sympathy for the police officers who lost their jobs as a result of the investigations into how details of the incident were leaked. 'It was all totally unnecessary,' he said. 'I do feel sorry for Mr Mitchell, yes.' Mr Richardson said he had written to his superior officer setting out what had happened in the hope that the Met could have put the matter 'into some kind of reasonable perspective to draw a line under it there'. But he said: 'They were very interested in the leak and to find out where the leak was, but I was told that who said what to whom at the gate was of no interest to the organisation. The Commissioner had decided that a line would be drawn under it there.' Mr Richardson said: 'It could have been said that it is a minor incident that has be leaked to the newspapers and let's all move on. 'But of course we didn't move on and we ended up all at the High Court last week and this week. 'It's a great shame and at what cost to so many people.' Mr Richardson said the Police Federation needs 'serious reform', adding: 'I think they need to more clearly represent their members. This was not a hook to hang their grievances on.'","Ian Richardson was in Downing Street and called row 'nonsense incident'

"Outraged patients who have been left permanently injured as a result of medical negligence have spoken out against the system that they claim failed them.

"For nine centuries almost everything about the life of Swedish King Erik IX has remained a mystery. No historical records of the 12th century monarch have survived and the only clues to his existence are his skull, bones and burial crown kept in a small gilded box in his home country. Now, researchers from Uppsala University have opened this box to display the relics to the public, and plan to use DNA and X-ray scans to reveal more about his origins and life. Researchers from Uppsala University have opened a small gilded box containing the skull, pictured left, bones and burial crown, pictured right, of King Erik IX who became a Swedish saint after he was murdered in 1160. They hope DNA tests will reveal more about how the king died . King Erik IX reigned from 1155 until his death on 18 May 1160. He was later named the patron saint of Sweden and his burial crown is said to be the oldest . known royal crown in the country. Many reports claim the king, also known as Erik Jedvardsson, was murdered by Emund Ulvbane - an assassin hired . by people working for the Sverker dynasty, in order for them to regain . the control of the kingdom. Other claims incriminate Magnus Henriksson, . another claimant to the throne, who is said in some sources to have succeeded Erik briefly as king. It is also thought there was resentment towards Erik's insistence that . tithes be paid to support the Church as they were elsewhere in Europe. King Erik IX reigned from 1155 until his death on 18 May 1160. He was later named the patron saint of Sweden. Erik's feast . day in the Roman Catholic Church and Evangelical Lutheran Church in .

Popular . folklore claims a miracle occurred at Erik's death - that a fountain . sprang from the earth where the king's head fell after he was beheaded. According . to the legend, King Erik the Saint was slain while he attended the mass . at the ecclesia Sancte trinitatis 'Trinity church' at Mons Domini, in . Uppsala. However, the current Trinity church in Uppsala was founded in the late . 13th century so could not be the church where Erik was slain. Scholars have discussed different . locations of the older Trinity church, but the presence of pre-cathedral . graves in the vicinity of the cathedral might suggest that the original . Trinity church was located at the same spot as the cathedral. It is thought Uppsala Cathedral was built on the murder site deliberately to house Erik's remains. Legend states Erik was accosted by the rebel nobles near Uppsala at Östra Aros . as he was leaving Mass on Ascension Day. He was . thrown to the ground from his horse, tortured and then beheaded. But none of these claims have ever been confirmed and all information about the royal is based on later legend aimed at having him established as a saint. Uppsala University said it hopes the tests will reveal more about how he died, his injuries and his family history. Many reports claim the king, also known as Erik Jedvardsson, was murdered in 1160 by Emund Ulvbane - an assassin hired by people working for the Sverker dynasty, in order for them to regain the control of the kingdom. Erik's statue stands outside Uppsala Cathedral in Sweden, pictured . The crown will go on display for the first time in the exhibition 'Heaven is Here' that . begins this summer when Uppsala celebrates the anniversary of the king's death. 'It's not often you get to open this kind of . shrine.The last time we opened the casket was in 2000 and no scientific studies . were made then,' said researcher Lars Åstrand. 'Thanks to the commemorative exhibition, everyone will get to see the royal crown, a real treasure of our common cultural . heritage.'

Sabine Stone, . professor of Osteoarchaeology at Uppsala University Campus Gotland, is . leading the project and will be responsible for analysing Erik the . Holy's relics. Researchers will also be able to answer if the relics in the tomb actually belong to King Erik, after some scholars have expressed doubt. Researchers also hope to learn more about the king's diet and whether he suffer from any diseases. Before the current exhibition, the saint's remains were on display in Uppsala Cathedral. The casket contains bones of a male, with traces of injury to the neck. Some sources suggest Erik's father may . have been English, and churches in the region did have contacts with . England at that time. It is thought Eric played a key role in spreading Christianity to Finland. In an effort to conquer and convert the Finns, he allegedly led the First Swedish Crusade against the native Finns and persuaded an English Bishop Henry of Uppsala to remain in Finland to evangelize the natives, later becoming a martyr there. He was also responsible for codifying the laws of his kingdom, after which he was given the nickname Erik the Lawgiver. The box has been opened several times before, but this is the first time DNA tests will be carried out and the crown put on public display. During the 14th century, some of Erik's relics were removed from the box and handed out to individuals and other churches.","The remains of King Erik IX of Sweden have been kept in a box since 1160 .

"They came in their hundreds of thousands to dance and have a good time, Rio de Janeiro-style. And yesterday revellers let their hair down in style at the Notting Hill Carnival in West London, with drumming groups, floats and sound systems all taking centre stage.

The festivities got off to a peaceful start on Sunday, with more than 5,500 officers on the streets, as revellers descended on the capital for Europe's biggest street festival. By yesterday morning police had made 88 arrests for a variety of offences, including drugs possession, public order, theft, criminal damage, robbery and assault, the Metropolitan Police said. Last night police confirmed that an additional 126 arrests had been made during the course of yesterday, bringing the total number of arrests made during the two-day party to 214. That compares favourably . to last year when 243 people were arrested. Police chiefs targeted troublemakers by making more than 40 pre-emptive arrests last week and agreeing an earlier finish time of 7pm for both days. A Scotland Yard spokesman said Notting Hill's streets emptied quickly after 7pm last night, adding that a visible police presence would remain until the early hours of this morning to disperse any groups that are gathered. He said: 'So far the event has been very peaceful, there have been a small number of isolated incidents that police responded to and resolved quickly. We believe the early finish has had a positive effect on how the event has gone so far.' Almost 600 revellers needed medical treatment over the two days and 59 of those were hospitalised, police said. Officers from the dog support unit . also seized three Pit-Bull type dogs under Section 1 of the Dangerous . Dogs Act but no-one was arrested, the force added. Commander Steve Rodhouse had earlier announced there would be a larger . police operation in place during yesterday's celebrations, with the 5,500 officers . on duty on Sunday increased to 6,500. Commander Rodhouse said: . 'Traditionally, Sunday is children's day, thousands of people came out . in Notting Hill to take part in this vibrant event which is so important . in the capital's calendar. 'Through effective stop-and-search, we believe we have deterred and prevented trouble from taking place. 'We've . worked closely with event stewards and have seen huge support from all . carnival participants to meet that really important earlier closedown. 'Our intelligence picture has not . changed and we will make sure that our officers are out stopping the . right people so everyone else can take part and join in the fun.'

Carnival queens: The vibrancy of the occasion was captured by the costumes of these two dancers . What a day: These participants enjoy themselves while wearing dramatic headgear, left, while others take part in the parade, right . Delicious: Chefs prepare industrial quantities of jerk chicken for the hungry masses . Police . have put in place a Section 60 order, which allows them to search . individuals to prevent serious violence, and a Section 60 AA order, . giving officers the power to require any person to remove items that . conceal their identity. Elsewhere . in London there were more than 4,000 additional officers 'as well as . the thousands who are normally on duty', Mr Rodhouse said. Mr Rodhouse previously said troublemakers were plotting disruption via social networking technology. He said the 'degree of chatter' surrounding troublemakers was consistent with previous years - despite thousands of arrests after the wave of looting and violence that gripped England a few weeks ago. London Mayor Boris Johnson issued a rallying call before the festivities began to 'let the true spirit of London shine through', hoping the carnival will help heal wounds left by the riots. 'It's right that the carnival goes ahead so we can show the world that the overwhelming majority of London's people are decent, law-abiding citizens who respect the law, love their city and want to celebrate our vibrant, diverse and historical culture,' he said. The Mayor will be visiting the carnival this afternoon. Carnival-goers have so far enjoyed clearer skies today than they did yesterday. Victoria . Kettley, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said: 'It has been a fine start and . should remain dry. Temperatures will be about 18 degrees.' After . downpours the previous day, the weather yesterday was mainly kind to . revellers and remained mild, although showers passed through Notting . Hill for half an hour. Show of strength: Police were out in force throughout the day and by this evening had made 170 arrests - a significant reduction compared to last year .

"The Kiwi Government is on a mission to convince 50,000 Australians to move to New Zealand. For the first time ever the country is holding jobs expos around Australia to showcase the Kiwi lifestyle and help local companies hire the skilled workers they are lacking. New Zealand Employment Minister Steven Joyce says the country is facing skills shortages across a range of industries, and with the Kiwi unemployment rate at just 5.4 percent compared to Australia's 6.2 percent he thinks it's the perfect time for Aussies to move across the ditch. Scroll down for video . Nigel Bickle from New Zealand's Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment speaks at the NZ Jobs Expo in Perth. The NZ Governmentwill hold another expo in Sydney this Saturday and Sunday . Sebastian Berry, who works in the digital advertising industry, moved from Sydney to Auckland in July . 'There is a bit of rivalry between the two countries but it always has been my genuine view that we should as two countries consider it as a single labour market,' Mr Joyce told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's traditionally been a Kiwi in Australia story but why shouldn't it be the other way around? 'It's a wonderful experience to work in New Zealand, we have excellent ski fields, it's a great place to bring up a family, the commutes are shorter and it's a positive, buzzy place.' This comes as figures show New Zealand lost just 5300 people to Australia in the past year – the smallest loss in 20 years. And Statistics NZ said Australia was the biggest source of arrivals at 22,721 migrants in the year to October, with many of those New Zealanders returning home. The New Zealand Government is trying to convince 50,000 Australians to move to New Zealand . The country's economy has been growing steading and it is facing skills shortages in a number of industries . Mr Joyce said this was an amazing change. 'We had a tough time of the GFC, then of course had the earthquakes,' he said. 'But the economy's been growing quite strongly for the past couple of years so we are starting to see significant skills shortage in parts of the country and in different industries.' Mr Joyce said unemployment in the South Island was much lower than the national average at 3.4 per cent, adding that it was extremely difficult for businesses there to find experienced staff. Across the country, there are skills shortages in the construction, IT and manufacturing industries in particular, he said. 'The construction industry is very important – for example in Christchurch we've got a whole CBD to build so there's at least five years' work there,' Mr Joyce said. Mr Berry, 35, from Sydney, said he was enjoying learning how to operate in New Zealand . Mr Berry said the market was similar but Kiwis had distinct differences in the way they like to do business . He said the IT industry was looking for people experienced in software design and New Zealand had certain niches cornered in the manufacturing industry, including in fruit sorting equipment and emergency service boats, which were crying out for staff. Tony Patane moved to New Zealand in April after completing a four-year electrician's apprenticeship in Townsville, Queensland . At the New Zealand Jobs Expo in Sydney, to be held at Sydney Town Hall on Saturday and Sunday, almost 40 companies with 1200 immediate vacancies will run stalls. At a similar expo in Perth last weekend, 35 companies attended to talk to potential job candidates. Tony Patane moved to New Zealand in April after completing a four-year electrician's apprenticeship in Townsville in Queensland but struggling to find work. The 31-year-old said when he arrived in Christchurch, a job in his field was easy to get. 'Over here they see to be a little bit relaxed and it's easier to find a job,' Mr Patane said. 'There's plenty of work on.' Sebastian Berry, who is commercial director at digital advertising technology firm Multiscreen Media, moved to Auckland in July to expand his business. The 35-year-old, from Sydney, said he was enjoying learning how to operate in New Zealand, where the market was similar but Kiwis had distinct differences in the way they like to do business.

"Arsene Wenger has hit back at Alisher Usmanov’s claim that he is holding Arsenal back. Usmanov, the Russian who owns 30 per cent of the Gunners, suggested on Monday that the manager’s 'restrictive principles' are becoming problematic for the club and that the Frenchman is making mistakes but not accepting them. But ahead of his side’s Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday night, Wenger aimed a jibe back at the Russian business tycoon.

'First of all, the 18 years I have been here I have shown that I can take criticism and everybody has the right to have an opinion,' he said. ‘Having said that, we have values at this club. The first one is when we go through a difficult patch, we show solidarity. That is a very important one. ‘The second one is that, when you have something to say to each other, we say it face-to-face.

"For the the last few decades Nasa has spent billions of dollars on a variety of missions to Mars to find out if the planet might once have been habitable. But has a YouTube blogger found evidence for past life on Mars in the form of a human face-like rock hidden in an old Nasa photo? The answer, of course, is an emphatic 'no', but that hasn't stopped the UFO enthusiast from suggesting that the rock may be a sign the planet was once inhabited. Scroll down for video . Scott Waring claims he has found signs of life in an old Nasa photo (Mr Waring has highlighted the 'facial' features to the right). The image comes from the Washington-based agency's first rover on Mars, called Sojourner, which landed on Mars on 4 July 1997. In the image the rock seems to have a human-like appearance . On his website UFO Sightings Daily Mr Waring says he has ‘found a new face’ on Mars. The discovery was seemingly made by the Sojourner rover on Mars back on 22 July 1997, but not unearthed by Mr Waring until now. In a video he expresses bafflement that Nasa has pointed out features on Mars, including the face, with arrows in the image. Sojourner was a rover that travelled with the Mars Pathfinder mission. It landed on Mars on 4 July 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet. It was designed to last just seven days on Mars but stayed active for 83 Martian days, eventually losing communication with Earth on 27 September 1997. In its time on Mars the rover travelled a bit more than 330ft (100 metres) The rover returned more than 550 images and, through chemical analyses of rocks and soil, also suggested that Mars may have once been warm and wet. ‘This rover found some objects and Nasa was pointing them out with different arrows. ‘I was just thinking “wow Nasa’s really not helping us at all find any of these objects on Mars” and bam, there is an arrow pointing right to the face.’ The actual ‘face’ spotted by Mr Waring is in the bottom left of the main image. It appears to bear a resemblance to a human face with a nose, chin, eyes and so on. Sadly for Mr Waring and similar UFO enthusiasts, this rock like so many others has a simple explanation. Namely, it is simply a chance alignment that tricks the brain into thinking it is seeing a face - known as face pareidolia. Mr Waring also added: ‘Of course Nasa noticed it, but they didn’t label the reason for the arrow.’ However, looking up the image in Nasa’s library of images reveals the true reasons for the arrows. Mr Waring says this indicates the planet was once inhabited. However the rock is nothing more than a case of pareidolia - when our brain tricks us into see human faces in objects like Jesus in toast. Nasa also said the arrows simply showed different types of rock . The image was taken by Nasa's Sojourner rover on 22 July 1997. This particular rock had an unweathered surface that appeared to have been unaffected by wind on Mars - but it was not a sign that some sort of intelligent civilisation carved a face into the rock . Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data. There have been multiple occasions when people have claimed to see religious images and themes in unexpected places, especially the faces of religious figures. Many involve images of Jesus, the Virgin Mary and the word Allah. For example, in September 2007 a callus on a tree resembled a monkey, leading believers in Singapore to pay homage to the Monkey god. Another famous instance was when Mary’s face was a grilled cheese sandwich. Images of Jesus have even been spotted inside the lid of a jar of Marmite and in a potato. ‘The large rounded rocks in the distance, marked by the red arrows, are comparable to ""Yogi""’ said Nasa. Yogi, found previously by Sojourner, was the first rock on Mars found to be made of basalt, which suggested the planet was once volcanic. Its smoothness also hinted at a wet past for the planet. ‘A second population of smaller, angular rocks (blue arrows) in the foreground have unweathered surfaces even on the downwind side, except where covered on their tops by drift’ Nasa continued. ‘The third kind of rock (white arrows) is white and flat, and includes ""Scooby Doo"" in the foreground.’ ‘Scooby doo’ was a pink rock that was coated with a crusty substance and contained a lot of rust. The agency explains how the image is a 360-degree colour gallery pan looking to the northeast of Mars. In it the colours have been exaggerated to highlight the differences between rocks and soils. The image is actually fairly remarkable as it is one of the first images ever taken by a rover - in this case Sojourner - on Mars. Sojourner (seen here with the Yogi rock) was a rover that travelled with the Mars Pathfinder mission. It landed on Mars on 4 July 1997 and became the first rover to operate on the surface of the red planet. It was designed to last just seven days on Mars but stayed active for 83 Martian days until 27 September 1997 .","Scott Waring claims he has found signs of life in an old Nasa photo .

"January Jones eptomises the Hollywood blonde bombshell. But the peroxide addicted Mad Men actress recently revealed that her constantly changing hair colour has sparked every glamorous girl's nightmare: hair loss. 'I have been every colour and now my hair is falling out in clumps,' the star, who is a natural light blonde, admitted. 'I’m going to have to shave it off and wear a wig.' Hair crisis: While January Jones looked her best as she walked the red carpet at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, the newly blonde star has revealed her hair is falling out . January, who plays icy blonde Betty Draper on the hit TV series, has previously been a brunette and redhead in her acting career. Speaking about her ever evolving hair, she told ABC News: 'I like it all colours, it makes you feel different according to what colour it is, but I prefer to be blonde.' But it seems the 35-year-old is paying the price for her luscious light locks. According to experts, hair loss is caused by bleaching or dyeing treatments that take place too closely together. The treatments strip your hair of its natural moisture and can damage the follicle leading to breakage. Shades of red: January's changing colour in June and October last year . Quick change: Also in October January was a blonde, left, before turning brunette in November . Jo Hansford MBE, a hair colour specialist whose clients include Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Adele, said: 'Extreme changes in hair colour can result in very damaged and over-processed hair, which is why a lot of actresses use wigs when they need to change their look for a role. 'Colour changes from brunette to blonde can be achieved safely but they are never instant – the technique and application of the colour is crucial and it needs to be a gradual process to ensure the condition of the hair is not compromised. 'It is always essential to consult a colour specialist when considering any colour change, as they will recommend the safest way to achieve your desired result without damaging your hair or causing any hair loss. And it seems that January isn't alone with both Lady Gaga and Kelly Osbourne also reportedly suffering hair loss because of hair dye. Damaged: January now says her constantly changing hair colour has caused it to 'fall out in clumps' Kelly admitted three years ago to getting bald patches after a hair colourist forgot about her in the chair. Lady Gaga, a natural brunette, has also spoken honestly about the difficulties of maintaining her platinum blonde look. '[I] must occasionally get a chemical haircut because my blonde hair is falling out,' she told People magazine. 'When I have a client who is forever changing their hair colour, I always make sure they're 100% committed to looking after it… especially when going this blond! 'I highly recommend the Nicky Clarke Intensive Moisture Mask, weekly, which hydrates the hair from within. I also make sure that they are using less heat during the lightening process by cutting down on straightening and by using heat protection sprays and oils/ . 'But my top tip: avoid tying your hair up wet. Your hair dries in its stretched state and then becomes brittle and susceptible to breakage,' added Ciaran Capuano, Colour Technician at Nicky Clarke . Fellow sufferers: Lady Gaga and Kelly Osbourne have both admitted to suffering from hair loss like January . Jason Cocking, celebrity hairstylist and Director of Lisa Shepherd London, said: . 'With more options for our hair than ever, it's hard to resist the . temptation to try every new colour trend or catwalk style on offer.' Here are his top tips... DON’T… -  Get distracted when dying your hairYou may think keeping the colour on longer will make it stronger, but it will also be stripping your hair of moisture. Try not to get too caught up in your favourite soap  – Always remember to watch the clock!-  Overlap the dyeWhen colouring your roots be sure not to colour over areas that have been dyed before. Dying it twice will do double the damage.-  Repeatedly use permenant dyes Try using semi-permanent colours; these will be gentler on the hair and will enhance the shine as well as improving the condition.  -  Be afraid to dye your hair every 6 weeksBe sure just to focus ONLY on the bits that need topped up e.g. the roots or grey hairs, don’t be tempted to do the whole head.DO….-  Try some daily moisturising treatmentsOn the week running up to dying your hair try to treat your hair every day to a conditioning treatment. E.g. Oribe’s Signature Moisture Masque.-  Always finish the dyeing process with a finishing treatment Try  Clynol’s Keratin Filler, a spray in treatment, which strengthens the hair.","January said: 'I have been every colour and now my hair .

"The taxpayer has spent £20million in four years on translators for foreigners on benefits, it emerged today. The Department for Work and Pensions said most money was spent on interpreters for people from Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. But there are fears that the bill will rise after restrictions on migrants from Romania and Bulgaria were lifted at the start of this month. Costs: The Department for Work and Pensions revealed how the bill for interpreters has topped £20million in four years . David Cameron ordered new curbs on access to benefits for people arriving in the UK ahead of the ending of EU work restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians. Laws were rushed through to stop immigrants claiming benefits for the first three months of arriving in Britain. The Department for Work and Pensions revealed details of the cost of interpreter services in response to a freedom of information request. In 2010 the bill came to £6,751,551, falling to £4,768,619 in 2011 and £4,118,816 in 2012. But it is on the up again, hitting £4,164,624 from January to November, latest figures show. It means that in the last four years the total cost is £19,803,610. There are around 645,000 Poles living in the UK, 60,000 Slovakians and around 40,000 people from the Czech Republic. Prime Minister David Cameron ordered new curbs on access to benefits for migrants ahead of work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians being lifted . A spokesman for the DWP said: ‘Although we do not have the information for the top six countries that interpreter services were used for, the top three have consistently been Polish, Slovak and Czech.’ Almost one in 10 people claiming the dole is not British, according to figures released last year. It includes 35,000 from the EU, 35,000 from Africa, 33,000 from Asia and the Middle East and 6,500 from the Americas. Poland tops the league table with 14,610 JSA claimants, followed by Pakistan 7,660, Somalia 7,120 and Portugal 5,860. It also included 4,130 Iraqis, 3,620 Nigerians, 3,290 Jamaicans and 3,120 from France . Private firm The Big Word won a contract to provide a telephone interpreting service for two years from May 2011. This has since been extended until 10th May 2014, the DWP said. Another company, Prestige Network, offers face-to-face interpreting services. A two-year contract from August 2011 has now been extended until 31st January 2015. A source at the department said today: ‘It’s a lot of money, most of it being spent on Polish interpreters. ‘You can imagine there is some concern that the bill will rise significantly more in the coming years as the number of Romanians and Bulgarians coming to live in the UK increases.’ A DWP spokesman said: 'We have a legal obligation to provide interpreters for people who would otherwise have difficulty accessing our services. 'This includes claimants who are deaf, hard of hearing, speech-impaired or do not speak English. We are careful to choose the most cost efficient means to provide these interpretation services.'","The Department for Work and Pensions revealed spending since 2010 .

"A police sergeant has set a new British record for the deepest unaided dive after swimming to depths of 230ft without any equipment. Sergeant Dave Kent, 43, did not use oxygen, flippers or goggles for the dive and held his breath for over two-and-a-half minutes to claim his place in the record books. The former Royal Marine from Eastbourne, East Sussex, out-dived the competition at the Blue Hole, a 430ft deep underwater cave in the Red Sea off Dahab, Egypt. Record breaker: Sergeant Dave Kent dived a lung-busting 230ft underwater without breathing apparatus, flippers or goggles . Sergeant Kent has only been a competitive free-diver for the past two years, focusing on the challenging  'constant weight no fins' category, which prohibits divers from using any methods of propulsion. Dave first set the British record in 2011 when he set a depth of 203ft obliterating the previous 180ft record, then went one step better in 2012 diving to 216ft. This time his record-breaking dive was so deep his lungs squashed to around an eighth of their usual size as he hit the lowest point. Dave, a response sergeant with Sussex Police, said: ‘Ironically, I actually didn't think it was going to be a good dive at the time. Preparing: Sergeant Kent during his pool meditation, a method of training which saw him hold his breath for over two-and-a-half minutes during the dive . There and back again: Sergeant Kent managed to get down to 230ft after which he had to return to the surface without any help . Up, up and away: Dave held his breath for an incredible two minutes and 35 seconds to claim the deepest unaided dive ever by a Briton at the Blue Hole cave off the coast of Dahab, Egypt . ‘I got my warm up all wrong, the surface was rough and I was getting chilly before the start of the dive.' Sergeant Kent, who has set his sights on the . European record of 291ft, added: ‘My descent was not a comfortable one - I wasn't relaxed at all. 'I was wondering whether I had set myself too much of a challenge. ‘We put our bodies under a huge amount of physical strain and a dive can easily go wrong if you're not well prepared. ‘Thankfully I managed to get to the bottom marker and that changed everything. I knew at that point the record was in the bag because my ascents are always strong. Uncharted waters: Sergeant Kent's record-breaking dive was so deep his lungs were compressed to an eighth of their usual size . ‘In stark contrast to the descent, the ascent was beautiful - I had 75 seconds to just think and take in the beautiful underwater scenery. I was gasping once I got to the top but it was a great feeling.’ Dave added: ‘My plan now is to go deeper. By next year I'd like to be hitting depths in the late 80s. ‘My ambition is to break more records, and within the next 18 months I want to make an attempt on the European continental record, which currently stands at 291ft. ‘There is only one person who has dived deeper than this - the current world record holder William Trubridge. ‘The rest of us are playing catch up.’","Sergeant Dave Kent broke the record for deepest unaided dive by a Brit .

"More than 1,000 Swedish shoppers have signed up to make payments with a simple swipe of their hand, using new technology that 'reads' the patterns of their veins. The developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method if it is a success during trials in the city of Lund in southern Sweden. The vein-scanning terminals have been installed in 15 shops and restaurants after an engineering student at the local university came up with the technology two years ago while waiting in line to pay. Scroll down for video . Handy idea! Developers hope hand scanning will become an alternative payment method for people if it is a success during trials in the city of Lund in southern Sweden (pictured) Some 1,600 people have signed up already for the system which its inventor insists is safer than credit cards. The social network is rumoured to be seeking regulatory approval to offer financial services - including electronic money and remittances - which would allow foreign workers to easily transfer money back to their families. If the social network does become an e-money institution, people in Europe could use the social network as a bank account of kind - to store virtual money. The services could offer remittances, which would let foreign workers securely transfer money to their home country. If Facebook offers the service to developing markets in the future, it could hook in millions of new users and make plenty of extra money in advertising. The service could prove attractive in areas where accessing and saving money securely is not as simple as nipping to a local bank. 'Every individual's vein pattern is completely unique, so there really is no way of committing fraud with this system,' said researcher Fredrik Leifland. 'You always need your hand scanned for a payment to go through.' While vein scanning technology existed previously, it has not been used as a form of payment before. 'We had to connect all the players ourselves, which was quite complex - the vein scanning terminals, the banks, the stores and the customers,' Mr Leifland added. Unique: While vein scanning technology existed previously, it has not been used as a form of payment before. Some 1,600 people have signed up already for the system which its inventor insists is safer than credit cards . The plan is to patent the system and expand it around the globe. To sign up, users have to visit a shop or restaurant with a terminal, where they scan their palm three times and enter their social security and telephone numbers. A text message is then sent to their mobile phone with an activation link to a website, with payments taken directly from customer's bank accounts twice a month. More than 1,000 shoppers have signed up to make payments with a swipe of their hand.

"National Security Agency officers have been spying on people they’ve been eying. NSA officers have been using agency tools to keep tabs on their partner or spouse for at least the past decade, according to a Wall Street Journal report Friday. The spying isn’t often, but is has been given its own code name, according to the Journal, ‘LOVEINT.’ Instances of spying have averaged roughly one a year, a mere drop in the 3,000 violations of privacy rules a year bucket the spy agency recently disclosed. Spy central: The National Security Agency headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland . Among the thousands of violations each year, there have only been a handful of wilful abuses of agency resources in the past decade, according to an NSA statement quoted by the Journal report. ‘NSA has zero tolerance for willful violations of the agency’s authorities [and responds] as appropriate,’ the statement said. Each known instance of LOVEINT surveillance was against a spouse or partner, the Journal reported, adding that each act was met with ‘administrative action of discipline.’ The incidents are often self-reported and are revealed during polygraph tests administered during the renewal of a security clearance, according to the Journal. Still not the end: Media reports indicate further disclosures about NSA spying will be made in the coming weeks by both The Guardian and the New York Times . Senate intelligence committee chairwoman Senator Dianne Feinstein (D – CA) told the Journal that the agency has made Congress aware of the ‘isolated cases’ of LOVEINT and did not involve surveillance of Americans, rather people overseas. Clearly, any case of noncompliance is unacceptable, but these small numbers of cases do not change my view that NSA takes significant care to prevent any abuses... when errors are identified, they are reported and corrected,’ Feinstein added. This revelation comes amid a summer of shocking reports about the amount of surveillance carried about by the federal government and may lead to further disillusionment with the agency. Additional surveillance disclosures from former security contractor Edward Snowden are expected to be published by both the British newspaper The Guardian and the New York Times in the coming weeks, according to media reports.","The spying has been given the codename 'LOVEINT'

"At first glance you might think Vince Cable has adjusted pretty well to Mars' hostile environment. Despite the chilly −63 °C temperatures and lack of oxygen, the MP appears relaxed, wearing just a suit and tie. But the Secretary of State for Business is in fact visiting a test yard in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, designed to replicate Mars. The new Airbus Defence Space ‘Mars Yard’ measures 98ft (30 metres) by 43ft (13 metres) and contains more than 300 tonnes of sand meaning engineers can test the next generation of vehicles destined to explore the red planet. Explorer? British Business Secretary Vince Cable stands with the 'Bridget' rover on the Mars Yard at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage. The Mars Yard provides a test bed area for prototype rover vehicles that may be used to obtain data from the surface of Mars . Europe's first Mars rover will be able to autonomously navigate up to 230 ft (70 metres) a day with no outside guidance from ground control. The next generation ExoMars rover will be tested in the Mars Yard to give the Guidance, Navigation and Control team a chance to finalise its sophisticated autonomous navigation system. Vince Cable said: 'The ExoMars rover represents the best of British high-value manufacturing. 'The technologies developed as part of the programme, such as autonomous navigation systems, new welding materials and techniques, will also have real impacts on other sectors, helping them stay on the cutting edge. The Bridget (pictured, left) and Bryan rovers (pictured, right) are shown on the Mars Yard test area at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage. The Mars Yard will be used up until its launch and will also be kept available after the rover has landed on the surface of Mars in 2019 . 'Not only is it hugely exciting that Europe's next mission to Mars will be British built, but it is incredibly rewarding to see the benefits of our investment in the European Space Agency (ESA) creating jobs here in the UK.' The facility was opened by Vince Cable as well as Chief Executive of the UK Space Agency, Dr David Parker and Director of Science and Robotic Exploration at ESA, Alvaro Giménez. Dr Giménez said: 'A facility like this enables us to develop sophisticated navigation systems to “teach” Mars rovers how to drive autonomously across the Red Planet. This will be a fantastic resource for the ExoMars rover team and for future missions to come.' Surreal: Ben Nye, Rover Guidance Naviagation and Control engineer for Airbus Space and Defence, is pictured making final adjustments to the Mars Yard at Airbus Defence and Space in Stevenage . The walls, doors and all interior surfaces are painted a reddish-brown colour mimicking the background colour on Mars, and the yard also includes a large mural of the Martian landscape. These features ensure the rover navigation cameras see as realistic a Martian landscape as possible. The Mars Yard will be used up until launch and will also be kept available after the rover has landed on the surface of Mars in 2019 in case engineers need to address any problem by simulating the situation on Earth. Life on Mars: The walls, doors, and all interior surfaces are painted a reddish-brown colour mimicking the background colour on Mars, and the yard also includes a large mural of the Martian landscape .

"Seven Somali men who were part of a 13-strong sex gang involved in the abuse, rape and prostitution of British girls have been jailed for more than 40 years. Victims aged between 13 and 17 were preyed upon, sexually abused and trafficked across Bristol where they were mercilessly passed around the men's friends for money. Many of the girls were groomed to view the abuse as a normal part of being the 'girlfriend' of a Somali man, as it was said to be 'culture and tradition' to be raped by their 'boyfriend's' friends. Scroll down for video . Mohamed Jumale, 24, (left) was jailed for 10 years. He forced a 13-year-old victim to be raped by his brother, Omar Jumale, 20, (right) to save him from hell as he 'wanted to turn gay'. Omar was jailed for two years . Of the four girls, three were white and one mixed race, with a fifth girl witnessing many of the sickening assaults. The girls were in local authority care and fell into the evil clutches of the men who used the fear of rape to control them. The victims, described as 'vulnerable' due to their age and circumstances, were paid as little as £30 or given drugs, alcohol and gifts to perform sex acts on older men. On one occasion, a 13-year-old girl was trafficked across Bristol to a Premier Inn by one of the defendants, Said Zakaria, 22, where she was raped four times by three different men. Another defendant, aspiring boxer Mohamed Jumale, 24, forced a victim to be raped by his brother, Omar Jumale, 20, to save him from hell as he 'wanted to turn gay'. And police investigating the case rescued one 14-year-old victim - wearing only her underwear - from a cupboard in a flat, where she was found weeping 'they made me do stuff'. Sakariah Sheik (left) was jailed for four years. Jusuf Abdirizak, 20, (right) was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for the rape of the 13-year-old girl at the Premier Inn - he was captured on CCTV booking the hotel room . Caught on camera: Jusuf Abdirizak, 20, aka Starns, is seen on CCTV cameras at the Premier Inn in Bristol checks in to a room where he and Said Zakaria, 22, raped a 13-year-old schoolgirl . Ordeal: The girl was pinned to a bed in the hotel room and raped by Zakaria, before he took her into the bathroom and raped her a second time. The girl went back into the bedroom where Abdirizak raped her . The case, now the subject of serious case reviews, follows similar exploitation of young girls across English towns and cities such as Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford and Telford. Two trials took place at Bristol Crown Court following an investigation, codenamed Operation Brooke, with 14 men convicted of child exploitation or drugs offences involving 10 victims. Eight were jailed for a total of more than 70 years in June, while the remaining seven defendants - including one who featured in both trials - were sentenced today. Said Zakaria, 22, was jailed for 11 years for two counts of rape and two counts of sexual activity with a child . Judge Julian Lambert imposed sentences of between two and 11 years, with a combined total of 40 years and six months, describing some defendants as 'merciless'. He said: 'You have all brought deep shame on your families, along with all the damage you have done. You were all brought up to know what proper standards of behaviour are. 'As well as deep, deep concerns for the victims of your crimes, I also have some concern for your families, who are not responsible for your actions. You are.' The Operation Brooke defendants were convicted of charges including rape, sexual services of a child, facilitating child prostitution, trafficking, paying for the sexual services of a child and drug offences. Mohamed Jumale was sentenced to 10 years after he was convicted of one count of rape against the second victim, known as Complainant 2. He was also found guilty of six counts of sexual activity with a child, against the first victim, known as Complainant 1, and one count of sexual activity with Complainant 2. Jumale was also convicted of aiding and abetting his brother, Omar Jumale, in sexual activity with Complainant 1 - telling her to have sex with his brother to prevent him from turning gay. Sentencing, the judge said: 'Love flowed only one way and was reciprocated only with lust on your part. ''You persuaded your girlfriend to have sex with three different men, including your brother. 'What you did was akin to causing a form of prostitution. To say you took advantage would be a significant understatement. You preyed on her affection for you in a highly cynical way.' The judge, who imposed a Sexual Offences Prevention Order (SOPO), described the rape on Complainant 2 as a product of Jumale's 'appalling lust'. Abdirashid Abdulahi, 21, (left) was jailed for four years for the rape of a 16-year-old girl. Mohamed Dahir, 22, (right) was jailed for two years for causing or inciting Complainant 1 into child prostitution . Jumale's brother Omar was sentenced to two years imprisonment, which he will serve in a Young Offenders Institution, for having sex with the 13-year-old girl. Mohamed Dahir, 22, was jailed for two years for causing or inciting Complainant 1 into child prostitution. Said Zakaria, 22, was also made the subject of a SOPO, and jailed for 11 years for two counts of rape and two counts of sexual activity with a child against Complainant 1. He was also convicted of trafficking the girl, then aged 13, across Bristol to take part in a 'sex party' in a hotel room at a Premier Inn. The judge said: 'While at the hotel you raped a 13-year-old girl twice, once in the bedroom and once in the bathroom. 'When you didn't get the sex you hoped for you took it by force. That force was significant. 'Your victim was injured as a consequence of your forceful lust. The repeated humiliation of a small 13-year-old girl was completed in a rough, callous and very nasty manner. 'You behaved without humanity and simply took what you wanted, leaving your victim totally humiliated and bleeding.' The judge ordered Zakaria to serve the 11-year sentence alongside the five-year sentence for drugs offences he was handed in the first trial. Jusuf Abdirizak, 20, was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for the rape of the 13-year-old girl, Complainant 1, at the Premier Inn. Abdirizak was captured on CCTV booking the hotel room, using his driving licence as identification. The judge said: 'I assess you as being responsible for an opportunistic rape which you perpetrated on a little girl of 13 who had been recruited for a sex party at a hotel. Scene: On one occasion, a 13-year-old girl was trafficked across Bristol to a Premier Inn (pictured) by one of the defendants, Said Zakaria, 22, where she was raped four times by three different men . 'When a 13-year-old girl was left bruised and battered by two rapes by another, you took her by force. It was cynical, callous and very nasty. You were merciless. 'You behaved without humanity and with no pity whatsoever.' Abdirashid Abdulahi, 21, was jailed for four years for the rape of a 16-year-old girl, known as Complainant 4. Sakariah Sheikh, 21, was jailed for four years for raping a girl, aged 16 or 17 at the time, known as Complainant 5, and sexual activity with a 13-year-old girl, Complainant 1.","Seven Somali men were members of a gang who abused four schoolgirls .

"An 'unprecedented' clean-up operation has been launched in Alaska after it became swamped by debris from last year's devastating Japanese tsunami. Workers plan to spend 12 days clearing the beach on Montague Island, which is covered in items including balls, buoys, beer crates, Styrofoam and lunch boxes. And they can expect to repeat this process in the future because an estimated 1.5million tons of flotsam and jetsam is yet complete the 3,500-mile journey to Alaska and elsewhere in North America. Cluttered: Tsunami debris washed up on Montague Island, Alaska ahead of a 12-day clean-up mission . Dumped: A fuel canister and a beer crate among the debris on Montague Island, Alaska . Montague, which is the largest uninhabited U.S. island and lies 120 miles southeast of state capital Anchorage, is likely to receive another equally large quantity by the time the year has ended. 'The debris found on initial surveys of the island showed an absolutely unprecedented amount of buoys, Styrofoam and other high floating debris, Patrick Chandler of the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies told Fox News. So far the wreckage floating away from Asia has included only the odd item - including the bizarre find of a Harley-Davidson and a football that was later reunited with its owner back in Japan. But much bigger quantities are set to arrive thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the debris will cross the Pacific Ocean far sooner than previously thought. Mess: A barrel and Styrofoam among the flotsam and jetsam on the island 120 miles from Anchorage . Washed up: A sign, left, and a buoy and fuel can found by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation . Found: A gas bottle that washed up along with other tsunami debris on Montague Island, Alaska . From the air: A view of the island taken from a helicopter . The latest computer models estimate that a vast collection of debris - measuring 4,000 miles across at its longest - will start washing up this October and continue to do so into late 2013. A recent satellite image from NASA's Earth observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean's surface. Around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses, factories, cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck Japan in March last year. While heavy items sank, at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys, oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500-mile journey to North America. Projections made earlier this year by the International Pacific Research Centre (IPRC), in Honolulu, Hawaii, suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between March 2013 and March 2014. On fast tides: The latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris, shown here in a graphic interpretation of a NASA satellite image, from the Japanese tsunami will hit North American shores far sooner than expected . Devastation: The earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck Japan in March last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris, including boats, cars and part of houses and factories into the Pacific . Bizarre find: This Harley-Davidson was found on a remote beach on the west coast of British Columbia last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year . Stunned: The owner of the Harley, Ikuo Yokoyama (left), said the discovery by Peter Mark (right) was a miracle . Debris: Radioactive tuna is not the only casualty of the tsunami to wash up in North America, as this motorbike which found its way from Japan to Canada proves . Journey: The container holding the items travelled 5,000km from Miyagi prefecture in Japan where the Tsunami struck all the way to the coasts of B.C. But predictions from the Japanese government and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has now pushed that date forward to October this year, according to a report in The Guardian. Indeed, many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last November. Last month, a Japanese teenager who lost his home in last year's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote Alaskan beach 3,500 miles from Japan. Misaki Murakami, 16, came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by American radar technician David Baxter on Middleton Island. Mr Baxter, who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing, now plans to travel with his wife Yumi across the Pacific to return the ball. Can I have my ball back, please?! Japanese teenager Misaki Murakami (left) told of his delight after his football was found by David Baxter (right) on an Alaskan beach. Mr Baxter's wife (pictured) also found a volleyball . Drift: The sports balls were found on Middleton Island, about 70 miles from mainland Alaska . And yesterday, the Japanese owner of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the West Coast of British Columbia last week was a miracle. The owner, Ikuo Yokoyama, a 29-year-old resident of the town of Yamamoto, in Miyagi Prefecture, was tracked down by a Harley-Davidson representative in Japan who saw the story, first reported by CBC News, the broadcaster reported today. Peter Mark, was combing the beach on Haida Gwaii islands when he made the discovery. A clearer picture of the debris is not expected to emerge before June or July when two privately-funded expeditions are due to travel into the north Pacific. Poignant: Items from the disaster have also been recovered in Alaska, like this sandal . Debris: Toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the Pacific . Washington state officials, which last week released posters advising residents what may arrive on their beaches, say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be found. Washington, Oregon, British Columbia and Alaska will get much of it, while most of California will be protected by currents pushing objects back out to sea, according to The Guardian. Hawaii, however, is in line for several deposits. The US navy and coastguard will be monitoring the debris over fears it could pose a danger to shipping. But for anyone worried that they may wake one day to a tsunami of trash heading towards them, Jan Hafner, of the IPRC, has these words of reassurances. 'Most people probably think there is a huge pile of debris moving across the ocean like a carpet. But it is very sparse, very patchy.'","Workers to spend 12 days removing debris up beach on Montague island .

"An artificial ear, pictured, that looks and works just like an outer human ear has been built by scientists using a 3D printer and cartilage from sheep . An artificial - and very lifelike - ear has been built by scientists using a 3D printer and cartilage from sheep. The organ was designed by plastic surgeons to make it look as likelike as possible. Researchers from Massachusetts then grew the required number of cartilage cells to fit custom models under the skin of lab rats. Wire was added to the moulds to give the implants their shape and make them bend and flex like human ears. Scientists are now preparing the ear for clinical trials in the hope they could be used in transplant operations. As the technology is customisable, the . scientists claim they could eventually use the process to produce . realistic looking ears for individual patients on a 'rapid timescale.' The ears were built by Thomas Cervantes, from Massachusetts General Hospital, and his colleagues. A 3D digital model was created . and designed with help from a facial plastic surgeon to make sure the . shape and proportions were correct. The . resulting model was printed and cast in polydimethylsiloxane, a special . silicone compound, to create a mould which was then split along the . outer contour, resulting in two pieces. These moulds were filled with cow collagen, the naturally occurring protein that gives skin elasticity and strength. Researchers then harvested ear cartilage cells from sheep. The researchers from Massachusetts worked with a plastic surgeon to create the 3D mould. It was filled with cow collagen while the team grew enough cartilage cells inside rats to replace the collagen in the mould. Wires were then added to help maintain the shape of the ears . Scientists . at Princeton University have created a breakthrough bionic ear that can . 'hear' radio frequencies beyond the range of normal human ears. The researchers used a radical 3D printing technique to create the ear with the electronics of a hearing aid inside it. They . say it is a major step towards creating 'cybermen' such as those seen . in the Terminator films, which combine living cells and electronic . circuits. Earlier this . year, doctors from Cornell University used 3D printing to create a . prosthetic ear using cells of cartilage, similar to the ones created in . Massachusetts. A solid plastic mould was printed and then filled with high-density collagen gel. The researchers then added cartilage cells into the collagen matrix. For . the prototype, they used cells taken from cows, but could in theory use . cells of cartilage from elsewhere in the patient's body. These cells were implanted under the skin of lab rats and the team then spent three months growing enough cartilage inside the rats to replace the cow collagen used in the moulds. The . researchers said that the modelled ear had enough definition in the . curves and lines to be recognisable even once a layer of skin had been . applied to it. 'All the implants were well tolerated,' said Cervantes. 'The implants with wire resembled a human ear, whereas implants without wire were flattened and distorted. 'The surfaces of both were white, glistening and grossly resembled cartilage. 'The constructs with the embedded wire framework had significantly improved size and shape fidelity, compared with those without the framework. The implants were flexible.' The same team previously carried out a proof of concept study on mice using cartilage cells in an ear-shaped collagen mould, but this was only analysed in 2D. The researchers said: 'The technology is now under development for clinical trials, and thus we have scaled up and redesigned the prominent features of the scaffold to match the size of an adult human ear and to preserve the aesthetic appearance after implantation. 'We also employed more rigorous methods to analyse the fidelity of the ear geometry after implantation.' They added: 'These quantitative shape analysis results have identified opportunities to improve shape fidelity of engineered ear constructs.' Each year thousands of children are born with a congenital deformity called microtia, when the external ear is not fully developed. Many have an intact inner ear, but experience hearing loss due to the missing external structure. The findings feature in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. Once the cartilage in the mould had fused and set, researchers put the ear through various stress tests to analyse its flexibility. A layer of skin was also applied to make the ear look more lifelike .","Researchers created the artificial ear by 3D printing a life-like mould .

"The way millions of households are being ripped off by the big energy firms is laid bare today. Figures show customers are being charged at least three times the price their suppliers pay for gas. Wholesale costs have halved in six months yet bills have not fallen. It means customers on British Gas’s one-year fixed-rate tariff are paying an almost four-fold mark-up. Scroll down for video . The way millions of households are being ripped off by the big energy firms is laid bare today . British Gas, which supplies around 40 per cent of homes, and other firms are under fire for their costs at a time when the Competition and Markets Authority is holding an inquiry into the energy supply business. Its parent company, Centrica, announced profits of £900million for the first six months of the financial year. British Gas customers are paying between £1.35 and £1.50 per therm. Yet the wholesale gas price paid by suppliers has hit a four-year low of less than 42p per therm, down from 72p in December. The other Big Six energy companies – nPower, EDF, SSE, E.on and Scottish Power – charge between £1.21 and £1.37 per therm. One therm of gas is enough to power a domestic boiler at full output for almost two hours. Richard Lloyd, of consumer group Which?, said: ‘Energy companies should be passing on any savings from falling wholesale and network costs. ‘It’s no wonder that consumers aren’t confident that the price they pay for their energy is fair, especially when Ofgem has reported that supplier profit margins are set to double. ‘With energy costs the top consumer concern, the competition authority must leave no stone unturned in its investigation of the market and must establish the truth behind our energy prices.’ British Gas, which supplies around 40 per cent of homes, is under fire for its costs, which comes despite an ongoing investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into the energy supply business . He suggested that customers shop around, as small suppliers can be considerably cheaper. For example, Extra Energy is offering a tariff that is almost 25 per cent cheaper than British Gas’s increased rate. Energy suppliers say the wholesale price of gas is only part of the cost of providing their services – and that prices are not cut automatically if it falls. Despite conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, prices have declined sharply because a mild winter left stocks high and fracking has reduced demand for natural gas in the US. Most firms bulk-purchase gas in advance to buffer themselves against sudden changes in the market, so wholesale price falls do not filter through to consumers immediately. Figures show customers are being charged at least three times the price their suppliers pay for gas . British Gas spokesman Tim Cowen said: . ‘The wholesale cost of energy is now less than half the bill, which . partly explains why the wholesale price can fall, but overall prices . don’t. ‘We also have other costs, such as regulated transport and distribution costs, that are rising.' The company says it is offering customers opting for the £1.50 one-year fixed-rate tariff a £50 High Street gift card to mitigate the cost – and adds that users should still see their bills fall because of ‘milder weather and improved energy efficiency measures’. The boss of one of the big six energy companies, nPower, has said Labour’s promise to  freeze energy prices if they win next year’s election is a factor in his company not reducing its prices. But Labour energy spokesman Caroline Flint rejected claims that her party’s pledge is to blame for energy firms keeping bills high. ‘It’s always the same old story – when wholesale prices go up, energy bills go through the roof, but when they fall consumers never see the full benefit,’ she said. The competition inquiry into the energy supply business will report at the end of next year. Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other. Shrewd . consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing . deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest . deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts. If . you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big . chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

Overuse of acronyms, such as LOL, were cited as one of the most common reasons a partner may lose interest, as they make the sender seem overly keen or too needy. Good text etiquette was found to include texting a lover good night, replying to messages within two hours and asking questions to stimulate conversation. While over three quarters of people believe they have good mobile relationship manners, four in ten people have completely misinterpreted a poorly written text - and sarcasm is the most common pitfall. Those in the south west of the UK were found to be the neediest partners when communicating via text and are most likely to send multiple texts before getting a reply. In contrast, the Welsh were the most patient or ‘hard to get’ in the early days of a relationship, leaving it almost a week before getting in touch after a last encounter. Overuse of acronyms such as LOL were cited as one of the most common reasons that a partner may lose interest, as they make the sender seem overly keen or too needy.

"A British couple who survived a horrific machete attack at their Tobago holiday home are suing the Caribbean island's government £2 million for psychological damage. Peter and Murium Green were left in a pool of blood after a man walked into the garden of their Tobago villain August 2009 and savagely hacked at them while they napped. Retired hotelier Peter, 70, was left blind in one eye and suffered permanent brain damage while Murium, 65, was left with a huge permanent scar across her face. Peter and Murium Green are suing the Trinidad and Tobago Government for £1 million compensation each . The couple, from Wellington, Somerset, now say they deserve pay out of £1 million each for the lasting physical and psychological damage they suffered in the murderous assault. They bought their home in Bacolet in the late 1990s and traveled over for two weeks in the sun before Peter began treatment for prostate cancer in August 2009. A man burst into their property and left Peter with a cracked skull, fractured cheekbones, smashed teeth, limited vision after the knife cut out his left cornea, and nerve damage. Murium, who has multiple sclerosis, had both cheekbones and eye sockets smashed, and her jaw detached. Medics said had she not regained consciousness and crawled to get help, the couple could have died. Peter and Murium Green sitting on the patio at their house in Bacolet, Tobago, where they were attacked . The beach at Bacolet near the property where Peter and Murium were savagely attacked while they napped . Peter was put into a medically-induced coma after the attack, had to learn to walk again, and suffers from numbness down the left side of his body. Recalling the horror, he said: 'When I was hit the pain in my head was something I could never parallel with anything else, and as I began to lose vision I had the fear of knowing I was dying. 'You hear about attacks there all the time and people need to know it's a dangerous place. The couple think the government should have done more to warn tourists the resort was 'dangerous' 'The authorities don't like me because I am a constant reminder of what their republic stands for. 'They say I've ruined their tourism industry and had an effect on hoteliers, but people need to know how dangerous this place is.' A 25-year-old local man was arrested but the case against him was dropped in April 2011 due to an apparent lack of evidence. The couple also revealed that while in Tobago they had befriended a German couple called Brigid and Hubertus Keil who were discovered hacked to death in Bacolet Bay on Saturday – not far from the Green's home. Mr Green said: 'The Keils were a delightful couple, we used to go for walks along the beach together and would occasionally go dancing together. 'Apparently someone crept up behind them and attacked them with a machete. When I heard what happened to suddenly made me relive what happened to us. 'When I was hit, the pain in my head was something I could never parallel with anything else, and as I began to lose vision I had the fear of knowing I was dying. 'When I heard what happened to the Keils I relived all that and knew the Keils must have gone through the same fear.' The couple's lawyers are preparing a legal challenge against the Trinidad and Tobago Government for £1 million compensation each, which will begin after they get the results of medical assessments. They claim they have suffered ongoing physical and psychological damage and think the government should have done more to warn tourists the resort was 'dangerous'. Peter and Murium Green on the beach near their villa, before the attack that left them both severely injured . The couple have not returned to their villa since the attack and Peter believes the whole experience has cost his family more than £470,000. He said: 'It might cost us a lot but we're going to do it. We want to bring it to people's attention that these islands are dangerous. 'There have been several other incidents. A Swedish couple were decapitated just west of Bacolet not long before we were attacked. 'It's a beautiful place but they do not tell you your life is in danger if you're going over there - it should carry some sort of health warning like on a cigarette packet.'","Peter and Murium Green were left with horrific injuries from 2009 attack .

"A teenager hanged herself after becoming convinced the world would end in 2012 after researching doomsday scenarios on the internet, an inquest heard. Schoolgirl Isabel Taylor, 16, turned to Buddhism after becoming fed up with the 'complications and injustice' of the modern world. But while searching for answers she began researching doomsday scenarios - becoming convinced a nuclear reactor meltdown would end civilisation in the coming months. Isabel Taylor, 16, hanged herself after becoming convinced the world would end in 2012 . She had researched on the internet how to overdose but was found hanged in her bedroom by her mother. Yesterday her parents Gary, 51, and Ingrid, 48, said in a statement: 'We have questioned and searched our hearts to try to find an answer to why Isabel went down this devastating path. 'She yearned for an uncomplicated and perfect world where every living thing would be valued and at peace. 'But the simple and perfect world she sought, where all living things would be treated with compassion and equality, was never going to materialise. 'Unfortunately the future for her in her eyes must have seemed very bleak. 'Sadly there were too many bad points for her to contend with and the lure to opt out was too compelling. 'We can only conclude that she wasn't prepared to adjust to adulthood with all the complications, injustice and, for her, unhappiness that came with it.' The couple, of Neston, Wiltshire, said Isabel had begun making flippant remarks that the world would end soon. Mr Taylor, a retired civil servant, said: 'We were aware of the 2012 issue. She would mention it around the dinner table. 'We would take it on board and say we didn't think that was going to happen Isabel, and try to make light of it and move conversation onwards. Isabel's parents Gary, 51, and Ingrid, 48, said they believe their daughter was unable to cope with the 'complications and injustice' of adulthood . 'She would flippantly say ""oh but it's all going to end next year anyway"" and we would try and laugh it off. 'She believed something was going to happen that would change the world, I'm not sure whether she ever fully believed that it was going to end, but she definitely thought something was going to happen. 'She read articles on all different types of things which could make the world end, she read about 15 to 20 articles over the course of 2011 with her best friend. 'The most recent one she read was on sun spots and how if they went wrong it could cause a nuclear reaction.' Increasing numbers of websites devoted to 2012 doomsday scenarios have sprung up online, centred on claims the Mayans believed this is the year the world will end. In France a tiny village named Bugarach has seen visits from doomsday devotees, claiming it will survive any apocalypse event. The inquest at Trowbridge Town Hall, Wiltshire, heard how Isabel was concerned about 'injustices' in the world and had converted to Buddhism in Spring 2011. An inquest heard Isabel had been researching doomsday scenarios on the internet, Picture posed by model . The committed vegan had just started studying animal science and management at Wiltshire College and was a passionate animal rights campaigner who ran a guinea pig sanctuary with a friend. Her parents said: 'Isabel was a fully committed vegan and had very strong views on animal welfare especially animal testing, livestock and dairy farming. 'In the spring of 2011 she turned to the Buddhist faith and their teachings to search for answers because she could relate in their beliefs and principles. 'It would seem her belief in Buddhism and the possibility of another, better life was strong enough to persuade her that the time was right to move on to what comes next.' The inquest heard how Mrs Taylor, found her daughter hanged in her room at their home at 3.15pm in September last year, after spending much of the night on the computer. Mr Taylor added: 'We will never understand why she took her life and we will never fully come to terms with it. 'We miss her greatly , it was a tragic incident, she had such a promising career ahead of herself. 'The enormous shock of it remains with us and we will never fully come to terms with it. 'She managed to hide what was going on inside her mind because outwardly the happy, bubbly Isabel we knew and loved so well was what she portrayed to us until the end.' Assistant deputy Wiltshire Coroner Claire Balsyz, recorded a verdict that Isabel had taken her own life while the balance of her mind was disturbed.","Isabel Taylor, 16, thought civilisation would end in 2012 after researching nuclear meltdowns .

"Mahmudul Choudhury, 35, admitted sharing the 'offensive' image of Hitler on his Facebook page . A  teacher has been fined after he admitted posting a picture Hitler on Facebook with the words 'you were right'. Mahmudul Choudhury, 35, from Tower Hamlets, east London, was reported to police for sharing the image by a Jewish student who he had previously added on the social networking site. He pleaded guilty to the racially aggravated offence at an earlier hearing and was told he could face losing his job, as he is still employed as a teacher. The father-of-two shared the photo of Hitler, which is accompanied with the words 'Yes man, you were right... I could have killed all the Jews, but I left some of them to let you know why I was killing them. Share this picture to tell the truth a whole world'. He added the caption: 'Yes now we can see why' #ProtectiveEdge.' Choudhury wore a suit and tie when he appeared at Bromley Magistrates Court yesterday, where he was fined £465. Toyin Odumade, prosecuting said: 'On July 11 of last year Mr Choudhury had posted an image on his Facebook account of Adolf Hitler. 'This Facebook poster was seen at the school where Mr Choudhury worked, this pupil is Jewish and it caused him distress so alerted the police. 'This led to Mr Choudhury being arrested and taken to the police station where he was interviewed. 'In this interviewed he said he had been on Facebook for four years and he kept his Facebook account up to date about what was going on in the world and sometimes posted things of freedom of speech and political stuff but never anything racist. 'He was shown the poster on his Facebook account and he confirmed it was his Facebook profile. He said the poster had been sent to him but he had shared it accidentally. 'When asked about the caption above it he admitted writing it but stated that he posted the image by accident. The Facebook post (pictured) stated: 'Yes man, you were right... I could have killed all the Jews, but I left some of them to let you know why I was killing them. Share this picture to tell the truth a whole world' 'Later in his interview he said he could understand why people could find the image offensive but stated that he didn't want to offend anybody and that is was an accident. 'He was subsequently charged with the offence.' The student who reported him to the police previously attended  Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham College in New Cross, south east London, where Choudhury used to teach. Choudhury, pictured leaving court, admitted sharing the image and was fined almost £500 . Subhankar Banerjee, defending, told the court: 'This is a young man in his mid-30's, a family man of impeccable good character, never been spoken to by the police before who was absolutely adamant he holds no anti-semitic or other extremist views.' Mr Banerjee added that his client took full responsibility for what happened and it is now possible he may lose his job because of it. Jonathan Sacerdoti, Director of Communications at the Campaign Against Antisemitism, said: 'Teachers have a special responsibility in our society and shape the minds of our children. 'Mahmudul Choudhury cannot plead ignorance and has today been spared any meaningful punishment for spreading a hateful message which helps create the climate in which Jews are currently being killed across Europe. 'We commend the police and CPS for pursuing this case with zero tolerance but unreservedly condemn this inexplicably lenient sentence and now expect an investigation into how someone who spread Jew hatred online came to be teaching London's children.' Lead magistrate, Shirley Muckell, told him: 'Obviously reading through this and the letters you're a well thought of person and this is going to put your standing down a lot. 'It's something that, we know you have now given up Facebook, but social media can cause a lot of problems as you found out the hard way. 'We have taken everything into consideration as what has been said and also that you pleaded guilty to this matter at the earliest opportunity.'","Mahmudul Choudhury was reported to police for sharing 'offensive' image .

"Deep underwater in southeast Mexico there is a sign which warns divers that anyone who swims through the underwater caves could face death. But that did not faze underwater photographer Lisa Collins, from Essex, England, who threw herself into the water to capture the scene. This network of flooded caves, known as the Yucatan Cenotes, is one of the world's deadliest diving spots. A diver lays down a lead to guide other divers through the underwater caves in Mexico. The Yucatan Cenotes are regarded as one of the most dangerous diving spots in the world. British photographer Lisa Collins, 48, went underwater to capture the scene . Divers swim through Chac Mool cenote in southeast Mexico. These flooded caves known as the Yucatan Cenotes have taken the lives of many divers . Deep underwater in southeast Mexico there is a sign which warns divers that anyone who swims though the underwater caves could face death. Pictured here are the green waters of the Kukulucan cenote, captured by photographer Lisa Collins . The underwater caverns were created when sections of land collapsed on the Yucatan Peninsula, creating sinkholes called cenotes. At one time, the caves were used by the Mayans for human sacrifices. The cave of Las Calaveras, which means skull in Spanish, holds the remains of more than 125 skeletons. Since the 1980s, fewer than half of the estimated 6,000 caves on the peninsula have been explored and mapped by divers. Many of those who have ventured into the 2,400 caves have died in the process. Divers who have perished include a Canadian who lost his life in the Cenote Kalimba in February 2013 and a Brazilian husband-and-wife team and their Spanish guide who died in one called Chac Mool in April 2012. Mrs Collins, 48, described visiting the area as like being in 'outer space'. She said: 'There is no sense of being in water because there are no currents. A Virgin Mary shrine has been put up in the Chac Mool cenote to remember the many divers who have lost their lives in the caves . A diver swims through the crevices in Chac Mool. There are 6,000 caves in the area - fewer than half have been discovered and mapped . 'In the sea, or on lakes, you can feel the water moving around you, but in a cave it is completely still.' The expert diver said that the most important skill when swimming in the cave is to remain calm. She said: 'You can lose track of which direction is up and which is down, so it is very disorienting.' Mrs Collins described the moment she squeezed through a tiny space when entering the Chac Mool. Some of the caves were roped off  - with a written warning of the dangers of diving in them. 'Seeing the sign with the grim reaper on it made me realise how dangerous an environment I was in,' she said. 'Divers have made a little underwater shrine to the Virgin Mary. It wishes divers good luck and is a shrine to the people who have died in the cave. 'I am not religious but it was very touching to see that.' A diver in the orange coloured water of Aktun Ha cenote. Another cave explored by Mrs Collins contained a mysterious sulphur cloud which blocked all daylight. The cave is called Angelita - nicknamed 'The Nightmare' by divers . In the deepest parts of the water there are bat bones, tree stumps and roots. Mrs Collins said it would be dangerous to dive too deep - in case the swimmer became tangled in vegetation . Another cave explored by Mrs Collins was plunged into complete darkness because it contained a mysterious sulphur cloud which blocked all daylight. The cloud is caused by a build-up of sulphur and hydrogen which separates freshwater in the upper part of the cave from saltwater. In the deepest parts of the water, there are bat bones, tree stumps and roots. Mrs Collins said it would be dangerous to dive too deep - in case the swimmer became tangled in vegetation. To get into The Angelita cave - nicknamed The Nightmare - divers have to swim through the cloud. Mrs Collins said: 'When you first float above the cloud you do not want to go into it as you don't know what's beneath. 'Below the cloud you can't really see anything. We had torches but the light didn't penetrate very far. It was very eerie and spooky.' Divers at the entrance of the Chac Mool cenote.

"Marcello A. Canuto, director of Tulane's Middle American Research Institute, examines hieroglyphics at the La Corona dig site in Guatemala . Archaeologists have found carvings in a stone staircase at the La Corona dig site in Guatemala which confirm the ‘end date’ of the Maya calendar, December 21, 2012. It is only the second known inscription which confirms this 'end date'.

Most of the inscription, carved into a stone abandoned by looters, deals with political history - but there is a reference to 'the end' in a passage about a king's return. ‘This was a time of great political . turmoil in the Maya region and this king felt compelled to allude to a . larger cycle of time that happens to end in 2012,’ says David Stuart of the University of Texas at Austin, who led a dig at the site. But many ethnic Mayans dismiss the apocalyptic predictions as largely a Western idea. Rather than the end of time itself, the inscriptions refer to the start of a new era. The 'apocalypse' refers to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C. 'The story started with claims that . Nibiru, a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians, is headed toward . Earth,' says Nasa, 'These fables were linked to the end of one of the . cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012.' ‘This text talks about ancient political history rather than prophecy,’ says Marcello A. Canuto, dco-director of the excavations at La Corona. A newly discovered Mayan tablet reveals the 'end date' for the Mayan Calendar - it's only the second artifact to specify the date . The carved blocks were found at the La Corona dig site in Guatemala . The hieroglyphics were found on blocks abandoned by looters at the La Corona dig site . Since 2008, Canuto and Tomás Barrientos of the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala have directed excavations at La Corona, a site previously ravaged by looters. ‘Last year, we realized that looters of a particular building had discarded some carved stones because they were too eroded to sell on the antiquities black market,’ said Barrientos, ‘so we knew they found something important, but we also thought they might have missed something.’ The find has been described as the most significant hieroglyphic discovery in decades . Marcello A. Canuto, director of Tulane's Middle American Research Institute, examines hieroglyphics at the La Corona dig site in Guatemala . Inscriptions on Mayan tablets found in . temples such as Tortuguero refer to 'the end' - and many internet . conspiracy theories have predicted our world will be swallowed by a . black hole, hit by an asteroid or devoured by ancient gods. Cults have gathered in the tiny French village called Bugarach where they hope to survive the apocalypse. Hundreds of books have been published on the subject since the Seventies, predicting Earth's demise at the hands of a mysterious planet Nibiru, or a black hole. 'The story started with claims that Nibiru, a supposed planet discovered by the Sumerians, is headed toward Earth,' says Nasa, 'These fables were linked to the end of one of the cycles in the ancient Mayan calendar at the winter solstice in 2012.' But many ethnic Mayans dismiss the apocalyptic predictions as largely a Western idea. Rather than the end of time itself, the inscriptions refer to the start of a new era. The 'apocalypse' refers to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C. What Canuto and Barrientos found was the . longest text ever discovered in Guatemala. Carved on staircase steps, . it records 200 years of La Corona history, states David Stuart, director . of the Mesoamerica Center at The University of Texas at Austin, who was . part of a 1997 expedition that first explored the site. Most of the inscription, carved into a . stone abandoned by looters, deals with political history - but there is a . reference to 'the end' in a passage about a king's return. While deciphering these new finds in May, Stuart recognized the 2012 reference on a stairway block bearing 56 delicately carved hieroglyphs. It commemorated a royal visit to La Corona in AD 696 by the most powerful Maya ruler of that time, Yuknoom Yich'aak K'ahk' of Calakmul, only a few months after his defeat by long-standing rival Tikal in AD 695. Thought by scholars to have been killed in this battle, this ruler was visiting allies and allaying their fears after his defeat. ‘This was a time of great political turmoil in the Maya region and this king felt compelled to allude to a larger cycle of time that happens to end in 2012,’ says Stuart. So, rather than prophesy, the 2012 reference places this king's troubled reign and accomplishments into a larger cosmological framework. ‘In times of crisis, the ancient Maya used their calendar to promote continuity and stability rather than predict apocalypse,’ says Canuto.

"Anne McQuilter, 41, was jailed for seven years for the attack on PC Steven McCrone . A grandmother battered a policeman with his own truncheon, breaking his jaw, during a brawl at a family christening, a court heard. Anne McQuilter was jailed for seven years for smashing the officer in the face with the baton, as he tried to break-up the alcohol fueled punch-up. The mother-of-two launched the violent attack on police constable Steven McCrone after he dropped his truncheon during the fracas in Redcar, Teesside. The 41-year-old later blamed the officer for his injuries, telling a probation worker, 'it was his own fault.' Blonde-haired McQuilter was found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent on October 12, 2012, after a trial. 'The report makes it clear you think you had a right to do what you did,' said recorder David Dixon, as he jailed her at Teesside Crown Court. 'You did not. He was doing his job.' Three co-defendants David Brotton, 32, Samantha Cooper, 25, and Paul Smith, 32, pleaded guilty to other charges arising from the disorder. The court heard that Brotton and Cooper had  christened their child earlier in the day, and ended up in the Stockton public house at around 11pm on October 21, 2012. Smith was said to have started the trouble when he made lewd comments to a woman - which he described as 'flirting banter'. Drinkers fled the pub as fighting erupted outside, which included Smith being grabbed by the throat and pinned against a wall by McQuilter's daughter. When the officers arrived on the scene, Brotton repeatedly charged at PC McCrone 'like an animal', said the judge, and struggled as he was detained. Brotton, who admitted a charge of affray, suffered a serious head injury which needed stitches in hospital. Cooper, who pleaded guilty to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, claimed she was involved on the fringes of the trouble. Smith, who also admitted using threatening or abusive words or behaviour, told the court that he was sorry for being the 'catalyst'. It was said on behalf of McQuilter,of Castle Road, Redcar, that prison would cause severe problems for her family, who describe her as their 'lynchpin'. 'Her family are now the victims of her actions,' said Paul Abrahams, defending MCQuilter. 'They will be punished as a consequence and it is that, really, that is going to hurt her more.' Recorder David Dixon sitting at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) said there seemed to be 'two sides' to McQuilter as he jailed her for seven years. The court heard how the grandmother-of-two has convictions for affray in 2004, and violence in 2009, and cautions for threatening behaviour in 2000, and assault in 2008. Mr Recorder Dixon told her: 'There seems to be two sides to you. I have seen plenty of references which describe you in glowing terms, matriarchal to the family, someone you can go to with any problem, and someone who works extremely hard. 'But when in drink, someone who loses their temper and someone who can behave in an appalling fashion.' Brotton of Lime Road, Redcar, was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months with a three-month curfew and 180 hours' unpaid work; Cooper, also of Lime Road, Redcar was fined £250; and Smith of West Dyke Road, Redcar, was ordered to do 150 hours' unpaid work as part of a 12-month community order. Investigating officer, Detective Sergeant Dave Smith, said: 'This is an example of the violence that officers can be faced with on a day-to-day basis whilst carrying out their duties in protecting the public. 'Anne McQuilter will now have to serve a lengthy prison sentence as a consequence of her violent behaviour after she fractured an officer's cheekbone by hitting him with a police baton. 'We hope that the sentence sends out a clear message to those who act without any thought whilst under the influence of alcohol.'","Anne McQuilter was jailed for seven years for the violent baton attack .

"A  man apparently upset about US immigration policy was shot and killed by an Austin police officer early Friday morning after firing more than 100 rounds at multiple buildings downtown, including the city's police headquarters and the Mexican Consulate. Assistant Chief Raul Munguia says nobody else was hurt. The identity of the shooter has not been released pending the notification of his family. Authorities received multiple 911 calls between 2.22am and 2.32am about shots fired at buildings downtown. Munguia said bullets struck police headquarters along 8th Street and the Interstate 35 frontage road, a Mexican Consulate and a federal courthouse. Scroll down for videos . Pre-dawn shooting: A gunman opened fire on three buildings in downtown Austin overnight . Doors filled with broken glass are photographed after authorities shot and killed a man who they say opened fire on the Mexican Consulate . Response: A large number of officers converged on the downtown area after getting calls about shots fired . Gunned down: An officer fatally shot the unnamed suspect. This image shows what appears to be cops dragging the man's body away from his van . Threat: Police called in a bomb squad after spotting suspicious devices inside the white van . Tragedy thwarted: All the targeted buildings were closed overnight and no one was injured . During a press conference at 10am Eastern time, Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo described the shooter as a white male, about 50 years of age, from Austin, Texas. Heroic: Sgt Adam Johnson, a 15-year veteran of the department, has been identified as the cop who shot the suspect . He revealed that the officer who shot the suspect, 15-year veteran Sgt Adam Johnson, was outside with a pair of police horses from the Mounted Patrol when he spotted the armed man, who was wearing 'some type of vest' resembling a suicide vest often used by terrorists. According to Chief Acevedo, the sergeant fired a single shot at the suspect with one hand while holding the horses by the reins with the other. However, police are not sure at this time whether it was the cop's bullet that ended the suspect's life, or whether he committed suicide. No was else was hurt in the incident. 'Police are the last line of defense against homegrown threats,' the police chief stated, adding that the attack may have been over US immigration policy. 'When you look at the national debate right now about immigration, that ... comes to mind. Sometimes our political discourse becomes very heated and sometimes very angry,' Acevedo told reporters. President Barack Obama this month imposed the most sweeping immigration changes in a generation, easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7million illegal immigrants. The suspect's white van was parked in an area near police headquarters, the Mexican Consulate and a federal courthouse. Responding officers dragged the mortally wounded man from his car, but backed away and called the bomb squad after noticing the vest on him and suspicious-looking cylinders inside the van. KEYE-TV later reported that the metal cylinders were propane tanks the suspect had used to start a small fire at the Mexican Consulate, which was quickly extinguished. In a statement, the Mexican Foreign Ministry expressed its 'deep concern and condemnation of the incident.' Active scene: Police tape marks off the scene after authorities shot and killed a man who they say opened fire on the Mexican Consulate, police headquarters and other downtown buildings early Friday . Evidence: Propane tanks the suspect had used to start a fire at the consulate are seen scattered on the ground at the crime scene . Update: Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo gives a press conference on the shooting Friday morning . Acevedo said during the press conference that it was determined this morning that the gunman did not have any explosives on his person or in his vehicle. Eyewitness Jesse Van Wallene told NBC News he was about 15 feet away from the suspect when he stopped at a red light and saw a large gun in his hands. Wallene described the suspect as wearing a bullet-proof vest and a helmet with a clear visor. None of the tactical gear had any markers on it, which convinced the witness that the man in front of him was not a member of law enforcement. Moments later, Wallene said the gunman opened fired on a building opposite the police HQ. 'He was firing in bursts of about five shots,' the 29-year-old waiter said. 'He didn't even seem to acknowledge we were there, he just seemed very focused on firing at the building, which had no lights on inside.' A robot was used to remove the objects from the vehicle, which police suspect may have been IEDs . Emergency: The shooting led to the evacuation of the police HQ in the Texas capital and the closure of several roads in the downtown section of the city . Shutdown: Police closed I-35 for hours in both directions after the shooting . Chief Art Acevedo revealed during the Friday morning news conference that the slain perpetrator had a criminal record, but he would not elaborate on it. The shooting led to the evacuation of the police HQ in the Texas state capital and the closure of several roads in the downtown section of the city.

"If you're worried about what your lifestyle may be doing to your health, then a new - albeit very morbid gadget - gadget claims to help. A Swedish inventor has designed a watch that apparently calculates a person's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die. Dubbed the 'death watch', Tikker was created by Fredrik Colting. Scroll down for video . Dubbed the 'death watch', the Tikker apparently calculates a person's life expectancy - and even counts down to the time they will die. The top row of the watch's digital display shows years, months and days, while the second row counts down hours, minutes and seconds.The bottom row shows the local time . But far from being morbid, Mr Colting calls it 'The Happiness Watch' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left. To set up Tikker, the wearer fills out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history, including allergies or illnesses. They are also asked whether they drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer, diabetes and other diseases in their family. Wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do, as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score. Their age is deducted from the results to predict a death date and the Tikker - which also works as a regular watch - begins the countdown. Now, after a crowdfunding campaign, the gadget is available to buy online £49.99. Despite the original target being $25,000, a total of $98,665 was eventually raised.

"Tired of writing with traditional pen and paper? Then you'll want to pay attention to Lix's device. Their 3D printing pen enables you to write and draw in the air by melting plastic. This means at the touch of a button you can create freestanding objects in a matter of seconds. Scroll down for video . London-based Lix are currently seeking fundraising for their pen on Kickstarter. It is by no means the first 3D-printing pen, but it is the first to actually resemble the shape and size of a regular pen. Essentially, . LIX 3D printing pen functions similarly to 3D printers. It quickly . melts and cools coloured plastic, letting you create rigid and . freestanding structures. It can be plugged into any standard USB port. The plastic is then fed into the pen. Structures can be formed in any shape. They can also be joined together after they've been drawn, letting you create large objects. What’s more, it can be powered by standard USB ports, so a person can simply plug it into their laptop. The pen is 6.45in (16.3 cm) long, 0.55in (1.4 cm) in diameter and weighs 34.9 grams. It is made of aluminium and comes in black or grey. Inside the pen it heats plastic to 150°C (300°F), which is then pushed out through the nib as a hot liquid at the touch of a button. The plastic used is a plant-based filament, although it can also use stronger forms of plastic. When the liquid is exposed to air it solidifies into shapes. You can’t move too quickly though, as the filament needs time to cool, but you can still make objects in a matter of seconds. Each rod of plastic that you feed in is about 4in (10 cm) long and lasts for about two minutes of drawing in the air. After this, the pen needs to be refilled. The pen has a whole range of uses, from writing text to fine art to T-shirt designs, and is apparently only limited by your ability to hold it steadily. It will retail for £85 ($139.95) when it goes on sale in September. Lix's product is the first 3D printing device that resembles the size, shape and weight of a regular ballpoint pen.

"While most expectant moms fret over decorating the nursery in the weeks leading up to their baby's delivery, Sharon Savino had a more pressing matter on her mind - the egg-sized tumor growing in her heart. The 26-year-old Long Island, New York resident noticed something was wrong when she developed a cough before Christmas. When she coughed up blood, she went to the emergency room near her home and doctors first diagnosed her with bronchitis - saying they didn't know what caused the blood. But when the bleeding happened again, she went to an obstetrician who found the dangerous egg-sized tumor. Risky procedure: Sharon Savino was 27 weeks pregnant when she underwent open-heart surgery to remove an egg-sized tumor. Pictured above with newborn son Maximus . Signs: Savino, of Long Island, New York, noticed something was wrong when she started coughing up blood around Christmas . While the tumor was not malignant, because of its size it had the potential to cause organ damage, a stroke or even sudden death. So doctors at Stony Brook University Hospital had a choice: either perform open heart surgery while Savino was still carrying the child, or perform a c-section pre-term and wait for the mom to heal before addressing the tumor. In the end, doctors decided that the situation was too risky and on January 17, at 27 weeks pregnant, Savino underwent open-heart surgery. The dangers with performing open-heart surgery on a pregnant woman is that the heart-lung bypass machine can impair blood flow to the fetus. The stress of the surgery can also cause the patient to go into premature labor. Operating on a pregnant woman is so rare, doctors only found 17 other cases. While patients usually spend about 45 minutes on the hearty-lung machine and about 25 to 30 minutes with their heart stopped during surgery, they cut those times in half for Savino and her unborn baby. 'For Sharon, we were able to reduce that to 18 minutes on the machine with her heart arrested for only 12 minutes,' Dr James Taylor told the New York Daily News. Tayor says Savino was a model patient who kept stress under control throughout the process. She says the weight of the surgery didn't hit her until she was just about to go into the operating room. 'Then it hit me, and I started crying. My mom was there, she started crying. I guess it wasn't real to me before then,' she said. Doctors at Stony Brook University Hospital decided the tumor was too dangerous to wait until after Savino's c-section so they operated while she was pregnant . Healthy boy: Savino gave birth to her son on April 2. Pictured above with partner Russell Daniels . The surgery went off without a hitch and Ms Savino remained in the hospital for a week after surgery while she was monitored for signs of preterm labor. She spent the remaining two months at home before giving birth to baby Maximus on April 2. Savino and partner Russell Daniels, 27, now have three children together including Maximus' older brother and sister Russell, 4, and Shallyssa, 2. 'I thought, ""I can't believe I made it,""' Savino said. 'He's healthy, and I'm still going.'","Sharon Savino sought medical attention after she started coughing up blood around Christmas this year .

"A shocked underwater photographer got the shot of a lifetime when a shark swam right up to her and posed in front of her camera.

Mr Kiefer, 45, works as a fitness photographer but regularly enjoys deep sea dives with his camera. He was diving with friends off the coast of Tiger Bay when the encounter took place. He explained how one of the tiger sharks that was swimming nearby came over to the group of divers to find out what they were up to. 'When I dive I'm not scared at any point, but always respectful of them', he explained. 'I choose to only dive with prepared and knowledgeable operators and peers and all precautions are taken to maximise safety.' Getting up close and personal: The divers said there were not scared at any point but were always respectful of the sharks . No sudden movements: The divers all had to stay very calm when the shark in the pictures was getting close . A different way of communicating: The curious creatures often bump objects with their heads and inspect them with their mouths . Ken continued: 'When the shark in the pictures was getting close we all just stayed calm. 'They are very curious and do not have hands to explore, so there is always a possibility that they might bump and inspect you with their mouths, which is exactly what this one did. 'We used our cameras to prevent the sharks from bumping us with their head.' 'Tiger sharks are extremely curious creatures', he explained.

"Historical evidence of how plucky British army officers rescued Hitler’s original ‘People’s Car’ and transformed it into the legendary Volkswagen Beetle goes under the hammer next week.

Instructions: Scale drawings clearly show the outline of the famous Type 1 Beetle and explain how to build one .

The documents were discovered originally by the British army officers in 1945 in the ruins of the Volkswagen factory in North Germany that had switched from pre-war car production to wartime military vehicles and even parts for the infamous  V1 rockets or ‘Doodlebugs’ which rained down on Southern England. The British officers and their team brought back to life what Hitler called his ‘Kraft durch Freude’ (KdF’) – or ‘Strength Through Joy’ – car in a town which carried the same name. But they gave it back its original name – Volkswagen or ‘People’s Car ‘– and renamed the town Wolfsburg after the local castle. After defusing an Allied bomb that had been dropped on the car plant in Wolfsburg, Colonel Charles Radclyffe and Major Ivan Hirst found the blueprints for Hitler's pre-war 'Peoples Car.' From them, they restarted car production of the car designed for Hitler by Dr Ferdinand Porsche – who founded the Porsche car dynasty -  with an order for 20,000 Type 1 Beetles for the British army and in doing so helped get Germany working again after the war. Since then 21 million Volkswagen Beetles   have produced and its success was one of the major building blocks of today’s mighty German motor industry. One careful owner: Colonel Charles Radclyffe's personal VW . How-to-guide: Blueprints were made into two books each containing 18 tabbed sections which will be auctioned by Bonhams on December 3 . It comes as Volkswagen this week launches a new generation version of the Beetle Cabriolet at the los Angeles Motor Show in the USA. The blueprints are believed to be copies as the originals were destroyed by Allied bombing during the war. They were made into two folios each containing 18 tabbed sections and were used by Col. Radclyffe. They are now being sold at auction in Surrey with a guide price of £3,000 to  £4,000 pounds. The scale drawings clearly show the outline of the famous car and tell the reader how to build a Beetle. Various sections include the drawings for major components of the Type 1 car, including the engine, fuel pump, carburettor, gear box, steering gear and body. The British Beetle  adventure had begun when Colonel Radclyffe, who was looking for a workshop that could carry out repairs to Allied tanks and transport, sent Major Hirst of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) to check out the stricken factory and ‘take charge.’ Amongst the debris the British found some  Beetle parts. Hirst decided to make the car in the factory and use it as much-needed transport for the occupying Allies. He had the car painted army green and sent it to his commanding officers. Shortly afterwards he received an order for 20,000 more cars. Big order: British Army order for 20,000 Beetles in 1945. Raw materials were, however, in short supply due to the war and by 1946 the British army had produced 1,000 Volkswagens . Out with the old, in with the new: The new VW Beetle on display at Geneva Motor Show. But is it as popular? They even lashed up a one-off cabriolet version which they dubbed the ‘Radclyffe Roadster’ in honour of the colonel. And by March 1946 the British army had produced its 1,000th Volkswagen. In May, 1949, the ‘Volkswagenwerk’ was formed and five months later the factory was officially handed back to the Germans. A road close to the Volkswagen factory is now named after Major Hirst in appreciation of the work he did to save the Volkswagen factory. The blueprints are being offered for sale by a private collector from the UK. A Bonhams spokesman said: ‘Colonel Charles Radclyffe, along with Major Ivan Hirst and Colonel Michael McEvoy were deployed by the British Military to commandeer and oversee operations at the Volkswagenwerk KdF factory in Wolsfsburg after the end of World War II. According to information supplied by the vendor they discovered these copies of blueprints for the car, the originals believed to have been destroyed by Allied bombing of the factory, and Hirst, Radclyffe and McEvoy each owned one set of the blueprint copies, Radclyffe's set being offered here along with another unnamed set. ‘ . He added: ‘Major Hirst is credited by motor historians and enthusiasts as being instrumental in reviving the post-War production of the car that become known as the 'Beetle', which may never have happened if it wasn't for the discovery of these blueprints.’ Toby Wilson, head of the automobilia department at auctioneers Bonhams, said: ‘British influence on the industry in Germany immediately after the way cannot be underestimated. ‘The Beetle is iconic. Like the Mini Cooper it came through the age of austerity and came out the other side still going strong. ‘These blueprints are a reminder of the huge British influence in making the German motor industry the might that it is today.’","Russian and American armies first came across VW factory but ignored blueprints .

"Hollywood’s golden age of silent film has largely gone forever. The vast majority of feature-length silent movies made in the U.S. over the past 100 years have been lost due to decay and neglect, according to a new study that will horrify cinema lovers. In the first comprehensive survey of silent films, the Library of Congress in Washington discovered that not a trace remains of three quarters of the films that were made. A film still from Beyond the Rocks with actors Rudolph Valentino (right) and Gloria Swanson made in 1922. It was found after 75 years but sadly thousands of other silent movies remain lost . Of the nearly 11,000 feature films made between 1912 and 1930, only 14 percent still exist in their original format. A further 11 percent of the films only exist as lower-quality formats or foreign versions. The casualties include some of the most memorable films of the era. Notable movies now considered lost include 'Cleopatra' from 1917, 'The Great Gatsby' from 1926, Lon Chaney’s 'London After Midnight' from 1927, and 'The Patriot' from 1928. The losses were partly attributed to the fact that the nitrate film stock was very vulnerable to fire and deterioration. But the study also blamed the movie industry’s tendency – with the honourable exception of the MGM studio - to neglect or simply destroy prints and negatives. A return: Oscar-winning film The Artist with Jean Dujardin as George and Berenice Bejo as Peppy . Cinema-going was the most popular form of entertainment in the 1920s, before either network radio or television. In the US alone, a country of 116 million people notched up average cinema admissions of 46 million a week. As movingly portrayed in the 2011 Oscar-winning silent film The Artist, this soundless era and its stars were swept aside by the arrival of the 'talkies' – movies with sound. Historian and archivist David Pierce, who conducted the study for the library, said few other defunct art forms have the resonance of silent films. 'It’s a lost style of storytelling, and the best of the films are as effective with audiences today as they were when they were initially released,' he said. Films featuring early stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Mary Pickford still exist . 'When you take away dialogue from a narrative story, it actually puts quite a challenge upon the creative people involved to tell the story entirely in a visual fashion. And it’s that limitation which makes the films so effective.' Films featuring early stars such as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Mary Pickford still exist. Archives such as the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Library of Congress have been preserving early films for decades. But for every classic film that survives, the study notes, half a dozen have been lost. Conservationists hope foreign archives and private collections might be able to help identify other remaining films that can be saved. Librarian of Congress James Billington said America had lost much of the creative record from an era that brought its films to the heights of cinematic achievement. 'The loss of American silent-era feature films constitutes an alarming and irretrievable loss to our nation’s cultural record,' he said.","Not a trace remains of three quarters of the films that were made .

"Brigadier Rupert Jones, son of Falklands hero Colonel 'H' Jones, will take command of Britain's 9,000 troops in Afghanistan . THE son of Falklands war hero Colonel ‘H’ Jones is to take command of Britain’s 9,000 troops in Afghanistan. Brigadier Rupert Jones was 13 when his father died during a one-man charge on an Argentine trench in the Battle of Goose Green in 1982, for which he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Now 42, he will be in charge of 1 Mechanized Brigade when he arrives in Helmand province in April. The job comes at a difficult time as Taliban insurgents are expected to intensify attacks on British forces who are preparing to leave the country by the end of 2014. The enduring reputation of his father will increase scrutiny of Brigadier Jones’s handling of the dangerous region. But he has said previously: ‘I have always said if I wanted to avoid  the connection I should have become a bank manager.’ Colonel Jones was also 42 when he was cut down by enemy fire while commanding 2 Battalion, The Parachute Regiment. His valour helped inspire his troops to victory in the offensive on the Argentine stronghold.His son joined the Army eight years later but he has insisted he always knew he was going to sign up. ‘I was shaped by my father while he was alive. ‘I was always going to join the Army and I don’t even remember making the decision to join – it  was always going to happen,’ he once said. He trained at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst before serving with his father’s former regiment, the Devonshire and Dorsets. It was merged to form part of the Rifles in 2007 and Jones was given command of the 4th battalion. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said Brigadier Jones – who was appointed an MBE in the Queen’s Birthday Honours in 2001 – had a tough job to do but was considered a ‘rising star’. ‘The Taliban will make real hay  to try to say they have defeated  the British and driven them out,  so they will be increasing their attacks,’ he said. Colonel 'H' Jones name on the 2 Para memorial at Goose Green in the Falklands . A soldier pays his respects at the grave of Colonel 'H' Jones . ‘The focus of these attacks will be on coalition troops, not Afghan troops. Brigadier Jones and his troops will have a fight on their hands. He is a rising star of the Army. He is a chip off the old block and is a very effective combat commander.’ Military insiders said that Brigadier Jones commanded loyalty  with his combination of ‘exemplary’ military skills and ‘compassionate’ nature. In February 2010 he launched  the Care for Casualties appeal on behalf of the Rifles. At the time, he said: ‘This week  I will bury three of my riflemen – men too young to die. Colonel 'H' Jones who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross after he died during a one-man charge in the Battle of Goose Green in 1982 . Argentinian soldiers captured at the Battle of Goose Green being guarded by a Royal Marine. Colonel 'H' Jones was killed during the battle . ‘Only yesterday I sat with one of my young riflemen who lost both legs and an arm. His focus is not on what he has lost but what he has.’  Marion Keogh met Jones when  her son Tom’s body was brought back to Wootton Bassett, Wiltshire, after he was killed in Afghanistan in 2010. She described him as ‘eloquent and very nice’, adding: ‘He was a really charming, humane man. ‘I appreciate he took time to speak to us at Tom’s funeral and he was very kind.’ Colonel ‘H’ Jones’s elder son, David, also joined the Army but later became a businessman. His widow, Sara, 71, was appointed a CBE for her services to forces charities. Last night she said: ‘One is proud of one’s son.’ She declined to comment further except to say Rupert ‘just wants to get on with his job’.

"France's President Francois Hollande became the first major Western leader to visit an Ebola-affected region since the outbreak began - but with the aid of a horde of bodyguards. Hollande, who was greeted on his arrival to Guinea by President Alpha Conde, pledged that France would set an example by providing aid to countries stricken by the disease. He is the first Western leader to visit one of the three worst affected west African countries - Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. French President Francois Hollande accompanied by Guinean President Alpha Conde greets medical staff as he arrives at the Donka hospital in Conakry, Guinea today in a seven-hour stop on his way to Dakar, Senegal . President Hollande, who is the first Western head of state to visit one of the west African countries worst hit by Ebola, visits the French Pasteur institute laboratory at Donka hospital in the country's capital, Conakry . More than 5,700 people have been killed in the worst known outbreak of Ebola in history. In Guinea, 1,260 people have died from Ebola out of 2,134 cases of infection. He told his hosts 'we are together with you in the struggle' and 'we have a duty to support you' ahead of a visit to an Ebola hospital. Speaking to reporters at Conakry airport, he said: 'France wants to set an example. Beyond material help, it is human help which is the most important.' He added he he had come to 'deliver a message of hope.' He will travel to neighbouring Senegal later for a summit of French-speaking nations in Dakar. The French president washes his hands before he enters Donka hospital in Conakry. Mr Hollande earlier told reporters 'France wants to set an example. Beyond material help, it is human help which is most important' President Hollande smiles while medical staff at Donka hospital prepare to take his temperature on his arrival. He earlier told his Guinea hosts 'we are together with you in the struggle' and 'we have a duty to support you' President Hollande gets his temperature taken by the waiting medical staff. A total of 1,260 people have died from Ebola out of 2,134 cases of infection in the west African country which was stricken with the disease . Guinea's President Alpha Omar Conde also has his temperature measured upon his arrival  at Donka Hospital . He promised that during the conference in the Senegalese capital, he will call for an international mobilisation' against the disease. France has pledged 100 million euros ($125 million) as a contribution to the fight against Ebola, focusing its efforts on Guinea, its former colony. The money is to be used to help with financing several care centres as well as 200 beds, some of which are reserved for health workers caring for the sick. President Hollande, left, meets with Fanta Camara, right, who represents the association of Ebola survivors . France has also pledged to set up two training centres for health workers, one in France and one in Guinea. In addition, French biotechnology companies will set up rapid diagnostic tests in Africa. Other Western nations are also ramping up their support. Hollande, pictured left, reviews the honour guard,  in Guinea, where he said he came to deliver a 'message of hope' The US is deploying up to 3,000 troops, mostly in Liberia, while Britain has sent military staff to build treatments centres in Sierra Leone. Locals cheer towards the motorcade carrying President Hollande through Guinea's capital, Conakry . President Conde said the arrival of French president Hollande, whose cavalcade through Conakry brought out locals to cheer him (pictured), was 'a very, very important sign ... it means everyone can come to Guinea' President Conde said Hollande's visit sent an important message. 'For the people of Guinea, the arrival of President Hollande is a very, very important sign. 'If the president of a country as important as France can come to Guinea, that means everyone can come to Guinea.' Conde's government has made some progress in controlling the outbreak. However, aid workers have said that local resistance to help is hampering efforts to curb the spread in rural areas. Guinea will be the focus of trials by British-funded researchers on a 15-minute Ebola test, the Wellcome Trust and UK government announced today.","Hollande visited Guinea where more than 1,200 have died from Ebola .

"A great white shark with razor-sharp teeth continues to close in on Britain, tracking technology can reveal. The deadly predator – named Lydia – is just 780 miles (1,255km) off the coast of Cornwall and Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean. The 14.5ft (4.5metres), 2,000lb (907kg) fish has also become the first tagged great white shark to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, as it journeys closer to the UK and Republic of Ireland. Scroll down for video . Closing in: Lydia the great white shark has swum 248 miles in the past 72 hours and is currently less than 800 miles away from Britain (marked). It is not understood why she is moving in such a northerly direction . Last week it was predicted that the shark would arrive in British waters today, but Lydia took a detour which has also makes her the most northerly tagged great white shark ever tracked too. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a ridge found along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates. It forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate in the North Atlantic, and the African Plate from the South American Plate in the South Atlantic. She was tagged as part of the Ocearch project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements. Lydia’s progress can be followed on the project’s website. Scientists have been following the ferocious fish for over a year as part of a ground-breaking ocean life study. Lydia has swum 248 miles (400km) in the last 72 hours and is currently less than 800 miles (1,288km) away from Britain. Record breaker: The deadly predator has also  become the first tagged shark of its species to cross the Mid Atlantic Ridge, an enormous underwater mountain range under the ocean . Deadly cargo: Tagging the shark (pictured) was a feat in itself, with heavy machinery used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device . She has become the first tagged great white to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates - on the morning of March 9. Great whites are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, . New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the . Gulf coast and Hawaii. Shark biologist Ian Fergusson tweeted: ‘WhiteShark Lydia pinged in on the other side of MidAtlanticRidge! Welcome to the history books, #Lydia,’ while Chris Fischer, who is involved in the project, tweeted: '#Lydia turns E toward #UK continuing first doc Trans/Atl migration n hist!’ She has covered more than 19,400 miles since a tracking device was fitted to her near Florida as part of the Ocearch scientific project and can reach speeds of 35mph. Scientists said they are shocked by her recent dash towards Europe. It is impossible to predict which way Lydia will travel, but she is currently pointing in the direction of Ireland and the UK, having journeyed further north. Lydia has become the first tagged great white to cross the Mid Atlantic Ridge (pictured) - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American Plates - at around 10am on March 9 . ‘I have no idea what to expect from her next. I've been working with sharks for a very long time now and I have never seen anything like this,’ said Dr Gregory Skomal, 52, senior fisheries biologist with Massachusetts Marine Fisheries. ‘It's anyone's guess where she is going to go next but she has been heading east so she might continue to do so. ‘In the last day we've had quite a few recordings after a little break. This is probably because she's starting to come a little higher up, where the water is warmer. ‘Though it's hard to predict what she'll do it'll be very exciting if she comes to you guys. Lydia was tagged by the Ocearch project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements . ‘She's just short of 800 miles away from your coast now but in the grand scheme of things that really isn't far for her. It's all very exciting. ‘It's hard to say how long it might take her to get there. If she decides she wants to get to England she could get there in days. ‘Having said that, she is quite likely to meander. It could take her days, it could take her months, or it might not happen at all. ‘I think it would be great to see her turn up in the UK though.’ Lydia’s tag only gives her location when she nears the surface and the mighty shark left researchers anxious for days before providing an update, as she remained deep in the water. The act of tagging the shark, let alone predicting where it will travel, was a feat in itself. A 75,000lb hydraulic platform was used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device. Though Lydia's journey is impressive, great whites are known for their marathon migrations. In 2003 a great white nicknamed Nicole travelled from South Africa to Australia and back - a some 12,400 miles. In recent years there have been several sightings of Great whites off the coast of Britain. In September last year, fisherman David Bond said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of Looe in southern Cornwall. The suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a 'giant shark' get close to his vessel. All those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark, saying the creature was much larger, prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white. Great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world, reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight. Satellite tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long-distance journeys. The OCEARCH Global Shark Tracker Project has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009. The study has shown that Great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months. They . are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, . New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the . Gulf coast and Hawaii. The . creatures have a ferocious reputation but are responsible for between a . third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each . year. They are highly adapted predators, detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away. Their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth, arranged across several rows. Gathering . speed and approaching their prey from beneath, Great whites can leap . clear of the water, breaching like whales to attack. They commonly feed on sea lions, seals, small toothed whales, and sea turtles. The predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year. If food is scarce, the sharks will try to avoid fighting, instead engaging in a tail-slapping contest along the surface of the water. The winner delivers the most slaps. Scientists . do not have a reliable idea of the species' population across the . world, but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and . sharks being caught accidentally in nets. They are listed as an endangered species.","On Friday, Lydia was spotted 1,000 miles from Cornwall and Ireland .
The satellite-tagged 15ft, 2,000lb great white is now just 780 miles away after she crossed the mid-Atlantic ridge found in the middle of the ocean .
It was predicted that she could arrive in British waters today, but Lydia took a .
detour north, which also makes her the most northerly tagged great white .
No one understands why she is taking such a strange route as great whites are usually found in warmer waters ."
"Pressure is mounting on three Labour grandees to explain their links with a vile group that tried to legalise sex with children. MPs, commentators and even Labour-supporting newspapers lined up yesterday to attack the silence of the party’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, her MP husband and former minister Patricia Hewitt. The chorus of condemnation follows the Mail’s devastating series of reports into how the trio held key roles in a human rights organisation that supported the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). Labour's deputy leader: Harriet Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when she became the . National Council for Civil Liberties's legal officer in 1978 until 1982 . Will he respond to the Mail's questions? Ed Miliband’s home affairs spokesman, Jack Dromey, sat on the NCCL executive committee for almost a decade, from 1970 to 1979 . Although the BBC has ignored the . story, those calling for the trio to explain themselves include . Left-wing commentators who would normally be expected to back them. Carole . Malone in the Labour-supporting Sunday Mirror angrily demanded that . Miss Harman, Miss Hewitt and Jack Dromey speak up about why they . supported the paedophile agenda in the 1970s. She said: ‘How can they . ever again be taken seriously on ANY issue if they stay silent?’ In . the Observer newspaper, a columnist said the Labour trio ‘cannot stay . silent on this child sex claim’, adding it would be ‘a grave mistake for . them to stay silent or curtly dismissive, perhaps hoping that the . claims will magically disappear’. The . Guardian’s Roy Greenslade wrote last week: ‘I’m with the Mail on this . one . . . I think Harman, Dromey and Hewitt do need to address this . matter seriously.’ 'People of different ages being nice to each other': The autumn 1982 edition of Rights, the in-house magazine of the NCCL. Self-confessed paedophile Mike Morten's letter was published on page 9 (pictured centre) Document: This is the cover page of the NCCL's submission to Parliament on the 1976 Sexual Offences Act held at the LSE library, which suggests that the age of consent be lowered to 14 . Damning: On page six of the document it is argued that 'a person aged 14 or over should be legally capable of giving consent' and the age of sexual consent cut to ten 'if the child understood the nature of the act' Kevin Maguire, the Daily Mirror’s associate editor and cheerleader for a  Labour government, tweeted: ‘Agree with @GreensladeR on NCCL-PIE. If I were Harman, Dromey or Hewitt, I’d want to set the record straight.’ 'They’re among the first to jump down anyone else’s throats if anyone challenges their politically-correct shibboleths' Philip Davies, Conservative MP . The Mail has revealed how, before they became MPs, the three were leading officials in the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) which granted ‘affiliate’ status to PIE and built close links with it. The group of predatory paedophiles was calling for the age of consent to be cut to just four. The NCCL itself lobbied Parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten – if the child ‘understood the nature of the act’ – and called for incest to be legalised in what one MP dubbed a ‘Lolita’s charter’. Questions being asked: Former minister Patricia Hewitt was the NCCL general secretary from 1974 to 1983 . Annual report for 1975: Patricia Hewitt published this document in April 1976, which included a 'gay rights' section on page ten defending the Paedophile Information Exchange and its members . Defence: Ms Hewitt had described the Paedophile Action for Liberation group, which changed its name to PIE that year, as 'a campaigning/counselling group for adults sexually attracted to children' Last night Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘When left-wing commentators such as Roy Greenslade and Carole Malone demand answers from these three senior Labour politicians, you know that this is not so much a political issue between Right and Left, but one about right and wrong.’ Fellow Tory MP Philip Davies added: . ‘They should certainly provide an explanation and clarification as to . whether they still hold these views or not. ‘They’re among the first to jump down anyone else’s throats if anyone challenges their politically-correct shibboleths.’ Police are investigating PIE as part of Operation Fernbridge, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. A source with knowledge of the inquiry says there is evidence PIE members were abusing children ‘on an industrial scale’. AGM minutes: This page reveals how the PIE was represented at an NCCL AGM at the University of Lancaster. Below the list of organisations present is Jack Dromey's name, after he was re-elected to the executive committee of the NCCL in 1977 . Columnists: Carole Malone (left) in the Labour-supporting Sunday Mirror angrily demanded that Miss Harman, Miss Hewitt and Jack Dromey speak up about why they supported the paedophile agenda in the 1970s. And Rod Liddle (right), writing in the Sunday Times, criticised the BBC for its silence on the story . 'How can they ever again be taken seriously on ANY issue if they stay silent?' Carole Malone, Sunday Mirror . 'Who would want their own good name indelibly attached to something like this?' Barbara Ellen, Observer . 'Can you imagine how the media – and especially the BBC – would react if three current senior Conservative MPs were revealed to have had links to a paedophile group?' Rod Liddle, Sunday Times . 'If I were Harman, Dromey or Hewitt, I’d want to set the record straight' Kevin Maguire, Daily Mirror . The Mail has repeatedly asked the Labour trio to answer vital questions about their time at the NCCL. The Mail has posed a series of vital questions to Harriet Harman, Patricia Hewitt and Jack Dromey. They include: . To Harman, Hewitt and Dromey: . During your time with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL), it gave significant support to the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE). Do you regret this support or feel inclined to apologise to the many victims who suffered appalling abuse at the hands of this vile organisation you helped legitimise? To Hewitt and Dromey: . The NCCL granted formal ‘affiliate’ status to PIE. Why did you allow your organisation to be associated with an outfit that advocated the legalisation of paedophilia? PIE submitted a report to MPs claiming that ‘girls as young as four months can achieve orgasm’, and that four-year-old children can ‘communicate verbally their consent to sex’. Given these utterly repellent views, why did you let the organisation remain affiliated to your NCCL? The NCCL made a written submission to Parliament’s Criminal Law Commission, arguing: ‘Childhood sexual experiences, willingly engaged in, with an adult result in no identifiable damage.’ On what basis, scientific or otherwise, did you make this extraordinary claim? The submission also called for the crime of incest be abolished, arguing that the suggestion that genetic damage may result from children born of incestuous unions ‘is in direct contradiction to the practices of successful animal breeders’. Do you still take this view? To Harman: . The NCCL’s affiliation with PIE, its support for lowering (or even abolishing) the  age of consent, and its demand for the legalisation of incest were all widely reported throughout the 1970s. Why, given these morally offensive views,  did you then take a job as legal adviser to the NCCL? Miss Hewitt, the former Health Secretary, was its general secretary from 1974-83. She described PIE in glowing terms as ‘a campaigning/counselling group for adults attracted to children’. Ed Miliband’s home affairs spokesman, Mr Dromey, sat on the NCCL executive committee for almost a decade, from 1970-79. His wife Miss Harman was a newly qualified solicitor when she became the NCCL’s legal officer in 1978 until 1982. None of the three has commented on the Mail’s revelations, except for Miss Harman whose spokesman said: ‘This story is untrue and ridiculous.’ In the newspapers, commentators from Left and Right condemned the trio for failing to explain their actions. Observer columnist Barbara Ellen wrote: ‘The fact remains that some very disturbing things went down, including the legitimising of a group that wasn’t even bothering to hide the word “paedophile” in its name. ‘Who would want their own good name indelibly attached to something like this, especially without sufficient reply? A calm, thorough, intelligent response is required.’ Miss Malone wrote: ‘There’s never been a time when it’s been OK for adults to have sex with children… If any opposition politician was implicated in such a scandal, Harman and Hewitt would be on their moral high horses demanding explanations. ‘But they and Dromey have point-blank refused to explain their links with this wicked group. That silence has made them look weak and cowardly.’ And Rod Liddle, writing in the Sunday Times, criticised the BBC for its silence on the story. He wrote: ‘So far, only a handful of newspapers have reported the fact that three very senior Labour party figures had rather close links with the group back in the good ol’ Seventies. ‘Can you imagine how the media – and especially the BBC – would react if three current senior Conservative MPs were revealed to have had links to a paedophile group?’ Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘BBC News is an impartial, independent news organisation and decides its editorial priorities based on merit alone and without external help. ‘The story in question is not new and instead we have followed several big breaking news stories this weekend.’","Pressure mounts on Harriet Harman, her MP husband and Patricia Hewitt .

"BBC Radio 4 has set aside ten hours in its New Year's Day schedule to air an adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s nineteenth century novel War and Peace . There was once a time when a ten-hour radio show based on a work of Russian literature would have been a daunting prospect even the most loyal listener. But BBC bosses are taking advantage in the boom of online listening and downloadable podcasts by handing over almost the entire New Year’s Day schedule for Radio 4 to a production of War and Peace. And the adaptation of Leo Tolstoy’s nineteenth century novel is the flagship of the station’s Christmas line-up, that will also see the characters of The Archers put on a full production of Noel Coward’s Blythe Spirit and the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby submit himself to analysis on Desert Island Discs. Jeremy Howe, Radio 4’s Commissioning Editor for Drama, said yesterday that before the availability of online catch-up he would not have felt confident commissioning a programme on the scale of War and Peace. He said: ‘[Podcasts and online listening have] changed the way we commissioned dramas. 'Ten years ago, we would have been slightly reluctant to do a ten-part classic serial but because we now advertise [catch-up listening] as available and it’s there for 30 days, it means if you’ve missed something you can go back and that’s emboldened us to commission big. 'It’s kind of like the box set philosophy, it’s available when you want it, as well as on air.’ War and Peace, widely regard as one of the most important works in literature, tells the story of the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the eyes of five aristocratic families. The event will be the first time Radio 4 has handed over so much of its schedule to one production on a single day, with War and Peace running from 9am to 9.30pm giving way only to news bulletins, The Archers and an as of yet unannounced comedy programme. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 20 on the BBC’s survey The Big Read, which sought to find the country’s best loved novel. Mr Howe said: ‘It’s the biggest blockbuster of them all, so why don’t we do it in the biggest blockbuster way? 'So that’s why we’ve stripped out the schedule on a day when we think people will be prepared to sit down and listen to something. 'One of the things I love about Radio 4 is we will give something the space to do something like that properly, 10 hours is a pretty good stab at War and Peace’. The ten-hour radio show is a production based on the works of Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy (pictured) Gwyneth Williams, the station’s controller, added: ‘We hope lots of Radio 4 listeners will set themselves up with vodka and blinis and dip in and out. So, the reason for doing it is because it’s arguably the best book ever written and if you haven’t made the journey through it, Radio 4 thinks you are really missing out’. The production will star big names such as John Hurt, Simon Russell Beale, Lesley Manville and Dame Harriet Walter and took a month to record. Howe added it had ‘all the logistics of a film shoot because it was so big’, even attending a re-enactment of The Battle of Austerlitz – a major event in the 1,300 page book – in order to record realistic battle sounds. It is being produced by the award-winning director Timberlake Wertenbaker, who said: ‘I’ve been obsessed with War and Peace ever since I can remember. 'I read it first in French, then in English and I even tried to read in in Russian – I think I managed about a page. I was living at that time in Washington D.C. with a Princess Volkonskaya who would talk about the book as if it were a family memoir. Howe added: ‘The place Tolstoy has in the Russian imagination makes Shakespeare look like a Johnny-come-lately in the English imagination’. The production will also be accompanied by an online digital companion, providing family trees, historical facts and maps to help listeners keep up with the complicated plotlines. War and Peace will be the longest drama Radio 4 has rolled out in a single day. However, they have previously undertaken similar ventures on a lesser scale. On Boxing Day in 2000 the station cleared its schedule for an eight-hour reading of JK Rowling’s Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone and, in 2012, there was a five and a half hour production of James Joyce’s Ulysses.","Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace to feature on BBC Radio 4 on New Year's Day .

"Sri Lanka's police have arrested 37 nationals, turned back by Australian authorities on the high seas after attempting to seek asylum. Superintendent Ajith Rohana said Australia's coastguard intercepted the trawler carrying the Sri Lankans near the Indonesian coast, before handing the asylum-seekers over to Sri Lanka's navy on Thursday. 'The boat left Sri Lanka on November 1,' Rohana said, adding that six children were among the passengers. 37 asylum-seekers whose boat was turned back by Australia after being intercepted in Indonesian waters this week, have been arrested by Sri Lanka's police . 'Investigations are being conducted by the anti-people smuggling unit of the CID (Criminal Investigation Department),' Rohana said. 'They are being held in custody, but will be taken before a magistrate shortly.' The asylum-seekers are the first group to be turned back by the Australian Navy since July, when a boat with 41 Sri-Lankan nationals was intercepted west of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Sri Lanka has since charged them with illegally leaving the country and their cases are due to be taken up in court next May. Sri Lankan asylum seekers  sent back by Australia in July cover their faces as they wait to enter a magistrate's court in the southern port district of Galle  Sri Lanka has charged them with leaving the country illegally and said those found guilty would face 'rigorous imprisonment.' PM Tony Abbott came to power in September last year vowing to stop asylum-seekers undertaking dangerous voyages on rickety boats to reach Australia. As part of its hard-line border protection policy, Australia has since gifted two former customs vessels to Sri Lanka to help its navy stop boats leaving the island's shores. Australia faces international criticism over its treatment of boat people, who are denied resettlement in Australia and sent to camps in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific state of Nauru.

"A clothing store in Beijing has provoked outrage after posting a sign in the window banning Chinese customers. The sign, which was reportedly put up a week ago, translated to: 'Chinese not admitted, except for staff.' A shop assistant explained it was for business reasons - but another said it was because Chinese customers are irritating. The sign posted in the window of a Beijing clothing store said: 'Chinese not admitted, except for staff' One employee at the shop on Yabaolu Street, a popular shopping destination, said Chinese customers are 'too annoying' and 'Chinese women often try on lots of clothes but end up buying nothing'. A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily entered the store posing as a customer but was refused by staff, who said they did not sell clothes to Chinese nationals. An employee told the paper that it had been put up to avoid competitors from copying their designs. Shanghaiist.com reported an employee also said the sign had been put after a Chinese customer stole a tourist's wallet then the owners of the shop were forced to pay $5000 in compensation. 'We didn't mean to debase our nationals, but sometimes they have gone too far', one employee said. One employee said it was to avoid rivals copying designs but another said Chinese customers are 'annoying' On social network Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, people were outraged and called for the store to be closed down. One user said: 'Is this still China?' But Li Xiandong, a professor from China University of Political Science and Law, said that although the sign is discriminatory, the owner hasn't broken any laws as racial discrimination is not illegal in China. 'This may not be regarded as illegal, but this is extremely improper judging from cultural aspects,' he said.","Sign in Beijing shop window translates to: 'Chinese not admitted'

"Harriet Harman may be reluctant to speak out now, but when the Jimmy Savile scandal exploded in 2012, she loudly demanded a judge-led inquiry. She toured television and radio stations proclaiming ‘we need to get to the truth’ for the sake of child abuse victims. She flatly rejected any notion that attitudes had changed or that it was a ‘different world’ years ago, insisting even in ‘historic’ cases, there were lessons to be learnt. Loud demands: Harriet Harman (left) was beating the drum for a public inquiry as Jimmy Savile (right) was revealed in October 2012 to have abused children at schools, hospitals and the BBC . Silence: Until now Miss Harman has said only that the Mail's story is 'untrue and ridiculous' but has refused to answer any questions, as have her husband, Jack Dromey (pictured), and their Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt . Miss Harman even lectured Parliament . that, whatever injustices had occurred in the past, they should be dealt . with now to protect others in the future. Her . battle cries of 2012 contrast sharply with her silence in the past week . in the face of questions about her role in the paedophile-supporting . National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL). Miss . Harman has said only that the Daily Mail’s story is ‘untrue and . ridiculous’ but has refused to answer any questions, as have her . husband, Jack Dromey, and their Labour colleague Patricia Hewitt. In . October 2012, as Savile was revealed to have abused children at . schools, hospitals and the BBC, Miss Harman was beating the drum for a . public inquiry. 1978 briefing: The NCCL legal officer Harriet Harman wrote this briefing paper on the Protection of Children Bill, which sought to ban child pornography. She argued that it would lead to an 'increase in censorship' Argument: The second page contains a paragraph saying that a picture should not be considered indecent if the model was not harmed . Recommendations: Miss Harman's briefing went on that the NCCL would argue that the Bill to protect children should be amended . Signed: The Labour Deputy Leader's name is carried at the bottom of a briefing that argued that a pornographic picture of a naked child should not be considered indecent unless it could be proven that the subject had suffered . Only an ‘overarching’ judge-led investigation into Savile’s rampage of abuse would suffice, she argued. Teachers, social workers and NHS staff should be legally required to give police all allegations of child sex abuse, a report into the Jimmy Savile scandal will demand today. The report was commissioned by police and is based on interviews with more than two dozen of Savile’s victims. They told interviewers that professionals who come into contact with children should be required to pass on any accusations handed to them. Currently Britain lacks a ‘mandatory reporting’ law – meaning people who work with children can go unpunished if they fail to report abuse. Such laws are common in parts of the US. Today’s report calls for a dedicated reporting line for abuse allegations and improved training for police officers. On . October 15, she told MPs debating Savile in the House of Commons: ‘It . is impossible to overstate the suffering caused to those whom he abused. No one should be complacent. ‘This . goes wider than just the BBC. There are still countless young women and . men who have been abused but have never complained because they bear a . great burden of shame, guilt and disgust, and fear that they will not be . believed. ‘Should not our . strong and clear message to them today be: “Come forward now, seek the . support that you need to address the wrong that has been done to you, . and, in doing so, not only secure the justice that you deserve but . protect others in the future”?’ Miss Harman also called for the Home Office to be part of the historic investigation because Savile abused children at an Approved School run by the Home Office. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that any such inquiry, had it taken place, might have unearthed a letter sent to the Home Office in April 1978. It was written by the legal officer of the NCCL, one Harriet Harman, and it argued that child pornography should not be banned as ‘indecent’ unless it could be shown that the child depicted had been harmed.","Denied attitudes had changed or that it was a 'different world' years ago .

"Penny pincher: Ariel Castro, pictured in his latest mugshot, so tight with money he would split McDonald's burgers in half with his own family . The man who allegedly kept three girls captive for a decade was so controlling with his first wife that he told her what to eat, who she could be friends with and when she could leave the house. Ariel Castro was 'obsessive' about ordering around Grimilda Figueroa to the point where he once demanded that she get into a cardboard box and only come out when he said so. He told her to wear skirts below the knee and vowed to kill her if she ever left him - so  she stayed by his side despite the abuse. Grimilda died last year due to injuries which her family claim were caused by Ariel. He allegedly beat her so badly that she suffered two broken noses, shattered ribs and a blood clot on the brain. She was also left with a knocked-out tooth and two dislocated shoulders from the domestic abuse, according to a 2005 court filing. Speaking to MailOnline, Grimilda's sister Elida Caraballo, 44, said: 'My sister would be alive today if it wasn't for him. 'If I could talk to him I wouldn't even talk to him. Words can't even explain what I feel inside. 'It's hatred, he's not even worth being called a father'. Elida said that Ariel and her sister met because they lived across the road from each other and that a week later they were dating. They moved into an apartment in the family home in Cleveland, but trouble began soon after the birth of her first son Anthony. Elida said: 'He became controlling.

'That's when everything started going downhill, the day she had Anthony. 'He told her she couldn't wear short skirts and that they had to be below the knee. They were like 1920s dresses. 'He said she couldn't go anywhere. He was controlling. She never had friends. 'She would never disobey him. She was only allowed to talk to the family.' Asked the significance of having a child, Elida said: 'I think having a child is more, you're mine. As a tie down kind of thing. You can't do this, you can't do that. 'He can control her even more. He was obsessed about control, he was always obsessive about having control. Music man: Ariel Castro is pictured in a 1998 newspaper clipping with members of the band he was in at the time. He's in the back, third from right . 'He became abusive, first he started pushing her then he hit her.' Elida recounted one instance that was particularly harrowing. She said: 'After she had Anthony he pushed her in a box, I don't know why. He pushed the flaps and told her: 'You stay in there until I tell you to get out.' 'When I went downstairs to tell my family he told Grimilda to get out. 'She got pregnant with (her second child of five) Angie and everything was OK but he was still controlling towards her.' Elida said that her sister stayed with Ariel 'because he said he would kill her if she left.' She said: 'It was for the kids. She would not leave for all those kids. 'When we used to visit her she would say she can't leave the porch or Ariel will kill her. 'She tried to leave. She feared him.

"Victim: Rico Dardis, 30, from Poole, Dorset, was killed when his friends pushed him overboard and ran him over with a speedboat, a court heard today . An aspiring rapper was killed when his friends pushed him overboard and ran him over with a speedboat, a court heard today. Rico Dardis, 30, got into an argument with Paul Gerlach, 52, and Louis Borzoni, 50, over cigarettes as they cruised on a powerboat off the coast of Christchurch Bay in Dorset. The pair allegedly pushed him overboard, before running him over with the boat's propeller - ripping both of his legs off. The father-of-one's dismembered body was discovered by police floating in the surf, while one of his legs was found entangled in the propeller of Gerlach's Mazxum speedboat, 'No Chance'. Today Gerlach and Borzoni denied murdering Mr Dardis, from Poole, Dorset, at Winchester Crown Court. The court heard that the trio had been enjoying a drink-fuelled daytrip on the afternoon of May 27 last year when they had started arguing over cigarettes and alcohol. Witness Anthony Soper said the defendants had been 'having a go' at Dardis, described as a 'talented freestyle rapper' by his family. He said one had shouted: 'You are being . ungrateful, you’ve smoked all my cigarettes and drunk all my beer.' Other witnesses said they had seen trio drinking, shouting and swearing as they had clumsily walked to a dinghy to where the speedboat was moored at around 3pm. Six hours later, families relaxing at Christchurch Bay called the police after spotting Gerlach and Borzoni acting suspiciously onboard the broken boat as they returned to shore. Far from calling for help, the pair were trying to unclog the propeller, before going off to buy more drinks while laughing and joking, jurors were told. Opening the trial, Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, said Borzoni had told one woman who had spotted Dardis's torso in the water at around 9pm: ‘Oh, maybe it’s a dummy’. Scene: Police were alerted after a couple noticed a torso floating in the sea off Christchurch Bay (pictured) 'Gerlach and Borzoni quarrelled with Dardis and pushed him off the boat,' he said. 'He was then deliberately run over by the boat and killed. 'His body was dismembered by the propeller which ceased to function because parts of his body were entangled in it. 'Neither did anything to call for help or anything of that nature. They made some efforts to recover the body parts and then allowed the boat to drift into the shore, which was seen by some people.' Mr Bowes said Gerlach and Borzoni were arrested by police later that evening, but both denied deliberately causing Mr Dardis's death. 'Really, they were saying well, it must have been an accident, that he fell off the boat and somehow, and even though it was moving forward, he managed to get entangled at the back,' he said. 'The prosecution’s case is that both defendants agreed that Mr Dardis should be run over by the boat and deliberately killed, and that each is guilty of murder.' Brenda Pidgley, who was at Christchurch Bay with her family, spotted the speedboat in a broken state next to a groyne at the beach at around 9pm, said Mr Bowes. Borzoni - who was covered in blood - was reportedly ‘fiddling’ with the propellor at the back of the boat for about 20 minutes. Mrs Pidgley then noticed 'what appeared to be a shop mannequin' floating face down around three to four metres behind the boat, but neither man took any notice of it,' the jury heard. Court: Gerlach and Borzoni have been jailed for life at Winchester Crown Court (pictured) after being found guilty of murder. Gerlach was sentenced to a minimum term of 17 years, while Borzoni was given 15 years . Walkers Gillian and Alan Bennett helped the defendants pull the boat up the beach and tie it up, but rang 999 after they saw the body. 'Once the boat had been tied up, Mrs Bennett saw what she believed to be a body in the water and said ""Oh my goodness, I think it’s a body"",' said Mr Bowes. 'The response from the man on the boat, Borzoni, was ""Oh, maybe it’s a dummy"". 'Plainly he knew perfectly well it was not but far from calling for any help or acknowledging it was a body, his response was - ""I think it’s a dummy"".' Mr Bennett then called the police - prompting Borzoni to swear and say: 'What, the filth?', the court heard. However, the defendant later apologised and explained that he had had 'a hell of a day'. Borzoni and Gerlach then abandoned the vessel and flagged down a taxi to take them back to the Renault van they had arrived in earlier, the court heard. Gerlach reportedly told the driver: ‘Yeah, we murder’, when asked about their day. They then drove to buy drinks at a Co-Op store, where Gerlach allegedly joked about his blood-stained state to a shop assistant, saying: 'Oh you should see the other guy, he’s dead'. The pair were arrested after driving back to the car park - where they had left a bag containing a bloody towel and a meat cleaver - at around 10pm. Gerlach, who had been driving, was more than 2.5 times over the drink drive limit, the court heard. Mr Bowes said: 'Version one of Gerlach’s story, which is absolutely untrue, was that he had driven forwards, Rico had fallen off the back and somehow become entangled in the propeller. 'Marine experts say that really would not happen, but a moment’s common sense would also demonstrate that. It is a complete lie.' Both of the defendants confessed to killing Mr Dardis in bugged conversations while on police bail and showed ‘callousness and indifference’, Mr Bowes said. He added: 'Both were totally indifferent to the suffering they would have caused. All Borzoni could say was it was ""unfortunate"".' The court heard that Gerlach was recorded boasting to his estranged wife, Anita Gerlach, that he and Borzoni had pushed their victim into the water because he had been beating them up. In the recordings, he said: 'He was floating, floating like a hundred yards away. I turned around, went around him and said: ‘You’re not bullying any c*** now are ya? You’re not bullying any c*** now are ya?’ 'You gotta realise we’re f***ing covered in blood, beat to f***. We were going round, there I was driving round, I said ""You’re not f***ing beating up c***s now are ya? 'I honestly, mate, I just whacked the throttle down, whacked the throttle down and I’m not remorseful.' Meanwhile, Borzoni allegedly told his brother Marco Borzoni: 'I hated the bloke. Really f***ing hated him and he deserved what he got. 'He was asking for it. The anger came out and I let it take control. I keep getting nightmares since it happened, over and over again.' He later said in a taped conversation: 'I’m as guilty as f***, so is me mate, but there’s no evidence we f***ing can suss out. 'What’s done is done. He was a complete and utter t***.' The court heard that post-mortem tests on Mr Dardis's body had revealed that both of his legs had been amputated by the propellor. The cause of death was given as drowning, associated with entanglement and injury by a boat propeller. Speaking outside court, Mr Dardis's family paid tribute to a ‘fantastic dad’ and ‘devoted’ son, and said his death was ‘heartbreaking’. The trial continues.

"Crackdown: Cosmetics Europe has urged companies to remove Methylisothiazolinone from creams . Beauty product companies have been told to stop using a chemical irritant in some products after an explosion in cases of allergic reactions and eczema. The chemical, a preservative called Methylisothiazolinone (MI or MIT), is routinely added to moisturisers, sun creams, shampoos  and wet wipes. Skin experts in the UK and around the world have picked up a large number of allergic reactions they believe are caused by the chemical. Now, Cosmetics Europe, the European cosmetics trade association, has told its members to remove MI from products that are left on the skin. In a statement, the body said: ‘This action is recommended in the interests of consumer safety in relation to adverse skin reactions. ‘It is recommended that companies do not wait for regulatory intervention under the Cosmetics Regulation but implement this recommendation as soon as feasible.’ The Daily Mail has previously highlighted the concerns of UK skin experts and suffering of a number of women who had severe allergic reactions. Symptoms ranged from a rash of bright red tiny bumps to fluid filled lumps on the skin, blisters, itchy eyes and even a severely swollen face. A Daily Mail survey in September found the chemical in L’Oreal Paris Triple Active Day Multi-Protection Moisturiser; Sanctuary Mini Mande Lular Body Soufflé; Clarins Paris Exfoliating Body Scrub for Smooth Skin; Olay Professional Exfoliating Cream Cleanser (150ml); Nivea Body Lotion Express Hydration; and Piz Buin 1 Day Long Lotion. Several companies have already announced that they will stop using MI, including Vaseline, Brylcreem, Huggies, Molton Brown, Nivea and Johnson & Johnson’s Piz Buin. However, products containing the suspect ingredient could still be on shelves. Chemical: A Daily Mail survey in September found Nivea Express Hydration Body Lotion and Olay Professional Exfoliating Cream Cleanser were among many creams to contain MI, alongside Clarins and Piz Buin products . British skin experts say the scale of the allergic reactions to the chemical, which has been used increasingly since 2005,  has been alarming. Dermatologists expect an allergic reaction to a cosmetic product of no more than 1-2per cent, however British clinics report that the rate has been more than 10per cent for MI. It is claimed that scale of harm is more than twice the level of another ingredient called MDBGN (methydibromo glutaronitrile), which was banned by the European Commission in 2008. Leading dermatologist Dr Ian White from St Thomas’ Hospital, London, said: ‘The frequency of reactions to MI is unprecedented in my experience. We’ve never seen anything quite like it. ‘Contact allergy to this permitted preservative is now of epidemic proportions.’ Dr David Orton, a member of the British Association of Dermatologists and president of the British Society of Cutaneous Allergy, welcomed the industry move but said it did not go far enough. Reaction: One in ten sufferers of dermatitis were found to have had an allergic reaction to the chemical . He said: ‘This is a promising step forward, and I welcome this demonstration of responsibility by Cosmetics Europe to pre-empt regulation on the use of MI. I hope that this recommendation will be adhered to by the association’s members and will go some way towards protecting UK and European consumers. ‘Nevertheless, as it currently stands, this recommendation falls short of calling for the removal or a reduction of MI levels in rinse-off cosmetics, such as shower gels or shampoos. ‘We still have concerns that its continued use at present concentrations in such products will elicit allergic reactions in those that are already sensitised. This is a matter which we are hoping to reach agreement on in future planned discussions.’","Preservative Methylisothiazolinone (MI) routinely added to moisturisers .

"‘Gone fishing’ is a phrase usually associated with a quiet afternoon out on the water, fishing rod in hand, pondering the world.

A YouTube user said: 'Guess for dinner they're having salmon... Smoked.' Hand grenades are a common, but environmentally catastrophic, way of catching fish in some parts of the world. The explosives are usually detonated underwater allowing the fisherman to collect the dead fish as they float to the surface.

"Proudly collecting her degree with a friend by her side, Emma Watson looks as though she has achieved her aim of having a normal student experience. But appearances can be deceiving... For the fellow ‘student’ accompanying the actress to her graduation is actually an armed police guard. And beneath the undercover officer’s black graduation robe is a gun. Scroll down for video .

But as she . picked up her degree in English Literature alongside 2,000 other . graduates on Sunday, she remained in constant sight of the undercover . officer. Underneath her . graduation gown, the guard wore a pink shirt, jeans and trainers – far . more practical, no doubt, than Miss Watson’s strappy heels.

"The crew of a British nuclear submarine faced death in soaring temperatures when its air conditioning failed, it emerged yesterday. Commanding officer Ryan Ramsey feared members of his 130-strong crew would die during the 2011 incident on HMS Turbulent, which had surfaced in the Indian Ocean. Equipment began failing in 140F temperatures and men were collapsing. Commander Ramsey ordered the sub to dive and it finally cooled in deep waters. It emerged that inlet pipes were blocked by crabs and barnacles. Close shave: Commander Ryan Ramsey on the bridge of his submarine, which was nearly the scene of a disaster when its air conditioning systems got clogged with crabs and barnacles as he sailed in the Indian Ocean . The astonishing near-miss was revealed three years on by retired Commander Ramsay, 44, who described it as the biggest crisis he faced in 25-years' service. Commander Ramsay said the incident began at 10.30am on May 26, 2011, three hours after Turbulent had left Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates. The boat was surfaced and the decorated officer was on the bridge when he received word the air conditioning units had failed. Soon afterwards the first of dozens of 'pipe' sounds - signalling a casualty - rang out. Commander Ramsay arrived in the sailor's cabin to find him crying and shaking, clearly suffering from heat exhaustion. Within hours almost every free space on board the 275ft submarine had become a makeshift sick bay. Action stations: Commander Ramsey, 44, now retired, said the incident began at 10.30am on May 26, 2011, three hours after HMS Turbulent had left Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates . Commander Ramsay, a married father of two from Plymstock, Devon, said: 'I came down below and I was met with this incredible blast of heat. 'I genuinely thought there was going to be a loss of life on board. People were going to die. People were just collapsing everywhere, many at their work stations. 'We had casualties in the control room, the engine room, the bridge, the wardroom, cabins, and the toilets and showers. 'It was absolutely terrifying, and I'm not afraid to say I was scared. I remember looking at a picture of my family quickly thinking ""we need to pull through this"". 'Walking around the boat I saw true fear in my crew's eyes. I saw genuine concern because we simply did not know how we were going to get through it. 'I felt like the world was against us. I was looking up and asking ""when are you going to give me a break to gain the upper hand here?"" People were crying - it was all about survival.' HMS Turbulent was commissioned in 1984 to hunt Soviet submarines and decommissioned in July 2012 . Commander Ramsay had never heard of a similar malfunction and to make matter worse his repair crews could not get close enough to the faulty equipment because it was too hot to touch. With a fifth of this staff now ill he ruled out a return to Fujairah and instead ordered two of the submarine's hatches to be opened to vent some of the heat. A number of the casualties were taken outside but with the air outside measuring a sweltering 42 degrees there was little respite. The knock on effect of losing the air conditioning also meant other vital systems had begun to fail - but the boat was still able to dive. Sinking to a depth of more than 200 metres, the temperatures finally began to drop. Just 24 hours later, with systems all returned to normal and the crew having recovered, HMS Turbulent continued on with its deployment. The boat was commissioned in 1984 to hunt Soviet missile submarines and decommissioned in July 2012. After the end of the Cold War she conducted intelligence gathering missions and commando landings, as well as firing Tomahawk missiles during the 2003 Iraq war. Submariners aboard a Trafalgar class submarine like Turbulent: Commander Ramsay retired in March but says his experiences have been incorporated into Royal Navy submarine training scenarios . Commander Ramsay, its commanding officer for three years, retired in March but says his experiences have been incorporated into submarine training scenarios. Hw said: 'It was touch and go before we dived as to what might happen to us and the submarine. 'We couldn't do anything. I could have radioed for help but it would have taken hours for anyone to reach us. In that time people would have died. 'We were alone in our steel tube. There really was no-one to call. 'There's not a day that goes by that I do not think about what happened. The pain of seeing my crew like that. 'But when I think back to that time I quickly remember how fantastic they all were in dealing with the situation. 'We recovered from it. They did exactly what they had to do, and looked after the team. 'Now that I've left the Royal Navy I feel I can openly and honestly talk about how amazing and incredible the service is. 'The medical team was made up of one Petty Officer medic, another medic, and six or seven first-aiders and they did an unbelievable job under intense pressure. 'That particular experience brought out some amazing actions from people who are rarely recognised, if ever, for what they do.' HMS Turbulent, a Trafalgar Class submarine, was decommissioned in July 2012 at the end of a career of nearly 30 years, although this was not connected to the incident. The boat launched Tomahawk missiles into Iraq in 2003 and was involved in operations off the Libyan coast. A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘In 2011, a technical issue in HMS Turbulent resulted in a temporary rise in temperature on board the submarine. ‘The problem, which caused no damage to the submarine or its reactor systems, was resolved by the crew after a few hours using standard operating procedures. ‘A number of personnel who showed signs of heat related symptoms were treated by the submarine’s medical team.’","Astonishing close shave revealed by retired Commander Ryan Ramsey .

"A film crew suffered the scare of their lives when a giant great white shark sunk its' razor-sharp teeth into their inflatable rubber boat. The MaxAnimal crew were filming for their popular YouTube channel off the coast of South Africa when the predator appeared several metres away. Seconds later, the creature popped its' head out of the water and latched onto the boat relentlessly. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Terrifying: A great white shark was captured on film attacking a film crew as they stood powerless on a small rubber boat in the middle of the sea . Damaged: The rubber boat was left with a giant hole in one of its sides after the shark ripped into it with it's razor-sharp teeth . Powerless to deter the shark, the crew could do nothing but watch in horror as the animal chewed into the rubber ferociously. The giant fish was then able to rip open one side of the boat as the crew watched in horror. MaxAnimal describe their channel as 'merciless, ferocious, untamed, violently fun, weird and wacky and above all, wild animal videos' on their website. They said they managed to make it back to shore with the semi-deflated raft staying afloat after the 'completely unprovoked' attack. Scared: The film crew from YouTube channel MaxAnimal inspect the damage on the side of their boat following the attack and manage to get the semi-deflated vessel back to shore . Unbelievable: The film crew watch in horror as the shark attacks the boat despite being 'completely unprovoked' 'The shark is fine and so is the crew,' a MaxAnimal spokesperson said on YouTube. 'Everyone made it out alive.' They said the 'scariest' part of the ordeal was when the great white stares at those on board the boat. The video has been seen by more than 750,000 people on YouTube. Despite the terrifying encounter, the company described great whites as 'amazing creatures'. 'They should be respected and protected.' Great white sharks can grow to 21 feet (four metres) in length and are one of the most feared creatures in the sea. But they rarely attack for no reason, with experts claiming this particular shark was more likely curious as to what the boat was rather than attacking those on board.","A great white shark was caught on camera 'attacking' a rubber boat .

"Yusuf Hameed says he has been knocked back from dozens of jobs over the last year because of his appearance . A job-hunter claims he has been left unemployable because he is covered in tattoos. Yusuf Hameed, 40, has been knocked back from dozens of jobs over the last year because of his unconventional appearance.

"Apple will bundle the subscription music service it bought from Beats into its iOS operating system early next year, the Financial Times has claimed. The inclusion of the paid-for Beats service in an iOS software update, which would instantly make it available on millions of iPhones and iPads, could happen as early as March. The service, which is likely to be rebranded under the iTunes label, will compete with music streaming services like Spotify, Pandora, and Soundcloud. Scroll down for video . The move will pit Apple against Spotify, which has suffered setbacks following a spat with Taylor Swift and other artists who remain sceptical about the economics of streaming . Despite the popularity of streaming services, Apple's installed base of active music buyers dwarfs other services, according to Midia Research, a music analysis firm. It says Apple has 200m active iTunes customers - and  estimates Beats Music has only 110,000 subscribers. Spotify said its subscriber base has grown to 12.5 million, up from 10 million when the number was last reported in May. 'The inclusion of the paid for Beats service in an iOS software update could happen as early as March, according to people familiar with the situation,' the paper said. Pre-installing apps on devices is seen as a fast way to reach new customers quickly- although the firm is still suffering from the publicity backlash earlier this year when it put a link to download U2#s new album for free onto every iTunes account. The move will pit Apple against Spotify, which has suffered setbacks following a spat with Taylor Swift and other artists who remain sceptical about the economics of streaming, claiming the Swedish firm does not pay them enough. The music streaming service responded by saying it it fights music piracy and had paid out $2 billion to the industry and artists since its launch in 2008. The statement in a blog post by CEO Daniel Ek came a week after U.S. singer Taylor Swift pulled her entire catalog from the popular streaming site as she released her new album '1989', which immediately soared to the top of the U.S. charts. Swift's label Big Machine has declined to say why it asked for Swift's albums to be removed from the free service of Spotify, which also offers a subscription service to users who want to eliminate advertising. The app, available on iOS, Android and Windows Mobile, allows music to be streamed for a $10 monthly fee . But in an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal in July, Swift wrote that music was valuable and 'it's my opinion that music should not be free'. 'Taylor Swift is absolutely right: music is art, art has real value and artists deserve to be paid for it,' Ek said in the posting on the Spotify website. He said Spotify was fighting back against music piracy on the Internet, which he said generated 'nothing, zilch, zero' revenue for artists, by offering a combined free listening and subscription service that compensates the music industry. Its subscriber base has grown to 12.5 million, up from 10 million when the number was last reported in May, he said. With revenue coming largely from advertising and subscriptions, Spotify had paid out $1 billion to the recording industry and artists from 2008 to last year, and another $1 billion since then, Ek said. The Beats Music streaming service was acquired alongside the Beats headphone brand when Apple bought Beats for $3bn in May. 'And that's $2 billion worth of listening that would have happened with zero or little compensation to artists and songwriters through piracy or practically equivalent services if there was no Spotify,' he said, taking a swipe at competing Internet streaming sites, some of which do not charge users. 'We're working day and night to recover money for artists and the music business that piracy was stealing away,' he said. Apple's new service will also go up against Google. Google said last week that YouTube is rolling out a long-awaited paid monthly music subscription service called YouTube Music Key.","Firm expected to release update next year for all iOS devices .

"The body of a woman found in a San Diego park is believed to be Megadeth singer Dave Mustaine's missing mother-in-law, sheriff's deputies have said. Deputies in Julian, San Diego County, California, responded on Wednesday to reports of a body found in heavy shrubbery on Highway 79 near Pinezanita RV Park & Campgrounds, where Sally Estabrook disappeared almost two months ago. Mrs Estabrook, a 75-year-old with Alzheimer's disease was last seen in the park at around 4pm on October 4 wearing a teal top and white Capri pants. Sheriff's deputies in Julian believe a woman's body found in Pinezanita campgroud is Sally Estabrook, left, the missing mother-in-law of Megadeath singer Dave Mustaine, right . Her husband told deputies at the time that he returned from a shower and found she had disappeared. Since then, search and rescue teams from three counties and a federal agency have been searching for the missing woman. They were told her Alzheimer’s means she isn't very communicative, but she might respond to her name. Deputies revealed the clothing worn by the woman whose body was found closely resembled those worn by Mrs Estabrook when she disappeared, reported NBC San Diego. No foul play is believed to be involved, but the cause of death will be determined by the medical examiner’s office. Mustaine, who formed the thrash metal band in 1983, wrote on Facebook yesterday: 'Yesterday evening I received a call that a person had located a body and the investigators from SDSD Homicide Division described our beloved mother, Sally Estabrook. 'Thank you all for your prayers, your good thoughts, and positive vibes.' Mustaine posted a message on Facebook yesterday to say: 'Thank you all for your prayers, your good thoughts, and positive vibes' When Megadeth released their most recent album, Super Collider last year, Mustaine revealed the songwriting process had been influenced by his mother-in-law's battle with Alzheimer's . He tweeted his fans in October asking them to 'please send good thoughts' to his wife Pam, 'and prayers from those of you who pray, as we search for her mom.' Thirty San Diego sheriff's search and rescue volunteers, including members of the Border Patrol Search, Trauma and Rescue Unit and search and rescue members from San Bernardino and Riverside searched a six mile area around the campground. Friends and family members also assisted along with two bloodhounds and a sheriff's helicopter. ‘It's hilly, rocky, and there are a lot of ravines,’ said sheriff's spokeswoman Jan Caldwell at the time. ‘Our fear is that she feel down a hill and maybe injured herself.’ Mustaine's daughter Electra also tweeted: 'Help find my beloved nana. She wandered off into the woods [on Saturday] @ 4pm. Has Alzheimer's-will not remember a thing!' The thrash metal singer tweeted his fans in October asking them to 'send good thoughts' to his wife Pam . When Megadeth released their most recent album, Super Collider, in 2013, Mustaine revealed that the songwriting process had been influenced by his mother-in-law's battle with Alzheimer's. According to Mustaine, the track Forget To Remember was written specifically about some experiences with memory and forgetting. 'The song touches on the no. 6 cause of death in America, Alzheimer's Disease, which my mother-in-law has been diagnosed with,' he said, 'and our world is now upside down. 'I did what I do best when I have something to say; I sing about it.'","Sally Estabrook, 75, was last seen in a San Diego park on October 4 .

"Charged: Martin Joseph MacNeill has been charged with his wife's death five years after her death was concluded as being from natural causes . A Utah doctor whose children have lived in fear since the unexplained death of their mother in their home five years ago has been arrested and charged with her death. Approximately one month after 56-year-old Martin MacNeill's release from a Texas federal prison on check fraud left his children scared for their lives, he was booked on Friday at the Utah County Jail in the 2007 death of his wife and their mother, Michele MacNeill. He has been charged with murder and obstruction of justice. 'I knew from the day my mom died that my father killed her,' his daughter Alexis Somers, his third oldest, told the Deseret News. 'No one believed us. She was taken from us and no one cared. Our family has been fighting for this for so long. It is so emotional for us.' Investigators have long thought MacNeill killed his wife that April she was found in their Pleasant Grove home's bathtub before covering it up — charges the doctor has denied. 'To find out everything has been a lie has been just horrifying,' his 29-year-old daughter said. Martin MacNeill's attorney, Randy Spencer, said on Friday it doesn't appear the county has any new evidence, and his client will fight the charges. Happy: Martin and Michele were the perfect couple for years, with their four children and four adopted Ukrainian children . Picture perfect: The daughters of Martin MacNeill strongly believe that he murdered their mother Michele in April of 2007 and have long worked to see him convicted . Drugged: Michele MacNeill underwent cosmetic surgery at her husband's suggestion, allowing him, a doctor, to provide her with numerous drugs prosecutors say he poisoned her with . An autopsy indicated his wife died of natural causes, but a 2010 addendum to that report questioned the manner of death. Authorities . now say they believe Michele MacNeill was drugged by her husband. Her . children say it was to escalate at least two affairs he was having. One . was with a woman who soon after his wife's death moved into their home, . posing as the children's nanny. The second, two years before his wife's . death, told her psychiatrist she was having an affair with a 'serial . killer.' Following MacNeill's release in July after serving a three-year sentence for fraud, forgery and identity theft, his daughter said she was terrified of him striking revenge against her and her siblings who had long accused the former clinical director of the Utah State Developmental Center as well as lawyer in her mother's death. Michele MacNeill's death on April 11, . 2007 was . initially ascribed to natural causes, but information supplied by the . Alexis and her sister Rachel helped the medical examiner to change the . results to suspicious in . October 2010. Fraud: Martin MacNeill (left) and girlfriend Gypsy Willis (right) were convicted for identity theft and imprisoned until his release last month from a Texas federal prison . Daughters: Alexis, left, and Rachel are convinced their father murdered their mother so that he could live a life with his girlfriend Gypsy Willis . 'It's really sickening to me,' she told Deseret News . after his release from prison. 'I am back into this panic feeling, just . really nervous knowing what he is capable of doing and now he is out.' The unravelling of the MacNeill family . began in 2005 when her father started losing weight, tanning and acting . strangely, even disappearing for days at a time. Until . then, the children had had a 'loving and affectionate' Mormon childhood . with their father, their beautiful . mother and eight children - four of which were from . the Ukraine. But, in 2007, Michele became convinced her husband was . having an affair after she found out the same number had been called over . and over again at strange hours of the morning. The number . belonged to Gypsy Willis who MacNeill said was renting a property he . leased out. Though Michele was not convinced, she let the matter rest. Tragic end: Michele MacNeill was found dead in her family's home's bathtub while recovering from cosmetic surgery her husband allegedly forced on her . Tender: Michele was described as a loving, caring mother who did everything for her children and her husband, even having a facelift for him . Then a few days later, MacNeill came to his 50-year-old wife with a strange request - he wanted her to have a facelift. Though . his pretty wife did not want to, she went along with her husband to . keep him happy. Two weeks later she had the surgery and was back at her . home recovering with supplied pills of Valium, Percocet, Phenergan and Ambien by her husband. Though heavily sedated, Michele told her daughter Alexis: 'Your dad kept giving me pills.' A . few days later, when she was feeling better after Alexis took control . of her recovery, she told her daughter: 'In case anything happens to me, . make sure it wasn't your dad.' Michele was found dead in the bathtub a few days later - just eight days after the surgery. MacNeill . claimed his wife slipped and fell. In a call to 911 he said he could . not get his wife out of the bath and had to call his neighbour to help . before he administered CPR. But it was too late. According to an affidavit filed in 4th . District Court, Utah State Medical Examiner Todd Grey said the . combination of medicines found in her body, which may have been forced . upon her and could have been lethal, Deseret News reports. Intentions: Authorities now say they believe Michele MacNeill was drugged by her husband, opening the door to an affair he had been having with a woman who just days later moved into their home posing as a nanny . An investigator with the Utah County . Attorney's Office told People Magazine last year: 'There is probable cause to . believe that Martin MacNeill had the opportunity, the motive, the . psychological disposition and...the capability of killing his wife . Michele MacNeill.' Until now Martin MacNeill had never been charged in her death. 'This is the first day he's in prison because he killed my mom,' his daughter Alexis Somers told the Deseret News. 'He's not been held accountable for that until now.' When Alexis found out about her . mother's death, she said she 'screamed from the top of her lungs' because she knew that her dad killed their mother, she told ABC in an interview last year. The next few years, Rachel said, was a 'nightmare within a nightmare'. MacNeill hired Willis as a nanny to . help look after their youngest daughters, but as the older sisters began . to fight for custody of their sisters, today aged 11, 18 and 19, they unearthed some devastating . information about their dad. He falsified his undergraduate . transcript to help him get into medical school followed by law school . and he failed to disclose an earlier conviction for check fraud. He had . also been discharged from the military for schizophrenia. Crumbled family: The daughters, three of four children she gave birth to, with four others adopted by the couple, say they have turned their back on their father and he was a man they never truly knew . An affidavit from the second woman he allegedly had an affair with also revealed their father's admittance to her that since he was a young boy he had a thirst for murder - attempting to take his mother's own life but thwarted by his sister who contacted emergency personnel and were able to revive her. He also told her that he had killed his brother in their bathtub, had a burning desire to kill one of his daughters and offered to kill her husband for her if she so wished, the Deseret News reports. When Rachel and Alexis threatened to . have Michele's death investigated if they didn't get custody of their . sisters, MacNeill dropped his children off the next day and never saw . them again. But after that he waged a furious campaign of intimidation telling his daughters he would 'destroy them'. Meanwhile, during the process of adopting one of their Ukrainian sisters, investigators discovered that Gypsy Willis had been using her social security number to hide her own debt heavy history. In 2009, Willis and MacNeill were both convicted of identity theft and imprisoned. Now Alexis is determined to see him back behind bars. 'His whole life he has gotten away with things by intimidating people and scaring them, and I am not going to be intimidated. For the last five years, I have tried to stand up and show the world what he has done. So no, I am not going to run,' she told Deseret News.","Martin MacNeill, 56, has been charged with murder and obstruction of justice for the 2007 death of his wife .

"The U.S. Justice Department asked the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department on Friday to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of the white policeman who shot to death an unarmed black teenager last month, sparking protests. In a letter to Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson, the Justice Department said residents had told its investigators that officers policing protest sites on Tuesday in Ferguson were seen wearing 'I am Darren Wilson' bracelets. Wilson killed 18-year-old Michael Brown on Aug. 9, causing outrage in the mostly black St. Louis suburb of 21,000 people. Wilson has not been charged in the case. The U.S. Justice Department asked the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department on Friday to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of the white policeman who shot to death an unarmed black teenager last month, sparking protests . The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the shooting and the police treatment of protesters, which critics say was unduly harsh. The letter said the bracelets had 'upset and agitated' people and 'reinforce the very 'us versus them' mentality that many residents of Ferguson believe exists.' The DOJ said it had been assured by officials with the county and state police, which have been brought in to help in Ferguson, that their officers would not wear them. Ferguson police could not be reached for comment on Friday evening. In a separate letter sent to Jackson earlier this week, the Justice Department said its investigators had observed Ferguson police officers not wearing, or obscuring, their name tags on their uniforms, a violation of the police department's rules. 'The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to community members that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity,' the letter said. Jackson, following weeks of heavy criticism and calls for his ouster, issued a video apology to Brown's parents on Thursday. He later began marching with a group of protesters, but a scuffle broke out near him and several people were arrested. A letter from the Justice Department said the bracelets had 'upset and agitated' people and 'reinforce the very 'us versus them' mentality that many residents of Ferguson believe exists' In addition to the Justice Department probe, a grand jury in St. Louis County is examining the case. Protesters have pledged continued civil unrest until Wilson is charged in Brown's death and on Friday night several dozen people gathered in downtown Ferguson to call for Jackson's ouster. Police kept a low-key presence during the demonstrations, showing none of the aggressive tactics that had led to prior clashes with protesters. Although Ferguson is predominantly African American, its political leadership and police department are dominated by whites. Activists say Brown's death was the culmination of years of police unfairly targeting blacks.","Justice Department says the bracelets have 'agitated' people and led to an 'us versus them' mentality .

"House Speaker John Boehner hasn't been coy about his interest in tackling immigration reform legislation. Just last week the Republican leader said he was 'hell bent' on doing so before the 113th Congress adjourns at the end of this year, despite facing pressure from members of his caucus not to bring the issue to the House floor. The Speaker's zeal for getting his Republican colleagues to embrace immigration reform took a sharp turn on Thursday from determination to antagonism, however, when Boehner publicly made fun of his Republican colleagues for being too afraid to confront the issue publicly. 'Here's the attitude. Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too . hard,' Boehner said, doing an impression of his Congressional caucus while squealing like a child. 'Here's the attitude. Ohhhh. Don't make me do this. Ohhhh. This is too hard,' House Speaker John Boehner said on Thursday, squealing like a child while making fun of his Republican colleagues' position on immigration reform . 'We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and . it's remarkable to me how many of my colleagues just don't want to ... They'll take the path of least resistance,' Boehner continued. 'I've had every brick and bat and arrow shot at me over this issue just . because I wanted to deal with it. I didn't say it was going to be easy.' During Thursday's event, Boehner also took shot's at national Tea Party groups 'whom purport to represent the Tea Party.' 'I . made it pretty clear I'll stand with the Tea Party, but I'm not . standing with these three or four groups in Washington who are using the . Tea Party for their own personal benefit,' Boehner said. According to the Cincinnati Enquirer, which first reported the story, Boehner's remarks on Thursday took place at a luncheon in the Ohioan's Congressional District at the Middletown Rotary Club. Boehner's office tried to frame the Congressman's immigration comments on Friday as playful. Spokesman Brendan Buck told The Huffington Post, 'As the speaker often says to his colleagues, you only tease the ones you love.' Boehner hasn't been coy about his interest in tackling immigration reform. Last he said he was ""hell bent"" on doing so before the 113th Congress adjourns at the end of this year . This is the second time in the last seven days that Boehner's nabbed headlines for coming off as a little too eager to pass immigration reform. After Boehner's 'hell bent' comment at a Las Vegas, Nevada gathering of Republican donors last Thursday, Buck told reporters that 'nothing has changed' and immigration reform wasn't on the table at this time. 'Everyone can tell their editors to chill. The House’s focus remains on jobs and the economy,' Buck said in an email to reporters, followed by an on-the-record statement that, 'Nothing has changed.' 'As he's said many times, the Speaker believes . step-by-step reform is important, but it won't happen until the . president builds trust and demonstrates a commitment to the rule of law,' Buck's statement read. Boehner quickly tried to shift gears and get back on message on Friday after his immigration comments made national news. The Speaker announced mid-morning via a video posted to his Facebook page that he would be giving this week's Republican address on behalf of the party. 'We'll be talking about jobs, healthcare and much more,' Boehner says in the video. Boehner's Facebook audience had most certainly heard about his immigration remarks. Within an hour, the video already had more than 150 unique comments, many of which referenced immigration reform. 'Please include in your speech exactly how rewarding criminals with amnesty will help jobs in Ohio,' Facebook user Seamus Joyce commented below the video. 'No amnesty,' said several others. While some of the immigration comments on the video were pro-reform, the bulk were not. 'If the Republicans sell us out on . amnesty, it is game over for liberty in America, Judson Phillips, . founder of Tea Party Nation said in a fundraising email on Friday. Boehner's congressional seat is up for re-election this fall, and three Republicans are challenging the Speaker of the House in the party's May 6 primary. Opponent J.D. Winteregg, a high school French teacher who thinks Boehner has 'electile dysfunction' and has the backing of national Tea Party organization The Tea Party Leadership Fund, asked if Boehner was, 'Auditioning for an MSNBC gig?' in a tweet accompanying a link to the Enquirer's story.","House Speaker John Boehner spoke at a luncheon in his Ohio congressional district on Thursday .

"President Obama reportedly only ate half of the expensive sushi dinner he was treated to last night in Tokyo. Instead of savoring every morsel of the made-to-order 20-course meal at Sukiyabashi Jiro- dubbed the world's best sushi restaurant and the subject of the 2011 documentary 'Jiro Dreams of Sushi'- the President reportedly put his chopsticks down after only 10 pieces. The owner of a chicken restaurant that sits in the same basement as the exclusive diner told Tokyo Broadcasting System that Obama stopped at the halfway point even though the famed chef, Jiro Ono, was making each piece especially for the world leaders. Prime seating: President Obama joined Prime Minister Shinzo Abe for dinner Thursday at the exclusive 10-seat eatery but apparently only ate half of the 20 courses that the famed chef makes for each customer . Less formal but not relaxed: A spy within the restaurant reported that the two men launched immediately into trade talks as soon as they sat down for sushi and sake . Unlike Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe munched the whole way through the offerings from the legendary 88-year-old chef, who times the meal to the customer's pace. Adding to the drama surrounding their meal at the exclusive 10-seat eatery, the $300-per-person meal was billed as a chance for bonding but a sushi chef from the restaurant said that the leaders' chat was quite formal. Instead of making small talk and savouring Japanese delicacies at Sukiyabashi Jiro, Obama jumped straight into discussions about trade. Outwardly, everything appeared to go fine, with both leaders showing their informal approach to the meal by forgoing ties and praising the food afterwards. intimate: The famed 88-year-old chef Jiro Ono, who was featured in the hit documentary Jiro Dreams Of Sushi (pictured), is said to make each piece of the meal himself and serve it directly to the diners . Hand-made: The menu at the restaurant, which was the first sushi restaurant to earn three Michelin stars, is made up daily and the diners have no say in what the chef makes them . 'That's some good sushi right there,' Obama said to a crowd of journalists waiting outside. Abe said they had discussed 'a wide range of topics in a relaxed atmosphere' and added even more praise for the food. 'The sushi I had too was the best I had in my life, so far,' Abe said. The leaders were joined by American Ambassador Caroline Kennedy and United Nations Ambassador Susan Rice. Satisfied: After the meal, Prime Minister Abe said that it was the best sushi he has had in his life . Smile for the cameras: Obama didn't let on that he stopped halfway through the meal . Chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga refused Thursday to be drawn on exactly how much the US president had eaten, saying only: 'It's true that he ate a good amount'. 'I can tell from his expression he was very much satisfied,' he added. The dinner 'played a great role in building trust between the leaders as they had talks in a relaxed atmosphere.' Trade is one of the thornier issues at play in the three-day visit, with the two leaders under pressure to make progress on auto and agricultural market access issues blocking agreement on the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership.","President Obama had a 'relaxed' dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday night .

"Great white sharks are feared man eaters - but this monster was in the mood for a spot of cannablism. The vicious shark burst from the water to rip into another great white, cementing the giant marine mammal's reputation as the ocean's most fearsome predator. The sensational moment was caught on camera by 33-year-old Adam Malski. Mr Malski had been enjoying the picturesque views off the Neptune Islands, South Australia, when a shark measuring 2.6m ate the bait off the side of their boat. A split second later a shark double the size broke through the surface of the water and sunk its razor-sharp teeth into its rival's head - much to the amazement of the people on board the boat. Scroll down for video . The shark (left) sunk its teeth into the other great white which was half its size . The other shark was only 2.6 metres long when the attack happened off the Neptune Islands in South Australia . The smaller shark was eating the bait off the side of the boat at the time of the unexpected attack . Mr Malski, who is from London but now lives in Sydney, had been diving earlier that day and spotted the shark - known as 'Gilbert' to the locals - underwater hours before. He said the trip consisted of two full days of bottom (15-25m) diving and surface diving and a day of transit either side. 'The day where the shark attacked the other was surreal. I asked the dive master and skipper of the boat what would happen if a smaller shark got in the way of a larger shark,' he said. 'The skipper responded, 'The big shark would take the smaller one down'. 'Literally six seconds later, that amazing scene was witnessed by me, the skipper and the dive master. 'They had never seen anything like it before. I believe that it is extremely rare footage as great whites are elusive and still largely unknown creatures.' Despite witnessing the brutal attack, Mr Malski says his diving trip changed his view on sharks. 'I spent many hours observing them in their territory and up close and saw 18 magnificent creatures in total. All of which were inquisitive but not aggressive,' he said. 'Even when one bumped my hand and camera when I was 20 metres underwater, there was no aggression - just inquisitiveness.' Gilbert has since been spotted in the waters around Neptune Islands - but the smaller shark has not been seen since. The skipper said 'the big shark would take the smaller one down' 'Literally six seconds later, that amazing scene was witnessed by me, the skipper and the dive master,' Adam Malski said .

"While alleged balcony murderer Gable Tostee might be out on bail, Queensland Police have requested assistance from dating app Tinder to help gather evidence for his prosecution. Tostee, 28, left a Brisbane prison on bail last week, three months after he was arrested for the alleged murder of Warriena Wright in Surfers Paradise. The US administrators of Tinder are being pushed by Australian authorities to aid their search for more than 50 women from Australia and overseas who were allegedly contacted by Mr Tostee via the app. Scroll down for video . Gable Tostee arriving at his parents' home in Carrara home after his release from prison . This photo Mr Tostee loaded onto the Facebook page 'Hottest/beautiful teenagers' in January . Bail documents indicate that investigators are pursuing statements from the women and have requested data from both Mr Tostee and Ms Wright's Tinder accounts, reported The Australian. Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, just hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via the mobile dating app. The information provided by the women could prove a crucial element of the case against Mr Tostee, with Gold Coast Police Prosecutions legal division sergeant Michael Campbell labelling Mr Tostee's contact with 'persons over the dating site' as 'substantial'. In an email to Mr Tostee's lawyers, Sergeant Campbell said that 'Police conducted extensive inquiries in relation to the defendant's' actions on Tinder. Tragic death: Warriena Wright (pictured) fell to her death from the 14th floor of Gable Tostee's Surfers Paradise apartment in the early hours of August 8 this year, just days before the 26-year-old was due to return home to New Zealand . Tinder date: Gable Tostee (pictured) says he did not murder Warriena Wright,following their meeting via the mobile dating app Tinder in Cavill Mall, Surfers Paradise, then on to his nearby high rise apartment . Sergeant Campbell noted that while the majority of witness statements for the case had already been collected, police were still chasing 50 outstanding statements from witnesses interstate and overseas. The revelation follows Mr Tostee's release on strict bail conditions, which include an alcohol ban, treatment for alcohol abuse, random breath testing and abstinence from not only Tinder, but all social media to try to meet up with women. A photo released to Daily Mail Australia shows a post Mr Tostee loaded onto the Facebook page 'Hottest/beautiful teenagers', with the caption: 'I am feeling ultra sexy today cus I just got a new haircut. It gets me all kinds of pu**y. My friends have the same haircut cus they saw all the ass I pull and well, they get lots of pu**y too.' The photo was posted to the page in January of this year, with Mr Tostee commenting later 'I took this photo with my d**k'. Tostee has been in custody at the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre since he was arrested in mid-August and charged with murdering New Zealand woman, Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor apartment on August 8. At his bail hearing, prosecutors alleged he locked 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony and that was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate. Accused murderer Gable Tostee has walked from a Brisbane prison on bail three months after he was arrested for alleged murder of Warriena Wright . The Avalon apartments (above) in Surfers Paradise on Queensland's Gold Coast were the scene of the fatal fall by Warriena Wright 14 storeys to the ground at around 2.20am on August 8 this year . Strict conditions: Gable Tostee will live at his parents, Gary and Helene's house (pictured) while on bail, not drink alcohol, not use dating app Tinder and be under a 6pm to 6am curfew . Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'. The 28-year-old will spend at least the next 14 months awaiting trial at his parents home at Carrara, west of Surfers Paradise, and is not expected to stand trial until at least 2016. Mr and Mrs Tostee, who were in the Brisbane Supreme Court for the decision, have put up a $200,000 surety to reduce the flight risk of their 28-year-old son. Granting Tostee bail, Justice Debra Mullins said the strict conditions imposed on him would reduce the risk of him fleeing. ‘I am satisfied the applicant has shown cause as to why his detention in custody is not justified,’ Justice Mullins said. Crown prosecutor Ben Power argued there was a strong risk Tostee would flee with the threat of a mandatory 20-year prison sentence looming. Fatal meeting: Warriena Wright (above, left) was holidaying on the Gold Coast after attending a friend's wedding, when the 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk fell to her death from Gable Tostee's (above, right) high rise balcony apartment. Mr Tostee has been granted bail and will be released . But defence barrister Soraya Ryan argued Tostee's public profile meant he couldn't hide from authorities. Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a damning police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. The prosecution claims Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him. Justice Mullins has made mention during the hearing of the accused’s autism and social anxiety.

"From magnets to 'invisibility' wetsuits, scientists have tried many tactics to help swimmers evade the potentially deadly jaws of sharks. Now, an inventor  has developed a wearable device that emits the sounds of killer whales, which are known to attack sharks. The 'SharkStopper Personal Shark Repellent' device is designed to be attached to a surfer’s ankle and has been shown to repel sharks in waters filled with bait. Scroll down for video . You won't need a bigger boat: An inventor from Long Island, New York, has developed a wearable device for surfers and swimmers that emits the sounds of killer whales - known to attack sharks - to scare off the toothy predators, including great white, hammerhead, tiger and lemon sharks . It is thought the sound will scare off sharks including great white, bull, tiger, hammerhead, blacktip, lemon, nurse, sand and Caribbean reef. Brian Wynne, 52, from Long Island, New York, is raising funds for his SharkStopper on crowd funding site Kickstarter, has spent 10 years developing the product. He worked with marine biologists and shark experts to test it on different species and in various locations, including in ‘extreme circumstances' when the water was filled with blood and other bait to tempt sharks. The predators came within five feet (1.5 metres) of the device but turned back at this point when they heard the noisy device, Mr Wynne claims. Thh inventor worked with marine biologists to find a frequency to repel sharks (illustrated). He explained that the sound includes that of a pod of orcas and scares sharks either because they are wary of the killer whales, or they simply don’t want to deal with the disturbance the device creates . Sound: The SharkStopper emits a low power acoustic signal. Experts agree that killer whales - sharks' main predators - use a variety of complex sounds. The device emulates these noises so that the frequency, combined with the sharks' natural fear of their main predator, keeps them at a safe distance. Weight and size: 4 inches (10cm) long and 2 inches (5cm) wide. Power: Rechargeable battery. Wearable: It's designed to be worn on the ankle because sharks can appear in less than 2ft (1metre) of water. Effects on the body: The inventor claims there are no adverse effects on the human body because the device uses sound waves audible to sharks in one direction. It does not harm sharks either. Tests: The device has been tested in shark hotspots including the Bahamas, Mexico, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts and New York. Cost: Available to pre-order on Kickstarter for $225 (£139). While the deterrent may be large, the device itself is small, measuring four inches (10cm) long and two inches (5cm) wide, weighing just 0.3lbs (140g), which is roughly the weight of a smartphone. It is powered by a rechargeable battery and lasts for around six to seven hours. Mr Wynne said he came up with the idea for the SharkStopper when his mother told him about the constant shark attacks in Volusia County, Florida, where she had moved to from New York. ‘Volusia County Florida is the shark attack capital of the world. This title is for bites, not fatalities,’ he said. ‘After hearing about these repeated attacks in Florida, I investigated sound as a possible deterrent to sharks. ‘It took a couple of years and multiple locations with different species of sharks until I was convinced that I found the right sound that would repel sharks.’ Mr Wynne talked to surfers and was surprised to find that many of them have seen sharks in the water. ‘Surfers are an amazing group, they know the dangers of the sport - like rip currents, rogue waves and sharks - yet they continue to go out and enjoy the sport they love,’ he said. The device has been tested in shark hotspots including the Bahamas, Mexico, Florida, Hawaii, Massachusetts and New York on great whites (pictured left) tiger and sand tiger sharks (pictured right) which are among the species responsible for the most attacks on humans . While the deterrent may be large, the device itself is small, measuring four inches (10cm) long and two inches (5cm) wide, weighing just 0.3lbs (140g) so it can be worn on a surfer's ankle (pictured) Great white sharks, tiger sharks and bull sharks pose the most threat to humans, according to statistics and journal reports of shark attack fatalities. They may be the biggest offenders because of their size. Great Whites can be 20ft long. Even if one of these species is not intending to attack a human, the size of its jaws are huge and they have teeth designed to rip instead of hold. The International Shark Attack File includes 279 known attacks on humans since records began, 78 of which were fatal, Discovery reported. Sand tiger, blacktip, hammerhead and spinner sharks have all been responsible for between 100 and 16 deaths attacks each. ‘We set out at the beginning to investigate sound as a possible shark repellent. ‘We always believed sound can attract sharks but it must also repel them because sharks pick up the sounds of splashing and the sounds of injured prey. ‘Sharks have an inner ear made up of three semicircular canals. Inside each canal are four sensory areas which are responsible for both balance and sound perception. ‘Sharks hear sounds with frequencies ranging from 10Hz to 1KHz, and are especially responsive to sounds 500Hz or lower. ‘We found a particular frequency range and modulation that was effective against many species of sharks.’ He explained that the sound includes that of a pod of killer whales and scares sharks either because they are scared of the predators, or they simply don’t want to deal with the disturbance the device creates. The device is available to pre-order on Kickstarter for $225 (£139) with an estimated delivery date of January. Sharks hear sounds with frequencies ranging from 10Hz to 1KHz, and are especially responsive to sounds 500Hz or lower. In tests, the inventor found that sharks will not come within five feet of the noisy device, which if worn by swimmers, could protect them in the water (illustrated) Sharks may have a fearsome reputation, but they can also be solitary, preferring to remain in the background, according to new research. UK scientists claim they have shown that the notorious predators have personality traits that determines how they behave in groups. A University of Exeter team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks in captivity under three different habitat types. The species of shark are found throughout the northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean and usually form mixed-sexed social groups driven by individual familiarity. Ten groups of sharks were monitored in large tanks containing three habitats which differed in their level of structural complexity. A University of Exeter team tested for social personality by recording the interactions of groups of juvenile small spotted catsharks (pictured) in captivity under three different habitat types . 'We found that even though the sizes of the groups forming changed, socially well-connected individuals remained well-connected under each new habitat,' said Dr David Jacoby, a behavioural ecologist now at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), London. 'In other words, their social network positions were repeated through time and across different habitats. 'These results were driven by different social preferences that appeared to reflect different strategies for staying safe. ' The study found that well-connected sharks formed groups, while less social individuals tended to camouflage alone, matching their skin colour with the colour of the gravel at the bottom of the tank. 'In the wild these small juveniles can make easy prey items for larger fish, so different anti-predator strategies are likely to have evolved,' said Professor Darren Croft, of the Centre for Research into Animal Behaviour at Exeter.","Device is intended to be attached to a surfer or swimmer's ankle .

"These kind-hearted divers removed a fishing hook from the jaws of a 6ft silky shark after coaxing it into a natural trance. Friends Cameron Nimmo, 26, and Mickey Smith, 25, grabbed the fish by the tail and twisted it upside down, paralysing it in a state called tonic immobility. It is a well-known phenomenon that affects certain shark species, including Great Whites and tiger sharks, and can last for up to 15 minutes. Scroll down for video . Just when you thought it was safe: Divers Cameron Nimmo and Mickey Smith, from Florida, make it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths and bodies of the silky sharks they encounter in coastal waters . Success: Mr Nimmo, 26, holds up the hook after removing it from the shark's jaws. Although twisting the animals upside down puts them in a state called tonic immobility, this one quickly awoke and swam away . But when the pair - who nickname themselves Shark Addicts - removed the hook with a pair of pliers, it was enough to stir the animal rapidly back into life as it darted away. The friends see anywhere from five to 20 sharks on each dive off the coast of Jupiter, Florida, and say three-quarters of them have hooks embedded somewhere in their bodies. Fishermen often target silky sharks, which are numerous off the southeastern U.S. coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. But they can also be caught accidentally by people trying to catch other species such as tuna. Mr Nimmo said: 'It happens when people who are fishing. They catch them and cut the line so they don't have to bring it on the boat, or the shark breaks the line. Tough job: The pair use pliers to extract the hooks, which they say affect three-quarters of the sharks they see . Technique: The sharks are flipped upside down by holding them gently by the tail and twisting their bodies . Flipped: Once the sharks are the wrong way up, they are paralysed for up to 15 minutes. Scientists disagree over the origins of the phenomenon, which affects several species and can be triggered in different ways . 'Taking a hook out feels great, knowing you have helped one of these magnificent creatures makes it all worth it.' The Shark Addicts said they had made it their mission to remove hooks from the mouths, noses and bodies of every shark they can. 'I love popping the hooks out,' said Mr Nimmo. 'There is some danger there but the last thing I'm thinking about it getting bitten - I just want to get the hook out. 'We love sharks so much and want to be around them as much as possible. We are trying to changes people's perspective on sharks through the videos that Mickey films. 'We want to help protect our oceans and marine life.' Animal kingdom: The pair love sharks and despite silky sharks growing up to 10ft, they rarely feel in danger . Despite publicity, shark attacks are relatively extremely rare. Mr Nimmo said: 'We are trying to changes people's perspective on sharks through our videos. We want to help protect our oceans and marine life' The friends hope to turn their passion into a business and teach others about the importance of caring for sharks. Silky sharks are common near the coasts of the Americas, Australia and West Africa. They can live for more than 20 years and grow up to 10ft long, and although their size and jaws make them potentially dangerous to humans, attacks are fairly rare.","Cameron Nimmo, 26, and Mickey Smith, 25, often dive near Jupiter, Florida .

"They are the undisputed predators of the ocean, armed with razor-sharp teeth, capable of reaching speeds of 35mph - and now a great white shark could be headed towards Britain. A ferocious predator - called Lydia - is currently just 1,000 miles of the coast of Cornwall and Ireland in the Atlantic. And if she continues on her path, the 14.5ft, 2,000lb beast could arrive in British waters by Monday, which would make her the first great white to cross the Atlantic. She was tagged as part of the Ocearch . project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their . movements and Lydia’s progress can be followed on the project’s website. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Deadly cargo: Tagging the shark (pictured) was a feat in itself, with heavy machinery used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device . Lydia was tagged by the Ocearch project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements . She has swum more than 19,000 miles since a tracking device was fitted to her near Florida as part of the Ocearch scientific project. She is currently near the mid-Atlantic ridge and researchers tracking her progress said she has travelled 380miles in just 72 hours. 'She technically does not cross the . Atlantic until she crosses the mid-Atlantic ridge, which she has yet to . do,’ said Dr Gregory Skomal, senior fisheries biologist with . Massachusetts Marine Fisheries. He believes she is closer to Europe than North America. Lydia has swum 380-miles in just 72 hours and is currently near the mid-Atlantic ridge (marked). If she swims over the mid-Atlantic range then she will be the first recorded great white to cross the Atlantic Ocean . The shark has travelled more than 19,000 miles since a tracking device was fitted to her near Florida as part of the Ocearch scientific project . In transit: Lydia is currently near the mid-Atlantic ridge - Dr Gregory Skomal says she technically does not cross the Atlantic until she crosses the ridge . 'We have no idea how far she will go, but Europe, the Med, and the coast of Africa are all feasible,' Dr Skomal said. The act of tagging the shark, let alone predicting where it will travel, was a feat in itself. A 75,000lb hydraulic platform was used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device. Though Lydia's journey is impressive, great whites are known for their marathon migrations. In 2003 a great white nicknamed Nicole travelled from South Africa to Australia and back - a some 12,400 miles. In recent years there have been several sightings of Great whites off the coast of Britain. In September last year, fisherman David Bond said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of Looe in southern Cornwall. The suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a 'giant shark' get close to his vessel. All those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark, saying the creature was much larger, prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a Great white. Great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world, reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight. Satelitte tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long-distance journeys. The OCEARCH Global Shark Tracker Project has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009. The study has shown that Great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months. They . are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, . New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the . Gulf coast and Hawaii. The . creatures have a ferocious reputation but are respsonsible for between a . third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each . year. They are highly adapted predators, detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away. Their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth, arranged across several rows. Gathering . speed and approaching their prey from beneath, Great whites can leap . clear of the water, breaching like whales to attack. They commonly feed on sea lions, seals, small toothed whales, and sea turtles. The predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year. If food is scarce, the sharks will try to avoid fighting, instead engaging in a tail-slapping contest along the surface of the water. The winner delivers the most slaps. Scientists . do not have a reliable idea of the species' population across the . world, but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and . sharks being caught accidentally in nets. They are listed as an endangered species.","Lydia, a satellite-tagged 15ft, 2,000lb great white, is currently 1,000 miles from the coast of Cornwall and Ireland .

"Two fishermen captured scenes of sharks feeding in British waters worthy of the film classic Jaws - all for just £5. Instead of using high-tech safety equipment, the pair risked life and limb by shot the never-before-seen footage from the inside of a converted laundry trolley. Martin Bowler, 41, and Michael Jackson, 46, said they pushed their luck 'as far as we could' as they whipped the blue and porbeagle sharks into a feeding frenzy. Scroll down for video . Jaws: Skipper Andre Alsop, left, Martin Bowler, left, and Michael Jackson, right, holding a blue shark. Mr Jackson filmed never-before-seen footage from a homemade cage of the fish in British waters . Dangerous: Michael Jackson was lowered into the water among dozens of sharks in just a converted laundry trolley . Damaged: The cage, which was picked up for free from a scrapyard, has been bent after an eight foot blue shark charged at Mr Jackson . The unique footage has been added to an independent DVD about the underwater filming of fish in their natural environment. Mr Jackson, who was in the cage, . experienced one nerve-wracking moment when an aggressive eight-foot-long . blue shark rammed into the front of the trolley, making a large dent in . it. The pair, from Wiltshire, planned the . dangerous shoot so they could be the first to film the lethal sharks in . that state in British waters. Mr Bowler, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, admitted they had concerns about the safety of Mr Jackson. He said: 'We did ask ourselves how safe Michael would be in the cage. 'We couldn’t afford to do proper health and safety checks but we did a risk assessment beforehand and we decided to risk it.' VIDEO: The two fishermen shoot unique footage of sharks in British waters . They recovered a 6ft tall, three-sided metal trolley for free from a scrapyard to use as a 'shark proof' cage. The trolley was then fixed to the back a boat using a 30ft bungee rope, which they already owned. Chicken wire - the only item they had . to pay for - was wrapped around the front for added protection and three . large floats were placed underneath to give it buoyancy. They charted a fishing boat to the . Celtic Deeps, an area where the Atlantic, English Channel and Irish Sea . merge about 30 miles off the Cornish coast. It is brimming with sharks that are said to be venturing further north in the hunt for food. Mr Jackson climbed into the cage wearing a wetsuit and snorkel and carrying a water-proof HD video camera. They baited the area with ‘chum’ - a . mixture of fish heads and guts - to attract numerous blue and porbeagle . sharks and whip them into a feeding frenzy.

'There was no way we could afford our own shark cage or hire one so we decided to improvise as best we could. 'We picked up an old linen trolley from a scrapyard that is made of metal and weighs about 75lbs. 'It only had three sides so we used . some wire on the front up to waist height. That enabled Michael to lean . out of the cage and fend off the sharks with the video camera. 'We put three floats on top of it to give the cage buoyancy.' After baiting the water up, the two . men were joined by half a dozen porbeagle and blue sharks that measured . up to 8ft in length and weighed about 180lbs.

"Russia must address a worsening situation of widespread violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people, human rights campaigners said today. Human Rights Watch has compiled a stark video incorporating clips from some of the worst examples of homophobic violence in Russia which has been filmed and uploaded to the internet. It hopes to pressure the Russian government into action by inciting international opprobrium ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which begins on Friday. Victims: LGBT campaigners stand in a huddle as they are photographed after being beaten by homophobic gangs during a protest, in a grab taken from a video of clips compiled by Human Rights Watch . A man yanks on the bag held by one of the gay activists during the protest, in scenes increasingly common in Russia . The country has faced fierce criticism over the climate of fear endured by Russian gays ahead of the Games, with opposition focused around a new law banning the dissemination of 'gay propaganda' to children. 'The Russian authorities have the power to protect the rights of LGBT people, but instead they are ignoring their responsibility to do so,' said Tanya Cooper, Russia researcher at Human Rights Watch. 'By turning a blind eye to hateful homophobic rhetoric and violence, Russian authorities are sending a dangerous message as the world is about to arrive on its doorstep for the Olympics that there is nothing wrong with attacks on gay people.' Victims in cities including Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk told researchers from Human Rights Watch they were attacked in public places, abducted, beaten, harassed, threatened, and psychologically abused. They told the campaign group that they were afraid to go to the police to report violence, fearing further harassment and believing the police would not bother to pursue their attackers. When victims did lodge complaints with the police, few investigations followed, it is claimed. A gang filmed beating a lone gay man in a video uploaded to and distributed on a Russian social network . Human Rights Watch hopes to pressure the Russian government into action over violent homophobia by inciting international opprobrium ahead of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, which begins on Friday . There has been a disturbing rise in the publication of videos on social networks showing self-described vigilantes dishing out punishment beatings and humiliations to gay people. Starting in late 2012, numerous groups mainly consisting of radical nationalists began attacking and harassing gay people in dozens of Russian cities. Mostly claiming to be fighting pedophilia, these groups lure men and boys to meet, accuse them of being gay, humiliate and beat them, and post videos of the proceedings on social networks, intentionally exposing their victims to further abuse. These groups have posted hundreds of the sickening videos online, often barely bothering to hide their identities because of the apparent impunity in which they are able to operate. Impunity: Many of the ultra-nationalist gangs are so unafraid of any action being taken by the authorities that they make no attempt to disguise their identities in the videos which they upload to the internet . When victims of homophobia did lodge complaints with the police, few investigations followed, it is claimed . The adoption of the federal law banning 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors' is but one measure among several federal anti-LGBT laws proposed or adopted in the past year in Russia. Violating the law is an administrative offense punishable by a range of fines. Media and organizations face particularly hefty fines, while foreigners  who violate the law are subject to fines, up to 15 days in detention and deportation. The law also bans representing 'traditional' and 'nontraditional' relationships as equally acceptable. That makes it illegal to say anything positive about being gay publicly or to tell a child that there is nothing wrong with being gay or being raised by gay parents. At the same time, Human Rights Watch reports, a vicious homophobic campaign began in the media, particularly state- sponsored and state-controlled media outlets. The group's research found that government officials, journalists, and celebrities have publicly called LGBT people 'perverts', 'sodomites', and 'abnormal', and have conflated homosexuality with pedophilia. Climate of fear: The attacks come as several anti-homosexual laws have been passed in Russia's parliament . Horrific: The ferocity of the violence seen in some of the clips in HRW's compilation is shocking . Left for dead: HRW has warned the Russian government that it must get a grip on the problem . Miss Cooper said: 'The discriminatory impact of the anti-LGBT law and hateful language on state television have created a climate of intolerance against the Russian LGBT community. 'Russian leaders should denounce, not feed, homophobic hysteria, or the Kremlin’s silence will be taken as condoning the violence.' She added: 'Russian officials have long denied that discrimination against LGBT people exists, including to the International Olympic Committee, yet the hostility and violence clearly have been intensifying. 'As Russia hosts the Olympics in this atmosphere of homophobic hatred, the government needs to take urgent measures to support the rights of LGBT people and protect them.'","Human Rights Watch compiles clips of homophobic violence in Russia .

"A long-lost avant-garde painting has been found by a sharp-eyed art historian who recognised the work in the background of 90s children's movie Stuart Little. Gergely Barki, 43, a researcher at Hungary's National Gallery, noticed Sleeping Lady with Black Vase by 20th Century painter Robert Bereny while watching TV with his daughter Lola in 2009. The painting, which is up for auction at a starting price of 110,000 euros (£87,200), had been bought by the film's set designer for 'next-to-nothing' in an antique shop in California. Lost and found: Art historian Gergerly Barki spotted the lost painting being used as a prop in 1999 film Stuart Little, starring Hugh Laurie and Geena Davies . Sleeping Lady with Black Vase disappeared in the 1920s but appeared before Mr Barki's eyes, hanging on the wall in  Stuart Little, a children's film from 1999 starring Michael J Fox, Geena Davies and Hugh Laurie. Mr Barki recognised it immediately even though he had only seen a faded black-and-white photo dating from a 1928 exhibition archived in the National Gallery. 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Bereny's long-lost masterpiece on the wall behind Hugh Laurie, I nearly dropped Lola from my lap,' Mr Barki said . 'A researcher can never take his eyes off the job, even when watching Christmas movies at home,' he said. Mr Barki sent a flurry of emails to staff at the film's makers Sony Pictures and Columbia Pictures, finally receiving a reply two year later, from one of the film's set designers. Back home again: The painting, which had been bought by a Stuart Little set designer in a California antique shop for 'next-to-nothing' in the 90s, is now up for auction at a starting price of 110,000 euros (£87,200) Treasure: Gergely Barki poses in front of  Hungarian artist Robert Bereny's Sleeping Lady with Black Vase in the Virag Judit Art Gallery in Budapest after the painting returned to Hungary after nine decades . 'She said the picture was hanging on her wall,' Mr Barki said . 'She had snapped it up for next-to-nothing in an antiques shop in Pasadena, California, thinking its avant-garde elegance was perfect for Stuart Little's living room.' After leaving Sony, the set-designer sold the painting to a private collector who has now brought the picture to Budapest for auction. Robert Bereny, the leader of a pre-World War I avant-garde movement called the 'Group of Eights', fled to Berlin in 1920 after designing recruitment posters for Hungary's short-lived communist revolution in 1919. In the German capital, he had a romance with actress Marlene Dietrich, and later returned to Hungary where he died in 1953. Bereny's painting goes under the hammer December 13 with a starting price of around 110,000 euros (£87,200), staff at the Virag Judit auction house said. According to Barki, the buyer at the 1928 exhibition, possibly Jewish, is likely to have left Hungary in the run-up to, or during, World War II. 'After the wars, revolutions, and tumult of the 20th century many Hungarian masterpieces are lost, scattered around the world,' he said.","Lost 20th Century art by Hungarian painter spotted in children's film .

"A Latvian man who left a baby girl with a serious brain injury after smashing a lorry into a car driven by her police officer father has been jailed for nine months. Warehouse worker Gendrihs Kuplovs-Okinskis, 44, of Southend, admitted he had not driven a lorry in a long time but claims his bosses at Peacock Foods ordered him to get behind the wheel of a bread delivery truck or lose his job. He veered into the path of oncoming traffic and smashed into a Vauxhall Zafira driven by off-duty policeman David Moon. Heartbreaking: Little Maisie in intensive care in hospital. She suffered a serious head injury after a lorry driven by Gendrihs Kuplovs-Okinskis smashed into her father's car . The Vauxhall was destroyed in the September 6 accident and Maisie, aged 15 months at the time, suffered serious head injuries and had to be flown to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for life-saving treatment. The two-year-old is still receiving physiotherapy and speech therapy as a result of her injuries. Mr Moon suffered a broken rib and his other daughter, Ella, was left with cuts and bruises. Samantha Leigh, prosecuting, told . Chelmsford Crown Court Kuplovs-Okinskis, who has an HGV licence, . over-corrected after avoiding low-hanging branches on a road in Earls . Colne, Essex. He was not speeding and the lorry was found to have no . defects. The Moon family at Essex Air Ambulance base. Mother Nicola, father David, Maisie (in pink jacket) and sisters Ella and Melissa . Shauna Ritchie, mitigating, told the court Kuplovs-Okinskis had a valid licence to drive HGVs in his native Latvia and in the UK, but had not driven a lorry for a significant period. He was pressed into service as a driver by his boss at short notice, the court heard. Mrs Ritchie said: 'He is hard working and has been trying to make his way in this country. He did not wish to drive as part of his employment. 'This is an unusual case of dangerous driving because the bad driving was not prolonged, persistent, deliberate or aggressive. 'No sentence can compensate the Moon family for what they have been through, but custody will do no better. 'He says it was his mistake and one he will always regret. He should have said no to driving and taken the consequences himself. 'He genuinely struggles to live with what he has done.' Kuplovs-Okinskis admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for nine months and banned from driving for two years. Judge John Dodd QC, addressing Kuplovs-Okinskis, said: 'No sentence I can pass can properly address the gravity of the injuries caused. 'I accept you have expressed real and profound remorse for your actions and the consequences. 'You made the fateful decision to take the wheel of a lorry at the insistence of your employer and the prosecution and the defence agree you were placed under inappropriate pressure.' The court heard the police have taken action against Peacock Foods in Halstead, Essex for not holding an operator's licence. Mr Moon, speaking after the hearing, said: 'It is nice the case has finished and we can close the book and go back to caring for Maisie and what she is going to need as she gets older. 'She is doing really well. She is recovering well but things with the brain injury are only just showing, which we were warned would be the case.'","Gendrihs Kuplovs-Okinskis drove into family car after dodging tree branch .

"Many brides find themselves  desperately trying to lose a pound or two just before their big day to make sure they fit into their dress. Tsia Pullen had a more drastic plan. She was so determined to lose weight for her wedding that she decided to have plastic surgery – and sold her house to pay for it. Mrs Pullen, who weighed 18 stone at her heaviest, spent £22,000 on a variety of cosmetic operations abroad, including a gastric band which helped her drop seven dress sizes and lose ten stone. Investment: Tsia Pullen paid £19,000 towards surgery - as well as spending £3,000 - on travel . Tsia was overjoyed to be a beautiful bride. Tsia when she weighed 18st. 'I'd struggled with my weight all my life,' she says . The money came from her £80,000 . semi-detached house, which she put on the market within weeks of her . engagement to her then fiance, Alastair. Seven years on, the couple have finally tied the knot – and Mrs Pullen is convinced it all was worth it. Last night the 34-year-old said: ‘People thought I was insane, but I knew it was the right thing to do.‘It . was the first house I’d ever bought, it had a massive garden and I was . proud of it. But more than anything I wanted to look amazing on my . wedding day.’ Tsia in hospital after surgery in Belgium where she had a gastric band fitting, an arm and thigh lift as well as breast implants, costing £22,000 in total . Tsia's final procedure was a tummy tuck to . remove the excess skin she was left with after her weight loss (left), . though the operation left her with bruising (right) but she says it was . all worth it . Tsia met Alistair through her job as a receptionist for a taxi firm when he called up to book a car in 2003 . Tsia said that although Alistair, pictured with her at her heaviest, loved her regardless, she didn't want to be an overweight bride . At her heaviest, 5ft 1in Mrs Pullen weighed 18 stone and wore a dress size 24. ‘I hated myself so much,’ she said. ‘I . used to end up in tears when I went shopping – nothing fitted, and as . well as the embarrassment, walking around the shops would leave me . breathless and in agony as I was so big.’ In 2003 Mrs Pullen, who worked as a receptionist in a taxi  firm, took a . phone call ‘from a friendly-sounding male voice, who turned out to be . Alastair’. ‘He’d only . phoned for a taxi, but he was warm, funny and friendly, and for months . we swapped messages and chatted on the phone before I plucked up the . courage to meet him,’ she said. Tsia says her lack of self confidence about her size before the weight loss (left) made it easy to make the extreme decision to sell her home to fund the cosmetic surgery to give her her dream body (right) ‘I . was certain he’d be put off by my body but Alastair didn’t bat an . eyelid. He loved me for me and our relationship quickly blossomed. Three . years later, in 2006, he proposed. ‘But . then it hit me – this awful vision of a bulging bride waddling down the . aisle. I didn’t want Alastair to have to marry me while I looked like . that. I wanted to be a beautiful bride.’ Mrs . Pullen didn’t have any savings, but she did own her own home. So she . made the decision to sell the property, in Bolton, and move in with . Alastair, who lived in Spalding, Lincolnshire. Tsia shrunk to a trim size 10 and her breasts shrunk from a size 44GG to a 36FF . The . house sold for £80,000 and, after clearing the £55,000 mortgage, Mrs . Pullen was left with £25,000 for her plastic surgery. In April 2006 she . travelled to a private clinic in Belgium for her first operation, a . gastric band procedure which cost £8,000. In two years she shed ten stone, going from a size 24 to a size ten. Her bra size also went down to a 36FF from a 44GG. After spending £22,000 on surgery, Tsia is finally happy with what she sees in the mirror . In . 2008 she travelled back to the clinic for three further operations. In . June that year she spent £4,000 on arm and thigh lifts, followed by . £3,700 for a breast lift and liposuction three months later. She . spent another £3,500 on a  further breast uplift in December. The . procedures alone cost £19,000, but with travel and accommodation the . total bill was £22,000. Mrs . Pullen, who now runs her own business selling customised pram covers, . said: ‘It was a huge amount to pay for cosmetic surgery, and I know some . people would think badly of me for it, but it was worth every penny. ‘After . every painful operation I kept telling myself that the end result would . be worth it. When I started seeing the results, I could feel my . confidence soaring. I felt like a brand new person and for the first . time in my life, I felt sexy.’ The . final operation on Mrs Pullen’s list was a tummy tuck, scheduled for . April 2009. But that, and the couple’s wedding plans, had to be put on . hold when she became pregnant with her son Mylo, now four. Instead . she had the operation in October 2009, two months after his birth. Mrs . Pullen was eligible for the tummy tuck on the NHS, because doctors . agreed the excess skin she was carrying around her stomach was affecting . her self-esteem and mental wellbeing. The couple finally tied the knot on their ten-year anniversary, on May 18 this year. Mrs . Pullen said: ‘I had my slim-fit wedding dress ready and waiting and I . was so excited to put  it on and walk down the aisle. I felt like a . princess. ‘I really do . feel like the luckiest bride in the world. I don’t regret selling my . house to fund my surgery for one minute – it’s easily the best thing I . ever did.’","Tsia Pullen weighed 18st at 5ft 1in and hated her body .

"A 20 minute delay in the rescue of a scuba diver who drowned off the Norfolk coast has caused a row between lifeboat services. Chris Vanstone, 49, ran into difficulty 60 ft underwater while diving 17 miles out to sea on Friday. When he surfaced unconscious, a distress call was made while Mr Vanstone was given CPR. But the coastguard who took the distress call has been accused of ignoring a local lifeguard service in favour of a helicopter that took 40 minutes to reach the scene - a decision which cost 20 minutes. Although the delay was not the difference between life and death for Mr Vanstone, who could not have been saved even by the closer boast, the overlooked Caister lifeboat service has hit out at the decision to use slower alternatives to answer a distress call. Overlooked: The independent Caister lifeboat, pictured, was closest to Mr Vanstone but was not sent out by the Humber Coastguard . Humber Coastguard, who co-ordinated the rescue, sent an RNLI boat from Gorleston, Norfolk, and a helicopter from Suffolk, instead of using the Caister lifeboat service, whose base in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, was closest to the scene. The helicopter was called at 1.20pm but did not arrive for almost 40 minutes. Mr Vanstone, a plasterer from Brixton, South London was then airlifted to James Paget Hospital in Norfolk, and pronounced dead on arrival. An inquest later found that he had drowned. But in the wake of his death the leader of the Caister service has claimed they could have been there in half the time. Rescue: A coastguard helicopter took 40 minutes to reach Mr Vanstone, 49 (file photo) Paul Garrod, the chairman of the Caister service, said that the RNLI base was six miles further along the coast, meaning their boat took substantially longer to arrive, according to The Sun. ‘We could have been there 15 to 20 minutes before any other craft – helicopter or boat. And when you’ve got someone who very sadly died on the boat, you need help straightaway. When a boat puts a mayday out they want someone there now.', he said. ‘We’ve got the fastest boat in the country, and a 250-mile radius.’ A spokesman for the RNLI said: ‘The RNLI is co-ordinated by the coastguard. We respond when we are paged and launch as soon as possible. ‘Overall responsibility for which assets go to each rescue is for them to decide.’ A spokesman for the coastguard defended their decision to send a helicopter to Mr Vanstone rather than the closer lifeboat. She said: ‘In an incident off Great Yarmouth on Friday 30th August, Humber MRCC was contacted by a dive vessel reporting that one of their divers had surfaced and was in difficulty. ‘The incident occurred 17 miles offshore and the decision was made to send the RAF search and rescue helicopter from Wattisham as this was the quickest way to get the casualty to hospital. ‘The Gorleston RNLI all-weather lifeboat was also requested to launch to assist with the transportation of the dive buddy, particularly in view of the distance offshore.’","Chris Vanstone, 49, ran into difficulty diving off the Norfolk coast .

"Two boys who became trapped after a plow operator pushed snow over them survived for four hours thanks to a pocket of air, police said. Cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, and Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11, were recovering in the hospital after being dug out of a snowbank in Newburgh, New York, early Thursday morning. Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday. Cousins: Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez (left) and Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera (right) from Newburgh, New York, spent Thanksgiving in the hospital after the accident, which police said could have killed them . During their search, officers learned that the boys had been building a snow fort in the area of the nearby Family Health Center. They boys had been digging the fort out of the snow bank, when the plow truck came through and trapped them, police said. Officials finally found the boys around 2 a.m. on Thursday, after an officer saw a shovel half buried in the snow bank. 'After I saw the shovel, I just felt compelled to dig,' said 28-year-old Brandon Rola, a member of the Newburgh police force for 7 years, to FOX News. 'I really didn't put it together, but I just started digging.' The officer took the shovel and started to dig, and saw a small boot. Others joined in, some digging with bare hands, and the boys were found. Accident: Authorities said a snow plow operator had been clearing a parking lot by pushing snow over, and didn't see the boys on the other side of the pile . Rescue: A neighbor captured cell phone footage of the police and others frantically digging the boys out of the snow at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning . Snowdrift: The boys had been building a snow fort in an area of the nearby Family Health Center in Newburgh, New York . When police found a small boot, they called for paramedics, fearing they may have arrived too late. That is, until another officer, John Maguire, saw the boot start to twitch. 'When John saw that, we just started digging like crazy,' Rola said. 'But we only had the one shovel, and you're talking about a 7 or 8-foot snowpile.' 'We knocked on doors, got shovels, and pretty soon, we had maybe 10 people working on that pile.' The rescuers finally reached the two boys, who were suffering from exposure but still conscious after being trapped for around four hours unable to move their arms or legs. 'Thank goodness, they were bundled up in layers, so they were warm enough,' said Rola. 'They were probably in about five feet of snow,' Newburgh police Sgt Aaron Weaver told CBS New York. 'But however it fell, there was, like, a dome around their heads, so there was air in there, like space for them.' Weaver, who was among the rescuers, said the dome of air was the only thing that saved them. Both the victims were recovering on Thursday night at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. Family members said they are in a good condition. After getting some much-needed rest, Rola woke up to a Thanksgiving with his own family, conscious of the dramatic rescue hours before. 'It was a good day,' he said.","Jason 'J.J.' Rivera, 9, and Elijah 'Papito' Martinez, 11, from Newburgh, New York, had gone out to build a snow fort on Wednesday night .

"This is the incredible moment a cheeky shark photobombed a diver and even seemed to grin for the camera as it barged its way in to the shot. Photographer Jeffrey Haines, 52, was left stunned by the close encounter while diving in the Caribbean sea off the Bahamas coast. The underwater snapper, from Kerhonkson, New York, was attempting to take a picture of a fellow diver and tiger shark when the ten foot lemon shark swam into the frame. Coming through: a lemon shark takes diver Barbara Ziegler by surprise, bursting in to shot as Jeffrey Haines tries to take pictures of another shark. It appears to be grinning as it heads straight for the camera in this image taken in the Caribbean Sea off the Bahamas in January . He said: 'I was actually photographing the diver who was pointing at a rather large tiger shark, that's why the diver is still in focus and the shark isn't. 'But all of a sudden this lemon shark swam into the frame and photobombed the picture. 'It looked like it was smiling and it almost looked like it was saying 'hey take a picture of me'. 'Lemon sharks are really curious and this one was definitely checking me out. 'The images were taken during a one-week expedition in the Bahamas in January this year, but these particular images were taken on just one dive. Flashing a grin: this lemon shark arrived out of the blue as Jeffrey Haines was trying to take a picture of diver George Hughes . 'I remember this dive being very chaotic it was a really dynamic shoot with dozens of sharks.' Jeffrey said he took up photography in 2006 shortly after he began scuba diving. He said of all the dives he had photographed this particular trip was one of his most successful. 'For me photography and diving went hand in hand, I wanted to share my experience so I began taking photos to document what I saw,' he said. 'I'd been close to sharks before but . during this most recent dive I managed to get closer than i'd ever been . before, I encountered lemon, tiger, Caribbean reef and nurse sharks. 'When . you first start scuba diving you're initially scared about seeing . sharks but you're told to feel lucky if you do as an encounter with them . is so incredibly rare. For me this experience confirmed that for me. As diver Klaus-Peter Harter watches on, the lemon shark heads straight for the camera being held by New York photographer Jeffrey Haines. It swam into shot while Mr Haines, from New York, was trying to take pictures of a tiger shark in the Bahamas . After photobombing the picture, the lemon shark swims on to its side while diver George Hughes rests his hands on its head . 'You do have to be careful sharks don't see you as a threat. You have to make sure you cover up, just a flash of skin could be mistaken for a fish and they may grab your hand thinking it's prey. 'By the time the shark would realise it wasn't a fish, it would be too late. 'If a shark bit down hard just once it would most probably be fatal. 'But I was underwater for up to six hours every day for a week with these sharks and not once did they even attempt to bite me. 'It's feels incredibly humbling to get this close to sharks and so rare it would be the equivalent of a grizzly bear walking up to you, it's awe-inspiring.'

"An American real estate agent has calculated that the fictional value of Hogwarts is $204,102,000. David Cross, who writes novelty real estate evaluations for Movodo.com, came to his conclusion by looking at the school's estimated location, the price per square foot of comparable homes in the hypothetical area, and the approximate size of the building. While Mr Cross came up . with the final sum, he also enlisted the help of die-hard Harry Potter fans . to determine the factors that led to his calculation. Cost of a castle: A writer for American real estate website Movodo.com calculated the fictional value of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at $204,102,000 . Mr Cross had much of his work cut out for him by fans of the book series who had already attempted to figure out what the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry would be like if it were real. One such enthusiast created a blog to establish the school's approximate location in the United Kingdom by looking at certain clues from the novels. The writer calculated that the Hogwarts Express travels north at a speed of around 65mph, and it passes the towns of Norfolk and Peebles - a small town on the border of England and Scotland - on its way. Using these factors - as well as the amount of sunlight on the day of Harry's trip to the school - the fan concluded that the most likely location of Hogwarts is in Scotland's Galloway Hills. Taking this assumption to be fact, Mr Cross set about finding comparable homes in the Galloway area to determine the average price per square foot. While no other buildings in Galloway are quite as grand as Hogwarts, by looking at five large homes in the area Mr Cross was able to determine that the average cost per square foot was $493. The third and final step proved to be the most difficult - ascertaining the dimensions of Hogwarts in square feet. Setting: Mr Cross based his calculations on the assumption that the most likely location of Hogwarts is in the Galloway Hills of Scotland . Probable location: This assumption takes into account the estimated speed of the Hogwarts Express, the towns it passes on the way to Hogwarts, and the amount of sunlight on the day of Harry's first trip to the school . At first Mr Cross looked at a model of the school, which was constructed on a 1:24 scale. He deduced from the model that the magical boarding school sits on 27.7 acres, and by multiplying this by the average cost per acre, he found that it would be worth $22,675,000. But Mr Cross ultimately decided that . this price was too low, and so he set about finding a better - and more . creative - way of determining the castle's actual square footage. 'Some of you might find this excessive, Hogwarts is the cream of the crop when it comes to wizarding schools' He finally decided to multiply the number of students at Hogwarts by the ideal amount of space each student should have in a classroom. After all, he wrote, '[Hogwarts is] a school filled with educators who care about how students learn. No one can tell me that Professor McGonagall doesn't want her students to ace her exams.' Again, Mr Cross turned to Harry Potter enthusiasts to figure out this number. Fan website Beyond Hogwarts determined that approximately 280 students attend Hogwarts, and that each classroom contains about 20 students at one time. Mr Cross then turned to a study which . concluded that each student should ideally have 50 square feet of space in a classroom. Comparable houses: By looking at five large homes in the Galloway area Mr Cross was able to determine that the average cost per square foot is $493 . Dimensions: To accurately calculate the boarding school's size in square feet, Mr Cross looked at the number of students at Hogwarts, how many make up one classroom, and the amount of space each student requires . Final sum: With seven floors, several towers and 1,000 square feet per classroom, he calculated the overall value - excluding notable features like the Quidditch field and Hagrid's shack - to be $204,102,000 . Following this guideline, he found that each . Hogwarts classroom would be 1,000 square feet in size. 'Some of you might find this extravagant,' Mr Cross admits. 'But I'll remind you that . Hogwarts is the cream of the crop when it comes to wizarding schools. Surely, the school’s classrooms are spacious, right?' He then estimated that each floor has an area of about 51,000 square feet, meaning that the entire building - which consists of seven . floors, an underground level and several towers - comes to 414,000 square feet. Finally, with all his . determining factors in place, the real estate agent concluded that the . value of Hogwarts school is approximately $204,102,000. The final price, notes Mr Cross, does not include notable landmarks on the property including the Quidditch field and Hagrid's shack.","David Cross at Movodo.com looked at the school's estimated location, value per square foot and approximate size to determine its value ."

"It's natural to assume that animals with large teeth and fearsome reputations such as the lion or shark are the world’s deadliest killers. But appearances can be deceptive and if you judge a creature’s deadliness by the number of people it kills every year, the tiny mosquito comes out on top. Malaria, which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes, kills more than 600,000 people a year, while 200million people suffer from it on a daily basis - far more than unfortunate individuals that are bitten by crocodiles or wolves. Scroll down for videos . Bill Gates' infographic (pictured) highlights the world's 15 deadliest animals, based on the number of humans who die from coming into contact with them every year. It reveals that the mosquito - Spanish for 'little fly' - kills more people than all the other animals listed put together . Malaria is spread by mosquitoes and occurs in around 100 countries. It kills approximately 725,000 people every year and imposes a heavy social and economic burden in developing countries, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. It is estimated that 207million people suffered from the disease in 2012 and 90 per cent of deaths occurred in Africa - 77 per cent of which were among children who did not live to see their sixth birthday. Mild cases of malaria cause flu-like symptoms, high fever and chills, which are particularly dangerous to pregnant women and children. Severe malaria can cause lifelong intellectual disabilities and can result in death.Malaria's economic impact is estimated to cost billions of dollars in lost productivity each year. In the last 12 years new cases of malaria have fallen by 25 per cent, and deaths by 42 per cent thanks to better diagnosis, pesticides and the use of bed nets. It is the aim of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to eliminate the disease completely, but the malaria parasite has begun to develop resistance to insecticides and drugs currently used, making the fight extra hard. Bill Gates shared an infographic on his blog to highlight the world’s 15 deadliest animals, based on the number of humans who die from coming into contact with them every year. It reveals that the mosquito – Spanish for ‘little fly’ - kills more people than all the other animals listed put together. ‘Malaria threatens half of the world’s population and causes billions of dollars in lost productivity annually,’ Gates wrote on his blog. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has long been working on ways to eradicate malaria, as well as other mosquito-borne diseases, which include dengue fever, yellow fever, and encephalitis. There are more than 2,500 species of mosquitos, found in over 100 countries and every region apart from Antarctica. ‘During the peak breeding seasons, they outnumber every other animal on Earth, except termites and ants,’ Gates wrote. ‘And . they affect population patterns on a grand scale: In many malarial . zones, the disease drives people inland and away from the coast, where . the climate is more welcoming to mosquitoes.’ The tiny killer: Malaria, which is among the diseases carried by mosquitoes (pictured), kills more than 600,000 people a year, while 200 million people suffer from it on a daily basis . Sharks kill just 10 people a year, lions 100 and crocodiles 1,000, despite having among the most fearsome reputations - according to the infographic. Humans wipe out 475,000 fellow people in murders and wars, but diseases such as schistosomiasis caused by freshwater snails, Chagas disease carried by bugs, sleeping sickness spread by Tsetse flies and rabies, which is transmitted by dogs, are also responsible for thousands of deaths. Stealthy snails: Humans wipe out 475,000 fellow people in murders and wars, but diseases such as schistosomiasis caused by freshwater snails (pictured), Chagas disease, sleeping sickness and rabies are also responsible for thousands of deaths every year . Not so deadly after all? Sharks (pictured left) kill just 10 people a year, lions . 100 (pictured right) and crocodiles 1,000, despite having among the most fearsome . reputations, according to the infographic . The Nazis realised the deadliness of mosquitoes and were investigating how to use the bugs as biological weapons, recently discovered documents revealed. SS-chief Heinrich Himmler’s entomological institute at Dachau concentration camp investigated whether malaria-infected mosquitoes could survive transport into enemy territory. The institute, set up by Himmler in 1942, conducted trials of different types of mosquitoes to find which could be kept alive long enough to ‘transport’ malaria from the lab to Allied troops. In 1944, a particular type of anopheles mosquito known for its capacity to transmit malaria to humans was recommended for use, according to an article in science journal Endeavour. The project was ‘a bizarre mix of Himmler's smattering of scientific knowledge, personal paranoia, an esoteric world view, and genuine concerns about his SS troops’, the article’s author Klaus Reinhardt told Süddeutsche Zeitung. Schistosomiasis, which is blamed for 10,000 deaths a year, is spread by tiny parasitic snails living in rivers and lakes in subtropical and tropical regions across the globe. They burrow into human skin, moving closer to the abdomen to lay their eggs. The disease, which can include paralysis of the legs and vomiting blood as well as flu-like symptoms, is caused by the immune system reacting to the eggs. It is associated with poor living conditions, overcrowding, poor sanitation and a lack of clean water. A total of 10,000 people are killed every year by Chagas disease, spread by the Assassin bug - also known as the kissing bug. It is estimated that between seven and eight million people living in Central and South America have Chagas disease. Its early symptoms include fever, swollen lymph nodes and headaches. While up to 70 per cent of people do not show further symptoms, some individuals suffer an enlarged oesophagus or colon, and others have enlarged ventricles of the heart, which can result in heart failure. Elsewhere, sleeping sickness kills an estimated 10,000 people a year. In humans, bile injected by the Tsetse fly erupts into a red sore and within a few weeks, the person can experience fever, swollen lymph glands, aching muscles and joints, headaches and irritability. As the disease takes hold, people can suffer changes in personality, confusion, slurred speech, seizures and difficulty in walking and talking.

"British swimmer, Adam Walker had enough to worry about as he took on the freezing ocean in a grueling eight hour and 36 minute swim across the Cook Strait on Tuesday. But he had his mind taken off the extreme temperature when he noticed a two metre shark-shaped figure swimming beneath him in the New Zealand waters. Luckily enough, the shark never attempted an attack as a pod of dolphins soon came to his side, swimming alongside Mr Walker for an hour while he crossed the strait. Scroll down for video . Adam Walker was joined by dolphins on his swim across the Cook Strait in New Zealand . It was a magical sight for those watching, as Mr Walker's long strokes were matched by the jumping figures of approximately 10 dolphins, who came so close to the swimmer that he brushed a tail as he swam. Whether they simply wanted to join in the fun or were actually actively participating in protecting Mr Walker from a possible shark attack is unclear, but the swimmer is grateful non-the-less. 'It would be a nice thought they were thinking, we will just help our pal get through,' Mr Walker told a New Zealand website. Mr Walker was partaking in his sixth swim as part of the Ocean's Seven challenge in which participants attempt to swim what are considered the seven hardest long-oceans around the world, while raising money for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. The athlete later added the following comment to his Facebook page after completing the swim: 'Yesterday I swam the 6th of the 'oceans seven' swims 'Cook Strait' in 8 hours 36 mins. But that doesn't tell the whole story rolling waves, big currents but more important than that a dream come true swimming with dolphins over an hour!! 'I'd like to think they were protecting me and guiding me home!!! This swim will stay with me forever,' he wrote. Mr Walker prepping for his sixth swim as part of the Ocean Sevens challenge in Oriental Bay, Wellington . The British swimmer said he saw a two-metre beast swimming beneath him before the pod of 10 dolphins joined him . Despite being told not to worry about sharks by legendary New Zealand swimmer Philip Rush, who mentored Mr Walker before his swim and having crossed the strait eight times himself, Mr Walker confirmed he 'had a go at him' once he'd finished his swim. But it's not the first time that dolphins, who often attack sharks in order to protect themselves and their young, have beenreported to 'save' humans from an impending shark attack. In 2004, a group of four swimmers were protected from a three metre great white shark by a pod of dolphins which encircled the group just off of a New Zealand beach. Rob Howes, a British-born lifeguard, who was saved by the dolphins after having gone for a swim with his daughter, Niccy and her two friends, told the New Zealand Press Association that the dolphins upheld their position for a full 40 minutes. Getting very close: Mr Walker said the dolphin's came close enough to brush his feet with their tails while he swam the Cook Strait . Mr Walker faced freezing water, roilling waves and big currents on the sixteen nautical mile stretch, starting off from Wellington and finishing at Perano Head . 'They started to herd us up, they pushed all four of us together by doing tight circles around us,' Mr Howes said. 'It [the shark] was only about two metres away from me, the water was crystal clear and it was as clear as the nose on my face,' he said before adding about the dolphins: 'They had corralled us up to protect us.' However Mr Walker faced more difficulties than just sharks during the sixteen nautical mile stretch along the Cook Strait, which he started from Wellington and finished off at Perano Head. The swimmer was overcome with motion sickness in the choppy waters of which he said: 'It was like swimming in a washing machine.' Mr Waters is ecstatic after his 6 hour swim in Malta: The Ocean Sevens challenge involves participants swimming the Irish Channel, the Cook Strait, the Molokai Channel, the English Channel, the Catalina Channel, the Tsugaru Strait and the Strait of Gibraltar .

According to the Ocean Sevens website, only one person has ever completed the entire Ocean Seven challenge which includes the participant swimming the Irish Channel, the Cook Strait, the Molokai Channel, the English Channel, the Catalina Channel, the Tsugaru Strait and the Strait of Gibraltar. Mr Walker hopes to be the first British man to complete the challenge and after successfully swimming the Cook Strait, he is preparing for the most challenging and final swim - the Irish Channel: a stretch of water between Ireland and Scotland, infamous for it's freezing temperature and difficult nature. His experience in the Cook Strait was not the first bad experience with native wildlife Mr Walker has had, after being stung by a Portuguese man o' war jellyfish in Hawaii. 'I lost feeling in my spine for about five minutes, and then I just had to push through it,' he said of the ordeal.","Mr Walkers saw a beast-like figure swimming beneath him during an eight hour swim across the Cook Strait .

"She won widespread acclaim for her first literary effort, a detailed account of the women in the life of former Prime Minister Lloyd George. Ffion Hague, the wife of Foreign Secretary William Hague, is now hoping to repeat her success with her latest publication, a book documenting what was believed to be the illicit gay love affair of an 18th century poet with the son of Britain’s first Prime Minister, Robert Walpole. The Grand Tour, which is released next week, is Mrs Hague’s second book, and explores the relationship between Thomas Gray and his schoolfriend Horace Walpole. Illicit: Thomas Gray, an 18th century poet (left), is said to have had a close friendship and a possible gay affair with Horace Walpole (right), the son of Britain's first Prime Minister . The release of the publication comes just over three years after her 52-year-old husband was forced to release a personal statement denying internet claims of a gay affair with his young special adviser, Christopher Myers. The 45-year-old novelist studied Gray’s life and work while a student at the University of Wales. Her new work explores how Walpole and Gray became friends at Eton until they had a dramatic falling out during the European Grand Tour they took after university. There has been speculation among historians that this was the result of a lovers’ quarrel. Previous biographies of both men have speculated about their sexuality. The American academic George Haggerty says that while Walpole and Gray’s intimate circle of male friends were not ‘identified as sodomites… several of them were known to feel desire for members of their own sex’. Couple: William Hague's wife Ffion is hoping the book will follow the success of her first literary endeavour . Thomas Gray was even said to be known as ‘Miss Gray’ because of his effeminate behaviour. Academic  Rictor Norton has speculated that Walpole was ‘the first great love’ of Gray’s life, and observing that Walpole’s letters to Gray ‘illustrate a “sentimental sodomy” characteristic of the many bachelors in Walpole’s circle’. It was in September 2010 that William Hague issued an astonishing personal statement denying claims that he’d had a gay affair with his then 25-year-old male aide Christopher Myers, after admitting that the pair had shared a hotel room during a business trip. He went on to add that he and his wife had tried to start a family, but Mrs Hague had suffered several miscarriages. At the time, Mr Hague said responding to the rumours had not been ‘an easy thing to do’ but said that he and his wife ‘had had enough’ of the ‘untrue and malicious allegations’ about the nature of their relationship. Mrs Hague’s first book was about the women in Lloyd George’s life, entitled The Pain and the Privilege, which was released to widespread acclaim from the critics. It went on to overtake Cherie Blair’s autobiography in the book charts when it was released in 2008. Mrs Hague took a degree in English Literature at Oxford University, before going on to study Eighteenth-Century Welsh Poetry at the University of Wales. Her master’s degree was on the life and work of Thomas Gray, who was also the author of the 1751 masterpiece Elegy in a Country Churchyard. After graduating, she joined the Civil Service and was posted to the Welsh Office. She was later appointed Private Secretary to the Secretary of State. On leaving the Civil Service, she became Director of Operations at the Arts & Business charity, which raises private finance for arts projects. In 2000, she became a headhunter and in 2003 she went on to become director of recruitment firm Hanson Green. Ffion was a trustee of The British Council and also a judge of the Orange Prize for Fiction in 2000. Talking about her decision to begin writing books, which was released almost six years ago, she said she had been inspired by her husband’s literary success after he published biographies on former prime minister William Pitt the Younger and politician William Wilberforce. At the time of the release of her first work, she said: ‘Having him around as an experienced author was an immense help. I saw the satisfaction and success he had with his books and I realised I didn’t want to put writing this one off any longer.’ Allegations: The book's release comes three years after her husband (left) was forced to deny internet claims he was having a relationship with adviser Christopher Myers (right)","The Grand Tour, which is released next week, is Mrs Hague’s second book .

"The grieving parents of Michael Brown said they were unmoved by an apology made by the Ferguson police chief - over a month after their unarmed teenage son was shot dead by an officer. Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, called for Chief Tom Jackson to be fired and his father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, he would like to see Officer Darren Wilson arrested. The couple gave an in depth interview to the Associated Press over their son's death after he was shot dead by a white police officer on August 9 and  left in the middle of the street for hours. Scroll down for video . Justice: The parents of Michael Brown, Lesley McSpadden, left, and Michael Brown, Sr., right,  say they are unmoved by the Ferguson police chief's apology in their son's shooting death by a police officer . Brown Sr said: ‘An apology would be when Darren Wilson has handcuffs, processed and charged with murder’ Shot and killed: Michael Brown, left, was unarmed when he was shot dead by Police Officer Darren Wilson . Brown Sr said: ‘An apology would be when Darren Wilson has handcuffs, processed and charged with murder.’ ‘I don't want words, I want action,’ Brown's mom added. In the video released on Thursday, Police Chief Tom Jackson apologized to the parents  for taking so long to remove the body of their son from the street. 'I want to say this to the Brown family: No one who has not experienced the loss of a child can understand what you're feeling. I am truly sorry for the loss of your son,' Jackson said. 'I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street. 'The time that it took involved very important work on the part of investigators, who were trying to collect evidence and gain a true picture of what happened that day, but it was just too long, and I am truly sorry for that.' Police officers took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead by Officer Wilson. Sorry: Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released this video apology on Thursday to the family of  Michael Brown and apologized for leaving the teenager's body in the street for so long . Dead: Police took more than four hours to remove Brown's body from the street where he was shot August 9 . The unarmed black teenager was fatally shot by Wilson, despite several eyewitness accounts which suggested he had his hands up in a 'don't shoot' position. His death sparked days of protests, some violent and many peaceful, in the predominately black neighborhood of Ferguson Missouri where racial tensions reached boiling point. During the protests, residents said officers were excessively aggressive towards them and unleashed  National Guard troops, tear gas and military equipment. Protesters: Residents said officers were excessively aggressive towards them and unleashed the national guard, tear gas and military equipment during the unrest . The police response was also branded inappropriate by officials and Missouri Governor Jay Nixon put the Missouri State Highway Patrol in charge of policing the protests. In the video apology, Jackson apologized for the heavy handed response from his officers towards the peaceful protesters. But earlier this week, police officers from the St. Louis County Department were spotted wearing ‘I am Darren Wilson’ bracelets whilst on duty. Support: The U.S. Justice Department has asked the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of the white policeman who shot to death an unarmed black teenager . Residents from Ferguson complained about the black bracelets  showing stark white lettering on them with the words 'I am Darren Wilson' emblazoned across it during a meeting with federal officials. The Brown's family lawyer, Benjamin Crump, said the bracelets gave an impression that the police lacked impartiality in the case. Brown's parents also expressed their disgust towards the officers who wore the bracelets. ‘It lets me know how they really feel about the situation, and the wrongness that they do. How can you work for the law and act like you're above the law? McSpadden said. The Justice Department has asked Jackson to 'confirm our understanding' that officers were wearing the bracelets in a letter sent on Friday. It also asked the Ferguson Police Department  to order its officers not to wear bracelets in support of Wilson. Brown's parents are in Washington to meet with lawmakers and lobby Congress to pass a law requiring police officers to wear body cameras whilst out on duty. Over a month after the shooting of Brown, the fate of Wilson now lies in the hands of a county grand jury which will decide if it should indict Wilson. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is investigating whether Brown's civil rights were violated.","Police Chief Tom Jackson apologized to the parents over their son's death .

"Two boys who became trapped after a plow operator pushed snow over them say they tried calling out for help, but rescuers were unable to hear them, leaving them trapped for hours. Cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera, 9, and Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez, 11, survived under the snow thanks to a pocket of air, and were only rescued after police noticed a boot sticking out of the snowdrift. The two boys struggled to free themselves after a passing snow plow caught them by surprise and buried them while they built a snow fort. The pair managed to stay alive thanks to an air pocket and the fact they helped each other to stay awake. 'We motivated each other to not go to sleep, keep yelling, keep moving our bodies, trying to break out,' said Elijah. 'Cause I knew if we would've fallen asleep ...we probably wouldn't have woke up because we would be so cold, frozen probably.' Scroll down for video . Buried alive: Cousins Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera (left) and Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez (right) spent Thanksgiving in the hospital after being buried by a snow plow . Scene: The snowbank in which cousins Jason Rivera and Elijah Martinez built their snow fort sits at the corner of a parking lot in Newburg, New York . The two cousins, ages 11 and 9, were building a snow fort Wednesday night in Newburgh when a plow operator clearing a parking lot unknowingly pushed snow over them . Lucky to be alive: Authorities searching for the missing boys found them when an officer noticed a half-buried shovel in the snow . Cousins: Jason ‘J.J.’ Rivera (center left) and Elijah ‘Papito’ Martinez (center right) spent Thanksgiving in the hospital after being buried by a snow plow . 'I was punching everything,' said Martinez. 'I was moving my shoulders, banging my head, moving everything so I could get more space.' 'If I could've sat up, I could've got my legs out, and we could've at least made more space, but there was a big block of ice on my chest, so I couldn't move,' explained Rivera. Authorities said the boys' parents became alarmed when they didn't come home from playing around 10 p.m., and after a fruitless search called police around 11:50 p.m. on Wednesday. Officials finally found the boys around 2 a.m. on Thursday, after an officer saw a shovel half buried in the snow bank. 'After I saw the shovel, I just felt compelled to dig,' said 28-year-old Brandon Rola, a member of the Newburgh police force for 7 years, to FOX News. 'I really didn't put it together, but I just started digging.' Trapped: Martinez (left) and Rivera (right) were reportedly building a fort in a snow drift when a plow buried them under snow . Accident: Authorities said a snow plow operator had been clearing a parking lot by pushing snow over, and didn't see the boys on the other side of the pile . Rescue: A neighbor captured cell phone footage of the police and others frantically digging the boys out of the snow at 2 a.m. on Thursday morning . Snowdrift: The boys had been building their fort in an area of the nearby Family Health Center in Newburgh, New York, and a shovel they left behind tipped off rescuers . The officer took the shovel and started to dig. Others joined in, some digging with bare hands. When police found the boot, they called for paramedics, fearing they may have arrived too late. That is, until another officer, John Maguire, saw the boot start to twitch. 'When John saw that, we just started digging like crazy,' Rola said. 'But we only had the one shovel, and you're talking about a 7 or 8-foot snowpile.' 'We knocked on doors, got shovels, and pretty soon, we had maybe 10 people working on that pile.' 'The cop saw our shovel got buried, he started digging twice and he hit my foot, and I'm like, ""Papito somebody hit my foot, so yell.""' 'We kept yelling, ""Keep digging, keep digging. We're in here."" So he kept digging.' The rescuers finally reached the two boys, who were suffering from exposure but still conscious after being trapped for around four hours unable to move their arms or legs. 'All I see was the feet,' Takiaya Stevens, a neighbor who helped with the digging, told USA Today. 'When I got over there, the little boy's feet was hanging out of the thing, and he was shaking, and his mother was like, ""It's all right,""' Stevens added. 'He was like, ""Mommy, mommy.""' 'They were probably in about five feet of snow,' Newburgh police Sgt Aaron Weaver told CBS New York. 'But however it fell, there was, like, a dome around their heads, so there was air in there, like space for them.' Weaver, who was among the rescuers, said the dome of air was the only thing that saved them. Both the victims were recovering on Thursday night at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. Family members said they are in a good condition and can look forward to a Thanksgiving meal when they're released. After getting some much-needed rest, Rola woke up to a Thanksgiving with his own family, conscious of the dramatic rescue hours before. 'It was a good day,' said Rola.","Jason 'J.J.'

"A Mormon has left the Jewish community incensed after 'insensitively' posthumously baptising the parents of a famous Holocaust survivor. Asher and Rosa Wiesenthal, long-dead parents of the late Simon Wiesenthal, were baptised in a common practice offensive to many Jews. The Simon Wiesenthal Center was left ‘outraged’ and said the actions make a ‘mockery’ of many meetings between Mormon and Jewish leaders.

"Concerns are growing today for a dolphin which has swum 50 miles inland along a tidal river. The bottlenose dolphin - the most common breed spotted in British waters - has ventured up the Bristol Channel and into the River Severn. It has been photographed  in the water as far inland as Stonebench and Elmore West near Gloucester. Wrong turn: The bottlenose dolphin has been seen 50 miles inland as far as Elmore West on the River Severn . Experts say it is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further. Alexandra Farthing, 19, who shot a video of the dolphin on Saturday night, said: 'It was definitely one of the most incredible things I have seen. 'It was an incredible site as I’ve never seen a dolphin in the wild. 'My grandparents have a slipway so I sat at the bottom of it and just watched him for hours, he came very close to the bank and I could have touched it he was that close.' Alexandra contacted British Divers Marine Life Rescue and the RSPCA but they are not allowed to intervene because the animal is not beached and still swimming freely. Experts say the dolphin is likely to have followed fish upstream during high tides but there are fears it could get stuck if it ventures any further . The dolphin has swum up the Bristol Channel as far as Elmore West near Gloucester . However, experts say they will become concerned if the creature swims as far as Maisemore - on the other side of Gloucester - where a porpoise once got stranded in 2009. Stephen Marsh, operations manager for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said: 'When we have high tides fish might come up higher as well. 'Dolphins follow the fish and can end up quite far along rivers. 'This is a bottlenose dolphin and they live in what’s called a fish infused society and what happens there is, individuals will move away from their family for a period, for what might be weeks, months or years, before returning. 'We do know there are bottlenose dolphins in the Bristol Channel at the moment so it may just have wandered off. 'The only concern we have is that if it went much higher, and went over Maisemore Weir it would be very difficult to get back, and there is a bore [tidal surge] next week so we hope it would be well out of the way by then.'","Dolphin spotted close to Gloucester after venturing up the River Severn .

"Finland has become the final Nordic country to legalise same-sex marriage after an equal rights bill was passed in parliament today. Victory cheers erupted in central Helsinki where thousands of human rights activists had gathered outside Parliament ahead of the vote. Gay couples in Finland have been able to enter into registered partnerships since 2002, but will now have the same rights as heterosexual married couples, and will be able  adopt children and share a surname. Yeys for gays: Supporters of the same-sex marriage celebrate outside the Finnish Parliament in Helsinki, after the Finnish parliament approved a bill giving equal rights to gay and straight couples . Laws governing marriage are now completely gender-neutral in the Scandinavian nation, which has a population of some 5.4 million. Supporters of the bill hugged after speaker Eero Heinäluoma closed the session, and some MPs cried leaving the floor of the House. 'Finland should strive to become a society where discrimination does not exist, human rights are respected and two adults can marry regardless of their sexual orientation,' centre-right Prime Minister Alexander Stubb said in an open letter before the vote. Finland becomes the 12th European state to allow gay marriage, but the last in the Nordic region to do so.

"A supermarket assistant who had three girlfriends at the same time was confronted by all of them when he flew home from holiday. Charlie Fisher, 20, had been stringing along Becky Connery, 17, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham, 19, and another girl, who does not wish to be named, for more than six months without any of them finding out about each other. But when he went away on holiday, Becky discovered he was cheating on her with both Lizzie and the other girl, who is 20, so they came up with the idea of humiliating him at the airport when he got home. The Iceland worker from Hatfield Garden Village, Hertfordshire,  walked through arrivals onto Luton Airport's main concourse to be confronted by all three girls shouting 'Liar, liar' at him before he fled with his grandmother. Scroll down for video . Revenge best served cold: Becky Connery, 17, left, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham, 20, centre, and the third girl went to Luton Airport, left, were all going out with supermarket worker, Charlie Fisher, 20 . Today Becky, an A Level student from Welwyn Garden City, told how she found out that the man she was in love with was cheating on her - and how she and his other girlfriends decided to have the last laugh. She told MailOnline: 'I'd known Charlie for three years but started seeing him in March, and early on we had the conversation that we weren't seeing anyone else, that we were exclusive. 'I was in love with him, and he said he was in love with me, but I had my suspicions from the start. 'He was very protective of his phone, he wouldn't let me put pictures of me and him on social networks, he deleted comments I made about us - looking back, he was very shady.' Becky, who said Mr Fisher was 'very clever with words', was at his house the night before he flew on holiday when she picked up his phone and saw a message from a girl  saying 'I will meet you later'. It instantly made her suspicious as she said he'd asked her to go home early that night as he had to finish his packing. Becky, who works part-time as a hairdresser when she's not studying, said: 'Charlie caught me and we had a row - I asked who this girl was and he said she was just a friend.' Mr Fisher, pictured with Becky earlier this year, used excuses about seeing family and friends to juggle girls . The next day, after Mr Fisher had flown off on holiday to see family in Germany, Becky found the girl, who lives in Hatfield but does not want to be named, on Twitter and sent her a message. Becky said: 'I told her we were both seeing the same person and she wasn't surprised - she had been with him since January, and had always had her suspicions' The two girls then met and discovered there was a third girl, Lizzie Leeland-Cunningham, 19, who lives in Hatfield, and made contact with her through Facebook.  Lizzie, a bar supervisor, had been dating Mr Fisher since meeting him on Facebook in April. She said: 'He was a real charmer and had a real way with words - he knew how to say the right thing at the right time. 'But what I didn't realise was that when he was going off to see his friend 'Chris', he was actually seeing one of the other girls.  He did it to them, too, saying he was going to see 'Harry' when he was seeing me. The three women Mr Fisher was seeing have now become firm friends - and say they're glad he's gone . Messages of a betrayal: This was the Facebook conversation between the third girl and Lizzie, in blue . The girls met in the pub to compare notes, and discovered he had been using excuses he was seeing friends or family when he was actually seeing one of them. Lizzie said: 'I suggested as a joke that we should all go to the airport to meet him.  The other two said ""Yes, good idea"" straightaway, so we met on Saturday morning and went to the airport together.' As Mr Fisher came out through customs, all three girls called his name. Becky said: 'He froze and looked at us.  He said: ""Why are you here?  Why would you do this?"" 'We were like ""Are you joking?"" 'I said to him: ""I can't believe how you could be like this for seven months.""' Lizzie said: 'He came out of customs and saw all of us and his face just dropped. We said we wanted to talk to him, and he said ""Can't I talk to you later?"" and we said no, we wanted to talk to him now. 'I said to him ""Don't you have anything to say to us?""'. Mr Fisher headed towards the car park with his grandmother, who had come to collect him, but the girls continued to berate him, stopping only to explain what their grievance was to his grandmother. 'She just shrugged and said ""OK"" when we told her why we were angry', Becky said. Becky put a picture of the girls at the airport on Twitter, with the caption: 'Just been at the airport to meet my cheating boyfriend...' and was celebrated as a hero by Twitter users, who said: 'This is awesome - you go, girl.' Now the girls, who say they're happy to have ousted him from their lives, have forged firm friendships with each other. 'They're great - I'm seeing both of them for nights out soon,' said Becky.  'We can't think what we saw in Charlie in the first place. 'I'm so glad we confronted him - it's not the 16th century any more - girls don't have to put up with this.' Mr Fisher did not reply to MailOnline's request for a comment today.","A Level student Becky Connery, 17, was in love with Charlie Fisher, 20 .

"These previously unseen pictures reveal the preparations in the hours leading up to the US nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The atomic bombings of the two cities in Japan were conducted by the US during the final stages of World War Two in August 1945. To this day, the bombings remain history's only acts of nuclear warfare. A group of men check over bomb casings that were sent to Tinian, in the Mariana Islands, south Japan, which was the launching point for the atomic bomb attacks against Hiroshima and Nagasaki .

By August 1945, the Allied Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory had devised two types of bombs. The 509th Composite Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces was equipped with a Silverplate Boeing B-29 Superfortress that could deliver them from Tinian in the Mariana Islands, to the south of Japan. A uranium gun-type atomic bomb, code-named 'Little Boy', was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, followed by a plutonium implosion-type bomb, called 'Fat Man' on the city of Nagasaki on August 9. Within the first two to four months of the bombings, the effects killed 90,000–166,000 people in Hiroshima and 60,000–80,000 in Nagasaki. Almost half of the deaths in each city occurred on the first day. The completed bomb was then towed towards the airfield under cover with an escort . The bombs were placed inside this pit in Tinian in the Mariana Islands, to the south of Japan . The bomb was lowered manually by a group of workers, some with their shirts open, towards the pit .

During the following months, large numbers died from the effect of burns, radiation sickness, and other injuries, compounded by illness. In both cities, most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizeable garrison. On August 15, just days after the bombing of Nagasaki and the Soviet Union's declaration of war, Japan announced its surrender to the Allies. The 'Little Boy' bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, killing 90,000 - 166,000 people - almost half were killed on the day it landed on the city .

Survivors of the Nagasaki atomic bomb find a way through the ruins of the city . The rare pictures were revealed in the same week that the US Department of Energy released transcripts of the 1950s hearings on the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Project developed the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The once-celebrated physicist lost his security clearance following the four-week, closed-door hearing when he was accused of having communist sympathies. Transcripts were released this week of the 1950s hearings on the security clearance of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos National Laboratory . Oppenheimer was accused of having communist sympathies after a four week, close-door hearing . Officials also alleged that Oppenheimer's wife and brother had both been communists and he had contributed to communist front-organizations. Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy for the Federation of American Scientists, said the release of the documents finally lifts the cloud of secrecy on the Oppenheimer case. 'This was a landmark case in U.S. history and Cold War history,' Mr Aftergood said. 'It represents a high point during anti-communist anxiety and tarnished the reputation of America's leading scientist.' After the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer served as director of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study until he retired in 1966. President Lyndon B. Johnson later tried to erase the embarrassment of Oppenheimer's treatment by honouring him with the Atomic Energy Commission's Enrico Fermi Award in 1963. Oppenheimer died of throat cancer in 1967.","Previously unseen pictures reveal preparations in hours before the attacks .

"A young Christian girl accused burning pages of the Islam's holy book has been freed from a jail near the capital and taken by helicopter to a secret location in a dramatic operation. The release of Rimsha Masih comes a day after a judge granted her bail. Mushtaq Awan said Masih left the prison in Rawalpindi, a garrison city near Islamabad, this afternoon. Rimsha Masih was taken to a secret location by helicopter to avoid mob justice . Pakistani security personnel shift Rimsha Masih to a helicopter after her release from jail in Rawalpindi . A blanket was used to cover her face in an attempt to protect her identity . She has been held for a little over three weeks after neighbours accused her of violating the country's strict blasphemy law. She was taken from the prison in an armoured vehicle and whisked to a waiting helicopter while covered with a sheet to protect her identity. Her lawyers say they will now push to have the case against her thrown out entirely. There are worries the child, reported to be between 11 and 16, could be in danger if she remains in her homeland. In Pakistan the mere allegation of causing offence to Islam can mean death. Those accused are sometimes killed even if they are found innocent by the courts. Police took cleric Khalid Jadoon into custody after witnesses claimed he ripped pages from a Koran and planted them in Rimsha's bag with burned papers. Activists and human rights groups insisted Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law was vague and widely abused. A glimpse of the young girl's face was captured just before the helicopter took off . Live broadcasts showed heavily-armed police surrounding Rimsha Masih, believed to be no older than 14, covering her face with a green scarf . They claimed it dangerously discriminated against minority groups. Amnesty International called the bail decision 'encouraging.' A spokesman said: 'The Pakistan . authorities must take concrete steps to show that no one can commit . abuses and attempt to excuse them as the defence of their religion. 'The . decision by a Pakistan court to grant bail to Rimsha Masih is an encouraging step, but the . Pakistan government must urgently reform its blasphemy laws to prevent . similar cases in the future. 'Rimsha . and her mother were first arrested by police on August 16 after an . angry mob had gathered outside their house in Islamabad, accusing her of . burning pages of the Koran, a crime punishable by death under . Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. 'The . case took another turn last week when police arrested a local cleric, . accused of planting the burned Koran pages on Rimsha. 'This morning (Friday), a judge set a bail of one million Pakistani rupees, about £6,200, for Rimsha. 'Although Amnesty  welcomes the judge’s decision, serious challenges remain.' The human rights group claimed Rimsha, her family, and the Christian community in Islamabad remained in 'serious danger.' Wilson Chowdhry is chairman of the British Pakistani Christian Association. He said: 'Although this is a small step . towards justice, she will still have to undergo a full trial unless . granted asylum in a western nation. 'Her safety is paramount and security at today's court hearing was significant. 'However the killing of Governor Taseer illustrates that extra-judicial killings are hard to prevent.' He was killed because he opposed the blasphemy law. Lawyer Raja Ikram, one of Rimsha Masih's representatives, talks to journalists after the hearing in Islamabad. His client was granted bail after three weeks detention . He is joined by Paul J Bhatti, minister for national harmony, at a joint news conference. Several Islamist leaders have joined the outcry over the arrest . Police escort blindfolded Muslim cleric Khalid Jadoon as he is brought before a judge earlier this month. He was arrested on suspicion of framing Rimsha Masih . A Pakistani policeman reprimanded him after he attempted to shout slogans on arrival at the court in Islamabad . 'We . have asked the Foreign Office on their position with respect to . granting asylum to Rimsha Masih and await a response,' said Wilson. 'MP Andrew Stephenson of Pendle has said it is highly likely that the UK would grant Asylum.' Rimsha's arrest triggered an exodus of . several hundred Christians from her poor village after mosques reported . over their loudspeakers what the girl was alleged to have done. Christians, who make up four percent . of Pakistan's population of 180 million, have been especially concerned . about the blasphemy law, saying it offers them no protection. Convictions hinge on witness testimony and are often linked to vendettas, they complain. In . 2009, 40 houses and a church were set ablaze by a mob of 1,000 Muslims . in the town of Gojra, in Punjab province following reports of the . desecration of the Koran. At least seven Christians were burned to death during the attacks. Two . Christian brothers accused of writing a blasphemous letter against the . Prophet Mohammad were gunned down outside a court in the eastern city of . Faisalabad in July of 2010. Pakistani Christians carry placards  in Islamabad during a protest calling for the release of Rimsha. There have been calls to review Pakistan's blasphemy laws . Amnesty International warned the case could cause problems for 'communal harmony' in Pakistan. 'In . the recent past individuals accused of blasphemy have been killed by . members of the public, often in incidents where the victim has not been . formally charged by the authorities,' the Amnesty spokesman said. 'Hundreds . of Christians have fled Rimsha’s neighbourhood in Islamabad since she . was accused, fearing violence. Her family remains in hiding. 'The Rimsha Masih case highlights the profound danger to communal harmony and rule of law caused by Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. 'Such . cases will continue to occur, especially against vulnerable religious . minorities, unless the Pakistan government urgently reforms the . blasphemy laws to ensure they cannot be used maliciously to settle . disputes or enable private citizens to take matters into their own . hands.' Amnesty called on the authorities . to ensure perpetrators of attacks on religious minorities were brought . to justice in court that met international standards - without recourse . to the death penalty. 'Amnesty welcomes the condemnation of . the charges brought against Rimsha Masih by a wide cross-section of . Pakistan society, including even from religious leaders who have in the . past vilified religious minorities and advocated strict application of . the blasphemy laws, including the imposition of the death penalty,' the spokesman said. 'But more important are legal, policy . and social reforms to address the general climate of vilification on . the basis of religion that has lead to almost daily intimidation and . deadly attacks on Christian, Shi’a, Ahmedi, Hindu and other minority . communities across the country. 'The Pakistan authorities must take . concrete steps to show that no one can commit abuses and attempt to . excuse them as the defence of their religion.'","Youngster airlifted out of danger zone to protect her from religious vigilantes baying for blood .

"An American tycoon has refused to rescue a doomed French tyre factory in frustration at the nation's 'stupid' labour laws. U.S. tyre giant Titan International's boss Maurice Taylor branded French unions demands for the takeover as 'the dumbest thing in the world'. And he said it was so difficult to do business in France, the nation may as well 'become communist'. Scroll down for video . American tycoon Maurice Taylor has refused to rescue doomed French Goodyear plant in Amiens out of frustration at the nation's 'stupid' labour laws . Mr Taylor, above, has twice tried to save the plant that US threatened with closure and the loss of 1.170 jobs; after visiting in February last year he wrote to France's then industry minister Arnaud Montebourg branding workers as 'lazy, overpaid and talking too much' He told France Info radio today: 'You can't buy Goodyear. Under your laws, we have to take a minimum of 662 or 672 employees. You can't do that. The most you could take is 333. There's no business for that plant now. 'You guys have got to wake up over there and tell the unions, ''Hey if they're so smart, they should buy the factory''. 'It's stupid. It's the dumbest thing in the world. France should just become communist and then when it goes all bad like Russia did, then maybe you'd have a chance.' It is Taylor's second failed attempt to buy the Goodyear plant in Amiens that is threatened with closure and the loss of 1,170 jobs. He visited the factory in February last year, and later wrote to France's then industry minister Arnaud Montebourg branding workers as 'lazy, overpaid and talking too much'. In the letter published in the Les Echoes financial newspaper, he wrote: 'I have visited the factory several times. The French workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours. Mr Taylor said, 'I have visited the factory several times. The French workforce gets paid high wages but works only three hours'; A A 2013 global study of working hours also revealed the French worked the fewest hours of any country in the world .

'Titan is the one with the money and the talent to produce tyres. What does the crazy union have? It has the French government. 'The French farmer wants cheap tires. He does not care if the tyres come from India or China and these governments are subsidising them. Your government doesn't care either.' Mr Taylor's latest embarrassing assessment of French workers comes as France teeters on the brink of recession and unemployment has risen above three million - the highest level of joblessness in 15 years. A 2013 global study of working hours also revealed the French worked the fewest hours of any country in the world. The report by Swiss bank UBS found the French graft for just 1,480 hours a year, with 27 days annual holiday. Britons work 1,782 hours a year - 301 more than the French - and have 20 days holiday a year, making us the world's 36th most lazy nation.","U.S. tyre boss labels French unions demands 'dumbest thing in the world'

"Tales of dolphins rescuing stricken humans from death at sea have been documented as long ago as ancient Greece. But as yet there is no scientific evidence to prove that the marine mammals empathise with another species’ dire situations. While it is not known if dolphins are merely curious or go out of their way to rescue people, one ecologist has shared a story of how the marine mammals came to the aid of a suicidal girl off the waters of Los Angeles, California. It is not known if dolphins (stock image) are merely curious or go out of their way to help, but one ecologist has shared a story of how the animals seemingly came to the aid of a girl attempting suicide off the waters of Los Angeles, California . Maddalena Bearzi, president and co-founder of the Ocean Conservation Society, shared the account in her latest book, 'Dolphin Confidential: Confessions of a Field Biologist', an extract of which was published by National Geographic. She said that her team was following a school of bottlenose dolphins near the shore to study their behaviour, when one individual suddenly broke away from a feeding circle and set off into deeper waters. The rest of the group set off in pursuit, much to the researchers' surprise who were used to tracking the animals back and forth within a few hundred metres of the beach. The account features in biologist Maddalena Bearzi's book 'Dolphin Confidential: Confessions of a Field Biologist' (pictured) They followed the speeding dolphins to around three miles (5km) off the coast. ‘The dolphin group stopped, forming a sort of ring around a dark object in the water,’ she wrote. Dr Bearzi’s assistant saw the a lifeless girl, who she described as pallid and fully clothed. ‘As the boat neared, she feebly turned her head toward us, half-raising her hand as a weak sign for help.’ The researchers radioed the lifeguards and lifted the girl out of the water before racing back to the closest harbour, Marina del Rey. Upon examination, one of the team said that the girl had severe hypothermia and they wrapped her in a blanket and hugged her to keep her warm. They discovered that the girl, thought to be around 18, could speak little English and was on holiday. Emergency doctors later told the scientists that the girl would make a full recovery but had been found with a suicide note. ‘If we hadn’t found her, if the dolphins hadn’t led us offshore when they did, to that specific place, she would have died,’ Dr Bearzi wrote. As the scientists were busy trying to save the girl, they had not continued to track the dolphins’ behaviour. ‘What might they have done with her if we hadn’t been there? Might they have tried to save her?’ she asked. There are many accounts of dolphins scaring off sharks or guiding humans lost at sea to shore. Some scientists think that intelligent dolphins are merely curious when coming to a human's aid. Scientists followed the speeding dolphins to around three miles (5km) off the coast (mapped) where they found the suicidal girl in the water, before rescuing her and taking her to a hospital in Marina del Rey (also marked) In April, British swimmer Adam Walker was joined by dolphins to protect him from sharks on a gruelling eight hour swim across the Cook Strait near New Zealand . They also swim under struggling members of their own species to push them to the surface, so may be doing the same with humans in the water. Dolphins have been observed coming to the rescue of a stranded pod of whales as well as rescuing a human that was bitten by a shark, in recent years. They seemingly drove the predators away so the man could be rescued. In the Red Sea, a group of dolphins reportedly surrounded 12 divers who were lost for over 13 hours, repelling sharks living in the area. People aboard a rescue boat also reported that the animals seemed to be trying to show them where the stranded divers were. However, many scientists do not think that the animals deliberately save humans and no evidence exists to prove otherwise. ‘That day I witnessed coastal bottlenose dolphins suddenly leave their feeding activities and head offshore. And in doing so, they led us to save a dying girl, some three miles offshore. Coincidence?’ Dr Bearzi wrote. In April, British swimmer Adam Walker was joined by dolphins, seemingly to protect him from sharks on a gruelling eight hour swim across the Cook Strait near New Zealand. He noticed a two metre shark-shaped figure swimming beneath him in the waters. The shark never attempted an attack, as a pod of dolphins soon came to his side, swimming alongside Mr Walker for an hour while he crossed the strait. Whether they simply wanted to join in the fun or were actually actively participating in protecting Mr Walker from a possible shark attack is unclear, but the swimmer is grateful non-the-less. 'It would be a nice thought they were thinking, we will just help our pal get through,' Mr Walker said. He was partaking in his sixth swim as part of the Ocean's Seven challenge in which participants attempt to swim what are considered the seven hardest long-oceans around the world, while raising money for the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society. The athlete later added the following comment to his Facebook page after completing the swim: 'Yesterday I swam the 6th of the 'oceans seven' swims 'Cook Strait' in 8 hours 36 mins. But that doesn't tell the whole story rolling waves, big currents but more important than that a dream come true swimming with dolphins over an hour!! 'I'd like to think they were protecting me and guiding me home!!! This swim will stay with me forever,' he wrote.","Dolphins off the coast of Los Angeles guided scientists to the struggling girl, who were then able to get her to hospital where she made a full recovery .

"Three planeloads of Americans have been evacuated from a major Iraqi air base north of Baghdad as Al Qaeda-aligned militants have toppled cities in the country's north and threaten to advance toward Baghdad. The planes, loaded with diplomats and contractors stationed at an Iraqi airbase in Balad, flew out amid fears that the base could be surrounded by the militants. The passengers included 12 U.S. government officials and military personnel who have been training Iraqi forces to use fighter jets and surveillance drones. Scroll down for video . The planes, loaded with American diplomats and contractors stationed at an Iraqi airbase in Balad, flew out on Thursday amid fears that the base could be surrounded by the Al Qaeda-aligned militants (stock pic of Balad Air Base, Iraq) The jihadist group the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has seized a large swathe of northern Iraq, including second city Mosul, and they threaten to advance toward Baghdad . The evacuation means that the training mission at Balad has been grounded indefinitely - despite repeated statements from the Obama administration that it would continue to support Iraq's military. Several hundred American contractors are still waiting to leave, although the State Department said on Thursday that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad continues to operate as usual. The development signals the worsening security environment in the northern part of the country. A senior intelligence source told Fox . News there is serious concern about how to evacuate other Americans out . of Iraq if the situation further deteriorates. Obama said on Thursday that it was clear Iraq needs additional assistance from the U.S. and international community given the lightning gains by the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Levant . Armed men watch and control Iraqis who fled the violence in Mosul: The al-Qaeda splinter group Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant have captured the country's second city, 400 kilometres north of Baghdad . The . source said 'all western diplomats in Iraq are in trouble,' and . American allies are scrambling to put together an evacuation plan. Military officials said there are 'not a lot of good options.' Other U.S. contractors are at a tank . training ground in the city of Taji, just north of the capital, that is . still in operation for now. The . militants, who operate under the banner of the Islamic State of Iraq . and al-Shams, have issued threats to anybody who defied a harsh code of . Sharia they have imposed in captured territories. Rule-breakers who ignore edicts banning drinking, smoking and ‘immodest’ behavior by women can expect ‘be killed or crucified, or have hands or feet cut from opposite sides.’ Less than three years after pulling American forces out of Iraq, President Barack Obama is now weighing a range of short-term military options, including airstrikes, to quell an al-Qaida inspired insurgency that has captured two Iraqi cities and threatened to press toward Baghdad. ‘We do have a stake in making sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold,’ Obama said on Thursday in the Oval Office. Militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) fire heavy machine guns during alleged fighting in the northern Iraqi city of Samarra earlier this week . However, officials firmly ruled out putting American troops back on the ground in Iraq, which has faced resurgent violence since the U.S. military withdrew in late 2011. Obama, in his first comments on the deteriorating situation, said it was clear Iraq needed additional assistance from the U.S. and international community given the lightning gains by the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. 'What we've seen over the last couple of days indicates Iraq’s going to need more help' from the United States and other nations, Obama said in the Oval Office. He added that the U.S. has been working 'around the clock' to find appropriate ways to intervene. 'I don't rule out anything.' he said, because we do have a stake in making sure that these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold in Iraq – or Syria, for that matter. In his briefing with reporters, White House Press Secretary cautioned that Obama was 'responding to a question about airstrikes – or, would he consider airstrikes – and that's what he meant.' 'We're not considering boots on the ground,' he added later. Obama, however, also said that 'it's fair to say that in our consultations with Iraqis, there will be some short term immediate things that need to be done militarily, and, you know, our national security team is looking at all the options.' Republican lawmakers pinned some of the blame for the escalating violence on Obama's reluctance to re-engage in a conflict he long opposed. For more than a year, the Iraqi government has been pleading with the U.S. for additional help to combat the insurgency, which has been fueled by the civil war in neighboring Syria. Northern Iraq has become a way station for insurgents who routinely travel between the two countries and are spreading the Syrian war's violence. Iraqi leaders made a fresh request earlier this week, asking for a mix of drones and manned aircraft that could be used for both surveillance and active missions. Refugees flee from Mosul which has been toppled by Al Qaeda-aligned militants who now threaten to advance toward Baghdad . Officials said Obama was considering those requests and was expected to decide on a course of action within a few days. The U.S. already is flying unmanned aircraft over Iraq for intelligence purposes, an official said. Short of airstrikes, the president could step up the flow of military assistance to the beleaguered Iraqi government, increase training exercises for the country's security forces and help boost Iraq's intelligence capabilities. The U.S. has been leery of its lethal aid falling into the hands of militants or being otherwise misused. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the U.S. is sending about $12 million in humanitarian aid to help nearly a million Iraqis who have been forced from their homes by recent fighting. Obama huddled with his national security team on Thursday to discuss the deteriorating security situation. And Vice President Joe Biden called Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to underscore that while the U.S. stands ready to help, it would be crucial for Iraq to come up with longer-term solutions to its internal political strife. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has accused the president of 'taking a nap' while conditions worsened in Iraq . Nearly all American troops left Iraq in December 2011 after Washington and Baghdad failed to negotiate a security agreement that would have kept a limited number of U.S. forces in the country for a few more years at least. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a frequent White House critic, called on Thursday for Obama's entire national security team to resign. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, accused the president of ‘taking a nap’ while conditions worsened. But Congress appeared divided over how to respond, with some Republicans backing airstrikes and other lawmakers from both parties suggesting that was the wrong approach. There were no calls for putting American troops back on the ground in Iraq, and Obama's advisers said the president had no desire to plunge the U.S. back into a conflict there. ‘The president is mindful that the United States has sacrificed a lot in Iraq and we need to not just be taking this all back on ourselves,’ said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser. Taking no prisoners: A man is executed by fighters from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as the Al Qaeda-inspired militants continue their march towards Baghdad . ‘We need to come up with solutions that can enable the Iraqis to manage their internal security and their internal politics.’ Even after American troops left Iraq, the U.S. has continued to send weapons and ammunition - although not nearly as much as Baghdad has requested. A U.S. training mission for Iraqi counterterror forces dwindled to almost nothing earlier this year, and Baghdad asked as early as last summer for armed U.S. drones to track and strike terrorist hideouts. The administration resisted, and similarly rejected options for airstrikes in neighboring Syria. Instead, the U.S. Embassy has sold small scout helicopters, tanks, guns, rockets and at least 300 Hellfire missiles to Iraqi forces. A U.S. shipment of ScanEagle surveillance drones is to be delivered to Iraq later this summer, and the State Department is trying to speed an order of Apache helicopters to Baghdad. Additionally, Congress is reviewing a $1 billion order of arms, including Humvee vehicles, to Iraq. Kurdish Peshmerga forces and Iraqi special forces deploy their troops outside of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, the U.S. has continued to send weapons and ammunition - although not nearly as much as Baghdad has requested . The Islamic State, whose Sunni fighters have captured large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, aims to create an Islamic emirate spanning both sides of the border. It has pushed deep into parts of Iraq's Sunni heartland once controlled by U.S. forces because police and military forces melted away after relatively brief clashes, including in Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul. Skirmishes continued in several areas. Two communities near Tikirt - the key oil refining center of Beiji and the city of Samarra, home to a prominent Shiite shrine - remained in government hands, according to Iraqi intelligence officials. The price of oil jumped to above $106 a barrel as the insurgency raised the risk of disruptions to supplies. In its statement, the Islamic State declared it would start implementing its strict version of Shariah law in Mosul and other regions it had overrun. The militants, who operate under the banner of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Shams, have issued threats to anybody who defied a harsh code of Sharia they have imposed in captured territories . It said women should stay in their homes for modesty reasons, warned it would cut off the hands of thieves, and told residents to attend daily prayers. It said Sunnis in the military and police should abandon their posts and 'repent' or else 'face only death.' The Islamic State's spokesman vowed to take the fight into Baghdad. In a sign of the group's confidence, he even boasted that its fighters will take the southern Shiite cities of Karbala and Najaf, which hold two of the holiest shrines for Shiite Muslims. 'We will march toward Baghdad because we have an account to settle there,' he said in an audio recording posted on militant websites commonly used by the group. The statement could not be independently verified.","The planes, loaded with diplomats and .

"Filmmaker David Riggs couldn't have chosen a more perfect winter's day to send his quadcopter drone out above Observatory Beach on the southern coast of Western Australia. It was a crystal-clear day in the town of Esperance, and Riggs was hoping his high-tech rig would catch some sea life at play. But impeccable timing saw his quadcopter camera capture vision of about 70 bottlenose dolphins surfing in the pristine turquoise waters of Observatory Beach. Scroll down for video .

'I've never seen them that intense and that playful, either - it was just extraordinary,' he said. 'That's why I posted it because I knew people would get a kick out of this - it was great.' Riggs, a professional documentary maker, says he was filming largely for the fun of it when he captured the incredible scenes.

Several top politicians, both Republicans and Democrats, have called for the arrest and prosecution of Snowden for exposing the National Security Agency Secrets. King is the first to call for the arrest of a journalist in the case. Snowden went by the nicknames 'The True . HOOHA' and 'Phish' and spoke in hacker slang, referring to his 'lamer . friends' - non-hackers - and talked about attending Otakon, a convention . for anime lovers in Baltimore, Maryland. 'I like my girlish figure that attracts . girls,' he wrote, 'and I like my lamer friends. That's the best . biography you'll get out of me, coppers!' He joked that he 'got bullied' into being an editor on the website by a gaggle of artists and 'beautiful nubile young girls.' Ohio newspaper reporter Matt Skrajner dug up several photo collages that Snowden posted advertising fake hip-hop albums produce by the non-existent record label 'Pimp Daddy Records.' As an adult, the former CIA employee has . not left much of a digital trail on the Internet. Snowden, who turns 30 . later this month, does not appear to be active on social media sites . like Facebook or Twitter - at least not under his own name. But the website of Ryuhana Press, a now . defunct start-up that had sold anime art, offers a glimpse of Snowden as . a youth. As its web editor, Snowden's profile page is a mix of truth, . sarcasm and silly jokes. For example, he listed his correct . birthday - June 21, 1983 - and noted that it falls on the Summer . Solstice, the longest day of the year. But he also claimed to be 37 . years old and to have fathered two preteen children. 'I really am a nice guy,' Snowden wrote . on his profile page. 'You see, I act arrogant and cruel because I was . not hugged enough as a child, and because the public education system . turned it's (sic) wretched, spiked back on me.' Republican Congressman Peter King said Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who printed the NSA leaks, should be prosecuted . Fighting back: Greenwald has fired back, saying that King's allegations were based on lies . He wrote that he favored purple sunglasses and  he praised the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. Reuters viewed the website on Tuesday and contacted former company employees for comment. On Wednesday, the website had been taken down. Details of Snowden's past . emerged Wednesday as news broke that he gave an interview to the South . China Morning Post in which he claimed that the NSA has hacked the . country's universities, businesses and politicians. He said the agency had hundreds of . targets - including the Chinese University of Hong Kong - from as far . back as 2009, but that these were just a fraction of the 61,000 NSA . hacking operations carried out globally. He added that none of the documents revealed any information about Chinese military systems. 'We hack network backbones – like . huge internet routers, basically – that give us access to the . communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to . hack every single one,' he explained. Edward Snowden posted several 'posters' for made-up hip-hop albums on his Ryuhana Press profile . This poster of Snowden, which he presumably designed, promotes a fake album called 'Gold Plated Xtacy' The rail-thin 18-year-old Snowden joked about his 'girlish figure' and how it attracted young women .

Early May, 2013 - Snowden makes contact with the Washington Post regarding his trove of information on the NSA's surveillance of call and Internet data. A few weeks later, he contacts The Guardian .

June 9, 2013 - Snowden reveals himself in an interview with The Guardian . June 12, 2013 - Snowden gives an interview to the South China Morning Post in which he claimed that the NSA has hacked the country's universities, businesses and politicians . The hour-long interview, which took . part in a secret location on Wednesday, came after Snowden fled to Hong . Kong from his home in Hawaii on May 20 after leaking sensitive documents . about the NSA about its data-collection programs. Peter King, the controversial House Republican in charge of national security issues, said that Greenwald - the first journalist to publish Snowden's claims, should be prosecuted. He told Fox News on Wednesday: 'Not . only did he disclose this information, he has said he has names of CIA . agents and assets around the world and they’re threatening to disclose . that. ... No right is absolute. And even the press has certain . restrictions... 'But in this case, when you have . someone who has disclosed secrets like this and threatens to release . more, then to me, yes, there has to be, there should be legal action . taken against him. This is a very unusual case with life and death . implications for Americans.' Greenwald has responded with vigorous denials. 'Just watched the King video; everything he said is based on the blatant *lie that I threatened to disclose names of CIA covert agents,' he tweeted. Later, he said: 'Only In America can a renowned and devoted terrorism supporter like Peter King be the arbiter of national security and treason.' King is noted for his support of the Irish Republican Army when the group was targeting British soldiers and civilians with bomb attacks. Greenwald is a natural born American citizen. There are few recorded examples in American history - and none in the post-September 11-era - of journalists being prosecuted by the U.S. government for publishing classified leaks. Photographs uploaded by friends for . Snowden's 19th birthday show a young man pulling down his pants for his . colleagues, putting a clothespin on his chest, and dancing. Yearbook photos of Snowden in middle school and high school show a clean-cut, smiling young man. A blog entry from a company employee . teased, 'Who is he? What does he do?

'I always wanted to write RPG . campaigns with my spare time, but I'll get about three missions in and . scrap the world for my next, better, powergamin' build.' Snowden . said he liked playing the popular fighting video game Tekken. He was so . skilled that he attracted a gathering of fans at the 2002 Anime USA . convention, wrote a co-worker on another part of the site. 'He tends to . spontaneously be a ray of sunshine and inspiration. He's a great . listener, and he's eager to help people improve themselves.'

"A young hippopotamus who was stuck in a swimming pool at a South African game reserve died just after a rescue operation began. His body was today winched out of the deep pool at Monate Conservation Lodge, north of Johannesburg, using a crane. The hippo, named Solly, plunged into the water on Tuesday after being chased away by his herd at the reserve and quickly became firmly lodged in the big tub, which has no steps and is eight feet deep. Scroll down for video . Tragic end: The four-year-old creature is lifted from the swimming pool at the Monate Conservation Lodge after dying just after the rescue operation began . Too late: The pool had become dirty with his faeces after Solly was trapped there for three days before a crane was brought . Pitiful sight: Game reserve workers look on as the animal is removed from the pool at last . The pool was big enough for the four-year-old hippo to swim around it but lodge manager Ruby Ferreira admitted yesterday that there was no way he could climb out. MuIsabel Wentzel of South Africa's National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals said a  game capture team would undertake the operation and a vet was to be present. Most of the water was drained from around the unhappy creature to make the extraction easier, and staff planned to sedate him before he was lifted out. Wildlife rescue expert Simon Prinsloo poured water on Solly to keep him hydrated, but the poor hippo died just as the vet arrived. South Africa's Eyewitness News claimed the vet sent to sedate the animal might have been able to save him but arrived nearly four hours late. His one-ton body was winched out upside-down today with a rescuer standing on top. Ms Wentzel said the four-year-old hippo's mother had given birth recently, prompting dominant males to force the creature away from the herd and its mother. Unpleasant conditions: The hippo was marooned in the swimming pool after fleeing from his herd . Hide-out: The bullied hippo would have had to be moved to another animal sanctuary as he could not have returned to the herd that rejected him . He had been noticeably relaxed with no other male hippos fighting for dominance, although the water in the pool had become unclean with his faeces. The hippo was to be moved to another animal sanctuary as he could not have returned to the herd that rejected him. There are two species of hippos, both of which are found in Africa. The large hippo, found in East Africa, is a highly social yet aggressive animal. Social groups may consist of up to 15 individuals in which a hierarchical society is formed with the older stronger adults ruling the herd. The pygmy hippo, found in West Africa, is a much shyer and smaller animal, weighing around 440 to 605 pounds. Unlike the large hippo, its habitat is much more restricted to forest areas and is considered endangered.","Four-year-old hippo forced to flee herd after dominant males pushed him out .

"British war veteran Ronnie Jessiman (above) died in a Taliban suicide bomb attack while working as a security guard for a diplomatic convoy in Kabul . A British security guard who died yesterday in a suicide bomb attack on a diplomatic convoy in Afghanistan was today named as a married war veteran. Former Scottish soldier Ronnie Jessiman was among five killed when the Taliban targeted a UK embassy vehicle in the capital Kabul. Another Briton was among dozens wounded as the bomber pulled up in a car next to the official four-wheel drive vehicle and detonated his device. Mr Jessiman, who once served with 5 Scots, the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, was believed to be working for private security firm G4S as a bodyguard. The former Bellahouston Academy pupil had previously enjoyed a successful career in the army, where he was a section commander in 5 SCOTS Fire Support Group. An Army source told the Daily Record: 'Ronnie was an experienced soldier and really knew his stuff. 'It's just a tragedy. After he left the army, he worked in close protection - his role at the time he died. 'It just shows you that no matter how good your skills and drills are, sometimes your luck just runs out.' The force of the blast blew the embassy vehicle on to its side on a busy road close to Kabul's diplomatic area. Many other vehicles were torn apart in the explosion. A translator working for Britain was among four Afghans killed. More than 30 were wounded, including at least four children. Witnesses described the scene as a mass of mangled vehicles and bodies. Murdered: Investigators begin searching through the wreckage of the  British embassy's 4x4 vehicle that was struck by the suicide bomb blast . Scene of devastation: The suicide bomber is believed to have been travelling in this red Toyota Corolla, which was packed with explosives . Aftermath: A British citizen was among the five people killed in this morning's Taliban suicide bomb attack on a British embassy vehicle in the Afghan capital, the country's Interior Ministry said . Victims: A pool of blood is seen on the road following this morning's suicide bomb blast in eastern Kabul. The attack left at least five people dead and wounded more than 30 others, including four children . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond condemned the attack, believed to have been timed ahead of an international summit in London next week on Afghanistan's future following the Nato-led combat mission. Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the bomb and later attacked a district of Kabul which contains many embassies. It is understood that three of the victims in the first blast include members of a family who were heading to nearby Jalalabad for a wedding. A sixth body recovered from the scene is believed to belong to the suicide bomber himself, who was travelling in a red Toyota Corolla car packed with explosives. The explosion left 33 other people injured - many of them civilians who had been going about their business along the busy stretch of road running from Kabul to the city of Jalalabad, which lies 95 miles to the east of the Afghan capital. Taliban insurgents later released a brief statement claiming responsibility for the attack, saying the group had 'targeted foreign invading forces'. A second massive blast followed by exchanges of gunfire rocked Kabul's central Wazir Akbar Khan district, which houses a large number of embassies and foreign compounds. Destroyed: Eyewitness Mustafa Deveci told MailOnline that several of the dead were travelling to a wedding in this vehicle. A relative of the victims was later told by the roadside that her relatives had been killed . Gathering evidence: Investigators begin searching through the wreckage of vehicles caught up in the suicide bomb blast . Blasted: A young Afghan boy walks past the charred remains of a car engine that sits alongside the main road between Kabul and Jalalabad . The dead British national, whose name has not yet been released, has been confirmed as an expatriate employee of private security firm G4S. A G4S spokesman said in a statement: 'At 10:20am local time this morning in Kabul, a suicide-vehicle-borne improvised explosive device was detonated targeting a British Embassy vehicle moving through the city.' 'A local member of the Embassy staff and an expatriate G4S security team member were both killed in the explosion. 'A second British member of the G4S security team was injured. An investigation into the incident is underway and therefore we are unable to comment further at this time'. 'Next of kin have been informed and we will continue to provide them with support. Our thoughts and most heartfelt condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of those involved in this tragic incident.' Afghan Public Health Ministry spokesman Kanishka Bektash Turkistani that at least four children were among the 33 people injured by the massive suicide bomb blast, which he described as 'an inhuman act by the enemies of peace and stability in Afghanistan.' A British security official escorts a survivor from the wreckage of a British embassy vehicle after this morning's suicide bomb attack . Eyewitness Mustafa Deveci told MailOnline: 'The explosion happened at around 10am. I saw five or six civilian cars blown up on the road, I couldn't tell which ones belonged to the British embassy.' 'I saw the damage of the smoking cars. The explosion happened on a very busy road.It's the main road going from Kabul to Jalalabad. It's always full of people.' 'All the seriously injured people had already been taken to hospital when I got there, but I saw a guy sitting at the roadside with minor injuries. A woman ran up to him and asked if her relatives were all right, he told her they'd been killed. She just broke down and started crying and cursing.' 'She was pointing at the car in the picture I tweeted. The rest of her relatives were travelling in it. I heard they were going to a wedding in Jalalabad.' In a statement released yesternoon afternoon, Mr Hammond said: 'I am deeply saddened to confirm that a British national civilian security team member and an Afghan national working for the Embassy were killed in the incident. 'I condemn this appalling attack on innocent civilians supporting our diplomatic activity. The families of the victims have been informed and my thoughts are with them. The Foreign Office will do everything it can to support them. 'This outrage brings home to us once again the courage and perseverance of the people of Afghanistan and members of the international community who support them, who have lived together through decades of conflict. 'We will not allow such inhumanity to deter us from continuing our partnership with the Government of Afghanistan. 'I have nothing but admiration for the staff of the Embassy, British and Afghan, who work at great personal risk to help build a better future for Afghanistan. Pain: A young Afghan boy receives treatment at a hospital after a suicide attack in Kabul. Many of those injured were civilians who had been walking and driving along the busy road between Kabul and Jalalabad at the time of the explosion . Covered in blood: An Afghan man receives treatment for a head injury at a hospital in Kabul following the suicide bomb blast . The attack took place in the east of the city, shaking parts of Kabul and sending a huge plume of dust and smoke into the air. The interior ministry initially reported the blast was caused by a suicide bomber on a motorcycle, but later said attacker was travelling by car. The Taliban subsequently claimed responsibility for the attack in a brief statement, saying it had deliberately 'targeted foreign invading forces'. The area of the blast in eastern Kabul has many foreign compounds and international military installations. The particular stretch or road through which the car was driving is considered one of the most dangerous in the world, with four suicide bomb attacks there in the last two weeks alone. It is the latest in a wave of attacks to hit Kabul as the majority of foreign combat troops withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of the year. In recent weeks, insurgents have launched attacks on military convoys and compounds housing foreign service companies and their international employees. Leg injury: A young Afghan boy has an injury to his foot treated by a doctor at a hospital in central Kabul this morning . Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday condemned the attack, adding that it would be up to the Foreign Office to decide whether to heighten security at the British embassy. In recent weeks, insurgents have launched attacks on military convoys in the area and on compounds housing foreign service companies and their international employees. Kabul has come under almost daily attack as insurgents intensify their war on local security forces and U.S. and NATO troops, who are set to officially conclude their combat role in the country at the end of next month. On Tuesday two explosions shook the Afghan capital, leaving seven army officers wounded. A remote-controlled bomb exploded in Kabul's outskirts as a bus carrying Afghan army personnel passed by, said Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan defence ministry. A later blast shook houses in the Wazir Akbar Khan area of the city, which is home to embassies, international media offices and aid groups, but there were no casualties, police said. A day earlier, a magnetic bomb killed two U.S. troops in the Afghan capital. British embassies and staff have been targeted in trouble-spots around the world in recent years, with Kabul among them. In August 2008 a car bomb attack near the embassy in the Afghan capital left four people dead, although none were British personnel. In November 2011 the embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran was closed after it was stormed by a mob of protesters. In April 2010 the then British ambassador to Yemen, Tim Torlet, escaped unharmed when a suicide bomber wearing a school uniform detonated an explosives belt as he made his way to work in the capital Sana'a. The following October, his deputy, Fionna Gibb, escaped a rocket attack in the city. Last year the embassy in the Arab country was closed by the Foreign Office during the Islamic festival Eid, amid 'continuing security concerns'. On November 2003 the British Consul-General in Turkey, Roger Short, was killed by a suicide car bomb in Istanbul blamed on al Qaida which left 60 others dead and hundreds injured. This morning Franz-Michael Skjold Mellbin, the European Union's special representative in Kabul, wrote on Twitter: 'Strongly condemn this morning's indiscriminate attack in Kabul that left many Afghans dead and injured UK colleagues.'","Married war veteran Ronnie Jessiman was killed in Kabul blast yesterday .

"Silent suspect: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev stopped talking when he was read his rights by police officials . The surviving suspect in the Boston marathon bombings admitted to his role in the attacks to the FBI - but clammed up when finally read his Miranda rights. It has been revealed that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, initially confessed to authorities that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, carried out the attacks during 16-hours of questioning over the weekend. Dzhokhar has been communicating with law enforcement officials by writing on a pad after suffering an injury to his throat during the frenzied manhunt for him which renders him unable to talk. However, the moment he was read his rights on Monday - which as a citizen of the United States entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating. Indeed, it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, four officials and one law enforcement official said. Investigators had planned to keep questioning him. This apparent confusion came after the White House decided against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. It is unclear as to whether this will . matter in court as the FBI says Tsarnaev has already confessed to a witness. A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said: 'Before being advised of his rights, . the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, . Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the . attack'. Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzokhar Tsarnaev, are accused of carrying out the April 15 twin bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260 . Mr Livingstone sparked controversy by suggesting the brothers who launched the attack on the city's marathon acted 'out of anger and demand for revenge' over American foreign policy . The debate over whether suspected . terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a sticking point. Many Repuplicans believe they hinder intelligence gathering. The Department of Justice has said . investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other . threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases. Investigators have found . pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and are analyzing . them, officials said. One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs. A piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing. Experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb . Confused reports about the shootout in a Boston backyard have emerged. Officials now claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed as he hid in boat in Watertown. This contradicts Boston Police Commissioner's account of hour-long firefight with Tsarnaev . Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital . from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last Friday. Police had . previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an . hour last Friday before they captured him inside a boat in a suburban Boston neighbourhood. But yesterday, two unnamed officials . said that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions . about the gunfire and how he was injured. The report contradicts the Boston police department's own account of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's capture - after commissioner Ed Davies describes a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured. More than 4,000 mourners at the . Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police . officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing . suspects. Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice . President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted, . perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.' U.S. Vice President Joe Biden gives his respects to police officers at memorial services for officer Sean Collier, who authorities say was shot dead by the Boston Marathon bombing suspect . Mr Biden paid tribute to officer Sean Collier's family: 'The moment will come when the memory of . Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK. The purpose of . terror is to instill fear. You saw none of it here in Boston. Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.' Investigators have said the . brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on . the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist . group. Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in . Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.","Dzhokhar Tsarnaev questioned for 16 hours before read Miranda rights .

"A Thanksgiving Day fire at a Maine house hit close to home for firefighters — because it belonged to the local fire captain. The blaze broke out at Captain Dave Hudson's rural house off North Bath Road in Bath at about 4 p.m. on Thursday. But the Maine fire chief  lives so far from a hydrant, that firefighters were forced to douse the flames with water from a local pond. His family, including his wife and children, his mother-in-law, and others all escaped unharmed, but one person was taken to hospital, according to The Times Record. Fire: A fire broke out at Captain Dave Hudson's house in Bath at 4 p.m. on Thursday .

Firefighters from several surrounding communities responded from Bath, West Bath, Topsham, Woolwich, Arrowsic, Brunswick and Harpswell with Wiscasset serving as standby. Bath Fire Chief Christopher Cummings said there were no hydrants close to the house. 'We had to bring hoses in and pipe water from a pond, about 800-1,000 feet away,' he said. He told The Times Record: 'There is a lot of smoke and water damage. But we think right now the rest of the house can be saved.' Bath Police helped with traffic control, and the Mid Coast Hospital paramedic team was also on hand. Family: Hudson, seen here with an unidentified woman escaped unharmed from the fire . Hudson is a Bath Fire Captain who serves as Rescue Chief. He also works at Mid Coast Hospital as Director of Paramedic Services.

"An eye-catching two-toned lobster called Harley Quinn has become even more striking after moulting to reveal electric blue skin down one side of his body . He is the star attraction of the aquarium and it’s easy to see why. An eye-catching two-toned lobster called Harley Quinn has become even more striking after moulting to reveal electric blue skin down one side of his body. The strangely pigmented creature was captured near Bridlington in East Yorkshire in 2010 and has been looked after by curious staff who have since monitored his colourful transition at Scarborough Sea Life Centre. The chances of a lobster being two separate colours on each half of its body is around one in 50million and Harley Quinn is arguably even rarer as his claws are the opposite colours to the corresponding sides of his body, making him look like he has been divided into four. He is named after the comic servants called harlequins, who wore brightly coloured suits. The sea creature amazed experts when it was caught in 2010 with a yellow, red and black body, buts its unusual appearance has intensified with each moult. Harley, who is thought to be five or six years old, has now shed his unique armour for the second time since his arrival at the centre and his keepers were delighted to see his new suit is his most spectacular yet. ‘Whereas he was a reddish-black on one side and sandy colour on the other, he has now adopted a deep electric blue down one side,' said Amy McFarlane, of the centre. Lobsters shed their hard shells as they . outgrow them and need a quiet safe haven for a few days while a new . larger shell develops and hardens. A-moulting-mazing: The sea creature had surprised experts after it was caught in 2010 with a yellow, red and black body, buts its unusual appearance has intensified with each moult and it now has electric blue colouring. The lobster named Harley Quinn is pictured centre, with his two old coats, which have been carefully preserved . The lobster’s colour combination is rarer than one in 50million. Research suggests that one in every two million lobsters is pure blue, one in 30million is yellow and one in 100million is albino . The lobster is divided into two colours by a straight line down his carapace because of a genetic mutation. The two sides of the creature developed independently with one half having none of the blue colouring, crustacyanin. Selection for the animal pigmentation starts at the first cell division of the embryo so genes from one pigment went to one cells and the others to another, resulting in its half-and-half appearance. It is thought Harley Quinn has blue colouring because of another mutation. Research by the University of Connecticut discovered that the genetic defect that makes lobsters blue in colour is the presence of too much protein. Experts believe that the protein together with a red carotenoid molecule combine to create the striking colour. The colouring of most young lobsters . intensifies every time they moult and a spokesman for the centre told . MailOnline: ‘The process is much the same with normal lobsters but I’ve . never seen one that's half and half with a weird transfer of colour on its . claws – he looks like an old fashioned harlequin jester.’ 'The line down his back is dead straight. It’s almost as if someone has used a ruler and he was designed by a draftsman.’ The lobster’s two-toned colouring is the result of a genetic mutation. The two sides of the creature developed independently with one half lacking the blue colouring, crustacyanin. Ed Baker of the Office of Marine Programs at the University of Rhode Island told Science Blogs: ‘Selection for pigmentation starts at the first cell division of the embryo. Genes from one pigment went to one cell while the others went to the other. All subsequent divisions carry the same information.’ The centre’s spokesman explained that the aquarium has been home to albino lobsters in the past but the blue colour is also very rare. Whiter shade of pale: An albino lobster named Santa Claws was discovered off the coast of Bridport, Dorset. Only three albino lobsters have been found in britain in the last 20 years . Research by the University of Connecticut discovered that the genetic defect that makes lobsters blue in colour is the presence of too much protein. Experts believe that the protein combines with a red carotenoid molecule to create the striking colour. Ms McFarlane said: ‘He's such a striking individual he did extremely well to avoid predators like conger eels and seals when he was in the open sea. Now safe from attack, he could live another sixty or seventy years. ‘There have been unusual coloured lobsters found in the past but he is remarkable because he has two colours separated by a near perfect straight line along the back of his carapace.’ While Harley might be different to the other lobsters, he acts in the same way and ‘doesn’t know he’s different,’ according to the centre's spokesman. Lucky escape: A red lobster called Gumbo (pictured right) was saved from the pot in 2010 at Billingsgate fish market, London. Research suggests that one in every two million lobsters is pure blue, (left) one in 30million is yellow and one in 100million is albino. But red is so rare that it could be one in a billion .","The strangely pigmented creature, which lives at Scarborough Sea Life Centre has moulted for a second time to reveal its electric blue colouring .

The mask is described online as 'a new face stretcher from Japan that promises to give users a more youthful and energetic look'. 'It's cheaper and doubles as a great Halloween outfit,' states Japan Trend Shop, who sell the product. The stretchy accessory wraps around your face and claims to help exercise different muscles while you make all kinds of bizarre facial expressions. Apparently, this not only improves and increases blood circulation to your face, but also smooths out any wrinkles, lines and sags in just five minutes of daily use. Available only in pink, the Facewaver is made out of nylon and polyurethane and will fit most face sizes. Priced at £40.58 ($61), this bizarre invention markets itself as a more affordable way to tighten your face and cheeks. There are, however, no reports on whether it actually works. It all started with this: The Face Trainer works to reduce the signs of aging by toning the underlying muscles through a series of exercises . Strange: The device comes with detailed instructions of the exercises, which, if . done for 10 minutes a day, are meant to help build up the muscles under . the face and improve wrinkles . Among the amusing range developed in . Japan is the Hana Tsun nose straightener - billed as a 'nasal support . beauty clip' - which features two silicone prongs that must be inserted into the . nostrils. According to the . seller, also Japan Trend Shop, putting the gadget into one's nose for 20 . minutes a day is enough to achieve the perfect profile. Other unusual products sold on the . website include the £80 Eye Slack Haruka, which is aimed at combating . sagging skin around the eyes with battery-powered vibrating pads, and . the £70 Beauty Lift High Nose, which applies vibrations to help push the . nose higher and make it firmer. The . manufacturers insist that just three minutes' use a day will make . enough of a difference that others will notice the user's perky new . profile. Cartoonish: The Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece slips over the wearers natural lips and claims to enhance the natural pout without the need for injections . Quirky: The Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece is made of a pliable silicone that is said to be comfortable to wear . For those who hanker after the . plumped-up lips of Katie Price - or even more extreme, Pete . Burns - the rather cartoonish Face Slimmer Exercise Mouthpiece slips over . the wearer's own mouth, with the ultimate goal of boosting the lips to a . more prominent pout. And then there's the Facial Lift At Once Toner, a . cylindrical white plastic gadget that is gripped between the user's lips where it . buzzes at a high frequency, thereby toning the area. Buzz your way to a better nose: The Beauty Lift High Nose applies vibrations to help push the nose higher and make it firmer . Lip up: A facial lifting device fits between the lips where it buzzes at a high frequency to exercise the area, resulting, say the manufacturers, in a youthful, taut complexion . 'All . you do is put on the mouth cover, pop it in your mouth and it does the . hard work for you!,' the website claims, adding: 'If only running a . marathon could be as easy!' The Japan Trend Shop claims the results are instantaneous. Other gadgets include rubber masks that . can be strapped on to provide resistance for facial exercises (just 10 . minutes a day will provide staggering results, they say) and a pair of . outlandish goggles that the makers claim will mean you 'won't look old . and tired any more' thanks to their ridged form that massages tired, . lined eyes.

"Beachgoers were left astonished after a hammerhead shark gave birth to a litter of pups before their eyes at the water's edge. A crowd had gathered on the beach in Florida after a fisherman hauled the five foot shark from the water and dragged it towards the sand. As the creature thrashed around in the shallow water, onlookers spotted the tiny hammerhead pups wriggling in the sea. Pups: A tiny hammerhead shark pup can be seen in the water next to its mother on the Florida beach . The bizarre scene at Panama City Beach was caught on camera in the U.S. yesterday. Despite repeated attempts to guide the hammerhead back into deeper water, she kept swimming towards the shore. Local resident Kathy Hunt, who was . watching on the beach, told local station News 13 that the shark seemed to be . 'looking for a way out and was thrashing around the closer it got to the . shoreline'. Park rangers arrived at the beach to take control of the situation. They tried to coax the shark back into deeper waters, but the shark died around 3pm yesterday. Shark pups are very independent and often swim away from their mothers as soon as they are born, as these pups did in Florida. Pups do not receive any further nourishment or support from their parents after birth and fend for themselves in shallow waters,  where they have fewer predators than the open sea. Female hammerheads usually give birth to 20-40 live pups, which are about 70cm long as pups. In Florida, hammerhead sightings have increased in the past two years and it is now not uncommon to see them following fishing boats in an attempt to eat some of their trawls. Like the shark that gave birth in Florida, hammerhead species generally inhabit shallow reefs in tropical seas worldwide and can even be found in water shallower than one metre. Most hammerhead species are small and are considered harmless to humans. Efficient at hunting thanks to their unusual head shape and breadth of vision, they feed on fish, squid, and crustaceans. They do not actively seek out human prey, but are known to attack when provoked. Catch: The fisherman abandoned his rod and grasped the five-foot-long shark with his hand to haul it towards the sand . Spectacle: A crowd of onlookers had gathered on the beach as a fisherman hauled the hammerhead shark towards the shore . Pups: As the shark writhed on the sand onlookers spotted the litter of tiny pups . 'Stunned': It is possible the shock of being pulled from the water prompted the shark to give birth . Thrashing: Onlookers said the fisherman tried to guide the shark back to deeper water but that it kept swimming towards the shore .","Crowd of onlookers gathered at Panama City Beach, Florida .

"Spectacular images of giant sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef illustrate perfectly why the majestic animals are known as the ancient mariners of the sea. Captured swimming through the water in all their glory, the turtles are not phased by nearby snorkelers and divers, including German photographer Christian Miller, who took the breathtaking photos. Using their fins to effortless carve through the water, one turtle is pictured pushing a diver out the way - possibly more intent on finding a good feeding area. But hoping for some interaction, the diver attempts to give the turtle a kiss, which goes ignored. Ancient mariners of the sea: Giant sea turtles have been captured on the Great Barrier Reef by photographer Christian Miller, completely unperturbed by nearby divers and snorkelers . Pucker up: A keen diver tries to give one of the animals a kiss, but the gracious turtle seems more focused on finding a good feeding area than the attention from the man . The turtles have become used to the presence of humans underwater on the reef and can swim within touching distance of divers . Mr Miller, 36, now lives in Cairns in said his underwater photo shoots of the animals had seen him develop a close affection towards the turtles. 'When you're working this near to animals, you start to become close to them. Sometimes I have to put the camera aside just to enjoy their beauty through my own eyes,' he said. 'On most dive sites here in local reefs the sea turtles are used to human interaction and are quite friendly. They are most likely happily feeding on some algae or sea grass.' Mr Miller's dives with the turtles take about an hour and offer him a truly unique viewpoint as he watches the animals become inquisitive of divers and swim within touching distance. Move it: Despite the interest from divers, the turtles continue about not bothered as they get on their way . Prehistoric: Turtles have been on earth for about 150 million years and date back to the dinosaurs, helping them earn the moniker ancient mariners of the sea . The animals have lived in the sea for 150 million years, dating back to the dinosaurs and leading to them being called ancient mariners of the sea. Six sea turtle species including the green sea turtle, hawksbill turtle, loggerhead sea turtle, flatback turtle, the olive ridley and the leatherback sea turtle all breed on the Great Barrier Reef. Mr Miller said there are two things in his life he will never stop doing. 'One is to create art; the other is my passion for animals and nature. Photography merges the two, and so it doesn't get any better for me,' he said. The majestic animals are often happiest when feeding on sea grass or algae . There are more than six sea turtle species that breed on the Great Barrier Reef and add to the unique aquatic life .","Photographer Christian Miller has captured giant sea turtles on the Great Barrier Reef .

"Hundreds of dolphins are seen diving through the sparkling waters as they migrate along the Eastern Cape of South Africa. On the last leg of their annual 6,000mile migration, the dolphins can be seen joyfully breaking the surface, and jumping across the waves off the coast of Port Alfred. The migration saw the dolphins move from Mossel Bay on the south coast of South Africa along the Tsitiskamma Landscapes up though Algoa Bay to Port Alfred on the east coast. Long journey home: Thousands of migrating dolphins reach Port Alfred on their trip along the Eastern Cape of South Africa . Moving on: Coastal dolphins, such as these, are known to stay closer to the coastline and therefore do not travel as far as off shore dolphins, who prefer to live further out . Moving down the line: The large pod's migration has taken them from Mossel Bay on the south coast of South Africa, along the Tsitiskamma Landscapes, up though Algoa Bay to Port Alfred on the east coast . Photographer couple Silke and Rainer . Schimpf followed the dolphins for seven months – from February to August . - before they found the perfect conditions in Port Alfred, having spent a . total of 440 hours and travelled 6,060miles on sea. Silke said: ‘It suddenly all came into place. ‘We . found the common dolphins close to the river and followed them out at . sea for about 30 km, the light was perfect and the dolphins played . along. ‘I love seeing them 'bow riding', breaching next to the boat, just for fun, and hunting fish. ‘Here and there we can spot a humpback whale - these animals live a life of paradise.’ Jump for joy: The dolphins migrate with the seasons and often travel in pods of up to 30 individuals . Catching a ride: The dolphins are not the only animals moving along the South African coastline, birds also follow in their wake . Dedication: Photographers Silke and Rainer Schimpf followed the dolphins for seven months - from February until August - before shooting the spectacular images .

"When one of Sean Abbott's team-mates dropped a crucial catch as a youngster, he was always the good sportsman who would pat them on the back and reassure them it would be OK. That's according to friends and mentors from Baulkham Hills Cricket Club, the north-west Sydney institution where the 22-year-old known to his mates as Sabs or Sabba grew up belting cricket balls. Three days after Abbott bowled the fatal ball that critically injured Phillip Hughes, local club members have joined countless Australians in rallying around the up-and-coming cricketer. Ian Chatman, who managed Abbott's junior team for about eight years and witnessed his first century, told Daily Mail Australia he was a grounded young man who was 'loved by everyone, and still is.' Scroll down for video . 'Loved by everyone': Sean Abbott's local cricket community in Baulkham Hills, in north-western New South Wales, is rallying around him . The 22-year-old, pictured centre, is the kind of person who would always console his team-mates if they made an error . Tragic accident: Sean Abbott left hospital on Thursday surrounded by friends, including former Test opener Simon Katich (left) and another mate (right) The Australian team doctor, Dr Peter Brukner, spoke of the concerns for Abbott, who had been at St Vincent's Hospital, where Hughes lost his life, and had been receiving support from his teammates . Hughes' sister Megan (right) sat with devastated cricketer Sean Abbott at St Vincent's Hospital to support him . Hughes' parents Greg and Virginia Hughes and sister Megan leave Cricket NSW in Sydney on Thursday . 'He was really loved by his team-mates, and he cared about them as well,' said Mr Chatman, who said Abbott would be 'devastated' by Tuesday's events. 'He was always making sure that you know, if someone dropped a catch, he'd be over there patting them on the back saying, ""Don't worry about it, it's okay"".' Today, it is the Australian cricketing community who are patting Abbott on the back, after what doctors said was a 'very freakish' accident. Hughes' sister Megan and Australian skipper Michael Clarke have both consoled the devastated cricketer, who was just doing his job. And they were far from alone. Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten have both spoken in support of the struggling cricketer. Former Australian national Test captain Adam Gilchrist tweeted: 'May those footprints in the sand now support another young man in need. #SeanAbbott'. And social media users posting #putyourbatsout tributes penned scores of well wishes for Abbott. 'Shed a tear today, devastated for Phil Hughes, his family, Sean Abbott and cricket lovers,' said one. Abbott, who Club sources said was a focused and mature player even in his youth, is an inspiration for many of the young people who take to the pitch at Baulko. 'We're very proud of him for being our first Australian representative,' said Baulkham Hills Cricket Club Vice President Peter McLoughlin. The club's Facebook page is chockers with Abbott's achievements and the club has invited Abbott to speak its next crop of cricketers in the past. His love of sport was encouraged at Hills Sports High School, near Seven Hills in Sydney's west, and he was playing representative cricket for Parramatta by his mid-teens. Despite the recent accident, Abbott has had a stellar year on the pitch . Former test quick Staurt Clark said that Abbott had just been 'doing his job', which was to 'intimidate' the batsman . The star spinner, who has rugby league in his blood, has had a stellar 2014 on the pitch despite the recent accident. He came to the attention of national selectors in May when he took out the Steve Waugh Medal, the Sheffield Shield's best player of the season - a high honour. In a photograph in October, Abbott appeared pleased to be awarded his green and gold Australia One Day International hat by cricket legend Dean Jones. 'He's a genuine type of guy who's worked hard to get there and he knows where he came from, if you know what I mean,' Mr McLoughlin told Daily Mail Australia. 'All kids want to be Allan Border or Steve Waugh or bloody something and when you see a bloke who played for your club, they all know hard work will get them there, hopefully.' Mr Chatman said: 'He'll just be so devastated it's a ball he bowled. For him, I know he'll really struggle.' But, Mr Chatman said, he's got plenty of support. From the highest levels, too. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said. 'Sean will have all the support he needs around him. 'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.' Abbott delivered the ball that felled Hughes on Tuesday afternoon . Abbott was warmly embraced by teammates and cricketers at St Vincent's hospital on Thursday afternoon . The young cricketer was seen on Wednesday wearing a pair of sunglasses and was flanked by teammates . The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely . New South Wales' Sean Abbott (right) bowled the bouncer that hit Phil Hughes on Tuesday .

"A jellyfish with a powerfully toxic sting has been rediscovered more than 100 years after the last recorded sighting of it. The incredibly rare Crambione Cookii has not been seen since 1910 but has been recently spotted off the coast of Queensland, Australia, where it was captured. Not much is known about the mysterious species, which measures 50cm long and has a sting so powerful that it can be felt in the water surrounding the creature. The incredibly rare Crambione Cookii has not been seen since 1910 but has been rediscovered off the coast of Queensland, Australia, where it was captured . It was found by an aquarist who was releasing a rescued sea turtle. Puk Scivyer, who works at UnderWater World aquarium in Mooloolaba, said: ‘As soon as I saw it I realised it was a species I'd never seen before. ‘But to then discover I was the first person to see this species in over a hundred years was just incredible.’ She told Sunshine Coast Daily: ‘It was the size [that made it stand out]... but as we came past he was more of a cube shape and we could see he was not like the ones that we normally see.’ ‘It’s the biggest [jellyfish] I have seen in Australian waters.’ The incredibly rare jellyfish was discovered by an aquarist who was releasing a rescued sea turtle. Not much is known about the creature, which measures 50cm long . Marine biologists are baffled as to how the species, which was presumed extinct, has managed to evade notice for more than a century. The Crambione Cookii was last seen by American scientist Alfred Gainsborough Mayor off Cookstown, Queensland, in 1910. His sketch was until now the only record of the creature in existence and was even used to help identify the animal by jellyfish expert Dr Lisa-Ann Gershwin, who confirmed the existence of unusual ocean-dweller after it was captured. It is now being cared for at the UnderWater World aquarium in Queensland and will be observed closely behind the scenes to learn as much as possible about the species. Currently scientists do not know where the animals live, their life expectancy or their population size,  and Ms Scivyer thinks it is unlikely that any more will be found.

"Scientists believe that more than 100 dolphins washed up dead along the Italian coast were struck down by a killer strain of measles. A total of 101 dolphin carcasses have been counted on the west coast of Italy since the beginning of the year. All are the same species - striped dolphins which have a distinctive blue and white pattern and grow to about eight feet long. They usually live for 50 or 60 years. Concerns: More than 100 striped dolphins have washed up on the west coast of Italy during the last three months . The bodies have appeared on beaches spanning more than half the western coastline of Italy, from Tuscany to Calabria, as well as the island of Sicily - which suggests that the problem is not caused by humans pollutants such as oil. Instead the deaths are being attributed to a possible outbreak of Morbillivirus, the virus that causes measles in humans, which scientists believe created a gateway for other illnesses among the animals. Thirty-five per cent of the corpses tested positive for dolphin measles, Italy's Ministry for the Environment said. A statement from the ministry read: ‘At the moment the suspected cause of the mass cetacean deaths is measles (morbillivirus delphini) and the bacterium Photobacterium damselae. ‘The deaths could be caused by food shortages which weaken the animal making them more easily exposed to diseases and parasites.’ A similar epidemic decimated Spanish dolphin populations between 2006 and 2008. Bodies: The bodies have been found all along the Italian coast, from Tuscany in the north to Sicily in the south . The current strain has mostly affected young dolphins between the age of 15 and 20, who have not come across the disease before. Animals born after a 1990-92 epidemic are devoid of the antibodies needed to defend them against the disease, scientists said. None of the dead dolphins had food in their stomachs, which suggests that they may have starved to death because the virus left them weakened. Overfishing which has left the Mediterranean with sparse reserves of dolphin prey could also be a factor, the government agency said. Striped dolphins feed on small prey including hake, cuttlefish, squid, mackerel and sole, all species subject to intensive fishing. The species is found in all the world’s tropical oceans. They are very sociable, travelling in large pods which can include hundreds of dolphins and are among the most acrobatic breeds. There are thought to be around two million striped dolphins in the world.","Dozens of dolphin carcasses counted on west coast of Italy .

"There can be nothing better than cosying up on the sofa with your partner to watch a good flick. But be careful what you pick as a partner's terrible film choice is among some of the biggest causes of conflict within a relationship. Disgusting bathroom habits, messy eating and being glued to social media also come high on the list of irritations that are currently driving couples mad. The average person now spends 590 minutes watching movies they hate every year just to avoid a row. Men come off the worst with 80 per cent admitting to biting their lip over a film choice each month, while 23 per cent of women go along with rubbish flicks to keep their partner happy. Around 80 per cent of men admit biting their lip over film choices every month to try and avoid a bust up with their other half . Perhaps unsurprisingly, rom-coms like Love Actually are the worst offenders when it comes to film hates for men, while women find horror flicks such as Saw a real turn-off. First dates prove to be the most awkward scenario, with 13 per cent of people confessing to having gone along with a choice to make a good impression. Even celebrity couple Kian Egan and wife Jodi Albert admitted they had very different tastes when it came to picking a flick to watch. Westlife singer and King of the Jungle star, Kian, said: 'Of course I love a movie night in with Jodi but we don't have the same taste in films. I like action thrillers and she's more of a rom-com girl.' Jodi Albert, wife of Westlife singer Kian Egan (pictured) admitted she makes her husband sit through the occasional rom-com such as Love Actually . Jodi added: 'I admit I am guilty of making Kian sit through a few rom-coms now and then but I have had to watch my fair share of film flops. It would be nice to spend Christmas season without watching any turkeys!' 1. Leaving clothes on the floor . 2. Leaving wet towels around the house . 3. Bad bathroom habits . 4.

But it's not just our partner's film choices that can leave us fuming. The research, carried out by crisps company Pringles, revealed the number one irritation for couples is clothes being left lying on the floor. The lazy habit is something which winds up more women than men, with 34 per cent of ladies feeling the frustration compared to 19 per cent of guys. Rows about bad bathroom habits also feature at number 3 with leaving hairs in the shower plug (26 per cent) the top gripe. Being glued to our mobiles was the fourth largest irritation. Surfing social networks at the dinner table was by far the worst offence (20 per cent), followed by using their phone in bed (20 per cent) and whilst watching a film (19 per cent). Other moans which made the top ten included messy eating habits such as eating crisps in bed, leaving dirty plates out and drinking and eating straight out of the fridge.","Choosing a film is one of the biggest causes of conflict in relationships .

"Men settle on their favourite hairstyle when they reach the age of 32 after trying five different cuts, a study claims. Women on the other hand typically test out seven styles before finding the one they want to keep long-term. Male celebrities who have sported the same signature hairstyle since they were 32 include rock stars Mick Jagger, 69, David Bowie, 66, and Rod Stewart, 68. Old classics: Mick Jagger’s (left) hairstyle has changed little since his days in the Rolling Stones and fellow rocker Rod Stewart’s (right) is much the same as when he was 32 . Sticking around: Actors Ryan Gosling, left, and Jake Gyllenhaal, right, are both 32 now so could have the same hairstyle for the forseeable future . Reasons men gave for sticking with just one style vary from it being convenient (65 per cent) to admitting that it was because their partner likes it (10 per cent). Actors Ryan Gosling and Jake Gyllenhaal and singer Justin Timberlake are 32 now so are likely to adopt their current haircuts for the foreseeable future. The study of 2,000 people, carried out by hair brand Fudge, also looked into the influence celebrity hairstyles have on British men and the appeal of haircuts which would not  typically be seen as fashionable. One in five admit they want to grow their hair longer to copy the likes of David Beckham and actor Bradley Cooper, while a quarter think that London Mayor Boris Johnson’s blond mop works. Trendsetters: One in five men would like to grow their hair longer to emulate the likes of Bradley Cooper, left, while a quarter think that Boris Johnson's mop top style, right, works . Another 17 per cent rate Bradley Wiggins’ muttonchop sideburns as cool – although, at 33, the cyclist has now moved on to a less-recognisable style and shaved them off. Two thirds said they would prefer to go grey like Clooney, than start to recede. And 12 per cent of men would even consider dying their hair grey to keep up with fashion trends - surprisingly, six per cent have already done so. John Vial, from Fudge, said: 'There is a common misconception about men not being influenced by hair trends. 'Yet, these findings show British men make a significant number of attempts to find their signature style, just two less than the average woman. 'A hairstyle that reflects your personality is a clear priority for the modern man. 'And it’s great to see the influence greying celebrities are having on men too.'","Mick Jagger and Rod Stewart have had the same style since age 32 .

"Three tech giants have called on the U.S. government to provide greater transparency on national security requests as they sought to distance themselves from reports that portrayed the companies as willing partners in supplying mass user data to security agencies. Google Inc was the first to go public, releasing an open letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice for permission to disclose the number and scope of data requests each receives from security agencies, including confidential requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Microsoft Corp and Facebook Inc soon followed with similarly worded statements in support of Google. The NSA program PRISM collects data on millions of internet users from the biggest companies in Silicon Valley . Google is pushing back against claims . that it handed over user data en masse to a federal government program . and saying that the NSA never had 'backdoor access' to its servers . Company executives are asking the . Justice Department and the FBI to allow them to reveal the number of . secret national security court requests for data to prove that what the . search giant hands over is limited in scope. The . company was reported to have participated in PRISM, a program that . mandated tech companies hand over millions of personal records to the . federal government. Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple all reportedly participate - all have denied any knowledge of or participation in the PRISM program. Some of them have allegedly given direct access to their servers so the federal government can live-stream data. Pushing back: Google's Chief Legal Officer David Drimmond, left, and CEO Larry Page, right, both said they push back against federal government requests for data . On Sunday Larry Klayman, former . Justice Department prosecutor, lodged a lawsuit  challenging the . constitutionality of the NSA’s phone surveillance program and declaring . the newly disclosed spy operation an 'outrageous breach of privacy.' The suit names Klayman, the former . chairman of Judicial Watch, and two others who say the government has . illegally spied on their Verizon accounts. Today Klayman told U.S. News he . will file a second class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for . the District of Columbia targeting government officials and each of the . nine companies listed in a leaked National Security Agency slideshow as . participants in the government's PRISM program. Facebook and Google have denied any . such access accusations - saying they cooperate with the federal . government to the extent that they are required to - and not more. Edward Snowden, the NSA whistleblower who leaked the secret information about a classified U.S. government surveillance program . 'The U.S. government does not have . direct access or a “back door” to the information stored in our data . centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday,' the company said in a post last Friday. Google's letter - which represented . the first instance of the Mountain View, California-based company . acknowledging that it has received FISA requests - argued that releasing . the total number of national security requests would show the company . does not give the government 'unfettered access' to its users' data. 'Assertions in the press that our . compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered . access to our users' data are simply untrue,' Google Chief Legal Officer . David Drummond wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and . FBI Director Robert Mueller that was published on Google's public policy . blog Tuesday. 'Google's numbers would clearly show . that our compliance with these requests falls far short of the claims . being made,' the letter said. Google's letter came three days after . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed Prism's . existence and described it as an internal computer system that helped . the government collect data obtained from Internet companies through . FISA requests. Since 2010, Google has published . semiannual transparency reports that reveal the number of data requests . it receives from authorities. But the reports have never included requests made under FISA due to their confidential nature. Following negotiations with the FBI, . Google began publishing in March the number of national security letters . - confidential requests for the data of domestic users - that it . receives from law enforcement officials. Drummond argued Tuesday that . publishing the number of FISA requests would 'likewise serve the public . interest without harming national security.' Other Internet companies that are . typically fierce rivals quickly closed ranks around Google. Sources . close to the three companies said the statements were not coordinated. 'Permitting greater transparency on . the aggregate volume and scope of national security requests, including . FISA orders, would help the community understand and debate these . important issues,' Microsoft said in an emailed statement. Leading social network Facebook followed within minutes. Following: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive. The social network said it would 'welcome the opportunity to provide a transparency report' 'We would welcome the opportunity to . provide a transparency report that allows us to share with those who use . Facebook around the world a complete picture of the government requests . we receive, and how we respond,' Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general . counsel, said in an emailed statement. Twitter's top lawyer Alex Macgillivray also tweeted in support of Google.

"With her shiny body and smooth curves, this £15-million superyacht is a real wealth symbol. The Adastra, unveiled today in China, is the new floating pleasure palace of billionaire businessman Anto Marden who commissioned its construction five years ago. Designed by Sussex-based yacht designer John Shuttleworth, the Adastra is so high-tech, it can even be cotrolled remotely at the touch of an iPad... as long as you don't get any further away than 50 metres. Space age: The trimaran yacht Adastra certainly made an impact during its launching ceremony yesterday in China . Marden, who is based in Hong Kong and . made his fortune in the shipping industry, will be able to sail the . state-of-the-art boat between the two islands he already owns off the . coast of Indonesia. Described as ‘one of the world's most amazing super yachts’, Adastra is 42.5 metres long, 16 metres wide and weighs 52 . tons. ‘It takes the power trimaran concept further than has ever been . attempted before,’ Mr Shuttleworth told Boat International. Owner: Anto Marden, who is based in Hong Kong, made his fortune in the shipping industry . ‘The challenge of turning this . concept into a viable luxury yacht has taken us to further research and . to develop new thinking on stability and comfort at sea for this type of . craft.’ It is the result of five years of planning and construction, and rivals anything owned by yacht-lover Roman Abramovich. The hull of the Adastra is built from glass and Kevlar and can house nine guests and six crewmen. The deck saloon has a panoramic view while the open cockpit has sofas on both sides. The open deck running aft also . has a door that hinges . out to create a bathing platform. Maximum speed reached by the yacht is 22.5 knots and her . range is an astonishing 4000 nautical miles at 17 knots. That is enough for a trip from the UK to New York. Boat International magazine said Adastra 'could spell the future for efficient long range cruising'. The yacht has an integrated ship monitoring system, and . can even be controlled with an Apple iPad within a 50-metre range. Adastra is powered by one Caterpillar C18 engine of 1150hp . at 2300 rpm and has 2 Yanmar 110hp @ 3200 rpm outrigger engines. Adastra's 16-metre beam features a saloon area on the main . deck with a lounge area, dining table, and navigation station. The deck at the rear of the yacht has a sofa and bar area to . port and a dining area to starboard. The main helm station, which has seating for two, is . positioned in a raised pilot house situated between the rear deck and the saloon . area and forms part of the cross beam structure. The Adastra is the latest in a long line of super yachts that compete to be the most high tech. Last year Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich bought a £300 million superyacht with two swimming pools, two helipads, a gym, hair salon, dancefloor and submarine. Eclipse has plenty of room to entertain friends, . with 15 double bedroom cabins all equipped with their own luxury . bathrooms and 6ft wide television screens. Parties on the 533ft yacht . are guaranteed to stay private, as it’s fitted with an ‘anti-paparazzi . shield’ that fires a laser beam of light at cameras to ruin photographs. The 20,000 sq ft interior also houses a sauna, steam bath and whirlpool to help guests wind down. The superyacht is 42.5 meters in length, 16 metres in width and weighs 52 tons . The Adastra was built in Zhuhai, China for a couple based in Hong Kong, at the cost of a cool $15 million . Five years in the planning and construction phase, the Adastra has finally taken to the water, much to the delight of boating enthusiasts . The superyacht has space for nine passengers and 5-6 crew, and can travel 4,000 miles without refueling .

"An animal trainer has become the first person in the world to be awarded a Masters degree in how sea lion whiskers work. Alyx Milne from Liverpool has been fascinated by the mammals ever since she visited SeaWorld as a child. The 27-year-old, who works at Blackpool Zoo, loves them so much she decided to write a dissertation on the motor neuron abilities of their whiskers. Alyx Milne was awarded a distinction for her research into sea lion whiskers at Manchester Metropolitan University . After extensive research, Miss Milne has been awarded a distinction in the subject from Manchester Metropolitan University. The first of its kind, her research will be published in the Comparative Physiology Journal. Sea lions use their hyper-sensitive whiskers to know where to look for fish by picking up vibrations in the water. Made up of tiny nerve fibres, they help the mammals navigate their way across the ocean and avoid preying creatures. 'From the moment I was splashed by a killer whale while visiting SeaWorld, Florida, I knew that I was going to be a ‘Shamu’ trainer one way or another,' said Miss Milne who is now pursuing a PhD in marine mammals. 'Working with the sea lions at Blackpool Zoo has been a major part of my research. 'I’m so pleased I have something so great to show for it.' Opened in 1972, Blackpool Zoo is home to more than 1,500 animals from all over the world and has the largest sea lion pool in Britain.

"Dolphins are said to share the human traits of bravery, jealousy and even a sense of humour. But it seems they share some worrying vices as well. Scientists were amazed at footage of the mammals apparently getting 'high' with the help of a toxic puffer fish. Seaworld sillies: Dolphins have been filmed eating toxic puffer fish, which when digested in small doses can have a 'narcotic-like effect' In . an extraordinary scene filmed for a new TV series, the dolphins are . shown gently passing the fish between them. Experts believe the . creatures are using the toxins, which emerge from the puffer fish as . part of its defence mechanism, for their own enjoyment. They nudge the fish with their snouts and as the toxin is released into the water, they seem to lapse into a trance-like state. At one point the dolphins are seen floating just underneath the water's surface, apparently mesmerised by their own reflections. The . dolphins were filmed gently playing with the puffer, passing it between . each other for 20 to 30 minutes at a time, unlike the fish they had . caught as prey which were swiftly torn apart. The . footage, from a forthcoming BBC1 show called Dolphins: Spy  in the Pod, . was taken by wildlife  filmmaker John Downer – who has previously used . hidden cameras to bring the secrets of penguin colonies to television . screens. Mr Downer designed underwater cameras disguised as squid, tuna and even other dolphins. Toxic trance: The footage, captured in the TV series Dolphins: Spy in the Pod, shows the dolphins deliberately putting the puffer fish in their mouths (left) and afterward, appearing intoxicated hanging near the surface (right) Zoologist and series producer Rob Pilley said that it was the first time dolphins had been filmed behaving this way. He . added: 'We saw the dolphins handle the puffers with kid gloves, very . gently and delicately like they were almost milking them to not upset . the fish too much or kill it. 'As a result the fish released various toxins as a defence. 'The dolphins then seemed to  be mesmerised.' He . insisted that the scene couldn't have been a one-off encounter, saying: . 'The dolphins were specifically going for the puffers and deliberately . handling them with care.' Fun-loving fish: The dolphins were filmed watching their reflections just below the surface in the series which used cameras disguised as sea creatures including a dolphin to get a glimpse of the mysterious life of the mammal . Never seen before: Viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the centre of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once in the up close footage . The BBC1 series follows the success . of Penguins: Spy In the Huddle, which used similar tactics of disguised . cameras, documentary producer Mr Downer was eager to create a range of . cameras disguised as sea creatures to offer viewers unprecedented . proximity to their favourite species. As . well as the Dolphincam, the Tunacam, Turtlecam and Squidcam have also . been created for different spying roles, with each fitted with HD . cameras to capture life under the sea. With the help of the cameras, viewers can watch a mother teaching her calf to catch fish and leap from water, as well as finding themselves at the centre of huge megapods with thousands of dolphins swimming around them at once. Hundreds of hours of filming were put into the programme which will be narrated by David Tennant. Some 900 hours of raw footage collected over a year from around the world including America, Coasta Rica, South Africa, Argentina and Australia. The puffer fish footage was filmed in waters near Mozambique. The film crew also dived some 1,500 times, spending nearly 3,000 hours at sea filming with the Spy Creatures in all types of weather. Sea spies: The disguised cameras included Turtlecam (pictured), Tunacam and Squidcam to spy on other deep sea species . Secretive sea creatures: With the use of the secret cameras and human dive crews, a huge amount of raw footage was collected such as this close-up with a bottlenose dolphin . Speaking of the project, Mr Downer said: 'Unlike Penguin-cams, this time our spy creatures had to keep pace with fast-moving dolphins, often out in the deep ocean. 'The dolphins were very curious about their new neighbours and allowed them into their lives.' Downer's last project, Spy in the Huddle, took viewers inside the world of penguins by deploying 50 cameras to the arctic for almost a year. The first of the two-part series will air on Thursday, January 2 at 8pm on BBC1.","The footage features in TV series Dolphins: Spy in the Pod .

"A hair-raising four-minute computer animation reveals what it will be like to descend 570 feet at speeds of up to 65pmh from the top of the world's largest rollercoaster. Until the aptly named 'Skyscraper' opens in 2017, thrill seekers will have to settle for the video. Released by US Thrill Rides, the company behind Skyscraper, the clip shows the Orlando rollercoaster in all its glory. Scroll down for video . The world's tallest rollercoaster is set to open in Orlando, Florida, in 2017 - and thrill-seekers are in for a treat with this towering metal monster named Skyscraper . Tumbling and twisting at speeds of up to 65mph, this is one rollercoaster that is not for the fainthearted . The video shows the ride taking off from inside the Skyplex entertainment complex and climbing skyward through twists and turns until it reaches its incredible 570-foot peak. The simulation then shows the cars drop, dip and dive down the track, which is spiraled around the tower overlooking Orlando. 'Skyscraper will not only take riders higher than ever before, but also introduce one thrill right after the next - there's no 'down time' on this four-minute coaster experience,' Bill Kitchen, founder of US Thrill Rides told the Orlando Sentinel. 'It is an absolute cutting-edge engineering marvel that will deliver pure adrenaline unlike any roller coaster in the world today.' A four-minute computer animation of the terrifying new rollercoaster was released by US Thrill Rides, the company behind Skyscraper . The  rollercoaster, which will be the centre of the new $200 million Skyplex entertainment complex, is not only designed to be the tallest in the world, but the most thrilling too. 'The unique design of the coaster means more incredible, heart-pounding inside and outside loops, dives, spirals and inversions in a vertical area than riders have ever before experienced,' Mr Kitchen added. For those who aren't sure they can stomach the twists and turns of the rollercoaster, there will also be a look-out point 535ft above ground, accessible by glass elevators and offering panoramic views of Orlando. The video shows the ride taking off from inside the Skyplex entertainment complex and climbing skyward through twists and turns until it reaches its incredible 570-foot peak . And next door to the rollercoaster, the 420ft Orlando Eye Ferris wheel will offer another sedate lookout option. The towering roller coaster will not be housed in any of Orlando's most famous theme parks - instead it will be the star attraction at the city's International Drive, which is an area normally reserved for hotels and eateries. International Drive's new $200 million, 495,000-square-foot Skyplex entertainment complex will begin construction in 2015 and is set to feature simulators, shops rock climbing, bars and restaurants.

"Final results looks like old paper theatres . For quirky cut out artist Alexander Korzer-Robinson a picture really is worth a thousand words. Sentences and paragraphs are of little interest to the 37-year-old who instead cuts around different images from 150-year-old Victorian books and carefully pieces them together to create a brand new 3D art form. The Bristol-based artist, originally from Leipzig in Germany, has created vivid, detailed collages that feature everything from old soldiers standing to attention to giant pink flamingos. Intricate: From Boys Own adventure books to a History of the 19th Century artist Alexander Korzer-Robinso has turned old books into an art form . Works are created using only the pictures that are already in the volumes and the end result is a hollowed out book with a layered composition similar to the Victorian paper theatres that were hugely popular at that time. The books are sealed around the cut so they can no longer be opened, but are designed to be either hung on the wall or can stand by themselves as an art object. 'Most of my piece are unframed, and have a pane behind the cover to protect the delicate contents.' Mr Korzer Robinson has had his work exhibited in the UK and the U.S. and will be showing his work in Switzerland later this year.

Painstaking: The Bristol-based artist, decided to use antiquarian books to deconstruct our ideas of the past . He said he came up with the innovative design about five years ago. ‘I had been experimenting with paper art, trying out different avenues and making boxed paper constructions,’ he said. 'I used all sorts of printed paper for the construction, among them second hand books. 'It wasn’t a giant leap from the boxed art to using the actual book as the enclosure of its original content. 'But it took me about a year of trial and error to refine the technique into the cut books I makes these days. Spooky: The books are sealed around the cut so they can no longer be opened, but are designed to be either hung on the wall or can stand by themselves as an art object .

'So it was really the result of a process of experimentation. He started exhibiting the books about three years ago and he said it was his mission to deconstruct ideas of the past through his work. 'The three-dimensionality is something that draws people in initially,' he added. 'But for me the inspiration starts at the point of choosing a book to work on. 'Then as I work on the piece the planning part is conscious decisions about what I want to make out of the book. 'There are a lot of unconscious decisions and value judgements that come up in this dialogue with the medium.

Today, the springs are now designated part of a state park. During the warmer months seats are often filled, but in February, according to Collinge, only a few people were in the audience. This gave her more of an opportunity to photograph the mermaids, but it also meant the park looked pretty deserted. Under da sea: The women thrive in the water .

"Heroic: 27-year-old Mark Wright died in the botched operation in Helmand province in September 2006 . Defence chiefs have gagged soldiers from talking about a botched Afghan rescue mission portrayed in a new film. An official letter warns servicemen not to discuss the RAF’s controversial role in the 2006 operation to save paratroopers stranded in a minefield. Personnel have also been ordered not to wear their uniform to the cinema to see the film Kajaki: A True Story – and banned from talking about whether the Army should have given more support to filmmakers. The letter, issued by the Parachute Regiment and seen by the Mail, reveals how Ministry of Defence bosses refused to back the film, despite originally saying they would. Last night Labour defence spokesman Vernon Coaker accused the MoD of imposing ‘draconian rules’, adding: ‘It’s totally unnecessary and mind-bogglingly illogical.’ The film, released yesterday, tells how one soldier died and six others were injured during an operation in Helmand province in September 2006. Paratroopers were injured by explosions when they became stranded in an unmarked minefield during a mission against Taliban fighters near the strategic Kajaki Dam. But further tragedy struck when the downblast from a hovering RAF Chinook helicopter sent to rescue them set off another mine, wounding more soldiers and causing fatal injuries to Corporal Mark Wright. The 27-year-old from Edinburgh was posthumously awarded the George Cross for his brave attempts to save the lives of colleagues while suffering serious wounds himself. Scroll down for video . At his inquest in 2009, the MoD was heavily criticised when a coroner said officials should ‘hang their heads in shame’ for failing to send helicopters fitted with winches. The film was made after a plea by scriptwriter Tom Williams in the Mail for more British war films that celebrated courage – . Mark Stanley (pictured) plays Paul 'Tug' Hartley in the new film Kajaki: A True Story, released yesterday . Ahead of the film’s release, serving Paras were sent a letter saying they were free to attend screenings – but not in uniform. And it warns about voicing their opinions on the mission, asking them not to ‘actively engage’ with the media. ‘Please do not get involved in the whys/wherefores/what-ifs of the events of the day,’ it reads. ‘Please do not be drawn into a wider commentary on whether wider support should have been given by the Army/MoD to the film.’ Paras are also instructed not to be drawn into a wider debate on the Afghan campaign. A relative of a Para who had received the letter said troops were ‘surprised’ by it, adding: ‘They wanted to go and show their support for a soldier who died fighting to save his comrades. ‘They are frightened, what have they got to hide? It is a film about heroism. This letter opens your eyes, it is all shrouded in secrecy.’ Stu Hale (played by Benjamin O'Mahony) and Stu Pearson (played by Scott Kyle) in the new movie, which servicemen have been banned from going to see in their uniform . Andy Barlow (played by Liam Ainsworth) in the movie, which tells the story of the Paras in the botched rescue bid in Afghanistan in September 2006 . The letter also reveals how military top brass removed their support for the movie despite backing from Cpl Wright’s parents and former paratroopers involved in the incident. Movie-makers Pukka Films were given permission by the MoD in the summer of 2012 to interview soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment (3 Para). But in October 2013 the MoD reviewed the script and pulled their support. The letter read: ‘After careful consideration of the script, engagement with Pukka films and consultation with serving personnel involved in the incident, the Parachute Regiment, Army and MoD have concluded that they cannot support this film. Accordingly the Parachute Regiment, Army and MoD are not to be represented as supporting this film.’ An official letter warns servicemen not to discuss the RAF’s controversial role in the operation . However, it contradicts a Ministry statement last month that said it was ‘untrue to suggest the MoD has withdrawn its support’. It is understood defence bosses considered the film to be ‘way off reality’ and showed the RAF and senior officers in a negative light. Defence sources said: ‘There were issues with it – the RAF hit and the portrayal that officers were in the back in the operations rooms while the soldiers were taking all the risks, which couldn’t be further from the truth.’ An MoD spokesman said: ‘The decision not to engage with Pukka Films further was made for a number of reasons, principally the demands on the time of serving soldiers and resource limitations.’ Personnel have also been  banned from talking about whether the Army should have given more support to filmmakers.

"Video footage of a glowing squid-like creature swimming in a harbour, might have baffled experts, but the mysterious animal has now been declared a hoax. Stunned eyewitnesses had filmed the strange, luminescent, tentacled creature, which was flashing a variety of colours floating close to the top of the water in Bristol. But it has now been revealed that the paranormal animal was part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote a new TV programme. Creature from the deep? It has now been revealed that the 'alien squid' was part of an elaborate marketing stunt to promote a new TV programme . Sightings of the creature by the public puzzled marine biologists. Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said: ‘It's very intriguing - I don't really know what to make of it.’ The guerrilla campaign was created to launch a new show called ‘The Happenings’ on Watch, which features the magicians ‘Barry and Stewart’ and is made by the producers of Derren Brown. The guerrilla video campaign featuring the mysterious creature was made to launch a new show called 'The Happenings' on Watch, which features the magicians 'Barry and Stewart' and is created by the producers of Derren Brown . The TV show is described as a ‘new type of narrative magic show’ that brings film scenes to life, which are unleashed upon unsuspecting residents from towns across the UK and the U.S. It launches on Monday December 9 at 9pm on Watch. The videos, which include ‘paranormal’ events and what is described as a ‘giant bioluminescent alien’ have racked up over one million views since they appeared on YouTube four months ago. The videos, which include 'paranormal' events and what is described as a 'giant bioluminescent alien' have racked up over one million views since they appeared on YouTube four months ago . The squid looked more mysterious at a distance but the new images allow people to see how the 15ft model was constructed . Bristolians took to social media to report the 15ft, squid-like alien pulsing beneath the water in the city's harbour. Videos and images shot by stunned locals of the tentacled alien first appeared on Tuesday and within 24 hours over 3.5 million related tweets were written. Before the hoax was revealed, one Twitter user questioned whether the squid had escaped from Bristol Zoo. Here the 'animal' lies in wait outside a local bar. Its presence in Bristol harbour had baffled marine biologists . This bizarre sight greeted people walking along Bristol harbourside - described by some as an 'alien-like creature' floating underwater . Dozens of people were left flummoxed after spotting the creature and quickly grabbed cameras to snap it. Some people suggested that Bristol artist Banksy might have had something to do with the strange object. Marine biologists admitted they were baffled by the footage and suggested it could have been a marine salp which had drifted off . course by the weather. Dr Steve Simpson, from the School of Biological Sciences at Bristol University, said before the unveiling: 'This is either a very interesting animal or someone's very cool interpretation of a marine creature.' Marine biologists claimed the footage could be a marine salp which had drifted off course by the weather. Dr Simpson said: 'There is a possibility that it is a special type of jellyfish or a marine salp. It's very unusual and I haven't really seen anything like it before though.

"A distraught father has demanded ministers take action after his teenage daughter was raped by a boy obsessed with hardcore online porn. The schoolgirl, who was 14 at the time, was bound, gagged, beaten up and raped by the 15-year-old as he tried to re-enact sadistic scenes he had viewed on the internet. Yesterday, her father renewed calls for restrictions on internet porn after it emerged the boy spent hours every day looking at disturbing sex videos in the months leading up to the attack. Sentencing: The older of the teenage attackers has been sentenced to three years in juvenile detention at Teesside Crown Court for the horrific rape of a 14-year-old girl . Earlier this week, he was jailed for . three years, after a court heard his interest in sex was left . ‘heightened’ and ‘unfulfilled’ by watching the material, and he had . wanted to ‘experiment’. Following the case, the girl’s father . said: ‘Any porn is inappropriate at that young age. But it’s the extreme . violent nature that is worrying. ‘Kids can get it on their mobile phones really easily. They can get it anywhere. ‘There must be some sort of . restrictions they can bring in. Surely the safety of girls like my . daughter is more important than people’s liberty.’ Following the case, pressure groups have renewed their support for the Daily Mail’s campaign to block online porn. Teesside Crown Court heard how the boy carried out the attack in April last year with a friend who was 14. 'Your interest in sexual matters was heightened and heightened, unfulfilled, and you wanted to experiment' Judge Simon Bourne-Arton . The older boy was said to have come . from a stable and respectable background, living with a supportive . mother in a semi-detached house. But psychiatric reports revealed he . became obsessed with watching sadistic pornography on his computer . without his family’s knowledge, and wanted to re-enact the scenes he had . seen. The three teenagers were at a house in . Hartlepool, County Durham, when the two boys locked her in and turned . off her mobile phone. They then gagged her and shoved her in to a cupboard before tying her to a chair and threatening her with knives. She had plastic bags put over her head and a scarf tightened around her neck. The court heard the boys laughed as she was pulled down the stairs and banged her head against a wall. when will ministers act.jpg . Judge Simon Bourne-Arton jailed the . older boy for three years, after hearing he was led by the more forceful . younger boy, who was sentenced to four years. Both had admitted rape . and false imprisonment. At an earlier hearing, Judge Bourne-Arton described the attack as 'heinous'. Judge Bourne-Arton told the older boy: ‘You had for many months, spent many days trawling through internet pornography. ‘Your interest in sexual matters was heightened and heightened, unfulfilled, and you wanted to experiment. ‘Weak-willed you may be and . weak-minded you may be, but you knew everything that you did to her.

"The family of a man who died after he was refused an ambulance claimed yesterday he lost his life because an NHS ‘computer said no’. Taxi driver Bill McLaughlin dialled 999 at 5am as he was finding it hard to breathe. But after putting his details into a computer an operator told him he did not need an ambulance. Taxi driver Bill McLaughlin, who was told that he didn't need an ambulance despite saying he found it hard to breathe and living just a mile away from his local ambulance station . The 55-year-old, a former merchant seaman, had been ill for three weeks and had seen five doctors about swelling after a change in his blood pressure medication. It has now emerged he did not give the answers that ‘trigger’ the need for an ambulance and was told to contact his GP instead. Pat Woodcock, 75, Mr McLaughlin’s partner of ten years, said: ‘I don’t drive and by this point his stomach was so swollen he couldn’t get behind the steering wheel. ‘In the end his doctor came out to see us just before 1pm and said he needed to go to hospital. They took him in a paramedic car, got him to the [intensive care] ward … He never regained consciousness.’ Mr McLaughlin died four days later, on September 1. A post-mortem examination found fluid around his body had caused heart failure. His family demanded to know why an ambulance had not been sent in the first place, from a station just three minutes from his home in Bridport, Dorset. They were told a computer system had decided neither an ambulance nor immediate hospital admission was necessary. The ‘computer says no’ catchphrase was coined by comedian David Walliams in the BBC’s Little Britain, in which a worker inputs data and then informs a customer they cannot be helped.

Last night Mr McLaughlin’s son Ross, 28, said: ‘I think Dad was let down by the NHS even before the ambulance. No one seemed to be doing anything about the fluid building up in his body. ‘It was then decided by a computer programme run by non-medically trained personnel who listen out for keywords, enter them … and the computer said no. I thought it was like Little Britain … but my dad died and that’s not acceptable.’ He added that an ambulance ‘would have given him an extra ten to 12 hours of treatment … that could have saved his life, but there’s no way to know for sure now’. The family is considering legal action to get the computer assessment system changed. A South Western Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘Every time a call is made … a comprehensive triage process is undertaken. ‘An ambulance will be dispatched to those deemed to be in a life-threatening condition.’","Bill McLaughlin felt unwell and called 999 after struggling to breathe .

"Wild dolphins around Africa have been found to have names identified by a unique whistle. Experts say the discovery, which has previously only been seen in captivity, could shed new insight on how the animals communicate. They also say it could reveal if human's are causing the animals to change their behaviour. Scroll down for video . The discovery, which has previously only been seen in captivity, could shed new insight on how the animals communicate . Each animal learns its own individually distinctive whistle, known as a signature whistle. These signature whistles are exchanged by groups of dolphins when they meet at sea and are used to address each other - similar to how humans use names. But it was unclear whether African bottlenose dolphins use a similar communication system, until now. The vast majority of research into how bottlenose dolphins communicate has been conducted in captivity or on animals who are restrained during the study. These have shown that each animal learns its own individually distinctive whistle, known as a signature whistle. These signature whistles are exchanged by groups of dolphins when they meet at sea and are used to address each other - similar to how humans use names. But it was unclear whether African bottlenose dolphins use a similar communication system, until now. A new study, published in Plos One, has found that both species of bottlenose dolphin found in south Africa and Namibia; the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) and the common bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), use a communication system based on signature whistles. 'The population we study in Walvis Bay, Namibia is a small, isolated population of common bottlenose dolphins,' said project leader, Dr Tess Gridley of the University of Pretoria and the Namibian Dolphin Project and Sea Search. 'Currently, there are only around 100 animals in the population. Walvis Bay, has lots of man-made pressures, including coastal construction, shipping and marine tourism. 'We are therefore concerned for their long-term welfare and capacity to cope with these stressors,' The research provides an important stepping stone for future studies into how the sounds are used, and whether human activity is affecting communication in the small dolphin population. Using a hydrophone – a microphone used for underwater recording – Gridley and colleagues collected over 79 hours of recordings of signature whistles, alongside identification photos of the dolphins who made them. On analysing the data they found good evidence for signature whistle use. Gridley fears that noise from the construction may block the dolphin's signals making it harder for them to communicate with each other. 'In the same way that the desert elephants or desert lions are small, locally adapted populations in Namibia's terrestrial environment, the common bottlenose dolphins found along Namibia's the coastline should be considered quite an important population and are locally threatened by coastal construction and marine tourism,' she says. Video Source NERC . Bottlenose dolphins use sound to find food and navigate, as well as communicate with each other. Bottlenose dolphins can learn new sounds and can quickly mimic novel sounds that they hear. Flipper, in the 1995 film version of the TV series - he was famously able to communicate with whistles . Bottlenose dolphins are an iconic marine species and one of the best studied dolphin species worldwide. But, research in Africa, especially on the larger truncatus form, is much more sparse. Most dolphin species rely on a wide variety of sounds in their day to day lives. They use sound to find food and navigate, as well as communicate with each other. Bottlenose dolphins can learn new sounds and can quickly mimic novel sounds that they hear. Although fairly common among many bird species and humans, this ability, termed vocal production learning, makes them quite special amongst mammals. Using a hydrophone – a microphone used for underwater recording – Gridley and colleagues collected over 79 hours of recordings of signature whistles, alongside identification photos of the dolphins who made them. On analysing the data they found good evidence for signature whistle use. 'We found that the number of different signature whistles recorded increased when group sizes were larger and when calves were present - something you might expect if signature whistles are used to address each other and help maintain contact between animals, particularly between mothers and calves,' explains Gridley. The catalogue of whistles produced as part of this study will help researchers to build a better understanding of how human activity is affecting the dolphins. Next, Gridley is also hoping to look into whether these individually distinctive calls can be used to monitor how the dolphins use their habitats.","Signature whistles are exchanged by groups of dolphins when they meet .

"The pole dancer girlfriend of the NSA whistleblower is so distraught over his fate that she is only just 'holding on', her father has revealed. Jonathan Mills said Lindsay is so upset over what will happen to Edward Snowden she has not even phoned him - and instead has gone to ground. Father and daughter have only communicated by text in which she told him she is ‘holding up as well as can be expected’. In his first interview since the story broke, Jonathan also revealed that he has already forgiven Snowden for putting his family through hell - even though his daughter faces arrest and a possible prison sentence. Forgiven: Jonathan Mills, the father of the NSA whistleblower's girlfriend Linsday Mills, says he has forgiven his daughter's boyfriend . Mr Mills said he has not spoken with his daughter since news broke that her boyfriend left her behind and fled to Hong Kong . Stunning ballerina Lindsay Mills, 28, took to her blog on Monday to detail her heartbreak over being suddenly left by 29-year-old Ed Snowden . Jonathan’s disclosure gives fresh insight into the agony that Snowden’s decision has inflicted upon his girlfriend of five years, who he had considered marrying. Lindsay, 28, had previously written on her blog about how she was ‘adrift’ at losing Snowden, 29, who she described as her ‘mystery man’. He is currently in hiding out in Hong Kong having leaked secrets about the National Security Agency's PRISM programme, which monitors millions of American citizens, to the media. Family members have said that Lindsay is currently with friends on the West Coast, though she could still be in Hawaii, where she and Snowden had been living together. Jonathan, 48, spoke outside his suburban home in Laurel, Maryland, with a look of resigned fatigue on his face. Wearing a light blue polo shirt and khaki trousers, he said he last saw his daughter two months ago when she came home to visit for a week. Tiny dancer: Lindsay Mills has posted numerous photos and videos on her personal blog of herself pole dancing . Miss Mills wrote that pole dancing served as an art form, as well as offering her exercise and an outlet to express her 'sensuality' One of Miss Mills' routines involved a samurai sword and music from Quentin Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass,' Lindsay Mills writes about being suddenly left by NSA whistle blower Ed Snowden. Mills describes spending time with her mystery man, who clearly resembles Snowden . Jonathan said: 'I've met Ed. He's very nice, shy reserved. They've been dating four or five years.’ Asked if he was surprised at what Snowden did, Jonathan said: 'It wasn't out of character. He's always had strong convictions of right and wrong so it kind of makes sense, but it was a shock’. Jonathan was not even angry that he was being put in this position, saying ‘alright, I understand' He said that he did not know if his own views or those of his daughter - who dislikes the surveillance state - had any influence on Snowden. He said: 'Lindsay is holding on. I've not spoken to her. She's holding up as well as can be expected'. Asked if he knew where she was, he said: 'I have no idea'. Earlier a blonde woman in her 50s thought to be Jonathan’s girlfriend went into his house and claimed to be the best friend of Lindsay’s’ mother Martha. She said: ‘He (Jonathan) has nothing to do with it and she (Lindsay) has nothing to do with it’. Keeping a secret: Snowden says he never told his girlfriend about his life-altering plans, saying he left weeks ago saying only that he had to travel for business . Slinky: Miss Mills posted numerous videos of herself pole dancing for audiences . Obsession? Lindsay wrote: 'Pole has been a major part of my life for the past year, but after a recent move across an ocean I've found it harder to find time for pole' Flexible: Miss Mills has been involved in acrobatic troupes in Hawaii before she went to ground after he boyfriend revealed himself . Since Snowden leaked the data he has effectively brought an end to any future he hoped to have with his girlfriend. The pair seemed blissfully happy even though they appear to be totally different people. She is an extrovert who enjoys walking around naked whenever she can, spends her Sunday evenings in circus classes and surrounds herself with bohemian eccentrics. The title of her blog reads: ‘Adventures of a world-traveling, pole-dancing super hero.' Snowden by contrast is a shy computer geek from a suburban family who likes to spend Sundays at football games and needed to be coaxed out of his shell to even do karaoke. On Monday she took to her blog - where she has posted dozens of photos of herself semi-naked  - to tell of her heartbreak. She wrote: 'My world has opened and closed all at once. Leaving me lost at sea without a compass. 'As I type this on my tear-streaked keyboard I’m reflecting on all the faces that have graced my path. 'The ones I laughed with. The ones I’ve held. The one I’ve grown to love the most. And the ones I never got to bid adieu. Better times: Lindsay Mills seen here with Ed Snowden before he suddenly took off for Hong Kong after leaking confidential information . This photograph of a Hawaiian sunset was taken by Mills recently. She has taken to her blog to write about her regret over how 'sometimes life doesn't afford proper goodbyes' Miss Mills has not spoken to her father since the earth-shattering revelation about her boyfriend on Sunday . ‘But sometimes life doesn’t afford proper goodbyes.' It was an awful turn of events for Mills who had lived with Snowden since at least 2009, when they were in Japan together. Last year he whisked her 8,000 miles from their home south of Baltimore, Maryland to Hong Kong where family friends thought they got married because it was a 'special place' for them. Snowden fled to a luxury hotel Hong Kong weeks ago after he decided to release the secret documents about the NSA's surveillance programs. He never told Mills about his plan - saying only that he needed to leave for a few weeks and offering a vague explanation. When he revealed his identity in the Guardian on Sunday, he said he expected he might never see his family again. The shocking leak of classified surveillance programs has sent shockwaves through the nation. Some have hailed Snowden as a hero. Several high-profile members of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, are calling his act treasonous and demanding he be arrested. His whereabouts are currently unknown after he checked out of his luxury hotel on Monday - though he is believed to still be in Hong Kong.","Jonathan Mills, of Laurel, Maryland, has said his daughter is too distraught to even speak with him on the phone .

"Michael Overd was accused of using threatening or abusive language as he preached last July . A Christian street preacher was yesterday cleared of harassing a gay couple - after telling them homosexuals would 'burn in hell'. Religious Michael Overd, 47, was accused of using threatening or abusive language against Craig Manning and Craig Nichol as he preached last July. A court heard that he approached the pair in busy Taunton High Street, Somerset, calling them ‘sinners’ and proclaiming they would ‘burn in hell’. But Overd claimed he was merely . exercising his right to expression by reading from the bible and was . acquitted of the charge by Taunton Deane Magistrates yesterday. Dean . Lampard, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), speaking after the . verdict, said: 'We take allegations of this nature very seriously and . when we reviewed the case we determined it was appropriate to charge Mr . Overd with harassment. 'We . examined the evidence and were satisfied that there was a realistic . prospect of conviction and that it was in the public interest to bring . criminal proceedings. 'We respect the magistrates’ decision today.

Overd, of Creech St Michael in Somerset, was charged last September in relation to alleged homophobic hate crime against a gay couple in Taunton. Overd's lawyers claimed his client was merely reciting a passage from 1 Corinthians . The court heard claims the lay preacher was provoked by a previous altercation with Mr Nichol and Mr Manning in October 2010, when he saw them holding hands. Mr Nichol, giving evidence at the two-day trial, said as soon as Overd saw them from around 10 metres away on July 16 last year 'the expression on his face changed'. He said: 'He said ‘I have already told these two sinners over here that they are going to burn in hell’. 'He looked at us and pointed at us when he said it. His voice was quite loud and very clear. I felt angry, embarrassed and ashamed. 'I asked him who he was to judge me and he said ‘it’s God’s words, it is in the bible’. 'He said I should repent and ask God for forgiveness.' Paul Diamond, representing Overd, claimed his client was merely reciting a passage from 1 Corinthians.

The extremely rare PINK dolphin  was photographed leaping out of the Amazonian water . The pictures were taken by Michel Watson, a tourist. The 66-year-old, from France, managed to capture several images of the elusive freshwater dolphin before it disappeared back into the water along with a friend. He said it was the first time he had seen the mysterious mammal. He added: 'I was thrilled when I saw it. I was so happy because they don't usually jump a lot and don't normally play like the common marine dolphin so it was quite unusual. 'I believe their skin is thinner than that of a normal dolphin so the blood vessels are just under the skin which gives it the pink colour. They sort of look like pigs with long beaks.'

The potentially endangered aquatic mammals rely on an internal sonar system to manoeuvre under water and find food. Historically, the Amazon Pink River Dolphin, also know as the Boto, has been spared by humans because of the belief that it has special powers. However, today they are increasingly viewed by fishermen as an unwanted competitor for fish and are also at risk of getting tangled up in fishing nets. Researchers believe that they are declining at a rate of 10 per cent each year. Scientists do not know exactly know why the dolphins are pink. However, they believe that the coloration is due in part to the dolphin's diet of crabs and shell fish as well as the presence of a large number of blood capillaries near the surface of the dolphin's skin. The unique animals are known to flush an even brighter shade of pink when they are excited.","Rare bubblegum pink dolphin photographed in Amazonian river .

"Psychiatric disorders could be treated with a tiny chip implanted in the skull after a new research programme was announced by a defense agency. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding the research costing $26 million with the aim of finding more effective treatments for current and ex-servicemen, who suffer from conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder. The project, which will be carried out by UC San Francisco (UCSF), is the first research project launched in support of President Obama’s Brain Initiative and will be called Systems-Based Neurotechnology for Emerging Therapies (SUBNETS). The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency hopes to develop devices to stimulate the brain, which will eliminate the symptoms of anxiety disorders . It is hoped the research will show the detrimental signaling patterns that are evident in major depression, anxiety disorders and addiction. They then hope to develop devices to stimulate the brain and strengthen alternative circuits, which means the symptoms of these conditions can be eliminated. Dr Edward F. Chang, team leader of the new project explained: 'Human brain recording can now reveal aspects of mental illness that have been inaccessible to scientists and doctors. Once the signalling patterns of conditions such as depression or post traumatic stress disorder are identified, the implantable devices will show the neural circuits, which are common with the disorders. The devices will then pick up when this neural activity is occuring in the brain and determine if electrical stimulation should be delivered to correct the abnormal brain pattern. Source: UCSF . 'By analyzing patterns of interaction among brain regions known to be involved in mental illness we can get a more detailed look than ever before at what might be malfunctioning, and we can then develop technology to correct it.' A team at the Massachusetts General Hospital will also work with Draper Laboratories to develop the microchips that could be implanted under a person's skull. Electrodes could then deliver tailor made therapy to the patient and record neurological data. Anxiety disorders, which include post-traumatic stress disorder, cost the U.S. $42billion a year, nearly one-third of the country’s total mental health care costs, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. DARPA hopes to build on the implants already used to treat Parkinson's disease, including the Medtronic, pictured . Researchers say existing treatments such as therapy and some medications can help the conditions but they can take many weeks to have an effect. Vikaas Sohal, an assistant professor of psychiatry at UCSF added: 'There are millions of people for whom these disorders are not well treated. 'These patients are not able to keep their jobs or to work at all, because they're constantly struggling with symptoms of their illnesses and the pain and suffering they cause. 'This project offers hope because it’s a totally new way of seeing how the parts of the brain interact in mental illness. 'It’s as if we’ve been looking at still images of actors but will now be able to see the performance of a play.' The U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency last month announced that it is working on restoring memories using brain implants that could reverse the loss in wounded soldiers, and benefit Alzheimer's and dementia patients. DARPA added that they hope to build on neuroengineering advances such as implants already used to treat Parkinson's disease, built by Minneapolis firm Medtronic.","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is funding the research .

A Spurs spokesman said: ‘Anti-Semitism in any form is wholly unacceptable and we support all efforts to kick it out of the game. ‘We hope those individuals responsible for this vile behaviour are identified and dealt with in the strongest way possible.’ West Ham co-chairman David Gold, signing autographs, reminded fans of their conduct before the match . The letter emailed to West Ham fans before the game from owners David Sullivan (pictured) and Gold . Kick It Out indicated they received ‘several reports’ on Sunday about the video. Chairman Lord Ouseley said: ‘What would have happened if we hadn’t seen this footage or it hadn’t been reported? We need to give people the confidence to challenge discriminatory and abusive behaviour, and this can only be reinforced by action being taken by police and within football by clubs and authorities. ‘Anti-Semitism must be tackled with the same vigour as all other forms of discrimination.’ In a further disturbing twist, a young female Tottenham fan told how she was abused in the street by a woman wearing a West Ham scarf — while police officers nearby did nothing.

She tried to hit me and a friend got in front of me.’ She said the attacker — who was in her 40s — gave the same friend a black eye and scratched her face. ‘The woman was finally dragged away by her kids. Then a man with her called me an Israeli c***. ‘There were police on duty within 20 metres of us and they didn’t do anything.’ Miss Bedi told how she had also suffered racial abuse at Arsenal and West Ham.
