Miami Dolphins player Jonathan Martin was best friends both on and off the field with his alleged tormentor-in-chief Richie Incognito, claims the team's quarterback. Martin walked out on the Dolphins last week after reportedly suffering a catalogue of abuse, including a racist voice mail message, from guard Incognito, who has been suspended. But according to quaterback Ryan Tannehill, far from being enemies, the pair were in fact close friends who would 'hang out' together off the field. Scroll down for video . 'Best friends': Richie Incognito, left, and Jonathan Martin, right, were close friends claims Dolphins' Quaterback Ryan Tannehill . Incognito, told a local TV reporter that he was 'just trying to weather the storm right now' as reports have emerged that he may have been under orders to 'toughen up' Jonathan Martin . Tannehill said: 'If you had asked Jon Martin a week before who his best friend on the team was, he would have said Richie Incognito. 'The . first guy to stand up for Jonathan when anything went down on the . field, any kind of tussle, Richie was the first guy there. Support: Dolphins' quarterback Ryan Tannehill said Incognito and Martin would 'hang out' off the field . 'When they wanted to hang out outside of football, who was together? Richie and Jonathan.' After leaving the team last week, Martin briefly checked himself into a South Florida hospital to be treated for emotional distress. The Dolphins's management arranged for his parents to travel to South Florida from their home in California where he is now staying. His father Gus told omg! Insider: 'He's a strong man. He's doing fine.' According to one source, who did not wish to be named, Martin . had considered giving up the sport because he was mistreated by other . offensive linemen. The source added Martin, who sought counseling for emotional issues, now plans to continue playing. Incognito . was reportedly told by coaches to 'toughen up' Martin when he subjected . his teammate to abusive voice mail and texts messages. It . has been revealed that after Martin missed two days of organized team . activities (OTAs) last spring, coaches encouraged Incognito, the . offensive line's undisputed leader, to 'get [Martin] into the fold.' Just . days later Incognito left a threatening, and racially offensive voice . mail in which he called Martin, who is bi-racial, a ‘half n*****,’ threatened to slap his mother across the face and uttered the words . ‘I'll kill you.’ Last week, . Martin's agent said the second-year player from Stanford was harassed . almost daily by teammates in his rookie year and the hazing continued . into this season. That . prompted an NFL investigation, and the Dolphins suspended Incognito, who . sources said sent Martin threatening and racist messages during the . offseason. The Dolphins suspended Incognito late Sunday for misconduct related to the alleged harassment of Martin, who abruptly left the team a week ago to receive help for emotional issues . Rant: An obscenity-laced video of Richie Incognito has emerged in which he uses the N-word when greeting a teammate . Commissioner Roger Goodell appointed a New York lawyer with experience in sports cases to investigate the case. The . controversy attracted more than 100 reporters and cameramen to the . Dolphins' complex Wednesday, and when the throng entered the locker room . after practice, a player pushed the button on a boom box sitting at . Incognito's stall and Circus music began to play. Dolphins' players have rallied passionately defended Incognito and insisting they . didn't see the blowup coming. Most said Martin and Incognito were . friends. 'I don't know why . he's doing this,"" offensive tackle Tyson Clabo said. ""And the only . person who knows why, his name is Jonathan Martin.' Guard John Jerry said he never heard Incognito use the racist term included in one voicemail and wouldn't have objected anyway. 'I . would have just laughed it off,' Jerry said. 'I know the type of person . he is, and I know he doesn't mean it that way. Everybody's got friends . that when you're out, they say those type of things. It's never made a . big deal.' Was Incognito under orders? It isn't clear whether the instructions to 'toughen up' Martin came from head coach Joe Philbin, pictured, or another coach . The 30-year-old . Incognito was kicked off his team at Nebraska, and has long had a . reputation as one of the NFL's dirtiest players. But he has been . universally praised by his teammates this week. 'Does he like to give guys a hard time? Yes. Does he like to pester guys and have fun? Yes,' Tannehill said. 'But . he brought a lot of laughter to this locker room, he brought a lot of . cohesiveness to this locker room and he was the best teammate that I . could ask for.' For Martin, . the final straw was a lunchroom prank at the team complex, and he then . left the squad. Tannehill and Jerry said the same prank has been pulled . on many other players. Hijinks are especially common among the offensive linemen, Clabo said. 'We . have a system of basically it's just a big joke, basically,' he said. 'It helps camaraderie. It keeps things light in the room. Everyone . participates. No one is exempt and so I don't see how ... we would all . be guilty of bullying.' Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, has taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates . The 24-year-old Martin was briefly hospitalized after he left the team and is now with his family in California. Tannehill said he was shocked when Martin departed. He . added: 'The whole thing, it's kind of mind-blowing to me. It's kind of . mind-blowing to most of the guys on our team right now. 'It's tough for me, because you can't help a situation that you didn't know existed - that no one on this team knew existed. 'We . have a bunch of good guys in this locker room.

Belita Howell, 58, found guilty of neglecting a pensioner with dementia and ¿orchestrating¿ a cover-up . A care home boss has been sentenced after being found guilty of neglecting a pensioner with dementia. Belita Howell, 58, former manager of Mother Redcaps care home in Birkenhead, Merseyside, received a 12 month suspended sentence, after a patient died after falling out of his faulty bed. Walter Witcherley, 86, suffered a broken hip and died in hospital a month later, as Howell tried to orchestrate a 'cover up'. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Howell was warned prior to the fall by a member of staff that the brakes on Mr Witcherley’s bed were faulty. The pensioner had previously been assessed as having a high risk of falling after spending a month in hospital after a similar incident. The court was also told how Howell, whose sentence was suspended for two years, was responsible for the pensioner’s welfare but did nothing to ensure his bed was fit for purpose. After discovering that Mr Witcherley was in hospital, Andrew Ford, prosecuting, said the former care home manager tried to cover up the incident. The court heard that Howell instructed that a log in the maintenance book, that said the bed needed to be repaired, should be marked off, to give the appearance that work had been completed. Andrew Ford, prosecuting, said: 'As manager of Mother Redcaps, she had a responsibility to care for Mr Witcherley. 'She had failed to maintain a proper bed for him and following that effectively covered it up in the aftermath of the fall Mr Witcherley suffered, where he sustained fracture injuries. 'There was a complete absence of a rail and sufficient brakes on the bed and he was not the same again after the fall.' Charles Lander, defending, commented: 'There were problems in the nursing home that pre-dated the defendant’s employment. Redcaps care home in Birkenhead, Merseyside. The court heard that Howell instructed that a log in the maintenance book, that said the bed needed to be repaired, should be marked off . 'She has worked hard all her life and her loss of income means her house is now up for sale.' Judge Andrew Hatton said: 'Your appearance before this court is a real tragedy. 'You are a 58 year-old woman who has worked hard all her life. 'There is no evidence that the injury sustained by Mr Witcherley was the cause of or precipitated his death. 'But it is clear to me that his final few weeks were made considerably more difficult than the weeks preceding the injury. 'He was left bed-bound as a result of your neglect. 'Walter Witcherley was at the time an 86 year-old man who suffered from advanced dementia and as the manager you were responsible for his care. 'He presented a significant risk of falling and it was essential that his treatment in the home included a bed with adequate rails and sturdy brakes. This was tragically not the case and he died of his injuries a few weeks later.'","Manager Belita Howell, 58, received 12 months suspended sentence .

But the world's oldest paperboy has reluctantly decided to hang up his bag after delivering more than 500,000 papers in Winterborne Monkton near Dorchester, Dorset, because his knees have finally given up on him. The 93-year-old took up the part-time job when he was 22 years old to earn extra pocket money but loved it so much he never gave it up. Tireless: The world's oldest paper boy Ted Ingram, 93, will hang up his bag this weekend. He has delivered more than 500,000 papers since he began the round in 1942 (pictured right) The pensioner was officially recognised by the Guinness World Records three years ago after doing the job for more than seven decades, but he has chosen to retire and will drop his final paper into a letterbox this Saturday. Mr Ingram, who began the job in 1942, said: 'I've really enjoyed my time as a paperboy and have had so much fun.

Mr Ingram started doing the round to top up his income as a tractor driver on a farm, and delivered the newspaper to 26 houses in the village on his bike. Incredibly, there have only been two days in the last 70 years when his customers have failed to receive their papers - and that was when bad snow storms prevented the copies from reaching him. He has only ever had two holidays, both of which were in the 1960s when he took his family to Butlins. But he ensured the people on his route would not miss out on their daily paper by getting a neighbour to look after his round each time. Setback: He had to stop cycling a few years ago after having a hip replacement and now gets a lift around the village during his round . Not stopping: He was still going strong when he was 80-years-old in 2000 . And even when he broke his back in the 1950s he arranged for his late wife Betty to deliver the papers in their village while he was recovering. Mr Ingram was forced to stop cycling a few years ago after having a hip replacement and now gets a lift around the village so he can do his round.

Guilty: Karl Karlsen is shown pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for crushing his son under a truck in 2008 in a life insurance scheme that netted him $700,000 . A man has admitted killing his son in an insurance scam that gained him $700,000. Authorities say Karl Karlsen, from upstate New York, confessed to the crime. Seneca County District Attorney Barry Porsch said 53-year-old Karlsen's guilty plea to second-degree murder came as a surprise a day before his trial was set to open. Karlsen was charged with murder and insurance fraud after the death of his son Levi. Prosecutors say Karlsen killed the 23-year-old on November 20, 2008 by toppling a truck on him as he worked underneath at his father's home in Yale Farm Road. His death was initially ruled an . accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after . the incident, raising suspicions. A family member tipped off the police about the large insurance policy and opened an investigation into his death last year . Karlsen was sole beneficiary of Levi's insurance policy. Investigators have also been reviewing the 1991 death of Karlsen's former wife, Christina Karlsen. She died in a Calaveras County, California, fire that also resulted in an insurance payout. Karlsen has denied causing her death. Karlsen has not been charged in relation to anything related to his wife's death. His daughter, Erin Deroche, spoke to ABC News last month saying she has no doubts that her father is guilty of killing her brother and their mother as well. It . wasn't until Deroche and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said . they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being . truthful regarding their mother's death. Karlsen: Flanked by officials, Karlsen is pictured on ABCnews . Tragic loss: After ten hours interrogation by police, he finally admitted he had been there when the truck fell on his son Levi and had accidentally caused it to happen, before leaving him to die . ‘Between . the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try,’ Deroche said. ‘He . didn't make an effort to save her. He just stood there,’ she told ABC . News. However, when she . and Levi confronted their father, Deroche said, ‘his biggest concern was . that he wondered what the community would think of his own children . accusing him of murdering their mother.’ The Democrat and Chronicle says in media interviews Karlsen said his ex-wife's death, his son's death and a 2002 fire at his Seneca County farm that killed his Belgian draft horses, for which he collected $80,000 in insurance money, were all just coincidences.

Account: The police record from the incident telld how Mr Reyes hit his . son several time across the face leaving him with a black eye . The boy's father . Jose Horacio Reyes, 32, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child abuse . charges, after admitting hitting his son in January 2012. Police records tell how the pair had . argued after returning home from buying video games. The youngster was . apparently having trouble counting the money to pay for the games and . his father had tried to teach him. There . had apparently been a disagreement after which Reyes, referred to as . Reyes-Mandujano in the record, said to his son: 'You don't have to be a . crybaby.' He told . the police that his son then became upset and hit him at which point he . lost control and smacked the boy two or three times across the face with . an open hand and then a back hand. The record states: 'The strikes to REYES face resulted in a black eye.' The following day the father reported the incident to school officials and was arrested on felony child abuse charges. He . later pleaded guilty in Sparks Justice Court to a misdemeanor charge of . child abuse, neglect or endangerment and was ordered to pay a $500 fine . and attend anger management and parenting classes. Hero: Michael Landsberry, 45, pictured with his wife Sharon, was shot . dead by 12-year-old Jose Reyes at the school where he taught in Sparks, Nevada . Landsberry is believed to have been a married father who had just celebrated his wedding anniversary this weekend . According to the arrest report, Reyes told police he felt  'sick to his stomach' about what he had done. The record shows that he had no previous criminal history and that his son told the same story about the incident.' The . arresting officer wrote: 'Reyes-Mandujano is being very cooperative and . honest and forthright, but I was still going to place him under arrest . and take him to jail tonight.' The . shocked community is still struggling to come to terms with the . shooting and explain what drove an apparently happy 12-year-old to bring . a gun into school. His . parents described him as a loving son who would kiss them every day and . used to save the money he earned working at his family's restaurants to . buy gifts for his two younger sisters and treat his parents to dinner. A tearful Michelle Hernandez, left, is led away from Agnes Risley Elementary School following a shooting at Sparks Middle School on Monday morning . Law enforcement personnel gather at the scene of a shooting at Sparks Middle School. The scene was cleared by SWAT teams and a bomb disposal unit . Mr Reyes said: 'We did not know Jose was angry or upset about conditions at school. 'He . had never complained about any particular teacher or student. We knew . that he had been teased and that he was trying to work through a speech . problem that he had.' Teacher Michael Landsberry, . 45, who died after being shot by the boy was an ex-Marine who coached . basketball and soccer and was known as a big fan of Batman. He . had served several tours of Afghanistan before becoming a much loved . teacher. He is understood to have been shot while trying to talk the boy . into handing over his weapon. Around 20 to 30 middle school students witnessed the multiple shootings. A . seventh-grade student called Andrew Thompson told IBNlive: 'A kid . started getting mad and he pulled out a gun and shoots my friend, one of . my friends at least. 'And then he walked up to a teacher and says back up. The teacher started backing up and he pulled the trigger.'

Both students are now said to be in stable condition. It is believed the student stole the semi-automatic handgun from his parents' home. Sparks City Attorney Chet Adams released the boy’s name after the Reno Gazette-Journal announced its plans to file a lawsuit. Multiple . students at the school had already told the the Reno Review-Journal . that Reyes was the shooter, but the newspaper refused to report the name . lacking official confirmation. However, . authorities were fighting a losing battle as the young shooters . identity was already widely known amongst Sparks' 90,000 residents and . was being circulated widely on social media. City . officials later acknowledged a report from the Univision affiliate in . Reno that disclosed the name and said they would release it publicly to . be fair to families and other media outlets.

Brothel madam: Jenine Jones was caught red-handed when police officers found her cowering on the roof in her dressing gown . Her wealthy home counties clients might have expected their horse riding instructor to take a second job for extra income. But Jenine Jones’s choice of alternative business is probably not what they had in mind. The 41-year-old was found guilty of helping to run a seedy brothel above a motorbike shop. To supplement her equestrian earnings, she worked as a madam in the evenings, a court heard, taking phone calls from punters and gathering takings of up to £400 a day from Eastern European prostitutes using the premises. The brothel is 60 miles away from her home in the pretty Hertfordshire village of Sarratt, where she owns a two-bedroom semi-detached house worth £400,000. Jones was caught red-handed when police officers raided the building and found her cowering on the roof in her dressing gown. She told them: ‘Thank God it’s you, I thought we were being robbed.’ Reading Crown Court heard that Jones, who is a woman of previous good character, helped run the brothel in Newbury, Berkshire, with owner Meinir Kirlew, 51. The illicit business attracted up to 20 clients a day after advertisements were placed in the local papers promising ‘relaxing and unhurried massages’. Prostitutes from other countries including Latvia and the Czech Republic paid £20 per client to Kirlew for use of the premises. Jones updated the owner by text message, telling her how many clients there had been and where she had hidden the day’s takings. One read: ‘Had 19, just off, see you next week.’ Another said: ‘Had a complaint about Anna today about poor service.’ A reply from Kirlew to Jones read: ‘Ok hun, did you leave the money and where?’ The response: ‘Yes bottom of sink bin.’ On the day of the police raid, November 9 last year, officers found two prostitutes and one client surrounded by pornographic material, oils, towels and baby wipes. Brothel: A number of Eastern European prostitutes were found to be working above a shop in Newbury . Prosecutor Rebecca Austin told the . court: ‘In the lounge of the flat was a woman. She stated she was . working as a prostitute one day a week. ‘She . earned an average £200 a day. In her make-up bag was a bundle of cash. She explained that the money was her takings from the clients.’ ‘Officers . went upstairs. In one bedroom was a man and a female. Both were in a . state of undress. The woman said she was a prostitute and renting a . room.’ Jones, who had . panicked and climbed on to the roof, surrendered herself to the officers . but claimed she was just a weekly cleaner. Property: The brothel is 60 miles away from her home in the pretty Hertfordshire village of Sarratt, where she owns a two-bedroom semi-detached house worth £400,000 . A total of £680 in cash was seized from the brothel along with eight mobile phones. 'In one bedroom was a man and a female. Both were in a state of undress. The woman said she was a prostitute and renting a room' Rebecca Austin, prosecuting . Jones, . wearing a blue flowery dress, black tights, and dark heels as she stood . in the dock, was convicted of assisting in the management of a brothel. Summing up the case, Judge . Angela Morris said: ‘When you consider what was found at the house, . what was contained in the  interview and what was contained in her text . messages it might be this amounts to someone who was doing more than . menial tasks.’ Kirlew, from Cardiff, had already pleaded guilty to managing a brothel. Both women will be sentenced next month.","Jenine Jones, 41, was found by police on the roof of brothel in Newbury .

A county council’s highways chief applied for compensation from his own authority after his Jaguar XK convertible hit a pothole - and was refused, it emerged today, . Rodney Bass, 67, who lives in the village of Wickham Bishops near Witham, Essex, took over responsibility for highways in May - including tackling the county’s 13,705 potholes. The long-standing Essex County Council councillor has revealed he asked the authority for compensation three years ago when the exhaust clamp broke off his car on a road. Mr Bass, who was forced to pay £250 in repairs, said: ‘The car is fairly low slung and I hit an elevated part of a road in Little Totham caused by subsidence around a drain, which hit the bottom of the car. ‘I submitted a claim to Essex County Council, but it was rebutted. I can empathise with those who do damage their cars - it is very irritating, but it is something we have to live with. ‘These things happen and you have to grin and bear it. We have to have our eyes open all the time when we are driving.’ Mr Bass has since replaced the car, and emphasised that he does not interfere with the claims procedure as a cabinet member for highways. Car: Mr Bass applied for compensation from the council after his Jaguar XK (file photo) convertible hit a pothole . Rules state that if a road defect has been drawn to the council’s attention, is classed as severe and has not been repaired, a claim for compensation can be made for any damage caused. In Mr Bass’s case, the problem had not been reported to County Hall. He added: ‘The council’s claims record is very good, or very bad if you are a driver. 'I can empathise with those who do damage their cars - it is very irritating, but it is something we have to live with' Rodney Bass, Essex County Council cabinet member for highways . ‘Our ability to defend claims is very good, and this means we are actually inspecting and taking remedial action on severe potholes quickly. ‘If someone has damaged their vehicle they will know if we have inspected the defect and how serious it is by whether it has orange paint, which is a priority and should be dealt with within 28 days, or purple paint, which means it is less serious.’ Mr Bass, a Freemason and University of Newcastle graduate, is a retired bank executive and has been a member of Essex County Council since 1997. His interests are cricket, golf and classic cars. Jaguar XK convertibles cost between £71,000 and £103,000 new, although it was not clear how much Mr Bass - the Conservative councillor for Heybridge and Tollesbury - paid for his vehicle.","Rodney Bass's convertible car was damaged in Little Totham, Essex .

Householders face being forced to recycle more after the government admitted it is falling behind European targets. Despite years of efforts by families to meet the demands of fortnightly collections, nine-bin collections, kitchen slop buckets and other compulsory recycling schemes, recycling rates remain too low to comply with EU rules. Recycling figures flatlined last year, according to figures released by the Environment Department yesterday. Grinding to a halt: Recycling figures have flatlined in the last year meaning ministers are now under pressure to do more to compel householders to do more . They suggest the great recycling revolution - imposed on a majority of homes in the country when their traditional weekly rubbish collections were withdrawn - has reached its limits and families are unwilling to do more to help. The failure means ministers are now under pressure to do more to compel householders to put out more of their refuse in a way that can be easily recycled. Among methods that have been under consideration are compulsory systems involving a string of separate recycling bins for every home, or monthly bin collections which mean that rubbish not separated for recycling is collected by binmen only once every four weeks. The new figures from Owen Paterson’s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said that the amount of household waste recycled in the year to the end of March was 43.2 per cent, up just 0.2 per cent on the previous year’s level. A report from DEFRA said there was ‘much variation across local authorities’. It added: ‘The rate of increase in the last year is insufficient to meet the 50 per cent EU target by 2020. Not enough: Owen Paterson's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says recyling of household waste went up just 0.2 per cent . ‘The household recycling rate was increasing rapidly until recent years. The rapid rise occurred while local authorities were introducing and expanding their recycling collection schemes.’ According to the report, only just over one in five of the 352 local councils that collect household rubbish succeeded in reaching the 50 per cent recycling target. Among setbacks were a drop of 10 per cent in the amount of glass and cans collected from homes in recycling bins, and a drop of six per cent in the amount of paper and card separated from other rubbish. ‘This may be due to various factors including more use of co-mingled collections or change in consumer behaviour to minimise waste,’ the report said. It added that there was a low collection rate for green waste in the first three months of this year ‘resulting from the freezing temperature and bad weather conditions.’ An Environment Department spokesman said that ministers are determined to hit the EU recycling target. ‘We are working with local authorities and communities to meet our 50 per cent target by 2020,’ she said. ‘Local authorities can continue to collect mixed waste as long as the quality of recycling is high enough. It is up to local authorities to decide what works best in their local area within the law.’ Ministers have warned councils that to meet the terms of EU recycling law they must from 2015 do their best to collect household waste paper, plastic, metal and glass separately. The instructions raise the prospect of every house being given five bins or their rubbish, four for separate recycling materials and one for general waste. However Government regulations on how councils will be expected to put the rules into effect have yet to be published. More than half the homes in the country have fortnightly collections, kitchen slopbuckets or other compulsory recycling systems. However material that is set out for recycling is often too impure to be recycled, and is incinerated, landfilled or sent abroad for recycling in Third World countries. Doretta Cocks of the Campaign for Weekly Waste Collections said she feared ministers may now revive the ‘pay-as-you-throw’ idea, which would mean families would have to pay to get their rubbish collected. Gordon Brown’s government adopted the idea but dropped it when it proved unpopular. Mrs Cocks said: ‘I am not at all surprised at the new figures. They have reached the recycling limit. ‘They are not getting the quality of recyclate they need. Sometimes councils are not entirely honest about the amount of material that goes for recycling. ‘The worry is that they will bring out the stick to persuade people to recycle. I am worried they will revive pay-as-you-throw.’","Recycling figures flatlined last year, according to figures released by the Environment Department yesterday .

The mother of a young Seattle woman who was murdered by her husband has described herself as a 'pit bull' in her six year campaign for justice after police refused to believe he was responsible. In an episode of CBS's 48 Hours, titled 'Relentless,' Gael Schneider describes her heartbreak at learning her daughter, Nicole Pietz, 32, had been murdered in 2006 and the psychological warfare she waged against her daughter's husband David Pietz to expose the truth. 'I wasn't going to let her become another case in their files,' she says in the show due to air on Saturday November 2. 'I hate to think of myself as a pit bull, but I was.' Scroll down for video . Finding the truth: Gael Schneider, pictured, describes her heartbreak at learning her daughter, Nicole Pietz, 32, had been murdered in 2006 and the psychological warfare she waged against her daughter's husband David Pietz to expose the truth . Pietz, now-36, reported his wife missing, and broke the news in a phone call to Schneider and her husband, Nicole's stepfather, Rod Schneider, who lived in Arizona. Both Pietz and Schneider went on TV pleading for information but, nine days later, Nicole's nude body was discovered in a wooded field near Seattle airport. 'She was my youngest daughter, and the absolute light of my life,' Schneider told 48 Hours. 'My beautiful daughter. My sweet girl. How anyone could hurt her is just – it's not feasible to me.' Pietz told police that Nicole's had been addicted to prescribed painkillers after suffering medical issues but had kicked the habit. However, he said he suspected she'd been abusing medication again after being treated for a recent back injury. Schneider knew her daughter's husband had more information he wasn't sharing but with few clues, the case went cold. Killed: Nicole Pietz, 32, was found dead in February 2006. She is pictured with her husband, David Pietz . Emotional scene: Martin 'David' Pietz, right, is taken from court Monday in Seattle after a jury found him guilty of murdering his wife, as her sister, Tonia Zurcher, left, yells, 'You're going to hell, Pietz' However, the desperate mother never let go. She always suspected Pietz was responsible for Nicole's murder and she vowed to uncover the truth. She confronted Pietz at work, calling him a murderer in front of his colleagues, which prompted a restraining order. Schneider left messages at his home and, she told 48 Hours, even left a blonde wig with fake blood on his doorstep. She also urged investigators to reopen the case and, more than six years after Nicole was found dead, fresh detectives pieced together enough evidence to arrest David Pietz for her murder. Earlier this month, a Washington state jury convicted him of second-degree murder in the death of his 32-year-old wife. Prosecutors said Pietz tried to cover up his wife's death by reporting her missing a week before her naked body was discovered. Devastated: 'She was my youngest daughter, and the absolute light of my life,' Schneider told 48 Hours of Nicole, pictured left and right with her mom . Nicole's family wept openly in the courtroom when the guilty verdict was announced following a day and a half of deliberations. Pietz was arrested in March by cold case detectives who had spent six years building a case against him based largely on circumstantial evidence. January 28, 2006: Nicole Pietz, 32, reported missing by her husbandFebruary 6, 2006: Her naked body found in the woods near Burien, WashingtonFebruary 12, 2006: Memorial service held for Nicole PietzMarch 2012: David Pietz arrested and charged with second-degree murderSeptember 12, 2013: Murder trial begins in SeattleOctober 8, 2013: Defense and prosecution rest their casesOctober 14, 2013: Jury reaches guilty verdict . Prosecutor Kristen Richardson later told the press that in the end, the case hinged on minor clues, including Pietz's alleged affairs with at least four different women and his wife's mouthguard, which she was wearing when her naked body was found in a wooded area near Burien, The Seattle Times reported. During closing arguments, Richardson told the 12 members of the jury panel that Pietz had grown tired of being married to Nicole because of her reluctance to pursue a more adventurous sex life, and was 'cold and callous.’ In the course of the trial, four women testified they had sexual relations with Pietz while he was married to Nicole. One of the husband's alleged lovers told the court in September that the 36-year-old defendant regularly spiked his wife's drinks with ecstasy to get her to take part in threesomes. Pietz's defense lawyer said the man was wrongly accused and that prosecutors failed to establish a motive or come up with hard evidence such as DNA or witnesses to the crime. 'Dave Pietz isn't the first guy to step out on his spouse,' attorney David Allen told jurors. 'Is it a motive to kill his wife? He had bad boundaries; he's oversexed.' The defense built its case on Nicole . Pietz's history of addiction to painkillers and claimed that the . 32-year-old woman suffered a relapse after eight years of sobriety and . disappeared while out looking to score drugs. However, . toxicology reports showed only trace amounts of prescription pills in . Nicole's system and no signs of recent drug abuse. Pietz showed little emotion beyond beads of perspiration glistening on his brow when . the guilty verdict was announced. Scene: Her body was found in a wooded area in 2006. Police said evidence suggested she had been killed at night - not in the day as Pietz suggested - as she still had her night mouth guard in . Cover? in 2006, Pietz had appeared on television beside Schneider pleading for information in the case . Emotions . ran high in the King County courtrhouse, where the victim's relatives . and friends sobbed with relief in reaction to the verdict. Nicole . Pietz's sister Tonia Zurcher yelled out, 'You're going to burn in hell, . Pietz,' as he was led out of the courtroom following his conviction. 'I . just wanted justice for my daughter and we got it,' Gael Schneider, said at the hearing. 'These last 7 1/2 years have been torture for . us.' Schneider then added, 'She'll never come back, we got justice for her, but I'll never get to hold her again,' the station KING5 reported. For years, there were no charges . brought in connection with the murder - until police arrested Pietz . last year and charged him with second-degree murder thanks to advances in . technology. Detectives were initially interested in Pietz as a suspect after learning that he was unhappy in his marriage and now they say they have built a case on circumstantial evidence. Pietz, who had been married to his wife for four years, was finally arrested in March 2012 after DNA and phone GPS linked him to the crime scene, police said. Loss: Investigators believe the couple was having marital problems and that Mr Pietz had cheated on his wife . Emotional: Earlier this week, Gael Schneider, Nicole Pietz's mother, unleashed an emotional rant when she came face-to-face with the accused killer in court . Investigators claimed there were . contradictions in his statements and he failed a lie detector test . before refusing to undergo a second. Pietz told police that on January 27, 2006, he got home from work around . midnight and briefly said goodnight to his wife, who was already . sleeping, KOMO reported after his arrest. The next morning he said he left for work at 8.30 a.m. without speaking to Nicole and had no contact with her throughout the day. Pietz told police that he called 911 when he went straight to a planned . dinner with friends that night and his wife never arrived. He claims she must have vanished as she headed to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting that morning where she was going to celebrate eight years of sobriety. He claimed he believed she had fallen back into her old drug habit. However, police said that forensic . tests - including undigested food in her stomach - showed that Nicole . had been killed around midnight on January 27. When . her body was found, she was wearing a mouthguard she only wore at . night and her wedding ring was in cleaning solution in the bathroom; . friends said she only took it off at night to clean it. Phone records also show her phone was allegedly used at her husband's workplace. And . DNA evidence showed that Pietz's was the last person to drive her . car, which was found two weeks after her body in a parking lot near the .

A Texas woman faces up to 99 years in prison after she was found guilty of murdering a decorated university athlete outside a nightclub with a single stab to the heart. Kaitlyn Ritcherson, 21, fatally stabbed 21-year-old Fatima Barrie after a brawl spilled out of the Republic Live bar and into the street in Austin's famous party district in December 2011. She had claimed Ms Barrie, a junior biology major and highly decorated track star at Huston-Tillotson University, attacked her with a mobile phone or a shoe before she lashed out in self defence. Guilty: Kaitlyn Ritcherson (left), 21, fatally stabbed 21-year-old Fatima Barrie (right) in a brawl in December 2011. Miss Barrie was a junior biology major and highly decorated track star at Huston-Tillotson University . The pair, who didn't know each other, had both been watching a concert in the club with friends when a fight broke out between the two groups. Ritcherson then pulled out the pocket knife, which she claimed she was only carrying to groom her hair extensions, and thrust it at Barrie, piercing her heart. Barrie died later in hospital. In tense moments after the verdict was read out, Ritcherson, who turned . 21 last week, sobbed loudly, yelling, 'Why?' and 'No, no,' as her . lawyers and family members embraced and attempted to console her. Outside the courtroom, Barrie’s brother, Rodrick Watson, told reporters . he believed justice was served. The scene: The pair, who didn't know each other, had both been watching a concert in the Republic Live bar with friends in Austin, Texas, when a fight broke out between the two groups . Her conviction marks the end of a lengthy process that saw an initial trial thrown out after the jury reached deadlock by 11-1. But this time the verdict was unanimous leaving Ritcherson to face a jail term of between five and 99 years. Friends of both women offered varying testimony on what prompted the argument and who was responsible. Ritcherson's attorney, Charlie Baird, said Barrie hit Ritcherson in the head and Ritcherson reacted in self defense. 'She was struck in the head with a cell phone, a shoe or a fist, it doesn't matter which, she has the right to be free from violence inflicted upon her by Fatima Barrie,' defence lawyer Charlie Baird told jurors. 'The only time Kaitlyn Ritcherson has a knife and stabs anybody is the third time she has been attacked or rushed or lunged at by Fatima Barrie.' But the defense argued that Ritcherson never told any officials that she had been attacked . 'You got to see her talking to the police and she never said I acted in self defense. Never gave any suggestion of it. Not only did she never say to the police I acted in self defense, she never suggested she needed to,"" said Travis County Attorney Gary Cobb. During her closing, Travis County Attorney Meg McGee became emotional when quoting Barrie's mother. 'She had run her last race and I'm gonna miss her very much,' said McGee. 'That's what you heard from Pat Davis. 'She sat with that beautiful scholarship daughter of hers for 17 days, waiting for her to die because of what the defendant did to her""Fatima Barrie was everything that Kaitlyn Ritcherson is not,' she exclaimed.'

Worry: Tory MP Ben Wallace said intelligence and security agencies were covered by laws in place to protect citizens against unwarranted intrusion . Google, Facebook and other private companies pose a greater risk to data privacy than State snooping, Parliament was told yesterday. Internet giants are ‘harvesting’ personal data and making billions of pounds a year, but are not properly regulated, an MP said. Former military intelligence officer Ben Wallace - now a Tory MP - said security and intelligence agencies were covered by strict laws in place to protect citizens against unwarranted intrusion. By contrast, lax protections against private snooping allowed mass collection of internet activities by private firms. Mr Wallace, a former platoon commander and military intelligence officer in Northern Ireland, said such companies needed tougher regulation because of the greater risk they posed to personal data. His comments came as MPs debated the actions of former US National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden who stole vast numbers of top secret files and leaked them to newspapers. Many of his revelations were published by the Guardian newspaper which has faced accusations it undermined national security. The leaking of the documents was criticised by the head of MI5 for handing a ‘gift’ to terrorists. Revelations: His comments came as MPs debated the actions of former US National Security Agency employee Edward Snowden (pictured) who stole vast numbers of top secret files and leaked them to newspapers . The debate was brought by Liberal Democrat, Tory and Labour MPs who warned about the scale of State surveillance exposed by Snowden’s revelations. Julian Huppert said the country was sleepwalking into a surveillance state and called for new scrutiny of security agencies such as GCHQ. But Mr Wallace told MPs the real threat to privacy was from private companies. He said: ‘Privately, without being a member of the security service or a government, I can find out where every one of you in this room shops, I can find out where you live, I can find out where you bought your car, I can find out your credit rating, I can probably get hold of everybody’s details without very much effort. ‘But what I find interesting is I’ve not yet heard one criticism or fear or demand that we regulate the private sector. ‘The big capitalist companies in America - the Googles, the Facebooks - harvest our data without your leave, sell it on to intermediaries on and on and on. ‘They make millions, billions of pounds, avoid tax - I haven’t yet heard anyone saying how they all keep their servers offshore to avoid tax - and that’s the area that needs regulating and protection.’ ‘I’m proud that our security services are regulated. I’d rather have the state than the private sector all over the world grooming through my internet capabilities...’ Claim: Google, Facebook (file picture) and other private companies pose a greater risk to data privacy than State snooping, Parliament was told . Google has faced repeated questions about its privacy protections and data-gathering activities. It has faced accusations it is creating a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users. Its Street View cars took pictures of . every street in Britain and at the same time collected vast swathes of . personal data from open wi-fi networks in people’s homes and offices.

The company has claimed that the collection was a ‘mistake’ but an investigation by US regulators found that a company software engineer explicitly designed the Street View programmes to collect the data and warned his bosses repeatedly about privacy implications. Mr Wallace said The Guardian was yet to produce evidence that British spies are breaking the law. He pointed to legal controls on data collection by the State contained within the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 - which is known as Ripa. He said his former intelligence colleagues ‘hated’ Ripa because it forced them to register how they used their powers and provided essential oversight and accountability. Cambridge MP Mr Huppert said the ‘mass hovering up of information using new technology’ was, he said ‘chipping away at our own liberty and our own privacy’.","Lax protection against private snooping, Tory MP Ben Wallace says .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:49 EST, 31 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:27 EST, 31 October 2013 . Virginia's highest court threw out a wrongful death verdict today over the 2007 university massacre that killed 32 people. The case . had been brought by the families of two students - Erin Nicole Peterson and Julia Kathleen Pryde - who argued that the women might have survived if Virginia Tech administrators had alerted students earlier about the gunman. The Supreme Court concluded however, that the university did not have a duty to warn students after the bodies of two students were found in a dormitory. Victims: Erin Peterson, left, and Julia Pryde were among those killed in the mass shooting at Virginia Tech . The justices agreed with the state, saying there was no way to anticipate student Seung-Hui Cho's deadly intentions. 'Thus, as a matter of law, the . commonwealth did not have a duty to protect students against third party . criminal acts,' the court wrote. Jurors in Montgomery County ruled in . March last year that the state was negligent in the deaths of Miss Peterson, 18, and Miss Pryde, 23, who were . killed in the deadliest mass shooting in . modern U.S. history. Jurors had awarded the families of both . students $4 million each, but a judge reduced the award to the state cap . of $100,000 for each family. Campus safety advocates have said the decision will not shake the heightened diligence at American universities, saying improved security is the 'living legacy' of the victims. 'The April 16, 2007, tragedy forever changed campus safety,' said S. Daniel Carter, director of 32 National Campus Safety Initiative, named for the number of Virgina Tech victims. Lone gunman: The Supreme Court ruled the university had no way of knowing Seung-Hui Cho's deadly intentions . Devastation: The mass shooting at Virginia Tech killed 32 people in 2007 . 'This court ruling does nothing to diminish that,' he said. Since the killings, campuses have instituted warning systems that use cell phone alerts and sirens. 'We draw strength knowing that the 32 innocent lives tragically lost were not in vain,' the VTV Family Outreach Foundation, a nonprofit established by the families of victims and survivors, said in a statement. 'Institutions, including Virginia Tech, now often have mass notifications out to their entire campus within minutes rather than hours after any serious incident occurs.' In Thursday's decision, the justices reversed a jury's findings and issued a final ruling, meaning there is no avenue for appeal. In response, the state attorney general's office said in a statement that the court 'found what we have said all along to be true'. Spokesman Brian Gottstein wrote in an email: 'The commonwealth and its officials at Virginia Tech were not negligent on April 16, 2007. Cho was the lone person responsible for this tragedy.' The case was the lone pending legal action from the massacre, Mr Gottstein said. At the trial in the case last year jurors found that the state should have issued more timely campus warnings after the dormitory shooting. The trial focused on the time between the first shootings, shortly after 7am, and the killings at Norris Hall, shortly before 10am. A campus-wide email at 9:50am warned of a gunman and advised students to remain inside. By then, Cho had chained the Norris Hall doors and continued with his massacre. The state argued that law enforcement officials believed the first shootings were the result of a domestic dispute, and had concluded the larger campus wasn't at risk. Reflection: Virginia Tech staff and a student pause at a memorial for the victims. Universities have brought in warning systems since the attack . The justices concluded that university officials acted properly. The Petersons and Prydes are the only families of Virginia Tech victims who did not join an $11 million settlement. Their attorneys have shielded the families from the media, but they have said they were intent on holding university officials accountable for their actions on April 16, 2007. The state was the only defendant at trial. In a statement, Virginia Tech president Charles Steger, extended his gratitude to state attorneys who argued the appeal. A university statement said the ruling 'can never reverse the loss of lives nor the pain experienced by so many families and friends of victims of one person'. Andrew Goddard, whose son Colin was wounded in the attack, said he found the ruling upsetting. 'I think it certainly takes the pressure off universities,' he wrote in an email to The Associated Press. 'I would hope that all future freshman orientations clearly spell out that, despite all the policy changes and advanced notification systems, the university actually has no ""duty"" to use them. Let's see how parents react to that.'","Court rules university did not have duty to issue warning after finding first victims .

Sharks have roamed the world's seas for more than 420 million years and now scientists think they know one of the secrets of their longevity. Experts believe they have solved the riddle of why sharks survived the mass extinction that began 252 million years ago, wiping out around 80 per of all life on Earth. Fossil evidence has hinted that the fish survived the global catastrophe, known as the 'great dying' by diving deeper. Experts believe they have solved the riddle of why sharks survived the mass extinction that began 252 million years ago, wiping out around 80 per of all life on Earth. Early species of sharks were smaller and had unique teeth. Pictured, is an illustration of falcatid shark,which is one of the cladodontomorph shark species . A paleontological dig site in the South of France, containing sediment from a younger Cretaceous ocean floor, has now revealed the teeth of a small shark ancestor, indicating that the fish swam into deeper oceans to seek refuge. One of the tiny T-shaped teeth typical of cladodontomorph sharks is less than a millimetre long and was discovered in 135 million-year-old rocks. Experts have hypothesised that the sharks fled the acidic coastal waters of the end-Permian period to move to deeper oceans and lived there for a hundred million years. The research, which was published in Nature Communications, is based on new evidence examining the anatomical study of the microscopic structure of animal tissues and morphological evidence - the structure of organisms. One of the tiny T-shaped teeth typical of cladodont sharks was less than a millimetre long and discovered in 135 million-year-old rocks . Guillaume Guinot, a researcher at the Natural History Museum in Geneva, Switzerland, told NBC News: ‘It changes our view of how dramatic this extinction event was. 'The find suggests that there may be many more fishes living in deep ocean sediment deposits that haven’t been found yet (and that may indicate that the) extinction wasn’t that dramatic for cartilaginous fishes (such as sharks).’ The study reveals that the recorded gap in the cladodontomorph shark lineage represents the longest gap in the fossil record for an extinct marine vertebrate group. The report says: 'This discovery demonstrates that the deep-sea marine diversity, poorly . known during most of the fish evolutionary history, contains essential . data for a complete understanding of the long-term evolution of marine . fish paleobiodiversity. The three species of cladodontomorph were relatives of modern sharks, rays and skates. The new findings suggest that modern sharks might have survived the great dying in a similar way - by moving to deeper areas in the ocean. However, Dr Guinot said there is no fossil evidence to prove that modern sharks swam to deeper waters.","A site in the South .

Zander, who cannot speak, was suffering seizures daily before his parents started giving him cannabis oil. Genetic defect: Zander Welton, 5, was born with cortical dysplasia, a condition that disrupts cellular patterns in the brain and is often the cause of epilepsy . Deadly: The defect causes Zander to have daily seizures of up to 10 minutes that are so severe he turns blue and stops breathing .

Although Arizona allows marijuana to be used for medicinal purposes, some state officials, including the attorney for Maricopa County and the head of the Arizona Department of Health Services, have said that products with resin extracted from marijuana, such as the oil originally used to treat Zander, are actually classified as an illegal narcotic according to the state's criminal code. Welton said she did not want to do anything that could be construed as being illegal and stopped giving Zander the CBD. Zander is now currently taking medicinal marijuana in dried plant form, but Welton said it wasn't ideal and hard to effectively administer to Zander. She tries to hide it in his porridge and other meals but it does not always work. ‘He does sometimes find it and then will spit out a piece,’ said Welton. ‘With the oil extract, it's like the other mediations.

A husband and wife who worked as NHS managers were paid nearly £1million in redundancy money – only to be rehired by the health service within weeks. Karen Straughair, 50, pocketed more than £605,000 when NHS South of Tyne and Wear, where she was chief executive, was wound up at the end of March. Her husband Chris Reed, chief executive of NHS North of Tyne, was paid more than £345,000 when his organisation was abolished. By June both had board-level jobs at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust – Mr Reed as interim chief executive, Miss Straughair as recovery director. Golden goodbye: Karen Straughair pocketed £605,000 and Chris Reed was given £345,000 redundancy . Shadow health minister Andy Burnham called it a ‘scandalous abuse of precious resources’, while Dan Poulter the Tory health minister blamed lax redundancy rules under Labour that allowed mega payoffs for public employees. The pair are among dozens of senior staff who received ‘golden goodbyes’ of more than £100,000; many of which later found new jobs in the ‘revolving door’ of the NHS. The bosses lost their jobs when the NHS organisations employing them were abolished.They were among 161 NHS bodies responsible for buying services – among them Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities – that were abolished to be replaced by GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups under reforms in April. Analysis of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Authorities’ final accounts, published yesterday, suggests payouts in excess of £100,000 were made to more than 50 staff and more than a dozen of these well-paid chiefs have since found work in the public sector. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham called the situation a ¿scandalous abuse of precious resources¿ . Critics have said payouts should be capped and recouped when staff are reemployed soon after being let go. On an online forum for an NHS trade publication, one critic posted: ‘Surely a relevant question is how come two former Chief Executives, effectively Mr and Mrs NHS Tyne and Wear can pocket hundreds of thousands in redundancy payments and then get relatively swiftly re-employed by the NHS on mega high salaries.’ Another wrote: ‘Just a minor point of Governance … does the Interim Chief Exec hold his wife to account if she fails to deliver her objectives? Isn’t that a bit too cosy when the organisation in question is facing such a huge challenge?’ The National Audit Office estimated in the summer that 10,000 people had lost their jobs at a total cost of £430million. At the time, the NAO said that 44 very senior managers were made redundant at an average cost of £277,273. Labour accused the Government of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds by replacing the statutory bodies with 211 new Clinical Commissioning Groups. But the Government blamed lax contracts drawn up under Labour, saying their ‘hands were tied’. Mr Burnham said last night: ‘This  is precisely what we warned  would happen.’ He told The Times: ‘David  Cameron’s refusal to listen and honour his promise of no top-down re-organisation has resulted in  a scandalous abuse of precious NHS resources. ‘He has given gold-plated, six-figure payoffs to thousands of managers while handing P45s to 6,000 nurses.’ Conservative Mr Poulter said: ‘Dismantling Labour’s bloated bureaucracy left us with a big bill, but that’s because manager  numbers and wages rose so quickly on Labour's watch, and their ridiculously lax redundancy rules tied our hands.’ He added: ‘We have overhauled their system to make sure this can never happen again.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be appalled that some of these golden goodbyes ran to six figures – especially for those individuals who have walked straight through the revolving door into another highly paid public sector job.’ The salary arrangements and terms of employment of Mrs Straughair and Mr Reed in the Leeds posts are not known, and both have recently left the trust. Sir David Nicholson wrote to the leaders of abolished bodies in March urging them not to take large payoffs and quickly seek new jobs in the NHS, which they are entitled to do after four weeks. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the individuals receiving payoffs but campaigners have criticised the size of the sums dished out when care services are under pressure.","Karen Straughair, 50, handed £605,000 when her trust was wound up .

To commemorate the first twin giant panda cubs to be born in the United States and survive, a time-lapse video has been released showing their first 100 days in three minutes. The adorable video featuring Mei Lun and Mei Huan, baby giant pandas born at Zoo Atlanta in July, has already been viewed almost 200,000 times. Over the course of 100 days, the baby boys develop from blind, pink, toothless creatures measuring about six to seven inches long and to robust, curious cubs with thick black and white fur. Scroll down for video . Tiny twins: The baby giant pandas must be kept warm when they are newborns as they cannot regulate their own body temperature . Helpless: At eight days old, the cubs are deaf and haven't yet opened their eyes . Developing: At 11 days old, the cubs have developed gray-ish markings where they will eventually have black fur . Mother's love: The cubs alternated time with their mother, spending three hours each with Lun Lun . Born July 15, the cubs' names were revealed, following . Chinese tradition, on the 100th day of their lives in a 100 Day Naming . Celebration on October 23. The names, Mei Lun and Mei Huan, come from ancient Chinese idioms meaning 'something indescribably beautiful and magnificent.' Zoo Atlanta documented their development by filming them with their 'PandaCam' 24 hours a day. Giant panda cubs are about 900 times smaller than their mothers when they are born looking after them is extremely time-consuming for the mother. The cubs appear to spend much of their time sleeping, but as they develop their eyes are open more and they begin moving around their enclosure. Cubs generally begin crawling at about 75 to 80 days old. Almost one month: The pandas have very soft, sparse fur when they are babies but will eventually grow thick, coarse fur . Miniature giants: By day 36 the pandas are beginning to look like tiny versions of the adults they will be . First sight: Both cubs opened their eyes and began using their back legs to scoot themselves around their enclosure at about this time . According to zookeeper Jennifer A, the cubs are now trying to stand. 'Both cubs are getting really good at standing... Their movements are still pretty clumsy, and sometimes when they try to walk they appear to be making frog-like or inchworm-like movements all around the nest box,' she wrote on the Zoo Atlanta panda blog. Zoo Atlanta staff told YouTube viewers that, typically, the twins would not have survived in the wild. In the comments section of the video, Zoo Atlanta said that in the wild, giant panda mothers only care for one cub when twins are born. It's believed the mother panda cannot store enough milk to feed more than one cub as she does not store fat. Growing fast: At this stage, the cubs weighed almost 7lb each . Teething: At about this age, the cubs' teeth began to come through and they became much more active . Milestone: The twins at their 100 Day Naming Celebration on October 23 . To get around this problem, Zoo Atlanta staff alternated the cubs with their mother for the first few months. This means their mother, Lun Lun, can give equal care to both cubs. 'This technique was first developed by our colleagues at the Chengdu Zoo. They used it for the first time in 1990 and as a result had the first pair of twins born in captivity to survive,' writes Jennifer A. Zoo staff will give both cubs to Lun Lun when they are able to walk, at which point she will not need much help from the staff to look after her twin sons.","The first twin giant panda cubs to survive in the U.S. have had their lives commemorated in a time-lapse video .

Since ancient times, people have dreamed of becoming invisible and many fans of Harry Potter have anticipated the day when they might be able to own a cloak that makes them disappear instantly. But they might be in for a long wait as scientists have admitted that most invisibility cloaks currently being developed actually make objects more visible. While researchers have worked out how to bend light around objects to make them temporarily invisible, there are major limitations to current technology. Scientists have admitted that most invisibility cloaks currently being developed actually make objects more visible, rather than hiding them. Pictured is perhaps the ultimate invisibility cloak - as imagined in the Harry Potter film, The Philosopher's Stone . Light humans see bounces off an object before it reaches our eyes. Scientists are controlling the path of the light to make objects invisible, using cleverly-shaped pieces of glass and other materials, which are loosely described as invisibility cloaks. Researchers have managed to make the light bypass objects they want to hide behind their cloaks, but still enable the light to reach a human's eyes. When light goes through a cloaking device it disperses sideways and follows a certain path to reach the same point as if it didn't encounter any objects. This means an object inside the cloak seems to have disappeared. Current cloaking devices are made out of a variety of materials - including planes of glass - and few of them look like the flexible cloaks worn by Harry Potter or the massive 'cloaking device' used in Star Trek. Scientists are working on bending light waves around objects with the help of various specially-shaped materials, returning the waves to their original trajectories as if there was no object there to block them, Live Science reported. They have also found ways to deflect and reposition other kinds of waves, such as sounds waves used in sonar equipment. While these scientific advances are impressive and will no doubt lead to more breakthroughs, scientists at the University of Texas at Austin, said current invisibility cloaks have numerous drawbacks. Perhaps the biggest problem to overcome is that the cloaks are usually limited to working against narrow ranges of wavelengths and types of waves, so a cloak designed to deflect microwaves would not deflect visible light. To try and overcome this problem, the researchers looked at how current invisibility devices scatter light waves. Researchers from the Zhejiang University, China and Nanyang Technological University in Singapore have explained how they use light refraction to render objects invisible using their 'cloak', which is actually a cleverly-designed hexagonal array of panels of glass . Although cloaks can make objects appear invisible within certain wavelengths, the scientists calculated that the techniques used for devices at the moment actually scatter more light than uncloaked objects. Current invisibility cloaks essentially make objects more visible - not less, they said. Andrea Alu, an electrical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin and Francesco Monticone said that by making an object invisible to red light, it can make it bright blue, increasing its visibility over all. Assuming one looked at all wavelengths of . light, one would actually see the cloaked object 'more than the . uncloaked object it is trying to hide,' they wrote in their study, published in the journal Physical Review X. Most invisibility cloaks being developed at the moment are made from metamaterials, which can be artificial structures with special light scattering properties. A lot of cloaks are made from static materials to warp light, but in the future, they could be fashioned from dynamic components such as a network of electronic amplifiers that connect metal patches, to create an active and changeable surface. The use of such technology could make cloaks invisible over a broader range of wavelengths and lighting conditions.","U.S. scientists admitted there are major limitations to current technology used in invisibility cloaks, which are often made of rigid materials .

The title included platform and action puzzle types, featuring Donkey Kong as the opponent against Mario in an industrial construction setting . The Legend of Zelda was a bestseller for Nintendo, selling over 6.5 million copies. It's often featured in lists of games considered the greatest or most influential and is thought to be a spiritual forerunner of the role-playing video game .

But with a swift dart to its left, the pup managed to outsmart the giant orca, swimming away to safety and leaving the whale hungry. Narrow escape: This lucky seal (circled) manages to escape the terrifying killer whale attack . The shots were taken in Patagonia, Argentina, by wildlife photographer Pablo Cersosimo, 44. Mr Cersosimo, who returns to the same peninsula every year to shoot whales’ hunting season, said that a group of wildlife photographers had named the nine-year-old whale Mica, and it just wasn’t her day. 'Watching the most intelligent predator from the sea going full speed out of the water when they hunt is very special. It doesn't matter how many times I’ve seen it or photographed it, the scenario is always different -- there's a lot of adrenaline in the air. 'Sometimes I feel sorry about the sea lion pups because from the very first moments of their lives they face a lot of challenging situations in order to survive -- they are really tough animals.' Hunting: Mica the killer whale closes in on the tiny sea lion pup . Escape: The sea lion wriggles to the side of the killer whale and makes a break for it .

Mr Cersosimo (pictured) said he felt privileged to witness such an important natural occurrence . Mr Cersosimo said he felt privileged to witness such an important natural occurrence. 'This is a spectacular natural event that only happens in this part of the world, as these orcas have developed a very difficult and dangerous hunting method.' He continued, 'There's a lot of strategy in their action, and some of this orcas work together to capture the sea lions from the shoreline. 'When an orca captures a sea lion, they take it 50 meters offshore, release it and they start playing with it by hitting it with their tales and biting it. The pup tries to escape by reaching the beach the orcas let them arrive very close, sometimes two meters away but then they capture it again. This behavior seems to be cruel, but orcas teach the youngest how to chase and hunt and its the way it has to be in nature. But the hardy sea lion didn't seem too perturbed by its near-death experience and was soon back in the waves again. Mr Cersosimo added: 'Every year I have different chances of shooting these events, but it’s not easy and many times you don't get what you want despite waiting for 10 hours, every day for two months. But on the other hand, it always worth it just to witness such an amazing place.' Phew! The sea lion heads back into the water to swim another day .","Wildlife photographer Pablo Cersosimo captured the shots in Argentina .

"By . Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 19:00 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:00 EST, 28 October 2013 . Justice minister Damian Green has announced new rules forcing criminals to listen to statements read out by their victims in court . Murderers, rapists and other criminals will be forced to sit in court and listen to victims and their families describe the misery and heartache caused by their crimes. Victims will be given the right to read out a statement in court after conviction - and confront directly the criminals who damaged their lives. Justice minister Damian Green said it would mean both offenders and judges were ‘left in no doubt’ about the full suffering of those hurt by criminality. If the victims choose to, they will read their statement out before sentencing, allowing the judge to take into account what they have said before setting a jail term or other sentence. Currently, Victim Personal Statements are often handed over to the judge on paper, with extracts sometimes read to the court. Nearly one in ten victims say they don’t remember even being offered the opportunity to write a statement. But as part of a new Victims’ Code, to be published today, they will be given a guarantee that their side can be heard before sentencing begins. If they do not want to read it out themselves the prosecutor can do it for them. Mr Green said: ‘For too long victims have felt they are treated as an afterthought in the criminal justice system. No more. I am determined that victims are given back their voice and are fully supported. He added: ‘I want to create a tougher justice system. Under this government those who break the law are more likely to go to prison for longer. I’m making sure victims’ voices are heard and that criminals no longer get away with just a slap on the wrist.’ The new rules were welcomed by the family of Catherine Wells-Burr, a Bath Spa University graduate who was murdered by her Polish factory worker boyfriend in a plot with his secret lover and the lover’s uncle. Rafal Nowak, 31, Anna Lagwinowicz, 32, and her uncle Tadevsz Dmytryszyn, 38, were convicted at Bristol Crown Court in June of murdering the 23-year-old for a life insurance payout and a share of a house worth £137,000. Victim: The new rules were welcomed by the family of Catherine Wells-Burr, a Bath Spa University graduate, who was murdered by her Polish factory worker boyfriend . Miss Wells-Burr’s mother Jayne, 46 submitted a statement to the court which was read by the judge. She told the Mail: ‘I think every victim impact statement should be read out in court: it should be the right of the person whose life has been changed so badly.’ ‘As witnesses you only answer the questions the barristers ask you, you can’t tell them your personal story. ‘In the statement, you can express your feelings about the person that you lost and your life without them.’ Catherine’s father Philip, 48, said: ‘We heard all the rubbish that came out from them for nine weeks. ‘At the end of it all victims should have their own right to express their feelings - and look those who did it in the eye. Catherine’s sister Leanne, 22, added: ‘I think it’s important for statements to be read out. I wanted to have the last say to those defendants.’ Victims groups said the process of writing and reading out the statement can help victims cope and recover from the crime. Earlier this year Michelle Knight, one of the victims of Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro, confronted him in court after being freed from more than a decade of captivity . Javed Khan, chief executive of Victim Support, said the change would give victims ‘the choice to explain to a court in their own words the personal and emotional impacts a crime has had on them and their families.’ The new code, which will come in to force in December, will ensure extra support for victims of stalking, domestic abuse, terrorism and families bereaved by violent crime. It will explain what victims can expect from the criminal justice system from when they report a crime to the end of any trial, and make sure they are referred automatically to victims’ service by the police. Victims will also be given easier access to compensation if they are denied support by the system. And for the first time businessess - which are the victims of more than nine million crimes a year - will be given similar rights to individuals. The new rules on reading out statements are similar to those in force in parts of the US. Earlier this year one of the victims of Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro confronted him in court after being freed from more than a decade of captivity. Michelle Knight told Castro: ‘You took 11 years of my life away, and now I have it back.’","Justice minister Damien Green said new rules would give victims a voice .

Refugees fleeing war-torn Syria could resurrect the spectre of polio in Europe, experts have warned. Europe was declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation in 2002, but is now threatened by a new outbreak of the disease reported in Syria, it is claimed. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said the virus probably spread from Pakistan - one of three countries where polio is still endemic - and warned that Syria's outbreak posed a threat to millions of children across the Middle East. Immunisation: Displace Syrian children line up to receive vaccination against polio at one of the Syrian refugee camps in the southern port city of Sidon this week . Mapping the cases: The number of polio cases in 2013. Black: Endemic. Red: Confirmed cases. Blue: At risk and subject to WHO vaccination programme. Grey: At risk due to low vaccination coverage. Two German infection experts writing in The Lancet medical journal highlight the fact that the polio vaccine currently used throughout Europe is not 100 percent effective. In parts of Europe where vaccine coverage is low, including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine, and Austria, immunisation levels may not be high enough to prevent sustained transmission of the polio virus, they stress. With large numbers of people now fleeing Syria and seeking refuge in neighbouring countries and Europe, polio could reappear in areas that have been free of the disease for decades. Warning: The (WHO) said the virus probably spread from Pakistan and warned that Syria's outbreak posed a threat to millions of children across the Middle East . 'Vaccinating only Syrian refugees - as has been recommended by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control - must be judged as insufficient; more comprehensive measures should be taken into consideration,' said Professor Martin Eichner, from the University of Tubingen, and Dr Stefan Brockmann, from the Department of Infection Control in Reutlingen. The polio vaccine used in most European countries today is the inactivated polio vaccine (IPC), which is injected. It usually forms part of a combined diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and polio jab. While good at preventing paralysis, IPC provides only partial protection from infection, Prof Eichner and Dr Brockmann point out. Once children were routinely vaccinated with an oral polio vaccine (OPV), taken in the form of mouth drops, which uses a live virus and is more effective. But this was discontinued in the UK and many other countries because in rare cases it can trigger paralysis. UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake, right, discusses polio vaccines with a health worker during a UNICEF-supported vaccination campaign at the Abou Dhar Al Ghifari Primary Health Care Center in DamascuS . Since only one in 200 polio infections cause symptoms, the virus could be circulating for nearly a year before a single case of paralysis occurs, according to the experts. By this time, hundreds of individuals may be carrying the virus. Prof Eichner and Dr Brockmann wrote: 'Hundreds of thousands of people are fleeing Syria and seek refuge in neighbouring countries and Europe. Because only one in 200 unvaccinated individuals infection with WPV1 (wild-type polio virus 1) will develop acute flaccid paralysis, infected individuals can spread the virus unrecognised. 'Oral polio vaccination provides high protection against acquisition and spreading of the infection, but this vaccine was discontinued in Europe because of rare cases of vaccination-related acute flaccid paralysis. 'Only some of the European Union member states still allow its use and none has a stockpile of oral polio vaccines. Routine screening of sewage for polio virus has not been done in most European countries, but this intensified surveillance measure should be considered for settlements with large numbers of Syrian refugees.' Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at Britain's University of Reading, said: 'Where war goes, pestilence, famine and death often follow. Each new baby who is born is at risk of polio until vaccinated, and conflict inevitably disrupts local vaccination efforts. 'Poliovirus has been nearly eradicated for almost a decade now. Most of the last pockets of poliovirus in Somalia, Pakistan, Afghanistan and now Syria have been centres of conflict. It is likely that poliovirus will continue to linger, following conflict around the globe until it is eradicated once and for all. 'The Syrian outbreak puts Europe at risk because of the way we give vaccines. In parts of the world where it is still possible to catch a wild strain of poliovirus, children are usually vaccinated with a live but genetically weakened poliovirus which gives excellent protection but has a tiny risk of changing back to the more dangerous form. 'However, in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated, like the UK, children are usually given a killed vaccine. It doesn't protect quite as well but it cannot mutate, so it protects reasonably well while preventing polio from being accidentally reintroduced to a country. 'Vaccination is never perfect, so despite being vaccinated, a small percentage of children in the UK would be at risk of contracting polio if they were exposed to the virus. Until the virus is completely extinct, it is essential that we continue to vaccinate our children.' The WHO has confirmed an outbreak of at least 10 cases of polio in Syria, where vaccination coverage has dramatically decreased because of the civil war.","The WHO has confirmed an outbreak of at least 10 cases of polio in Syria .

The sinking of the Costa Concordia in January last year is one of the worst maritime disasters in living memory, with 32 passengers tragically losing their lives. Now new insight into the frantic moments before the cruise liner hit rocks just off the island of Giglio in Italy have been revealed. The captain of the Costa Concordia, Francesco Schettino, is said to have cried out 'Madonna, what have I done?', as the cruise liner hurtled into rocks off the coast of Tuscany, an Italian has court heard. In the dock: Captain Francesco Schettino seen as he arrives for his trial . The captain allegedly cried out 'Madonna, what have I done?' when the ship hit the rocks . Captain Francesco Schettino, who was in command of the ship on the night of the disaster, reacted with disbelief on the impact, asking fellow officers ‘Did we hit a reef?', according to a recording played in court in Grosseto, Tuscany. Schettino, 52, is facing 20 years jail time if convicted of dereliction of duty and multiple counts of manslaughter. His lawyers argue that he is not solely responsible for the tragedy. The giant cruise liner Concordia hit rocks on the night of January 13, 2012 and 32 people were killed when it sank. Salvatore Ursino, left, arrived yesterday with his lawyer Antonio Langher at court where he gave evidence that Captain Schettino ordered officers to make the boat go faster in the run-up to the disaster . Cruise ship Costa Concordia lies stricken off the shore of the island of Giglio . It is believed Schettino had diverted the ship in an attempt to make an ill-judged 'salute' to the island of Giglio. Giving evidence for the prosecution, Salvatore Ursino, one of the ship’s junior officers, alleged that the Captain had been too slow to take action when things began to unravel and, in the run-up to the impact, ordered officers to make the boat go faster. Mr Ursino said that 'just five minutes before' Schettino had given the command to take the boat from 15 knots to 16 knots. ‘Schettino gave the order to increase the speed to his deputy, (first officer) Ciro Ambrosio,’ Mr Ursino told the court. Their problems began when the Indonesian helmsman failed to understand the Captain's orders twice as they approached the rocks, Mr Ursino said. Schettino allegedly still took no action, merely repeating his commands in English with the added threat, 'or else we'll hit the rocks'. Salvage operators in Italy lifted the Costa Concordia cruise ship upright from its watery grave off the island of Giglio in September, in the biggest ever project of its kind . Ursino and another female official were forced to approach the helmsman themselves to try to steer the ship out of danger. In the course of his evidence, Mr Ursino, who was the only officer at Schettino's side continuously during the incident, also described the presence of other guests on the bridge. One of these was Antonello Tievoli, the ship’s maitre d who was originally from the island of Giglio. Schettino allegedly sailed the ship close to the island in a 'salute' in order to impress him. Another was Moldovan dancer Domnica Cemortan, who was accused of causing the accident by flirting with Schettino. She has always denied an affair with the Captain even though her suitcase and bikini was found in Schettino's cabin. Miss Cemortan, now a civil plaintiff in the trial, was in court and is due to give evidence for the prosecution tomorrow. The 950 tonne ship was wrenched off the rocks last month in a mammoth operation and is expected to be removed from the island after the winter.","32 people were killed when Costa Concordia hit rocks off coast of Tuscany in January 2012 .

Scores of actors descended upon the quiet market town of Kirkby Lonsdale, in Cumbria, as filming for the BBC's adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's classic novel Jamaica Inn took place. The sleepy town was transformed from its 21st century norm to an eerie 1820s back-drop, against which Downton Abbey star Jessica Brown Findlay led the cast in a production directed by BAFTA-winner Philippa Lowthorpe. Set against the windswept Cornish Moors, Du Maurier's Jamaica Inn follows the journey of Mary Yellan, a young girl who falls into a life of crime after being sent to live with her aunt when her mother dies. The quiet market town between the Lake District and Yorkshire has been transformed into the eerie, 1820s Cornish village featured in the book originally . The town on the River Lune was chosen as one of three settings for the drama as Launceston in Cornwall, the story's original setting, has become too modern . Back to reality: Kirkby Lonsdale Market Square on a normal day. The square hosts a weekly market in support of local merchants who sell food, flowers and plants . St Mary's Church was also used during filming which took place earlier this month over one week. Local residents expressed their surprise at how 'smooth' the transformation had been . The original story is set in the Cornish town of Launceston however producers decided the area had become too modern to offer a realistic backdrop to the drama . The three-part drama will be filmed in two other locations, with shooting arranged in Cornwall and Yorkshire as well. Jamaica Inn is the story of young Mary Yellan who is forced to move in with her Aunt Patience after her mother dies. When Mary arrives in Launceston she discovers her aunt living under the rule of her husband, Joss Merlyn, who is the crooked keeper of Jamaica Inn. With no guests and locked rooms, the inn soon reveals itself as a hub of illegal activity. Mary quickly falls into a life of crime, joining the group of wreckers led by Joss and his brother, Jem, who run ships aground and murder sailors to steal their loot. Against her better judgement she develops feelings for Jem, a penny thief whose crimes are less severe than his older brother's. After several attempts to expose Joss as the criminal he is, Mary discovers him alongside her Aunt Patience who have been stabbed to death. She returns to her native Helford, but flees one day after seeing her beloved Jem walking across the moors with all his possessions. The story was originally set in the Cornish town of Launceston, but, as its town centre has become too modern looking, the more historical Kirkby Lonsdale was chosen instead, reports the Westmorland Gazette. Before filming begin in earnest, Origin Pictures issued a statement to residents that said: 'Some shops may look different during this time but behind their doors will be continuing as normal.’ 'We hope you will find our work interesting and apologise in advance for any inconvenience.' The town's quaint market square was turned into a 19th century horse traders yard on the second day of filming, while scenes were also shot near St Mary's Church. Members of the small community seemed more than happy to accommodate the programme's crew, posting updates of the filming's progress on kirkbylonsdale.co.uk. In a post titled 'Cornwall comes to Cumbria!', residents welcome tourists to visit the historic town during the exciting time. 'The rest of the town remains firmly in the 21st Century, so there are plenty of shops and eating places to provide for visitors. 'Why not take a trip back in time during the next few days while this part of Cumbria becomes Cornwall?' it read. Later posts reveal the residents who were taking part in the filming as extras were reminded to keep mobile phones on silent or switched off, and told to refrain from flash photography. 'The streets were lined with spectators busily taking snapshots at every opportunity. Because of the low light levels the director asked us to make sure our flashes were off, and not forgetting to remind us to make sure our mobles were on silent too. 'The logisitcs involved in transfroming our dear town must've been a monumental task and I can only say how impressed I have been with the smooth running of the whole process . The production's writer, Emma Frost, said: 'I love Daphne du Maurier’s novels and it’s been a lifelong dream to . adapt Jamaica Inn. 'I hope I have done justice to this wonderful tale of . morality, survival and desire.' Speaking upon the announcement of the programme's cast, she said: 'It has been a pleasure and a privilege to . adapt it for the screen, and I'm tremendously excited to see how our . talented cast and director bring the scripts to life.' Filming is underway in the Cumbria town of Kirkby Lonsdale which is playing host to the actors and crew behind the BBC's latest drama, Jamaica Inn . It has been reported that local residents in the town, which has an estimated population of just 1,770, have joined in on the set as extras . House of Card star,  Ben Daniels,  joins the cast as Davey while Wimpole Street actress, Rhiannon Oliver,  takes on the role of Mrs Trelawn .

The novel which was written in 1936 has been made into a film and been performed on the stage numerous times . Director Philippa Lowthorpe of Call The Midwife added: 'I love Jamaica Inn because it is an exhilarating adventure story set in a . wild landscape with brilliant characters, and at its heart is Mary .

The story, written in 1936, was first made into a film in 1939 by Alfred Hitchcock, starring Charles Laughton and Maureen O'Hara. But reports at the time claimed Du Maurier was understandably unimpressed with the film version changing several aspects of the original tale. In 1983 a TV adaptation was produced by ITV in the United Kingdom - featuring Jane Seymour, Trevor Eve, Billie Whitelaw and Patrick McGoohan.

Unlucky: Mary Roberts, who survived the sinking . of the Titanic, then endured a second shipwreck just two years later in . the North Sea near Whitby . Its owner survived the sinking of the Titanic and then endured a second shipwreck just two years later. Now the trunk Mary Roberts lost in her latter brush with a watery grave has resurfaced for sale on eBay. Miss Roberts spent a life at sea before finding fame by living through the infamous Titanic disaster in 1912, then surviving the sinking of the Rohilla in 1914. But her trunk had been presumed lost . to the North Sea since tempestuous winds smashed the steamship against . rocks to the west of Saltwick Nab, near Whitby, North Yorkshire. Wednesday . saw the 99th anniversary of the sinking of the Rohilla, where lifeboat . crews battled for 50 hours to pull 144 survivors from the wreck. As . the Rohilla sank Mary Roberts was brought ashore by lifeboat, and was . later quoted as saying the Rohilla sinking was worse to endure than the . Titanic. Miss Roberts had been a stewardess for White Star Line for several years when she signed on for the Titanic’s maiden voyage. When it launched, the RMS Titanic was one of the most opulent liners to have ever been built and the largest steamship in the world. It struck an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton, England, to New York City and sank on April 15, 1912, claiming the lives of 1,517 passengers and crew. The crew of the ship had failed to heed warnings of ice in the North Atlantic and were sailing at speed through an ice field when it struck the huge floe. Those who either drowned or froze to death in the disaster died mainly because there were not enough lifeboats on the ship and those that were used were half-empty. There was no chance of survival in the -2.2C water. Miss Roberts was one of the lucky ones. She left the doomed liner on lifeboat Number 11, helping to look after a small baby until being rescued by the Carpathia. She would later note that the White Star Line stopped her pay at 2.20am, the exact time Titanic sank. Missing for 99 years: Pete Thomson, curator of . Whitby Lifeboat Museum, with Miss Roberts's trunk, which she lost at sea . when the Rohilla was dashed against rocks in heavy gales and . tempestuous seas in 1914 . But it was after only a short recovery that she felt the call of the sea again, signing on to the Rohilla as a nurse. A . ship of the British India Steam Navigation company, the steamer had . been commandeered by the government to operate as a hospital ship at the . outbreak of the First World War. It . was carrying more than 200 patients and crew when, amid fierce gales . and wartime black-out conditions at 4.00am on on October 30, it struck . Whitby Rock, a reef at Salwick, south of Whitby town. The . boat was only 660 yards from shore, but the storm force winds . complicated efforts to rescue survivors from the wreck and treacherous . seas. Whitby's life boat . could not make it out of the harbour, and had to be carried by hand . over an eight-foot sea wall and across rocks so it could be launched . from a nearby beach. A painting imagines the scene as the Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean. Miss Roberts left the doomed liner on lifeboat Number 11, helping to look after a small baby until being rescued by the Carpathia . Miss . Roberts, one of only five women aboard the Rohilla, was among the first . 17 survivors rescued by the Whitby lifeboatmen, which went back to . rescue a further 18 before it too was smashed by the storm. But . by then, a further six RNLI lifeboats had arrived and valiantly . continued the rescue operation for a weary, wet two days, eventually . saving most of the 229 people aboard. Eighty-five lives were lost in the disaster. A photograph originally published in Popular Mechanics magazine shows life guards trying to get . line to the Rohilla as it fell to pieces. Miss Roberts was among the first people saved from . the ship by the Whitby lifeboat . Her trunk, an . intriguing relic of maritime history, has now been recovered by the . Whitby Lifeboat Museum, after its curator, Pete Thomson, spotted it on . for sale on eBay. He said: . 'It’s spooky, the fact that I have got this here now, 99 years later. Mary Roberts carried it on to the Rohilla and then she never saw it . again. 'When . the sea calmed down the rocks would be crawling with people picking up . items and it’s been missing for the last 99 years until it surfaced on . eBay for sale a month ago.' Mr Thomson, a former lifeboat coxswain, was not even aware of the antique’s existence until he contacted a friend who had attended the 90th anniversary in 2004 who happened to mention the trunk. Scavenged from the wreck? The box was found in a house clearance in York earlier this year, but its history before that is a mystery . 'If I hadn’t made that phone call I wouldn’t have got it. It was an absolute freak of luck. It’s such a coincidence, it’s almost as if the Lord’s looking out for us,' he said. Mr Thomson contacted the seller, an antiques dealer in Louth, Lincolnshire, who agreed to sell it to the museum for just £50. Made of tin, with wooden struts, the box was found during a house clearance in York earlier this year, but prior to that its history is unknown. The Rohilla was built in 1906 by . Harland and Wolff in Belfast, the same shipyard that would later . construct the equally ill-fated Titanic. Whereas . the Titanic sank in calm water, the weather during the Rohilla disaster . was tempestuous, with gales and huge waves battering against the ship . as it broke apart. Since . purchasing the trunk, Mr Thomson has been in contact with the . descendants of Miss Roberts, who didn’t know of its existence. The . trunk is now set to feature in a national World War One exhibition . focusing on the brave lifeboatmen who rushed to the aid of the stricken . vessels and their beleaguered survivors. Called .

Heroic: MP Stephen Gilbert spotted what he thought was a body in the Thames while he was on the House of Commons terrace . A quick-thinking MP was involved in a dramatic rescue of a woman from the river Thames near Westminster. Stephen Gilbert was attending an event on the House of Commons terrace - which overlooks the river - when he saw what he thought was a body floating past. But when he saw the body move, he reacted quickly to throw a lifebelt into the water. The woman was then able to grab the safety device before being rescued further downstream. Liberal Democrat Mr Gilbert, who was at an event for bus operators, was left shaken by the incident. He said: 'What looked like a body just floated past. Then I saw that the person then moved and I followed them down the terrace.' A number of life rings are kept along the terrace at the Palace of Westminster and Mr Gilbert, the MP for St Austell and Newquay, threw one into the river. He said: 'There are some lifebuoys on the terrace, I guess this is not the first time something like this has happened. 'I didn’t expect for the person to move and then I didn’t expect to have to react to get them a lifebuoy. 'She disappeared towards Westminster Pier and she was rescued near to that.' Mr Gilbert said the shock had left him 'barely able to string a sentence together'. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a woman had been pulled from the river near Westminster Pier, just yards from the House of Commons. Result: The quick-thinking MP, who announced his act of heroism on Twitter, pictured, threw a lifebelt into the water so the woman was able to grab hold of it. She was later rescued downstream . A spokesman said: 'The woman was rescued from the water by the RNLI, the marine policing unit was also involved. 'She has been taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service.' Mr Gilbert wrote on Twitter: 'Shaken after seeing a body float past House of Commons terrace - she moved, I threw a life-buoy and she’s now been rescued! #Result.'","Stephen Gilbert was at an event on .

Barbara Fari has received a three-month prison sentence after she exaggerated an injury in a bid to claim £750,000 compensation . A mother of 13 who exaggerated an injury in a bid to claim £750,000 compensation has been handed a three-month prison sentence. But she was allowed to walk free from prison after High Court judge Mr Justice Spencer stayed the term - half of which Barbara Fari would have to serve before her automatic release - so she can lodge an appeal. If an appeal is not lodged by November 29, discontinued or dismissed, she will have to surrender herself into custody. Former dinner lady Barbara Fari, who is 60 tomorrow, pretended to be almost totally disabled and in constant agony after falling over a slab of pavement in May 2008. She claimed the only way she could get up and down the stairs was by dragging herself on her buttocks and demanded £750,000 in compensation from Homes for Haringey, which manages council housing in the north London borough. The organisation admitted liability and . offered her £7,500 but she pursued the larger claim which was only struck . out by a judge in October 2012 after covert video evidence revealed a . huge difference between how she presented at medical examinations and . when she was out and about near her home in Hornsey. Today Mrs Fari received a three month prison term for contempt of court, but the judge was forced to stay the sentence until the outcome of any appeal. Husband Piper Fari, a musician, was also convicted of contempt of court for his part in the claim and received a two month sentence suspended for a year. Mr Justice Spencer told the couple they were also liable for £100,000 costs, but would only be required to pay 'if they should win the lottery'. Mr Fari had claimed he was working as his wife's full-time carer but footage shot on September 1, 2011, showed Mrs Fari walking with two heavy bags of shopping. She strolled at 'medium to brisk pace' up the steep hill to her Hornsey home. The pair even convinced leading surgeons and psychologists of Mrs Fari's 'debilitating' injuries, carefully keeping up the act until they were out of eyeshot. Her medical records showed a knee complaint which pre-dated the supposed fall by years. Husband Piper Fari, a musician, was also convicted of contempt of court for his part in the claim and received a two month suspended sentence . She said the fall aggravated her pre-existing arthritis to the point where she was no longer able to look after her large family and instead needed their care. The couple denied contempt and Mrs Fari, who is illiterate, claimed she relied on the advice of solicitors, simply signed documents which were not explained properly and that medical experts misinterpreted what she told them. But the judge described her as a 'strong and domineering' character, who actively pursued her case while her unemployed husband of 27 years foolishly went along with it. Barbara Fari (with walking stick and hand bag) hides behind her husband Piper Fari on the way to court today . Sentencing the pair, Mr Justice . Spencer said, 'You Barbara Fari deliberately exaggerated your continued . symptoms from this minor accident in a thoroughly dishonest way. 'You pretended to be far more seriously affected by the minor injury to your knee than you really were. You knew that the whole claim was being presented on a false basis. 'You have consistently contested the allegations to the hilt. In that sense, you have made it worse for yourself. 'For you, Barbara Fari, the least sentence I can pass is one of three months imprisonment. You will serve one half of that sentence before you are automatically released. 'You, Piper Fari, foolishly allowed yourself to become entangled in your wife's lies and deception. I am persuaded that in your case it is not necessary that the sentence be served immediately.' The judge said that false and lying claims undermined the administration of justice in a number of serious ways. He said: 'Insurers have to spend a great deal of time and money identifying and weeding out claims they think may be fraudulent. 'False claims damage our whole system in this country of adversarial justice, depending as it does on openness, transparency and honesty. 'False claims can take up a great deal of court time and precious resources. 'The courts have made it very clear that those who make false claims and are caught out must expect to go to prison. There is no other way to underline the gravity of such conduct and deter those who may be tempted to make such claims, no other way to improve the administration of justice.' He said that Mrs Fari's injury affected her life for only four or five months and was a claim worth a few thousand pounds at most. He accepted her solicitors were not the . most efficient, but it was Mrs Fari's conduct which was under the . spotlight and it was she who had unusually chosen to contest every . allegation to the hilt in the proceedings. 'False claims damage our whole system in . this country of adversarial justice, depending as it does on openness, . transparency and honesty' - Mr Justice Spencer . The couple's counsel, Mohammed Bashir, said the couple were the 'engine room' of their family of children aged 15 to 24, two of whom are disabled. They were the sole earners, receiving income support of £190 per week, and their absence would have a far-reaching effect which would outweigh any potential deterrence. He emphasised that Haringey never paid out the money which was claimed and said the couple, who were of previous good character, were essentially good people trying to do their best in difficult circumstances. After the hearing, Homes for Haringey's solicitor, Jennifer Harris of Plexus Law, said: 'This is a stark warning to anyone tempted to exaggerate a personal injury claim. It is not just their compensation they risk losing but also their liberty. 'If the original claim had been for a realistic sum which reflected the true extent of the injury, this case would have been settled long ago and need never have come to court. The courts have sent a consistent and strong message at every stage of these proceedings - fraudulent behaviour will not be tolerated.' Mark Dyson, insurance partner at Plexus Law, said 'This decision will make a huge difference in terms of future and indeed current personal injury claims, forcing claimants to focus purely on pursuing the genuine element of their claim, and helping the insurance industry to contain its costs which in turn will benefit society generally.'","Barbara Fari handed three month prison sentence at London's High Court .

Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, backed the sacking of two guards at Yarl's Wood in Bedford . Two guards at an immigration detention centre have been sacked for ‘sexual activity’ with a woman detainee, a report reveals today. Two men were sacked as a result of ‘inappropriate behaviour’ with a detainee at Yarl’s Wood in Bedford. A third female guard was fired for failing to blow the whistle when the woman came forward, inspectors said. Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, said sexual activity with a detainee can ‘never be less than abusive’ and backed the sackings. The centre is run by services firm . Serco - which has come under fire in recent months over allegations it . overcharged taxpayers for tagging criminals. Following the sex abuse allegations, Mr Hardwick ordered more than 50 confidential interviews with detainees. But . in his report, published today, he said there was no evidence of a . ‘wider culture of victimisation or systematic abuse’ at the 400-bed . centre - which is Britain’s largest immigration removal centre for . women. His report also . found 100 illegal entrants a month were found climbing out of lorries in . the Midlands alone. Some six hundred were detected and taken to Yarl’s . Wood over a six month period. A . police investigation into the sexual activity allegations was launched . last month following claims from a 23-year-old Roma woman who was held . at Yarl’s Wood. It is thought the woman has launched legal action . against the centre. Mr Hardwick said: ‘We were concerned to find that two staff had engaged in sexual activity with a female detainee, something that can never be less than abusive given the vulnerability of the detained population, and these staff had rightly been dismissed.’ The report said: ‘Before the inspection, two members of staff had rightly been dismissed as a result of inappropriate behaviour with a detainee, and a third had been dismissed because of a failure to safeguard the detainee concerned. ‘Steps had been taken to minimise the risks of this occurring again in the future, including a programme of training, but continuing vigilance was needed.’ Yarl’s Wood holds mainly single adult women and there is a short-term holding facility for adult men.Inspectors said more female staff were needed urgently as there were not enough for a mainly women’s establishment. It also expressed concern that male staff entered women’s rooms without waiting for a reply after knocking. Women said they were ‘embarrassed’ by male officers carrying out searches of their rooms and personal property. A number of women at the centre were detained for long periods, including one for almost four years. This picture shows Oakington Immigration Centre in Cambridgeshire, not the centre in question . John Tolland, Serco’s contract director, said: ‘We are really pleased that this inspection report recognises the improvements Serco has made at Yarl’s Wood and considers it to be an establishment where residents feel safe and there is little violence. ‘Our managers and staff have worked hard to establish and maintain good relationships with the residents, who are vulnerable people in the middle of a distressing and difficult experience. ‘However, we are not complacent. As the HMCIP report says, we need to make further improvements and we are already working closely with the Home Office to implement their recommendations.’ A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Detention is a vital tool that helps us remove those with no right to be in the country, but it is essential that our facilities are well run, safe and secure. ‘Safeguarding those in our care is our utmost priority and misconduct is dealt with swiftly and robustly. ‘We are carefully considering the contents of the report and will respond to each of its recommendations in due course.’","Third female guard sacked for failing to expose 'inappropriate behaviour'

Iran has decided to spare the life of a convicted drug trafficker who survived a hanging, media reports on Wednesday quoted Justice Minister Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi as saying. The reports follow calls from within Iran and appeals from international rights groups against the man found alive in a morgue facing execution for a second time. 'The convict who survived (the death penalty) will not be executed again,' Pour-Mohammadi said late Tuesday in remarks reported by the official IRNA news agency. 'After putting much effort to prevent the second execution of this convict, we have received a positive response,' he said without elaborating. Iran has the highest rate of executions per capita and puts to death more people annually than any other nation except China. This convicted murderer Hashem Anbarniya was hanged in 2002 . All judicial affairs and decisions in . the Islamic republic rest with the judiciary, which constitutionally . operates independently from the government. The . convict, identified only as Alireza M, 37, was pronounced dead earlier . this month by the attending doctor after hanging for 12 minutes from a . noose suspended from a crane at a jail in northeast Iran. But . the next day, staff at the mortuary in the city of Bojnourd where his . shrouded body was taken discovered he was still breathing. 'Inhumane': It is believed around 200 people have been put to death in Iran since its new president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June . Media later reported that he had fallen into a coma. Pour-Mohammadi implied that a second execution would be damaging for Iran's image. 'If he survives, it is not expedient to hang him again,' said the minister. The incident led to a heated debate between jurists, with some arguing against a repeat hanging and others for. According . to the media, a petition signed by jurists and attorneys was sent to . judiciary chief Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani, appealing for a stay in the . exceptional case. Amnesty International also called for an immediate stay of execution for Alireza M.

Murder, . rape, armed robbery, drug trafficking and adultery are among the crimes . punishable by death in Iran, based on its interpretation of sharia law . in force since its 1979 Islamic revolution. Iran has executed an estimated 560 people this year - including around 200 that have been put to death since new 'moderate' president Hassan Rouhani came to power in June.","The 37-year-old was put to death in the Islamic regime's Bojnourd prison .

Two engineering bosses have drunk fracking fluid in an attempt to show the world it is safe to use in the ground. John Gorman, vice-president of Halliburton, and Michael Binnion, chief executive of Questerre Energy Corp, drank samples from champagne bottles. They urged onlookers to sip the mixture – which is injected into the ground during the fracking process – and 20 other executives did so. Fracking Fluid: John Gorman, Vice-President of Haliburton Canada, sipped the drink during a PR stunt to prove it is safe . Ironically Halliburton says the . liquid is not safe for human consumption, but Mr Gorman said that what . he drank was modified slightly with food additives. Mr . Binnion told the Quebec Oil and Gas Association conference in Montreal . that the fluid was ‘very stale-tasting’. But he hoped his drinking it . would make people reconsider their views on its safety. The . stunt recalls  that in 1990 when John Gummer, then minister of . agriculture, tried to persuade his four-year-old daughter to eat a beef . burger to play down the dangers of BSE – ‘mad cow disease’. She refused. Thirty-two people later died of CJD, the human form of BSE. Campaigners . say chemicals mixed with water and sand in the fracking process to . force gas out of deep rock could contaminate soil and water supplies. 'We were trying to show that whenever the oil and gas industry is shown a challenge, we view it as an opportunity to find solutions,' Gorman told the Financial Post, adding that they replaced 'very few' chemicals with food additives. Halliburton invented the controversial oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking', that allows hydrocarbons to be removed by injecting a chemical fluid into shale rock formations. It is now the biggest provider of services in America’s fracking industry. But it . has been fighting allegations that the fluids it injects into the . ground as part of the hydraulic fracturing process are toxic, harmful to the environment and can contaminate human water supply. So the gas provider developed the CleanStim liquid using . ingredients 'sourced from the food industry.' Although Halliburton does say the fluid is not for human consumption. Controversial: Fracking allows hydrocarbons to be removed by injecting a chemical fluid into shale rock formations causing tiny fractures which allow long-term release of gas. But some say the fluids are toxic . 'The purpose of drinking frack fluid is to say how one can in a dramatic way show people that their accepted wisdom on frack fluid disclosure is simply wrong,' Mr. Binnion said. 'It is especially wrong today as more and more companies have joined in to disclose contents of the fluids.' 'It was absolutely the first time I drank fracking fluid - you can be . sure of that,' said Michael Binnion, President of QOGA and CEO of . Questerre Energy Corp. 'I feel fine. 'There was quite a . build-up, but it was a bit of a let-down as it was less viscous than I . thought it would be, but more viscous than water. And very . stale-tasting.' It comes a month after Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper told a Senate committee that he drank a glass of Halliburton's fracking fluid. 'You can drink it. We did drink it around the table, almost rituallike, in a funny way,' Hickenlooper told the Washington Times. 'It was a demonstration. … they’ve invested millions of dollars in what is a benign fluid in every sense.' America's biggest: Halliburton invented the controversial oil and gas extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing or 'fracking', and is now America's biggest provider . Invented in 1949, hydraulic fracking involves drilling more than 7,000ft down into gas-bearing shale before pumping a mixture of water and sand at high pressure into the shale, causing tiny fractures which allow long-term release of gas. In the US large-scale fracking since 2005 has caused energy prices to plummet, sparked economic recovery and cut greenhouse gas emissions to levels last seen in 1990. However, survey by the Pew Research Center showed the public’s growing anxiety over fracking. Almost half (49 per cent) of those polled in a recent survey opposed the increased use of fracking — up from 38 per cent people in a similar survey in March — while 44 per cent were in favour. The skepticism comes as the industry is making concerted efforts to change the ingredients used in fracking fluids and focusing on recycling the water it consumes. 'The oil and gas and oilfield services companies together have not done a good job in the past ten years in defending or proposing solutions,' Mr. Gorman admitted. 'But now obviously it is in our best interest to say, ""Look, here are some of the answers to the questions you had"". And we think we have done a good job and with data and with facts — not with rhetoric and rumour.'","Halliburton Canada VP John Gorman drank the fluid at an event in Montreal .

A prisoner of war who played in goal for the Welsh team in a concentration camp football league has returned to its site to bury the ghosts of his past. Ron Jones, 96, was held in E715 - a prisoner of war camp alongside the main Auschwitz extermination camp in Poland - after being captured by German troops during World War II. He said the soldiers were terrified. 'We did not know what would happen to us. We thought at one time they would stick us in the gas chamber,' said Ron. 'It was not just Jews going in, it was Polish, political prisoners, gypsies, homosexuals.' During the week prisoners were employed at forced labour camps, but on their rest day they were allowed to play football on a field just outside the camp - with armed German guards watching from the sidelines. Father-of-one Ron said: 'We didn’t work on a Sunday so we used to play football.' The Red Cross heard about it and brought the teams four sets of shirts - English, Scottish, Irish and Welsh. Ron, a widower, of Newport, South Wales, played in goal for the Welsh team at the camp, which is situated near the Polish town of Oswiecim.

But he survived the ordeal and eventually returned to his home to be reunited with his wife Gwladys. Ron is now only one of three men still alive who survived the death march. He has returned to the camp as a book about his survival called The Auschwitz Goalkeeper is published later this month. Auschwitz in 2005, and in 1945, where Ron was held after being captured by .

Ed Miliband will launch a campaign today to compel the Government to deal only with firms willing to pay a ‘living’ wage. He will insist Whitehall contracts should only be offered to companies paying at least £7.20 an hour, or £8.30 in London, both far above the legal minimum wage. The Labour leader will mark Living Wage Week by saying it is an idea ‘whose time has come’. 'Key plank': Labour leader Ed Miliband, left, who has worked closely with his brother David, right, on the plans, has said making the living wage the norm for workers is at the heart of his party's bid to return to power . But Government lawyers warn awarding contracts on the basis of hourly wage rates may be illegal. The legal opinion was based on a . European Courts of Justice case which found that describing a wage in a . particular contract could be illegal unless it was universally applied . across the country. The opposition leader has been . working closely with his brother David Miliband on ways to ensure the . pay terms replace the lower minimum wage as the norm - possibly through . naming and shaming companies that do not pay it. Their . collaboration is a sign that tensions between the Milibands are thawing . after Ed Miliband narrowly beat his brother to the Labour leadership in . 2010. 'Slog': Ed Miliband has said workers deserve a decent wage if their employers can afford it . The . leader of the opposition said the wage - defined as the minimum hourly rate needed . for an acceptable standard of living - was a key plank of his 'One . Nation' vision to share prosperity. The £7.20 living wage, which . rises to more than £8.30 in London, is higher than the current minimum . wage of £6.19 for people aged 21 and over, and £4.98 for those aged 18 . to 20. While some . large firms and public sector employers already pay the living wage to . staff, Labour wants to see more companies adopting the policy . voluntarily. As part of its policy review, . Labour is looking at three ways of making the pay terms the new norm, . including naming and shaming listed companies who do not pay the wage . through corporate governance rules. It is also considering . introducing rules that will see Whitehall contracts awarded to firms who . pay workers the living wage or above, and giving Treasury-funded . incentives to companies who introduce the wage structure. In an . interview with the Independent on Sunday,  Ed Miliband said: 'You go out, . slog your guts out...you deserve a decent wage if the company can . afford it.

Hugh Grant has become a father for the second time to a son he has named Felix Chang, The Mail on Sunday can exclusively reveal. Tinglan Hong, the mother of the Notting Hill star’s 16-month-old daughter Tabitha, gave birth on December 29 and registered the new arrival on Valentine’s Day. According to the birth certificate, Felix Chang was born at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London – where the Duchess of Cambridge is expected to have her child. Holding the baby: Hugh Grant (pictured with a baby in About A Boy) has become a father for the second time to a son he has named Felix Chang . It reveals the boy’s full name as Felix Chang Hong Grant. Felix is the Latin word for lucky and Chang in Chinese means long-lasting. It is understood the actor told his closest friends only in the last week, but swore them to secrecy. His ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Hurley, who is godmother to Tabitha, was among those informed. Grant decided to make the news public yesterday after being contacted by The Mail on Sunday with a congratulatory message. Minutes later, at 3.19pm, Grant posted a message on his Twitter page saying: ‘In answer to some journos. Am thrilled my daughter now has a brother. Adore them both to an uncool degree. They have a fab mum.’ Grant tweeted again at 6.44pm: ‘And to be crystal clear. I am the Daddy.’ The 52-year-old star of Love Actually and About A Boy is on the certificate as the child’s father under his full name Hugh John Mungo Grant with his occupation listed as ‘actor’. Revelation: Hugh Grant announced yesterday that he had had a second child with Tinglan Hong . Clarification: The actor later tweeted 'I am the Daddy' to any followers who were confused . Miss Hong, 32, who lives at the . £1.2 million terrace house in Fulham, West London bought for her by . Grant last year, lists her occupation as ‘housewife’. Felix’s . birth was registered at Westminster Register Office five days later . than is technically permitted by Westminster City Council rules. These . state that parents should register their children within 42 days of . their baby’s arrival. According to the certificate, the birth was registered by ‘the signature of Tinglan Hong [and a] statutory declaration made by Hugh John Mungo Grant on January 17’. A statutory declaration of acknowledgement of parentage, which must be made in front of a magistrate, Justice of the Peace or solicitor, can be used to register a birth if the child’s parents are unmarried and one parent is unable to attend the registration. Felix’s arrival comes almost 17 months after Miss Hong gave birth to the couple’s first child, daughter Tabitha Xaio Xi Hong Grant, at London’s Portland Hospital. Mother to his children: Hong (pictured with Grant in 2011) gave birth to the couple's first child, daughter Tabitha Xaio Xi Hong Grant 17 months before the arrival of Felix . In an interview with American chat . show host Ellen DeGeneres last April, Grant admitted that while coming . as something of a shock, fatherhood had had a very positive . ‘life-changing’ effect on him. ‘Everyone . was right all these years, saying: “Hugh, why don’t you have some . children? It changes your life.” Now that I have a child, it is . life-changing. I recommend it. Get some. ‘I can’t pretend it wasn’t a little . bit of a surprise. But it’s a very nice surprise. In fact, the baby’s . name in Chinese, because the mother’s is Chinese, means ‘happy . surprise’. Miss Hong, who . was born in Zhejiang province in eastern China and moved to Britain in . 2003, is understood to have met Grant in a Chelsea wine bar 2008. The pair struck up an unlikely friendship before embarking on a relationship in January 2011. Tabitha’s arrival was kept secret for two months until the actor’s spokesman released a statement confirming the birth but adding that Grant – who rose to fame in Four Weddings And A Funeral in 1994 – was no longer in a relationship with Miss Hong. It read: ‘I can confirm that Hugh . Grant is the delighted father of a baby girl. He and the mother had a . fleeting affair and while this was not planned, Hugh could not be . happier or more supportive.’ 'It changes your life': Grant admitted that while it came as something of a shock, fatherhood had had a very positive 'life-changing' effect on him . Giving . evidence at the Leveson Inquiry in November 2011, Grant said he . regretted authorising his publicist to describe the relationship as . ‘fleeting’. ‘I felt it was . important to be honest and not have a wrong version, a twisted version, . appear in the papers, which was that she was my girlfriend who had been . dumped when she got pregnant, which was simply not the case, or that it . was a planned pregnancy that I ran away from,’ he said. ‘I was protecting her reputation – I . didn’t want her to appear to be a jilted girlfriend. I was protecting . mine – I didn’t want it to seem that I was a monster who ran away from . his girlfriend. ‘It’s true . I’ve been given a hard time for using those words because . . .which is . ironic seeing as it’s actually the truth, but that doesn’t seem to be . very popular.’ The star has enjoyed romances in the past two decades with a string of high-profile women but has never married. In 2008, Miss Hong, who is affectionately known as Ting Ting to her friends and has a degree in hotel management from the University of Surrey, embarked on an 18-month relationship with specialist car dealer Robert Hodge, 56, a divorced father of four from Wandsworth, South West London whom she met in 2006. In an interview with The Mail on Sunday in 2011, Mr Hodge claimed Miss Hong first met Grant in late 2008 on a night out with friends at Brinkley’s wine bar, a venue popular with well-heeled locals including England footballer Frank Lampard and cricketer Kevin Pietersen. ‘The next day she showed me this photograph on her phone with Hugh Grant. We laughed about it and she’d bring it out to show people but I didn’t think any more about it.’ Miss Hong broke off the relationship with Mr Hodge in early 2010. In January 2011, Miss Hong was photographed with Grant in the press for the first time. This was around the time when she fell pregnant with the couple’s first child. Yesterday a spokeswoman for Grant said she had no further comment to make.","Mail on Sunday's congratulations led Hugh Grant to tweet birth of son Felix .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 07:18 EST, 29 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:04 EST, 29 January 2013 . A never-before-seen portrait of Nazi leader Hermann Goering painted by a Jewish artist during the 1930s is set to go under the hammer. The oil painting by Imre Goth enraged the tyrant after it was completed, as he was furious that it depicted him as the morphine-fuelled drug addict he was. Goering was so outraged by the artwork that Goth feared for his life, and was forced to flee Germany and seek refuge in Britain. Up for auction: This portrait of Hermann Goering by Imre Goth is going under the hammer . The portrait never left the possession of its creator, and on his death 30 years ago he asked a friend to destroy it. But the confidante kept the unique work, and it is expected to sell for thousands of pounds when it goes up for auction next month. Goering commissioned the Hungarian-born artist - whose work appeared in a number of trendy German magazines - to paint portraits of him and his actress girlfriend in 1934, at the height of the Nazi rise to power. But Hitler’s right hand man was said to be dismayed when he saw the finished article. He had developed an addiction to morphine during the First World War, and worried that the painting showed the effects the drug was having on his body. Badly received: The Nazi feared that the picture exposed his debilitating morphine habit by depicting the damage it had done to his appearance . Goering demanded that the artist alter the portrait to bring it in line with heroic propaganda images of his fellow leaders. But Goth insisted he would only paint what he could see, and refused to create a ‘dishonest’ vision of Goering. Realising his life was in danger, the artist fled to Britain, and was interned in a camp on the Isle of Man before being allowed to settle in the UK, where he stayed until his death in 1982, aged 89. He brought the painting with him and entrusted it to friend Sylvia Reed on the condition she dispose of it when she died. But she decided to preserve the artwork for posterity, and kept it under wraps for almost 30 years. Propaganda: An official portrait of Goering painting him in a much more heroic light . Imre Goth (1893-1982) was a Hungarian Jewish artist who found fame as a portraitist in Berlin. His pictures were often seen in German magazines during the 1930s, which was when he was commissioned to paint Hermann Goering. During the middle of that decade, as Nazi Germany became an increasingly hostile place for Jews, he moved to Britain after holding a successful exhibition in Birmingham. As a citizen of an enemy state, Goth was interned on the Isle of Man during the early years of the Second World War. However, he later settled into a peaceful life, and struck up a friendship with film producer Alexander Korda, giving him an entry into the British showbiz world. He lived off the proceeds of his inventions, which included car headlights and a type of parachute. A note from Mrs Reed which accompanies the picture reads: 'Goering commissioned him to paint pictures of friends and particularly of an actress he was having an affair with at the time, and then asked him to paint his portrait as he wished to give it as present to his girlfriend. 'At the time Imre Goth got on well with Goering due to their mutual interest in aircraft and flying... all went well until the portrait of Goering was finished. 'Goering felt that the eyes betrayed the fact that he was taking morphine and he demanded that Goth should change them. 'Goth said he could only paint what he saw and left immediately.' The portrait forms part of a war memorabilia sale to be held by Mullock’s auctioneers in Ludlow, Shropshire on February 14. Its reserve price is £8,000, but it has previously been valued by experts as high as £50,000. 'The historical significance of this portrait cannot be denied,' said Richard Westwood-Brookes of Mullock's. 'As opposed to the official Nazi portraits of Goering, this shows him exactly what he was - a depraved drug addict - and for that reason I personally think it should be displayed publicly to show successive generations exactly what the Nazis really were, as opposed to their now more familiar propaganda images.' Before his exile Goth was a celebrated artist and his paintings could be seen on the covers of magazines and on gallery walls.","Imre Goth was forced to flee Germany after painting portrait .

Eulogised by William Wordsworth, Esthwaite Water is a mile and a half long and nestles in one of the most beautiful parts of the Lake District. It is also going to be for sale on eBay for roughly the same price as an ordinary home – £300,000. It is believed to be the first lake to go on the online auction site, which  is more often used to get rid of unwanted clothes or concert tickets. Owner Nigel Woodhouse describes it as a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' as he prepares to retire. Esthwaite Water, which lies between Lake Windermere and Coniston Water in Cumbria, is the first to be offered for sale on eBay . The lake's owner Nigel Woodhouse claimed it was the 'opportunity of a lifetime' for prospective buyers . The lake inspired William Wordsworth and Beatrix Potter as they penned their literary masterpieces . He said: 'I chose eBay because I wanted to broadcast it to the world. The literary and natural importance of the lake is likely to attract an international audience so what better way to get the message out?' Esthwaite Water covers 280 acres, straddling the villages of Near Sawrey and Hawkshead, and is the largest privately owned lake in Cumbria. Mr Woodhouse said he wants to sell the lake and its established leisure businesses after 32 years in charge, as he approaches retirement age. 'I will be sad to see it go; it has been my life,' he said. The majestic expanse of water is mentioned by Wordsworth in his poem Expostulation and Reply and is the location for Lines Left Upon A Seat In A Yew-Tree - both feature in his Lyrical Ballads. And Beatrix Potter's 'favourite lake' was the setting for the moment the children's author was inspired to create the popular character frog, Jeremy Fisher. A licensed nature trail around the lake now pays homage to the famous literary figure behind the Peter Rabbit series. Images painted by the author on the shores of the water hang in a studio nearby celebrating her work. Owner Nigel Woodhouse, left, is preparing to retire after running the lake's leisure business for the last 32 years. The expanse of water lies 500 metres from the former home of children's author Beatrix Potter, right . Mr Woodhouse said he chose to market the lake on the auction site because it is likely to attract prospective buyers from across the globe . An illustrated map shows Esthwaite Water lies in the South Lake District close to Lake Windermere and Coniston Water . 'The nature walk provides for an informative amble from our car park up to the National Trust property of Hill Top, just 500m away,' Mr Woodhouse added. The lake is the largest stocked fishing lake in the north west and acts as a trout fishery, attracting thousands to fish its shores each year - including one who caught England’s largest pike at 46.5lb. Mr Woodhouse added: 'The site is of European importance and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. 'It also has Ramsar status, which commends wetlands of international importance. 'We have had ospreys on site for 13 years and now offer a self-driven electric boat ride safari around the lake, taking in six different locations.' Included in the 15-year lease from the Graythwaite Estate is the lake and land on the south west shore, a Victorian boathouse, fisherman’s lodge and shop. There is also a slipway and jetty for boats. The auction will work on a best offer basis and Mr Woodhouse is available to show prospective buyers around. Poet William Wordsworth drew inspiration from the beautiful landscape at Esthwaite Water . William Wordsworth was an English poet who helped to launch the Romantic age in English literature. He was Britain's Poet Laureate from 1843 until his death in 1850. Esthwaite Water is mentioned twice in Wordsworth's The Prelude at line 269: 'Make green peninsulas on Esthwaite's Lake'. And again at line 570: 'From Esthwaite's neighbouring lake the splitting ice.' The lake was also mentioned as the spot where Wordsworth spoke with a friend in his poem Expostulation and Reply, which made up part of the former Poet Laureate's Lyrical Ballards. In the same collection, compiled with fellow romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the lake is the location for Lines Left Upon A Seat In A Yew-Tree.","Idea for character Jeremy Fisher was born on the banks of Beatrix Potter's 'favourite lake'

An Indian author, who wrote a bestselling memoir about life under the Taliban, has been shot by militants in Afghanistan. Suspected Taliban militants broke into Sushmita Banerjee's home late last night in Paktika province. Provincial police chief general Dawlat Khan Zadran said they tied up her husband before taking Ms Banerjee, 49, outside and shooting her. Sushmita Banerjee was shot dead by militants who broke into her Afghanistan home on Thursday night . Her body was then left near a religious school, the BBC reported. Ms Banerjee was known for her memoir, A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife, a bestseller in India. It tells the story of her marriage to Afghan businessman husband, Jaanbaz Khan, and their move to his country before she fled back to her native India. Ms Banerjee's memoir was made into the 2003 film Escape From Taliban . The book was made into a 2003 Bollywood film called Escape From The Taliban. She moved to Afghanistan in 1989 but escaped in 1995 after the Taliban's rise to power and restriction of women's rights. In the book, Ms Banerjee described fleeing to neighbouring Pakistan but being forcibly brought back to the Afghanistan capital Kabul by her brothers-in-law. She eventually tunnelled out of the house before being assisted by the Indian Embassy. The BBC reports the Taliban has denied murdering Ms Banerjee, who was also known locally as Sayed Kamala. No group has claimed responsibility. According to local reports, Ms Banerjee and her husband had only recently moved back to Afghanistan. She had been reportedly working as a health worker and filming the lives of women that she met. The killing of Ms Banerjee is the latest in a string of attacks on prominent women in Afghanistan, adding to fears women's rights will recede even further in the country after US-led foreign forces leave.","Sushmita Banerjee shot outside her home before her body was dumped .

Surfers could have ridden the biggest waves in history yesterday as waves of up to 100ft created by St Jude's storm battered the European coast. Father-of-two Andrew Cotton, 34, of Croyde, North Devon - who is a part-time professional surfer, plumber and lifeguard - took on the monster waves off the coast of Portugal at Praia do Norte, near the sleepy fishing village of Nazare at around 8am yesterday morning. Married Mr Cotton, whose wife Katie and two children Honey, six, and Ace, one, are currently braving the storm at home on the Devon coast, was towed into the waves by his US surfing partner Garrett McNamara. Daredevil surfer Carlos Burle rides down what is believed to be one of the biggest waves ever conquered at Nazare, Portugal. The exact size of the wave Burle rode is yet to be determined, but it is believed to be close to challenging McNamara's feat from earlier this year. The incredible moment was captured from the hillside overlooking the bay by Portugese photographer To Mane.

The married father-of-two took on the monster waves caused by Atlantic Storm St Jude .

However, one . female surfer, Maya Gabeira from Brazil, nearly drowned and had to be . resuscitated on the beach when she fell on a wave and her jet-ski . partner could not get to her in time. She was rescued unconscious and taken to hospital, where she was reportedly doing well despite suffering a broken ankle. Brazillian . surfer Carlos Burle was also in the water taking on the waves and may . also have ridden a record-breaking wave during the same session, but the . exact height of the waves is impossible to tell and and quite . subjective depending on the angle from which they are viewed. It is not the first time Mr Cotton has been involved in a surfing world record - two years ago he was driving the jet-ski when he towed Mr McNamara into a giant wave at the same spot in 2011.

He said he could hear the waves . pounding the shoreline overnight from inside the beach house he is . staying in, saying the monster swells were even making the walls shake. Yesterday morning Mr Cotton and his team were in the water before light at 6am, . along with scores of other surfers all trying to ride the biggest wave.

But despite the ominous rumbling, Mr Cotton said he slept remarkably well and was in the water raring to go before light. He caught two waves before the potential record-breaker, which he believes was at around 8am, after he'd been in the sea for about two hours. Mr Cotton described the moment he was towed-in to the monster: 'Garrett heard on the radio that the third wave looked good so he just popped me in there in the perfect position. It was really bumpy, I spent most of the time just trying to stay on my feet, it's like you can't go fast enough, it's not like normal surfing.' Mr Cotton said it is hard for him to judge exactly how big a wave that size is, particularly as he is riding it. He said: 'Everyone wants to put figures on it, there were definitely 80ft waves there today, some even bigger, it was ridiculous, everyone got huge waves today, it was frightening out there.

Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is reportedly pocketing big money for public speaking events, taking home almost half a million dollars from Goldman Sachs after giving two talks for the investment banking giant and their clients this week. Clinton, who is considered a likely top contender for the Democratic nominee in the 2016 presidential race, is said to have received $200,000 per speaking engagement. The first event was the AIMS Alternative Investment Conference hosted by Goldman Sachs last Thursday, which is a private conference that explores the latest strategies and products available to financial advisers, according to National Review. Then on Tuesday, Clinton spoke at the Builders and Innovators Summit, which is devoted to discussing entrepreneurship and how to help innovators expand their businesses. The news comes on the back of a NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, which said the number of people who have a positive view of Clinton has dropped from a high of 58 percent in December to 46 percent today . Hillary Clinton was paid $400,000 to give two speeches hosted by investment banking firm Goldman Sachs, it has been claimed . Hillary Clinton has become a prominent name on the talking circuit, much like husband Bill Clinton, who last year alone earned $17 million from giving speeches . The New York Times reports that Clinton has been using her impressive government resume to garner large speaking fees since leaving her post at the State Department earlier this year . It's a strategy used extremely successfully by her husband, former US president Bill Clinton, who earned $17 million for speeches alone last year. His engagements outside the United States are said to be the most profitable. But it is Hilary's latest transactions that are raising eyebrows. While there is no suggestion Clinton has done anything wrong, the issue at hand is a large financial transaction happening between a potential presidential candidate and one of the most powerful investment banks in America. Richard Kim, editor of weekly magazine The Nation, said Clinton was 'ill-equipped' to speak at events centering on finance and the business world. Speaking of Clinton's impressive contact book of 'billionaires and corporate giants like Walmart, Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein, Mike Bloomberg, Hollywood mogul Steve Bing and Paychex chairman Tom Golisano', Kim said although Clinton may not 'solicit the advice of all these folks'. she will almost surely 'solicit their donations'. Hillary Clinton is the likely top Democratic contender for the 2016 presidential election . In terms of the banking world, Clinton also made visits to private-equity firms KKR in July and the Carlyle Group in September. At KKR's annual investor meeting in California, she answered questions from firm co-founder Henry Kravis on the Middle East, Washington and politics. At Carlyle Group, Clinton made a speech to shareholders moderated by Carlyly founder David Rubenstein. Both Clinton's office and Goldman Sachs did to respond to requests for comment about the speaking engagements. Last weekend Clinton gave her surest sign yet that she will as a presidential candidate. Speaking at a repetition at St Andrew's University in Scotland, where she received an honorary degree, Clinton was asked if she intends to run. 'I haven't made up my mind yet,' she said. When guests joked that her answer wasn't satisfactory, she replied: 'Yes, it is unsatisfactory. I'm minded to do it.'","The former US Secretary of State was reportedly paid $200,000 per speech for the investment banking firm .

Not backing down: Mr Cameron could seek court injunctions to prevent publication of classified information . David Cameron last night threatened to take legal action against newspapers that leak ‘damaging’ details of intelligence operations. The Prime Minister warned the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, which has printed classified information from renegade spy Edward Snowden, that it faced court injunctions if it continues to print claims about the activities of the GCHQ listening station. The newspaper, he said, was refusing to behave with ‘social responsibility’ despite repeated warnings that the revelations are damaging to national security. Mr Cameron threatened to impose a . D-Notice – an official Whitehall instruction not to print specific items . – on newspapers which reveal details of highly sensitive intelligence . operations. While a . D-Notice is not legally enforceable, Mr Cameron signalled that ministers . could also seek court injunctions to prevent publication. Mr Cameron acknowledged that The . Guardian had let agents of the security services destroy computer hard . drives containing some of Snowden’s material after being warned that . terrorists could access it on their servers. Under pressure: Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger pictured arriving at the Leveson inquiry in 2011, is accused of damaging national security and refusing to behave with 'social responsibility' by printing the leaks . Security risk: Renegade US spy Edward Snowden leaked details of intelligence operations to the left-wing newspaper . But he made clear that his patience is wearing thin after the latest batch of revelations – that the Americans have bugged the phones of 35 world leaders and that British intelligence has eavesdropped on Italian and Spanish citizens. The Prime Minister told MPs: ‘We have a free Press, it’s very important the Press feels it is not pre-censored from what it writes. The approach we have taken is to try to talk to the Press and explain how damaging some of these things can be, and that is why The Guardian did actually destroy some of the information and discs that they have. But they’ve now gone on and printed further material which is damaging. ‘I don’t want to have to use injunctions or D-Notices or the other tougher measures. I think it’s much better to appeal to newspapers’ sense of social responsibility. But if they don’t demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for Government to stand back and not to act.’ A Downing Street source said the government could intervene ‘if we were aware that they have material that could be published’. That would give ministers broad scope to gag newspapers in the courts since security chiefs are already aware of material stolen by Snowden which has not yet seen the light of day in the media. It emerged yesterday that spy chiefs lost track of terrorists after Snowden’s leaks. Militants stopped using electronic communications after he revealed the extent of monitoring by GCHQ and the American National Security Agency. In a statement to the Commons, Mr Cameron said serious attempts were made to attack Britain once or twice a year, and highlighted to MPs that 330 people had been convicted of  terrorism offences in British courts since the 9/11 terror attacks. ‘I quote these figures just to demonstrate the scale of the ongoing threat we face in our country,’ Mr Cameron said.","He says the paper was refusing to behave with .

While Euro zone finance ministers have suggested that Athens should be given until 2022 to lower its debt/GDP ratio to 120 per cent, Ms Lagarde insisted the existing target of 2020 should remain. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde (right) chats with Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras at the start of a Eurogroup finance ministers meeting in Brussels . She said: 'We clearly have different views. What matters at the end of the day is the sustainability of Greek debt so that country can be back on its feet.' Behind her sharp exchange with Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker lies a rift over whether euro zone governments need to write off some of Greece's debt to them to make it manageable. IMF officials have pressed for such a 'haircut' while Germany, the biggest contributor to euro zone bailout funds, has vehemently rejected it as illegal. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters on Tuesday that the 2020 deadline was 'a little too ambitious'. 'There's . a debate about a haircut for official creditors. On that I will say and . most countries have said so in the past few weeks that that's legally . not possible,' he added. Lagarde is in dispute with Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker (pictured) over . whether euro zone governments need to write off some of Greece's debt to . them to make it manageable . Chancellor Angela Merkel has signalled she wants to keep Greece in the euro zone but is determined to avoid losses for German taxpayers before a general election in September 2013. With so much stake, diplomats remain confident that a deal will be done to release a 31.5 billion euros tranche of bailout money which Athens urgently requires to avert bankruptcy.But it is a way off yet. Financial markets, which have been calmed by the European Central Bank's pledge to buy euro zone government bonds to shore up the currency bloc, took a dim view of the failure to agree. The euro dipped to a two-month low against the dollar and safe-haven German Bund futures rose to two-month highs. 'There seems to be quite a big difference of opinion between the IMF and euro zone finance ministers ... but our view is still that Greece won't leave the euro zone,' Rabobank rate strategist Lyn Graham-Taylor said. Juncker, who heads the 17-nation group of euro zone finance ministers, said a further Eurogroup meeting would take place on Nov. 20 and officials said more negotiations could be required the week after that to nail down a new deal. French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici told reporters on Tuesday that bailout money should flow by the end of the month. 'Our objective is to reach an agreement in principle on November 20 so that we can ... proceed to the disbursement of funds by the end of this month,' he said. The delay leaves Athens scrambling to meet a 5 billion euro bond repayment deadline on Friday, but EU officials were confident that it would not default. With Greece's overall debt pile set to . hit 190 percent of GDP next year, the IMF has set 120 percent as the . target, saying that anything much above that is not sustainable given . Greece's low growth prospects and high external borrowing requirements. Amid calls for a national strike, Greece has secured a £3bn in short-term funding which will be used to help make a crucial debt repayment at the end of the week . 'All avenues in order to reduce debt on Greece are being explored and will continue to be explored in the coming days,' Lagarde said. If the IMF, which is concerned about its own integrity, were to walk away from the Greek bailout, the euro zone would have to contribute extra funds and its reputation in financial markets could be severely damaged. Equally, if the IMF were to back down, its authority would be diminished. The euro zone ministers did agree on Monday to give Greece two more years to make the spending cuts demanded of it but by doing so they face an extra funding bill of around 33 billion euros, according to a document prepared for the meeting. A target was set in March for Greece to achieve a primary surplus of 4.5 percent of GDP in 2014. That will now be moved to 2016 giving Athens some breathing space to temper a deep recession that is to all intents and purposes a depression. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the 2020 deadline was 'a little too ambitious' Despite Greece approving a tough 2013 budget last week, which it hoped would meet conditions for the release of the next tranche of emergency loans under its second bailout programme, . Lagarde said more work was needed to cement the budget measures. 'There will be a few, only a few additional prior actions to be verified in the coming days,' she said. Loans have been held up since Athens, which has received two bailout packages from the euro zone and IMF, went off-track with promised reforms and budget cuts, partly as a result of holding two elections in the space of three months earlier this year. Until the bailout money flows, Greece will issue more short-term paper to keep itself afloat. Athens will sell one- and three-month T-bills later on Tuesday to refinance the 5 billion euro issue maturing on Nov. 16. Its debt agency expressed confidence the issue will be fully funded.Three officials told Reuters that the troika had concluded that Greece's debt burden will fall only to 144 percent of gross domestic product in 2020 and roughly 10 percentage points lower two years later if current policies do not change. To get the higher figure down to 120 percent of GDP requires lopping the best part of 50 billion euros of Greece's debt pile. Among the new instruments under consideration to reduce Greek debt are the removal of the 150-basis-point interest above financing costs on 53 billion euros of bilateral government loans to Greece, and lengthening the maturity of the loans. Greece may also borrow from the euro zone bailout fund to buy back its privately held debt, of which there is 50-60 billion euros, taking advantage of the deep discount it trades at to save money on redemptions and interest payments. 'It may be that we take some measures to reduce interest rates that will have an immediate effect on the budget,' Schaeuble said. 'Apart from that we expect that the problems will be solved within the financial framework of the second programme by allowing more time with additional measures.'","Dispute over whether Athens should be given until 2022 to lower its debt/GDP ratio to 120 per cent .

And before she was 16, Jennifer Lopez had the figure to match – thanks to plastic surgery paid for by her mother. And, as in any family, what she had, her younger sister Karen wanted too. Karen and Jennifer’s mother Lesley has now spent almost £20,000 on cosmetic surgery for her daughters. The result? Both now wish they hadn’t gone under the knife when they were so young – because their artificially enhanced bottoms and breasts attract too much attention. The Lopez sisters have had seven procedures between them to look like Jennifer's namesake . The sisters' mother Lesley has spent almost £20,000 on plastic surgery for them to emulate the curves of pop star Jennifer Lopez . Karen, 20, said: ‘My bum is so big now it’s kind of a curse because guys in clubs always want to have a feel of it. Even girls want a photo next to it. My body attracts everyone – I get too much attention and it annoys me.’ Her sister, Jennifer, 23, who has a young son, added: ‘Sometimes it’s too much. Men beep their horns and whistle at me, even come up and touch my bum. 'I also get a lot of attention from women. They ask me if my bum is real and if they can touch it. It can be uncomfortable.’ Jennifer was the first to have surgery – a £4,000 breast enlargement operation to increase her cup size from A to C when she was just 15. She later had a second, £6,000 operation, which involved having liposuction on her stomach. The fat was then pumped into her bottom. Jennifer, a size 12, said: ‘I envied curvy women like [US pop star] J-Lo. When I asked for the surgery, [mum] said no at first and that I should wait until I was 18, when my curves might develop. ‘But I wanted the results straight away. I kept on asking every day, saying how unhappy I was until, a year later, she agreed.’ As they were: Jennifer, left, and Karen, far right, with their mother Lesley and an unidentified friend . Karen, a size eight, started even younger. She had a £2,000 nose job at 14 and a breast enhancement, which also cost £2,000, a year later. She eventually persuaded her 43-year-old mother to use her savings and money earned through a cleaning job to pay for a £3,500 liposuction and bottom enlargement operation like Jennifer’s. The sisters had most of their surgery in Colombia, where their parents migrated from shortly before Karen was born. They now live in Camberwell, South London. The Lopez sisters admired the US singer's curves, seen in 2002, left, and at the Grammy Awards last week . In the UK, the legal age of consent for cosmetic surgery is 16, but most reputable surgeons won’t operate until 18. Jennifer, who has had further liposuction on her stomach and a second £2,000 breast enlargement after discovering she had faulty PIP implants, said: ‘After my surgery I had the body of a woman, but in reality I was still only a child. ‘There are so many perfect images of celebrities, it’s hard not to feel the pressure. We did. But if you have the money and it makes you happy, why not do it?

Naomi Watts: 'I'd watch again and again' She has already claimed she was given permission from beyond the grave by Diana to play her in a new film. Now Naomi Watts has revealed she was so determined to make her portrayal of the Princess of Wales perfect that she became obsessed with her controversial Panorama interview with Martin Bashir. Miss Watts, 44, has admitted she repeatedly watched the 1995 programme – even while she exercised. ‘I ran the Martin Bashir TV interview so often that it got to the point where I was watching it on my iPhone while I was out jogging,’ she told Hello! magazine. ‘I had five minutes of her walk, five minutes of her wave, five minutes of her laugh that I’d watch again and again. ‘She laughed a lot, actually, and had a cheeky sense of humour and would crack jokes you wouldn’t expect a princess to crack.’ The film Diana, which is released next month, focuses on the 18-month relationship the princess – who died in 1997 – had with Pakistan-born heart surgeon Hasnat Khan, following her separation and divorce from Prince Charles. ‘He was someone she trusted right away,’ Miss Watts said. ‘She was fascinated by his mind. ‘He was clever and traditional. She knew he was never going to exploit her. 'People would always be following her: but she did end up finding a connection with this one man. And I think that, despite the tragedy, that’s an uplifting story. Playing the Princess was, says Watts, her hardest ever role. ‘I kept wondering to myself “Would she like it?”,’ she reveals. ‘So I found myself constantly asking for her permission to carry on. 'I had saturated myself with Diana and her life and I felt this enormous responsibility of playing this iconic woman. Looks familiar: Prasanna Puwanarajah plays Martin Bashir in his famous interview of Diana in the film, Diana, which will be released next month . ‘It felt like I was spending a lot of time with her. There was one particular moment when I felt her permission was granted.

And now Canadian researchers claim to have discovered exactly how many calories the average person burns during sex. They say that in young people, sex burns an average of 4.2 calories a minute for men and 3.1 calories a minute for women. Sexercise? The average man burns 4.2 calories a minute having sex, while women burn 3.1 calories. This makes it better exercise than a walk - but not as good as jogging, say Canadian researchers . With the average session lasting 24.7 minutes, this equates to 104 calories for men and 69 for women. This makes it better exercise than a walk - but not as good as jogging. The researchers, from the University of Quebec at Montreal,  looked at 21 heterosexual couples aged between 18 to 35. The average recorded session lasted for 24.7 minutes - the shortest being 10 and the longest 57 minutes . During four sex sessions at home, couples wore a SenseWear armband that tracked their energy expenditure. They also answered questions on how tired they were afterwards, how much effort they put in and how much they enjoyed it. Participants . had previously undergone a half hour treadmill test so the researches . could measure how many calories they burned during exertion - and then compared the readings from the armband worn during sex. Men, for example, burned 9.2 calories per minute on the treadmill - but only 4.2 in the bedroom.For women, this fell to 7.1 calories while jogging. And, to help settle another holy grail question, the average recorded session lasted for 24.7 minutes - the shortest being 10 and the longest 57 minutes. While the figures aren't quite the marathon calorie burn some might hope for, they are better than those suggested in previous research. David . Allison, a biostatistician at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, found that the average person burns a mere 21 calories during the average session. He discovered that sex lasted six minutes on average - . 'disappointing, isn't it?' - and that the energy output equated to a . paltry 20 or so calories - about the same as walking. However, if done with enough gusto, sex can still count as 'significant exercise', the Quebec researchers said, reporting in the journal PLOS ONE.","Men burn 4.2 calories a minute and women 3.1, say Canadian researchers .

A Home Office immigration enforcement team broke up a suspected 'sham marriage' at Harrow Registry Office. Two officers are seen here quizzing the 'bride', a 21-year-old Italian woman . Acting on intelligence, which suggested the 'relationship' may not be genuine, officers put a stop to the nuptials and detained the 'bride and groom'. With full co-operation from the Superintendent Registrar, the team intervened and questioned the 23-year-old Sri Lankan, who was found to have overstayed his visa. He had been due to marry a 21-year-old Italian woman. The 'bride' was quizzed by officers and released, while her betrothed was placed on immigration bail while further inquiries take place. He faces being deported from the UK if he is found to have no reason to stay in the country. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: .

Multiple sclerosis is a potentially . disabling disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous . system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. All the nerve fibers in the body are covered with a protective coating called myelin. It works like an insulating cable, helping messages from the brain get to the spinal cord and other parts of the body quickly. In MS, the body's immune system turns inward and starts to attack the myelin. When it becomes damaged, the messages from the brain slow down or have trouble getting through. Depending on where the damage to the myelin occurs, this will affect different parts of the body. Symptoms . can be mild, such as fatigue, or severe, including paralysis, loss of . vision and slurred speech. There is no cure, but treatment can help manage symptoms and . reduce the progress of the disease. It is twice as common in women than men.

Questions are being asked about the preparedness of the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, after it was revealed that there were four attacks on diplomatic targets in the Libyan city in the months leading up to the killing of the U.S. ambassador on Wednesday. Despite President Obama's administration claiming that there was no 'actionable intelligence' before the attack, on June 6th an IED was thrown at the perimeter of the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi and on August 5th, just over a month before the deadly assault an International Committee of the Red Cross building in the city was hit by rocket propelled grenades. 'This (the U.S. Consulate) was a place that was targeted months before with an IED (improvised explosive device),'  said Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House intelligence committee who has been briefed on the attack and investigation. A protester holding his rifle during the assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya on 11th September . He told Fox News, 'It's clearly a target that they wanted to hit and they wanted to cause casualties. ... It's just too many coincidences here'. In addition, on June 11th the British ambassador's motorcade was attacked by grenades, leaving two security personnel injured and on June 18th, armed gunmen attacked the Tunisian consulate and burned its flag. And on Friday the chairman and a ranking member of the Senate homeland security comittee, Joe Lieberman and Susan Collins, issued a letter to the State Department inspector general requesting an investigation into the posture of the U.S. Consulate before the attack. The letter references the attack on the British ambassador in June. 'Does the risk assessment process consider the capacity or lack thereof of the host country to provide security?' says the letter. 'Did the Libyan government request or suggest that security could be improved at the Benghazi facility prior to September 12th, 2010?' Four U.S. citizens died in the attack on the consulate in Benghazi including the U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens . However, a spokesman for the Office of the Director of National INtelligence, repeated the claim that U.S. officials in LIbya were in the dark about the assault. 'Actionable intelligence would have meant that we either saw or heard something, through intelligence collection, that told us that a specific act was being planned or was imminent,' said the spokesman. 'As I have said, we are not aware of any actionable intelligence related to the attack in Benghazi.' The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the National Security Council did not comment when asked if the president was briefed on the four prior attacks before the deadly Benghazi attack. This comes as the U.S. has announced it is sending more spies, Marines and drones to Libya, trying to speed the search for those who killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, but the investigation is complicated by a chaotic security picture in the post-revolutionary country and limited American and Libyan intelligence resources. The CIA has fewer people available to send, stretched thin from tracking conflicts across the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Much of the team dispatched to Libya during the revolution had been sent onward to the Syrian border, U.S. officials say. Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . And the Libyans have barely re-established full control of their country, much less rebuilt their intelligence service, less than a year after the overthrow of dictator Moammar Gadhafi. The U.S. has already deployed an FBI investigation team, trying to track al-Qaida sympathizers thought to be responsible for turning a demonstration over an anti-Islamic video into a violent, coordinated militant attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other embassy employees were killed after a barrage of small arms, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars tore into the consulate buildings in Benghazi on Tuesday, the 11th anniversary of 9/11, setting the buildings on fire. President Barack Obama said in a Rose Garden statement the morning after the attack that those responsible would be brought to justice. That may not be swift. Building a clearer picture of what happened will take more time and possibly more people, U.S. officials said Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation publicly. In a statement posted Saturday on Islamic militant websites, Al-Qaida's branch in Yemen praised the killings and called for more attacks to expel American embassies from Muslim nations, suggesting the terrorist organization is trying to co-opt the angry protests over a film produced in the United States denigrating the Prophet Muhammad. Losses: U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens, . left, and former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty, right, were killed during . Tuesday night's attack . Gone: Diplomat Sean Smith, left, and Tyrone S. Woods, right, were also killed in the melee . Intelligence officials are reviewing telephone and radio intercepts, computer traffic, satellite images and other clues from the days before the attacks — the kinds of material routinely gathered in a conflict zone where al-Qaida affiliates are known to operate — and Libyan law enforcement has made some arrests. But investigators have found no evidence pointing conclusively to a particular group or to indicate the attack was planned, White House spokesman Jay Carney said, adding, 'This is obviously under investigation.' Early indications suggest the attack was carried out not by the main al-Qaida terror group but 'al-Qaida sympathizers,' said a U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly. One of the leading suspects is the Libyan-based Islamic militant group Ansar al-Shariah, led by former Guantanamo detainee Sufyan bin Qumu. The group denied responsibility in a video Friday but did acknowledge its fighters were in the area during what it called a 'popular protest' at the consulate, according to Ben Venzke of the IntelCenter, a private analysis firm that monitors Jihadist media for the U.S. intelligence community. Following the attacks on the U.S. Consulate the CIA and the military are increasing their presence in the region . The U.S. had been watching threat assessments from Libya for months but none offered warnings of the Benghazi attack, according to another intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about U.S. intelligence matters. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, questioned whether the consulate had taken sufficient security measures, given an attempt to attack the consulate in Benghazi a few months ago. Carney said that given the 9/11 anniversary, security had been heightened. 'It was, unfortunately, not enough,' he said. That paucity of resources also applies to the intelligence officers available to monitor Libya on the ground. With ongoing counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen, as well as the civil war in Syria, the CIA's clandestine and paramilitary officer corps is simply running out of trained officers to send, U.S. officials say, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deployment of intelligence personnel publicly. The clandestine service is roughly 5,000 officers strong, and the paramilitary corps sent to war zones is only in the hundreds, the officials said. US Marines carry the caskets during the transfer . of remains ceremony yesterday marking the return to the US of the remains of the . four Americans killed in an attack this week in Benghazi, Libya . Most of the CIA's clandestine and paramilitary team that had worked with Libyan rebels to bring about the fall of Gadhafi is now arrayed at the Syrian border, working with rebels there to try to hasten the fall of Syrian president Bashar Assad, the officials said. The CIA normally hires extra people to make up for such shortfalls, often retired special operators with the requisite security clearance, military training and language ability. But the government mandate to slash contractor use has meant cutting contracts, according to two former officials familiar with the agency's current hiring practices. To fill in the gaps in spies on the ground, the U.S. intelligence community has kept up surveillance over Libya with unmanned and largely unarmed Predator and Reaper drones, increasing the area they cover and the frequency of their flights since the attack on the consulate, as well as sending more surveillance equipment to the region, one official said. The bodies of Americans Sean Smith, Glen A. Doherty, Tyrone S. Woods and Christopher Stevens were taken from a . military transport plane as a military band played . The victims of the attack in the U.S. consulate in Libya are returned to American soil at Andrews Air Force . Base in Maryland yesterday . But intelligence gathered from the air still needs corroboration from sources on the ground, as well as someone to act on the intelligence to go after the targets. The Libyan government, which U.S. officials say is eager to help, has limited tools at its disposal. The post-revolution government has been slow to rebuild both its intelligence capability and its security services, fearful of empowering the very institutions they had to fight to overthrow Gadhafi. They have made a start, but they lack a sophisticated cadre of trained spies and a large network of informants. 'The Libyans in just about every endeavor are just learning to walk, let alone run,' said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official and author of the book 'Intelligence and U.S. Foreign Policy.' 'There is confusion and competing elements within the new provisional government which complicates the task of creating new institutions, including the intelligence service,' he said. U.S. President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton return to their seats after speaking at the repatriation ceremony yesterday . 'There are still some aspects of the intelligence services that still work,' says Barak Barfi of the New America Foundation think tank, including eavesdropping on cellphone calls and spying on computer traffic using equipment from the Gadhafi era. Barfi spent months with members of Libya's transitional government as they tried to rebuild the nation's services and infrastructure. But the Libyans have not yet even taken full command their own security services almost a year after Gadhafi's fall, Barfi said. That's given the tens of thousands of militiamen who helped overthrow Gadhafi the time they needed to organize and seek new targets, especially Western ones, he said.","The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was attacked on June 6th when an IED was thrown over the perimeter .

Hundreds of pregnant women may have had healthy babies aborted after scanning blunders at a top hospital. An investigation found that medics had been using a flawed procedure for scanning women who were at risk of losing their babies. It is feared that many will have been wrongly told they had miscarried and given drugs to terminate the pregnancy. Near miss: Emily Wheatley, 31, was wrongly told by staff that her daughter Ella, now eight monhts old, right, had died when she was nine weeks pregnant. The ‘fundamental error’ in procedure goes back to 2006. Midwives . investigating miscarriages are recommended to use an internal . transvaginal scan which is more accurate than the external Doppler . ultrasound procedure. The . scandal came to light after Emily Wheatley, 31, was told she had . miscarried at nine weeks following investigations at the University . Hospital of Wales in Cardiff. But . when she attended a different hospital for treatment with drugs to . remove the foetus in July 2012, staff carried out a further scan which . revealed a baby’s heartbeat. Miss Wheatley went on to give birth to a . healthy baby but was ‘traumatised’ by the events. Fears: In Ms Wheatley's case the error was spotted, and she gave birth to a healthy baby. But an investigation has raised fears that other women may not have been so lucky . Emily Wheatley yesterday spoke of her despair after being told by a midwife she could not detect a  heartbeat during her first scan. Another midwife repeated the procedure at the University Hospital of Wales, in Cardiff, but concluded she had suffered a silent miscarriage. It was only when she went to Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny that another scan revealed she was still pregnant. Miss Wheatley, of Monmouth,  who is now mother to healthy eight-month-old  Ella was left ‘traumatised’. She said: ‘When I saw the baby clearly on the screen, I couldn’t really believe that the University Hospital of Wales had got it wrong. I feel angry at the decision to not follow a simple process which could have prevented this misdiagnosis.’ Miss Wheatley, who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, added: ‘It’s just unbelievable that there are potentially other women out there who have been diagnosed with having a silent miscarriage. And they potentially have got rid of healthy babies –  that frightens me. ‘Maybe hundreds of babies have been lost because of their decision.’ The . investigation found UHW staff were ‘systematically failing’ to perform . the correct scans on women with suspected early pregnancy loss. A . damning report from Peter Tyndall, the Public Services Ombudsman for . Wales, says well-established clinical guidance was ignored for seven . years. The findings will be ‘extremely disturbing’ for women who have . had terminations in that time, he said. A . spokesman for the Royal College of Gynaecologists,  who issued the . guidelines, yesterday said  almost every unit in England was signed up . and adhering to the recommended procedure. Mr . Tyndall has asked the Welsh Government to check that all health boards . are now complying with the guidance. A helpline received 28 calls . yesterday, of which eight women were ‘immediately reassured’. Failings . were discovered after  a complaint by Miss Wheatley’s mother about her . daughter’s treatment. Apology: Representatvies of Universtiy of Wales Hospital in Cardiff (pictured) have admitted they 'failed' in their duty to Ms Wheatley . 'Systematic failing': Staff at the hospital had been using out-of-date guidelines for pregnancy scans, which led to false diagnoses . The report found that UHW did not tell staff to . carry out the internal scans. Instead they relied on Doppler scans that . in Miss Wheatley’s case could have been ‘potentially dangerous’. Even . when the guidance was re-worded in 2011 to emphasise the need for TV . scans in early miscarriage, the UHW policy went unchanged. Mr Tyndall . criticised the Cardiff and Vale Health Board for not updating its . guidelines and told them to pay Miss Wheatley £1,500 in compensation. Mr . Tyndall said: ‘Were it not for the fortunate circumstance of [Miss . Wheatley] seeking  her post-miscarriage care at  an alternative . hospital, it seems likely that these failings would have resulted in the . medical termination of a healthy, viable pregnancy.’ RCOG spokesman . Siobhan Quenby said: ‘This is a  really big issue because we have to be . 100 per cent certain that a miscarriage has taken place – 97 per cent is . no good for the 3 per cent of women for whom the wrong diagnosis would . be a disaster.’ Cardiff and Vale Health Board said it made an ‘unreserved apology’ to Miss Wheatley.","Women at the University Hospital of Wales were given botched scans, which could have wrongly told them they had miscarried their babies .

"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 19:21 EST, 1 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 1 November 2013 . The extent to which government and insurance companies have fleeced motorists for years was laid bare yesterday. Research by the House of Commons Library found that the cost of vehicle tax and insurance has more than doubled over the past 25 years – even when inflation is taken into account. The combined cost is now a whopping 117 per cent higher in real terms than it was in 1987. War: The figures were condemned by Tory MP Robert Halfon, who blamed 'trendy, anti-car green policies' Motorists face annual bills of up to £490 for vehicle excise duty, when it was just £100 a quarter of a century ago. And insurance costs – an average of £280 in 1987 – are now £652 for fully comprehensive and £1,057 for third-party, fire and theft. The study also found that petrol and oil costs have soared by 64 per cent over the same period. Much of the cost is taken up by fuel duty imposed by government – a levy that is among the highest in Europe. To add to the burden still further, car maintenance costs have gone up by 57 per cent. The research reveals that the only expense to have reduced in recent years is the cost of buying a car in the first place. Vehicles are now, on average, less than half the price they were in 1987 in real terms. Fleeced: The cost of taxing and insuring vehicles has more than doubled in the past 25 years . Tory MP Robert Halfon, a transport campaigner, said the figures confirmed that motorists are being hard hit because of ‘trendy, anti-car green policies’ imposed by politicians. He called on the Chancellor to reduce both vehicle excise duty and fuel duty to help hard-pressed drivers. ‘Motorists are amongst the most hammered taxpayers in Britain,’ he said. ‘Wherever they look, they are hit by one charge or another – whether it is the high cost of fuel, insurance charges, vehicle excise duty or speed cameras. ‘Enough is enough. This is hurting families and businesses. We need radical reform to look at how Britain can afford to get motoring again. ‘We’ve had a culture of environmentalism for the chattering classes who forget about families who need their car to pick their children up from school, and businesses who rely on their car for their living. Cars are a symbol of freedom and shouldn’t be taxed out of existence. I think the Government should be looking at road tolls as long as it guarantees that vehicle excise duty and fuel duty will be reduced.’ Vehicle excise duty was a flat rate of £100 a year in 1987. Now it is charged at a rate depending on a car’s emissions – zero for the least-polluting cars and £490 for the most polluting. The first-year rate for cars in the top band is £1,065. The Commons Library said average car insurance rates were around £280 in 1987 – but are now often four-figure sums. The rise is put down to the fact that there are now more younger drivers – insurance companies  will charge more for third-party insurance because they perceive applicants as a higher risk – and because of a sharp increase in personal injury claims, particularly  whiplash cases. RAC spokesman Simon Williams described the rises in fuel prices as ‘shocking’. ‘The price rise is not just down to inflation and changes in the oil industry, it’s also very much down to the incredible rise in fuel duty charged by the government,’ he said. A spokesman for the AA said: ‘Drivers have felt for many years that they are an easy target for whichever government, local authority or business has wanted to maximise its take.’","Research carried out by the House of Commons Library .

"By . Michael Zennie . PUBLISHED: . 21:09 EST, 28 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:24 EST, 29 October 2013 . An adventurous treasure hunter claims he has found a legendary lost gold mine in the mountains of northeastern Utah - a $1.7billion bonanza first discovered by Spanish priests in 1650 that has laid dormant for more than three centuries. Gary Holt believes that he and his son have found the Josephine de Martinque mine at Hoyt's Peak in the Uinta Mountains - and they only need federal government permission to delve deep enough to claim their prize, the Park Record newspaper reports. The Lost Josephine Mine was fabled to be the richest gold mine in the world. It was first documented by Spanish Jesuit priests in 1650. Discovery: Brandon Holt, pictured, and his father Gary say they have found an abandoned Spanish gold mine from the 1600s . The U.S. Forest Service is skeptical, saying the cavern is likely a natural formation and that it contains no gold deposits . The explorers say they have found calcite semi-precious gemstones in the cavern, but no gold . But U.S. Forest Service officials say the mine is a fairy tale - and treasure hunters are defacing a natural cave and destroying formations that are millions of years old as they search for riches. Mr Holt told the Park Record that he has yet to find gold in the cavern. He obtained a mining permit and said he has so far pulled millions of dollars worth of calcite crystals from the shaft. He markets them as 'Goldite' and says they could become valuable as semi-precious gemstones. So far, though, the spelunking into the cavern has not yet yielded any gold. Mr Holt remains undeterred. In a 2009 post on the treasure hunter forum Ancient Lost Treasures, Mr Holt suggests that the mine could contain $1.7billion in gold. Officials say the 'Goldite' mining operation is little more than a ruse to allow Mr Holt to continue looking for gold. The caver is at the bottom of a deep shaft that Mr Holt and his friends have been exploring for years . This is a 'Goldite' outcropping - calcite that Mr Holt believes he can sell for millions as a semi-precious stone . Revolution: The mine was abandoned by the Spanish in 1680 during the Pueblo Revolt when Indians drove them from their claims in New Mexico . He says the hunt for gold is 'still in active development.' References to the the Lost Josephine Mine first appear in records of Spanish Jesuit priests in 1650. It was said to be the most valuable gold mine in the world. Three decades later, the priests were forced to abandon the mind when the Spanish were driven out of the New Mexico Territory during the 1680 Pueblo Revolution uprising by the Pueblo Indians. The exact location of the mine has been lost ever since. But, Forest Service Archeologist Tom Flanagan, says the the myth of the Lost Josephine Mine being in northeast Utah is nothing but a fairy tale. 'If we had those kinds of gold mines in the Uintas (Mountains), I'd be a rich man,' he told the Park Record. 'A lot of treasure hunters will map on a natural solution cavity and try to purport that it's a historic or ancient mine and then try to mine it.' Location: Other explorers have long believed that the that the lost mine - with untold riches - was located at Hoyt's Peak in northeastern Utah .","Gary Holt, 72, discovered a cavern in the Uinta Mountains of Utah that they believe is an old Spanish mine .

'That bloody Bellisario!’, as Princess Margaret used to . call him, was a constant presence at royal events, taking candid shots of the Queen and her family. Some of the 'Royal collection' were featured in Bellisario's 1972 book To Tread On Royal Toes and also in international media, yet there are many which are previously unseen. The sale of the catalogue, including its copyright, has been organised by Omega Auctions of Cheshire.

Addressing dignitaries such as FIFA president Sepp Blatter, his UEFA counterpart Michel Platini and England manager Roy Hodgson, Prince William said: 'Our national players are role models for millions of young people and I think we need to give those highly pressured and driven players the support and training they need to live up to their rightly exalted status.

It is the age old bedroom dilemma: Do you get down to it, get it over with – or simply not bother at all? Now, Canadian researchers say it’s not as black and white as whether you indulge or not – and the ultimate reason you decide to have sex could heavily influence how happy your relationship is. They say in most cases, it’s better have sex than avoid it – even if you’re not in the mood. Canadian research has found that we're happier in our relationships on the days we have sex. And that it's better to have sex than avoid it - even if you're not in the mood . That's because according to new research, we’re happier in our relationships on the days we have sex. But, more than that, there are two main reasons why couples in a long-term relationship or marriage have sex, the Wall Street Journal reports. ‘One thing we wanted to know is whether it really matters to your partner why you want to have sex, as long as they are getting what they want,' Dr Amy Muise, a psychologist from the University from Toronto, told the WSJ. One is positive (an ‘approach’ goal) – such as to feel closer to a partner. The other is negative (an ‘avoidance’ goal) – basically to avoid an argument or reduce feelings of guilt. The categories are then subdivided again into self-focused or partner-focused, Dr Amy Muise explained to WSJ journalist Elizabeth Bernstein. Dr Muise and her team asked 108 couples . to keep diaries, charting daily their levels of desire and sexual . satisfaction each day. They also had to list the reasons why they had . sex over a two-week period. After they had sex, each partner . answered a questionnaire about their motives – ranging from ‘to make . myself feel better’ to prevent their partner from feeling rejected and . upset. Each was rated on a sliding scale of importance. But having sex out of guilt still doesn't bring as much sexual satisfaction. Even if you think you're doing your partner a favour, your level of desire will affect how much they enjoy it . The . researchers found that when sex is wanted for a positive reason – such . as to increase intimacy – then we feel happier and more satisfied in the . relationship – and this transfers to our partner, increasing their . satisfaction, too. But having sex out of guilt doesn’t bring as much sexual satisfaction – and even if you think you’re doing your partner a favour, your level of desire will affect how much they enjoy it – and how happy they are in the relationship. And contrary to what some people might think, men have guilt sex too. ‘Men do have higher desire in general, but the motives for sex and the way they make people feel aren't different for men and women,’ Dr Muise said. The research is published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.","The reason you decide to have sex - such as to increase intimacy or out of guilt - could heavily influence how happy your marriage is .
Canadian researchers say in most cases, it’s better have sex than avoid it, as we're happier on the days we have sex .
But having sex out of guilt can reduce satisfaction a partner gets from sex ."

The host: Millionaire's daughter Jessica Kennaway has issued an apology after noise from her all-night 18th birthday party was heard three miles away from her Devon home . Even in the best of homes, teenage parties can get a little rowdy. But the one thrown by millionaire’s daughter Jessica Kennaway did more than just upset the next-door neighbours. The all-night bash was so loud it could be heard three miles away. It went on until police arrived at 7am on Sunday to tell Miss Kennaway to turn the music down. And after complaints from angry villagers, the 18-year-old was told by the local council to apologise, although her mother insisted it was ‘just a few people having a bit of fun’. Miss Kennaway organised the extravagant party, which had its own DJ and at least 60 guests, to mark the start of her gap year and a friend’s 18th birthday. It was mostly held outdoors at Escot House, her family’s stately home. But while the secluded Grade II listed mansion is set in 1,100 acres of Devon woodland, the revelry was loud enough to wake residents in three neighbouring villages. They said they had never heard such a din coming from the estate, which has been owned by the Kennaway family for 210 years and for the past ten years has been open to the public, hosting upmarket festivals, weddings and concerts. Allison Britz, who lives a mile away in Feniton, was one of dozens who used Facebook and Twitter to express their disbelief at the level of noise. The 49-year-old sales manager described the party as ‘very selfish’ and said people in the villages of Buckerell and Payhembury, almost three miles away, were also disturbed. ‘We all enjoy a party and no one objects to it once in a while if we are notified about it and it doesn’t go on all night,’ she said. ‘But this was absolutely crazy, the thump-thump-thump of the music went on all night. ‘My six-year-old woke up and asked me what the noise was. 'My niece and her friends who were staying knew all the songs that were being played, it wasn’t just a drone of background noise.’ Mother-of-two Clare Humpreys said she, her daughters and her mother were also kept awake. ‘I barely slept until 5.30am,’ she said. ‘I went on Facebook from around 3.30am and couldn’t believe how many other people were awake because of it.’ Devon and Cornwall Police said officers gave ‘strong words of advice’ when they went to the manor house. Bosses at East Devon District Council, who received complaints about the noise, instructed Miss Kennaway to apologise in person to villagers. The teenager, who is preparing to leave for a nine-month trip to South America, said: ‘I warned all our neighbours about the party and they all seemed fine with it. 'We put the speakers in the direction of the valley to minimise the volume.’ Miss Kennaway, whose 20-year-old sister Olivia is away at university, added: ‘During the course of the night, as everyone became absorbed in the party atmosphere, what started as an acceptable volume level must have crept up. ‘I’ve been back to apologise to some of the farmers and neighbours who were affected by the noise as I didn’t mean to disturb anyone. Venue: Police were called to the home and Escot estate near Ottery St Mary, East Devon, around 4am on Sunday following complaints about the noise . Business: Since the early 2000s the Escot estate has been opened up to the public to help fund repair work of the aging building. The venue hosts weddings, concerts and other events for families . In charge: The house has been owned by the Kennaway family for 210 years with John-Michael Kennaway (pictured) taking over in the 1980s . ‘I . would like to apologise to local residents for not realising that the . volume had reached an unacceptable level and, therefore, for disturbing . their Sunday morning.’ But . Miss Kennaway’s mother, Lucy, 47 – who was aware the party had been . planned and was in the house with her husband John-Michael, 51 – while . it took place, has defended her daughter’s party. ‘It was just a private party and a few people getting together to have a bit of fun,’ she said. Escot House is a privately owned 19th-century country house, and has been the home of the Kennaway family, whose ancestors include Baronets and politicians, for 200 years. Sir John Henry Kennaway, the third Baronet, was conservative Member of Parliament for East Devon and Honiton, between 1870 and 1885. The 220 acre estate was designed by Capability Brown, and the gardens are now open to the public. Since the early 2000s the Escot estate has been opened up to help fund repair work of the aging building. In . addition to the Beautiful Days Festival, which attracts thousands of . revellers every August, the estate boasts several visitor attractions and . hosts conferences, weddings, plays and concerts. ‘Jess ensured that all the neighbours . were aware of the party and warned them a few days before – she’s since . been back to apologise to those affected. ‘The wind meant that the volume and music travelled a lot further than it would usually have, which is very unfortunate. ‘We called her at one point to ask her to turn the music down, which she did right away.’ Escot House, near Ottery St Mary, was built in 1678 and bought by the Kennaway family in 1794. Miss . Kennaway’s ancestors include baronets and MPs. Her millionaire father, . who took over the property in the 1980s, makes his money from fish . farming and from the estate. The original mansion was destroyed by a fire in 1808 and rebuilt to a design by architect Henry Roberts in 1838. It . hosts the Beautiful Days Festival, which attracts thousands of . revellers every August, as well as regular theatre evenings, . conferences, tours and nature days for children. Apology: The teenager, who is preparing to leave for a nine-month trip to South America, said she had apologised to some of the farmers and neighbours who were affected by the noise as she had not meant to disturb them . The party in Escot Park was heard in the nearby villages of Feniton, and Payhembury and Buckerell some three miles away .

To be happy is to be alone – or at least live in some of the most remote parts of the British Isles. By contrast those who live in over-crowded cities like London and Liverpool are more likely to be anxious, unhappy and unsatisfied with life. However experts analysing the wellbeing of the nation reveal the overall happiness of the nation may have been boosted by falling unemployment and the London Olympics. Happy nation: In the last year happiness has increased in Scotland and Northern Island, but have fallen in the south of England . Areas with the highest average ratings for happiness: . 1. Eilean Siar (Western Isles), Orkney and Shetland, Scotland . 2. Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland . 3. Scottish Highlands . 4. Gwynedd, Wales . 5. Perth and Kinross, Scotland . Areas with the lowest average ratings for happiness: . 1. Bedford, Bedfordshire . 2. Merseyside, North West England . 3. Stoke on Trent, West Midlands . 4. North Lanarkshire, Scotland . 5. Caerphilly, Wales . People who live in Orkney, Shetland and Eilean Siar report the highest levels of life satisfaction, self -worth and happiness across the whole of Great Britain, new data shows from the Office for National Statistics. Locals also have very low levels of anxiety, coming second in the table only to Dumfries and Galloway, the ONS said. Dawn Snape, head of personal wellbeing at the ONS, said: ‘It looks like Eilean Siar is the place to be.’ But on a regional basis London had the lowest average rating for life satisfaction and the highest average rating for anxiety, both higher than the UK average. In a breakdown of council areas, people living in Stoke-on-Trent in the West Midlands have the lowest levels of self-worth and life satisfaction. People in the area are also unhappy - reporting the third lowest levels of happiness in the nation behind Bedford and Merseyside. Worthwhile: People living in London and other big cities were less likely to have high levels of life satisfaction . Areas with the highest average ratings for life satisfaction: . 1. Eilean Siar (Western Isles), Orkney and Shetland, Scotland . 2. Scottish Highlands . 3. Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland . 4. Wokingham, Berkshire . 5. Scottish Borders . Areas with the lowest average ratings for life satisfaction: . 1. Stoke on Trent, West Midlands . 2. Inner London . 3. Newport, Wales . 4. Blackburn and Darwen, Lancashire . 5. Torfaen, Wales . Meanwhile, Reading, Milton Keynes and inner London all ranked in the top six worst places for high levels of anxiety. People from Merthyr Tydfil in Wales and Brighton and Hove also have high levels of anxiousness, the ONS said. More than one in five Londoners (22.4 per cent) questioned said they had high anxiety levels. Ms Snape said: ‘London has the most disposable income but very little life satisfaction and very high anxiety.’ People living in the capital could be especially hit by stressful jobs or mortgage problems, analysts said. Ms Snape added: ‘There are huge disparities within London, for instance average life expectancy in Tower Hamlets is 78.8 compared to 84 in Kensington and Chelsea, and we know that health is a really important factor contributing to personal wellbeing.’ Change: Increasing levels of personal wellbeing were blamed on rising employment and the London Olympics . Areas with the highest average ratings for self-worth: . 1. Eilean Siar (Western Isles), Orkney and Shetland, Scotland . 2. Scottish Highlands . 3. Clackmannanshire, Scotland . 4. Moray, Scotland . 5. Anglesey, Wales . Areas with the lowest average ratings for self-worth . 1. Stoke on Trent, West Midlands . 2. Dundee, Scotland . 3. Glasgow, Scotland . 4. Newport, Wales . 5. North Ayrshire, Scotland . The data, which was collated by polling 165,000 people, also paints a picture of wellbeing across the UK. ONS officials asked people to rate how satisfied they are with their lives, how worthwhile they feel their lives are, how happy they feel and how anxious they feel on a scale of zero to 10 - zero being ‘not at all’ and 10 being ‘completely’. They found that the highest proportion of people who gave the top scores for life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness were in Northern Ireland. England had the lowest proportion of people who gave themselves the top scores for happiness and life satisfaction. Meanwhile Scotland appears to be the most laid-back country - having the highest proportion of people who gave themselves very low anxiety scores. The ONS report stresses that the reasons behind the local variations are ‘complex and not yet fully understood’, but it says that the factors most associated with personal wellbeing are health, employment and relationship status.","Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland rate happiness at 7.9 out of 10 .

He was then prescribed powerful painkillers to relieve the agony he felt in his nerve endings . His family yesterday told Stourport Coroners' Court they believe the side-effects of the drugs made him suicidal. Mr Hatcher, who worked as a senior forensic production technician specialising in crime scenes, left his home on July 1 this year after first telling his wife 'I love you.' The inquest heard he left his home in the early morning before walking to nearby Perry Wood Bridge in Defford . Stourport Coroners Court heard he was then hit by a train travelling from Derby to Plymouth. Recording a verdict of suicide, Worcestershire Coroner Geraint William said Mr Hatcher was found at Perry Wood Bridge Defford having been spotted by a train driver.

We both met in January 2008 and married in September 2009. 'We have two children together, Callum who is three and Oscar who is five months old. 'Michael struggled with the constant pain in his hand and was prescribed pain killers and a beta blocker to try and ease the pain.

If he didn’t take the tablets he was in a lot of pain, but if he did the side effects of the pills made him very low. 'The weekend before he died he was his happy normal self, very loving and affectionate. 'We said so many nice things to each other and were even making plans for the future. The morning he died he came up to the bedroom before he left for work and told me that he loved me. 'I told him that I loved him too, that was the last thing we said to each other. 'I am heartbroken and so is his eldest son. He was a very loving man who would do anything for anybody and I am struggling to come to terms with his loss. He was the love of my life.

Nikitta Grender, 19, was raped and then stabbed to death two weeks before she was due to give birth to a baby daughter. Her boyfriend Ryan Morris has now spoken of the difficulties he has faced since his life was ripped apart by his older cousin Carl Whant who killed Miss Grender before setting fire to her flat, in Newport, South Wales.

Ryan Morris (right) has said Nikitta Grender (left), who was murdered two weeks before she was due to give birth, will always be the 'love of my life' Mr Morris said he was looking forward to becoming a father and settling down with Miss Grender before her brutal death . In a documentary to be aired tonight, Mr Morris says: 'She was the love of my life, she . always will be now until the day I die, no matter which way I go in my . life she will always be the love of my life.' Speaking to MailOnline ahead of the documentary's screening Mr Morris, 20, said he was still 'suffering' after his life was drastically altered by Whant. He said: 'I was in work, I was expecting to be a dad, I had the girl that I wanted and I had a great future.' Mr Morris, who has not worked since the murder in February 2011, said he had been looking forward to settling down with Miss Grender. He said: 'I would have married her. I set my eyes on her and she was what I wanted. 'Obviously with her having the baby and us moving in together, I thought that was the last step in that way and then we would have brought up the child. It was all taken away.' Miss Grender was raped and then stabbed to death two weeks before she was due to give birth to a baby daughter . Carl Whant was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in February 2012 for the murder of the teenager . Mr Morris said he is now on anti-depressants and has to take medication for his stomach which developed problems after he stopped eating and drank excessively in the months following Miss Grender's death. Whant was jailed for a minimum of 35 years in February 2012 for the murder of the teenager.

He then set fire to her flat before returning to a party where he had been all night. Whant set fire to Miss Grender's flat before returning to a party where he had been all night . Mr Morris wept in the public gallery after the jury returned their verdict. He had been forced to listen as Whant lied about the night of the double killing by falsely claiming Miss Grender, who he ‘fancied’, had willingly had sex with him. In fact, he had gone to her house at 5am – drunk and high on cocaine – in the full knowledge that Mr Morris was not there. He raped her and stabbed her in the stomach and throat. The court heard that the neck wound killed Miss Grender and the knife to her stomach killed her unborn child, who had already been named Kelsey-May. In six police interviews Whant refused to answer every question about the killings. He later falsely claimed to have taken part in a consensual threesome with Miss Grender and her boyfriend at the couple’s home on the day of the murder. But Mr Morris, 18, told the court: ‘Nothing like that happened. He’s a liar. I’m not into all that, I’d never do that, especially not with my cousin.’ Before the attack, Mr Morris, who had been out drinking with Whant on the night of the killings, had considered his second-cousin to be one of his closest friends and ‘like a brother’. Mr Morris has now told MailOnline he has never been able to grieve properly because Whant has never admitted his crime. He said: 'It makes it ten times worse. We will never be able to grieve because of what he put us through. Miss Grender's family carry her white coffin from St John's Church, Newport, Wales after her funeral service, led by her boyfriend Mr Morris, (front left) and her father Paul (front right) 'He pleaded not guilty in court, he tried dragging me down with him and it makes me ten times worse now and it will have repercussions in the future because of what he said.

Mr Morris told MailOnline that in the months leading up to the murders, he would regularly talk to his cousin about the prospect of becoming a father. He said: 'Obviously I spoke to him, in the months leading up to it I used to talk to Carl, I was expecting to be a dad and he had all that in his mind and for him still to do what he's done is sickening.' Mr Morris said he has stayed in touch with Miss Grender's parents, Paul Brunnock and Marcia Grender, and sometimes sees them during his weekly visits to the cemetery. He said: 'They have gone back into work full time but they are at the other end of the phone. 'I try to go up there to the cemetery twice a week, if not then it's guaranteed once a week.' Mr Morris described his recovery as a 'learning curve', but said he has now stopped drinking and is hoping to return to work at some point in the next year.

"By . Simon Parry . PUBLISHED: . 16:10 EST, 28 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:29 EST, 13 November 2013 . A former community policewoman facing execution for smuggling drugs into Indonesia has revealed how she tried to stop friends and family in Britain discovering she may face the firing squad. Speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday inside one of Indonesia’s toughest jails, Andrea Waldeck, 43, said she had been so appalled at her plight, she could not bear to let loved ones find out. Only close family members were told of her arrest and many friends only found out the truth when she appeared in court in Indonesia’s second largest city Surabaya last week, where prosecutors announced she faced a possible death penalty. Jailed: Former community policewoman Andrea Waldeck (left) is facing execution for smuggling drugs into Indonesia. Above, she is pictured with prison guard Eru inside Medaeng Prison in Surabaya . Waldeck is charged with smuggling 3lb of methamphetamine – known as crystal meth – with a street value of about £100,000 on a flight from China to Surabaya in April. The former Gloucestershire community policewoman and youth worker once gave teenagers advice on staying away from drugs. But she is believed to have fallen into the clutches of an international drug-smuggling syndicate after leaving the UK to teach English in China. In signed statements to police, Waldeck admits smuggling the crystal meth from Guangzhou, China, where she said she was promised £3,100 by a British man she named only as Joe in return for being a mule. But police were tipped off and put her under surveillance when she arrived alone and checked into Hotel 88 in the city centre on April 28. They pounced after she took a call from Joe in China the next day with instructions on who to pass the drugs to. Service: The 43-year-old worked as a PCSO for Gloucestershire Constabulary until she left the force in February 2012 . Officers burst into her room, strip-searched her and found the bags of crystal meth hidden in her bra and underwear and taped to her waist. Waldeck said she had been desperate to keep her situation secret. ‘It wasn’t too difficult at first because I’d been living in China for a year before this happened,’ she said, speaking in the stifling heat of the visitors’ enclosure at Surabaya’s Medaeng prison. ‘I didn’t want my family and friends to find out what had happened. I didn’t contact them or let them know for a long time. But in the end it had to come out.’ Waldeck said she was already reconciled to the fact she might face the death penalty. ‘I’ve known for some time that the offences I’m charged with carry that sentence so it didn’t come as a surprise when it was raised in court,’ she said. Asked how she felt about the prospect of death, she smiled and replied: ‘I’m not a conventional person. I can’t say any more about it than that.’ Wearing an orange prison jacket over her jeans and polo shirt, Waldeck refused to say whether she will plead guilty, although she insisted the outline of the case presented in court last week was ‘bull****’. She said she hoped to have an opportunity to speak out in court. Her next appearance is on Tuesday and prosecutors expect her to be convicted and sentenced within two months. Drugs: Waldeck is charged with smuggling crystal meth on a flight from China to Surabaya in April . ‘I want to write a book about my . experiences here,’ she said. ‘I don’t want anyone else to have to go . through what I’ve been through.’ After her arrest, Waldeck . co-operated with police in a double sting, first meeting a contact who . was arrested as he arrived to collect the drugs from her hotel, and then . flying under police guard with the other suspect to the capital . Jakarta. There, on May 2, Waldeck and the other suspect took part in a further sting, meeting another of the drug syndicate’s members in a Jakarta street where he was arrested after they passed the drugs on to him. Prosecutor Deddy Agus Oktavianto said Waldeck’s co-operation might save her from the firing squad. Last month, Indonesia's Supreme Court upheld the death sentence for grandmother Lindsay Sandiford . But her case mirrors that of Lindsay Sandiford, the British grandmother on death row in Bali for smuggling cocaine in 2012, despite co-operating with a police sting. Waldeck was transferred to . chronically-overcrowded Medaeng prison a month ago, after spending the . first four months after her arrest in police cells in Jakarta. She is the only Western prisoner in Medaeng prison, where she shares a cramped cell with 16 other women.

Her mother Sue Barrett, 64, said her family and Waldeck are being helped by the legal action charity Reprieve. When news of Waldeck’s arrest broke last week, friends in England were stunned. The wife of a police community support officer who worked alongside Waldeck described her an ‘intelligent and conscientious’ woman who devoted her former police career to helping youngsters recognise the dangers of drug use. Sue Bennett, whose husband Ken regularly patrolled the Cheltenham beat with Waldeck, said: ‘The idea she could be involved in something like this is totally out of character. 'The Andrea we knew went out of her way to help youngsters and actively discouraged them from drugs.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Ex-Gloucestershire community policewoman Andrea Waldeck is facing execution for smuggling drugs into Indonesia .

"By . Luke Salkeld . PUBLISHED: . 17:28 EST, 1 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:57 EST, 2 November 2013 . A pet rabbit has apparently become the latest victim of false widow spiders. Only hours earlier one-year-old Molly had been hopping happily around the garden. But she was found dead in her hutch after it was infested by the  poisonous creatures. Recently false widow spiders have put several people in hospital after biting them and even caused a school to be closed temporarily. Victim: The body of the pet rabbit, called Molly, was found next to a spider's web with five false widows crawling around . Molly’s owner Samantha Davies found her dead when she went to feed her two rabbits, Molly and Milly. When the 21-year-old removed Molly’s body, she found a hammock-shaped web and up to five spiders scuttling around the hutch. After using the internet to identify them as false widows, Miss Davies became worried for the safety of her 18-month-old daughter, Rosie. She contacted her local environmental health department in the hope of having her home treated for infestation. Her request was declined, but  an officer told her he was 98 per cent certain the spider was responsible for Molly’s death. Yesterday Miss Davies, a kitchen assistant, said: ‘We couldn’t believe it when we saw the spiders. I was really upset when Molly died. Devastated: Samantha Davies, 21, pictured with her 18-month-old daughter Rosie and partner Scott Barnes, was told by an environmental health officer he was 98 per cent certain the pet's death was caused by the spiders . ‘I really didn’t want the spiders around my daughter. We asked environmental health if they could help us, but they refused. ‘If it had been a rat, they would have done something, but not with poisonous spiders.’ Miss Davies, who lives with her partner Scott Barnes and their daughter in Mountain Ash, South Wales, has since disinfected the hutch where Milly still lives, and killed the spiders she found last weekend. Venomous: The false widow spider has caused a school to be closed and has left people with horrific injuries after the attack in recent weeks . The false widow is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known to be in Britain and cases of people being bitten by the venomous creature have been on the rise. John Catlin, 66, from Bromley, Kent, is still recovering a year after a bite that caused his organs to start shutting down. Bodybuilder Gary Meadows from Teesville, Middlesbrough, required a skin graft when he was bitten in 2011 and has suffered severe reactions to any insect bite since. Layla Benton, 14, was off school  for three weeks after her knee swelled up when she was bitten in her bathroom in Basildon, Essex. And last month Dean Academy in Lydney, Gloucestershire, had to close its doors to pupils after the dangerous spiders were found there. The spiders are shiny and black with distinctive cream markings on the abdomen that resemble a horseshoe – or, to some eyes, a skull. They have long, spindly legs and  are easily confused with the black widow, a far more venomous cousin not found in Britain. As with most species of spider, it is the female false widow which is the force to be reckoned with. Males tend not to grow much bigger than two centimetres, while females reach up to three centimetres. The first false widow is thought to have come to Britain  from the Canary Islands or Madeira in the 1870s in a bunch of bananas. The first recorded sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879.","Samantha Davies, 21, found Molly's body lying next to a spider's web .

'When my partner Clive and I moved here there was one white papier mache teapot on display in the window and it looked awful,' she said. 'I tried putting plants there but that didn't look right either, so I started collecting teapots from charity shops and car boot sales and anywhere else I saw them. I have got teapots like ducks, fish, chickens, cats, mice, pigs and a horse. 'None of them are particularly valuable - although there is an original 17th century Chinese one which is worth about £200.

Police civilian worker Furqaan Mohmed, 21, and 30-year old Mohammed Usman Patel challenged each other to a two mile road duel whilst driving their Vauxhall Astras through a town centre. However, disaster struck as a BMW car unwittingly veered into their path as the pair roared alongside each other on the wrong side of the road towards a red light. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: CCTV footage shows the moment young drivers Furqaan Mohmed and Mohammed Patel raced each other through the streets of Bolton, Greater Manchester at speeds of up to 80mph before a crash which left two pedestrians fighting for their lives . Race: Police civilian worker Mohmed, 21, and 30-year-old Patel had challenged each other to a two mile road duel whilst driving their Vauxhall Astras through the town centre . Caught: The race between the two drivers was captured on CCTV cameras as the pair roared alongside each other on the wrong side of the road towards a red light . Their cars ploughed into the BMW, causing Patel’s Astra to spin out of control and collide with a parked Audi A3 as it mounted a kerb. Before the Astra could come to a stop, it struck 12-year-old schoolboy Raheem Hussain as he walking home after an evening of prayers at the mosque. The car then smashed into a bus shelter, hitting a 51-year-old pedestrian and flinging him under another vehicle parked nearby. A court heard that as witnesses tended to the injured, the drivers were overheard laughing, with one saying to the other: 'We will never race again.' It emerged the incident occurred whilst Patel was banned from driving. Raheem suffered a bleed and swelling . to his brain and multiple breaks to his leg, causing doctors to fear at . one stage that they would have to amputate it. He . was kept in a medically induced coma for three weeks and underwent an . operation to save his leg and a blood transfusion.

Saleem Mogradia was in hospital for two weeks with a fractured arm . which needed metal plates, broken ribs and a punctured lung. Aftermath: A 12-year-old boy and a 51-year-old market trader were left with serious injuries when the racing drivers hit a BMW which caused Patel's Astra to spin out of control and mount the the pavement before hitting them both . Victim: Schoolboy Raheem Hussain suffered a bleed and swelling to his brain and multiple breaks to his leg, causing doctors to fear that they would have to amputate it . He later revealed he had to quit his job after the injury and said: 'This incident has had a huge impact. All my independence and dignity has gone.' Two other people suffered minor injuries in the huge impact. Today at Bolton Crown Court, Patel and Mohmed, both of Bolton, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Patel also admitted perverting the course of justice, driving whilst disqualified and driving without insurance. Patel was jailed for three years and 10 months, while Mohmed was sentenced to two years and eight months. Both were banned from driving for four years. Jailed: Both Mohammed Patel, left, and Furqaan Mohmed, right, admitted causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Patel also admitted perverting the course of justice, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance. Both were given prison sentences and banned from driving . Mohmed who worked as a Greater Manchester Police Operational Support Officer at Farnworth police station has since been dismissed from his job. A third man Mohammed Vohra, 20, also of Bolton, who falsely claimed to be driving Patel’s car, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to six months, suspended for 18 months. He was also ordered to carry out 100 hours unpaid work. The crash took place at around 11.30pm on Sunday, July 21, after Patel and Mohmed, spotted each other at the wheel of their cars by chance and began racing for a lark. Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, said: 'The two vehicles were first seen travelling at about 70mph even though it has a 50mph limit. One driver said two vehicles overtook him and carried on straight through the red light. Carnage: Damage caused to one of the two Astra's in the crash on July 21 . Unwitting: Disaster struck when the Astras driven by Patel and Mohmed hit a BMW 320, causing Patel's car to spin out of control . 'A bus driver caught the cars speeding along side by side on its CCTV. The driver estimates they were going at around 80mph in a built-up area and another driver heard the screeching of tyres. The cars were side by side.' The court was told that one female driver, who saw both vehicles veering towards her on the wrong side of the road, said to herself 'I’m dead', before slamming her car into reverse and mounting the pavement to get out of the way. Mrs Thomas said: 'Another witness saw two cars side by side undertake her vehicle along a bus lane. They appeared to be going very fast and were clearly racing.' As the cars reached a junction they overtook another moving vehicle and hit the BMW, which was emerging from a side street. Vohra was initially treated by police as the driver of Patel’s Astra after he tried to cover for Patel, who was disqualified from driving. This meant Patel was not tested for alcohol or drugs at the scene. The court heard he had previous convictions for driving without insurance, using a mobile phone at the wheel of his car and driving across a pedestrian crossing and had been banned under the totting up procedure. Mohammed Nawaz, mitigating for Patel, said: 'There wasn’t any element of the two of them meeting through a pre-arranged meeting to race. 'This was a chance meeting. Then through utter foolishness and stupidity they egged each other on. 'Perhaps only through luck and good fortune no one has died. He is ashamed of his actions and wrote a letter of apology to the victims. 'He is exceptionally contrite about the suffering he has caused. Smash: Patel's Astra mounted a curb, striking 12-year-old Raheem and flinging Saleem Mogradia under a nearby parked car . Danger: Judge Timothy Clayson told the pair they had driven as if they were 'invincible', and had deliberately ignored the rules of the road . 'He wants to say that no one was laughing at the scene of the collision, he said that did not occur.' In a statement read to the court Mohmed said: 'I never set out to cause so much trouble. 'I think about it every day and every night. I know what people think of me when I am walking in my area. I hope they don’t think of my family in the same way.' Passing sentence, Judge Timothy Clayson said: 'You decided to race each other in your cars through the built-up streets of Bolton. The truly horrifying CCTV shows how dangerous your driving was and you caused the crash.' He added: 'You drove as if you were invincible. You caused injury to a young boy who suffered a serious brain injury and fractures which almost required amputation and time in a medically induced coma. They are possibly life-changing consequences. 'No words better describe the way you were driving than driving with a deliberate decision to ignore the rules of the road and the great danger caused to others. You do now understand the distress and unhappiness you have caused to so many people.' Speaking after the hearing Sergeant Danny Byrne said: 'To say that it is fortunate nobody was killed as a result of this collision and more importantly Mohmed and Patel’s appalling driving is a complete understatement. 'The manner of their reprehensible driving was a tragedy waiting to happen: they were using the roads as a racing track, showing nothing but contempt for other road users and members of the public.'","Furqaan Mohmed, 21, and Mohammed Patel, 30, jailed for horror crash .

From Tony 'Scarface' Montana's 'little friend' - the M16 rifle - to Dirty Harry's Magnum ('the most powerful handgun in the world'), guns and glamour have often gone hand in hand on the big screen. But now the firearms have been cast in a new light, as these X-ray images show. The intimate workings of some of cinema’s most iconic weapons, including James Bond's Walther PPK, have been revealed by British artist Nick Veasey in an attempt to 'deglamorise' guns - by reducing them to the status of scientific specimens. These X-rays were made by British artist Nick Veasey in an attempt to 'deglamorise' guns - by reducing them to the status of scientific specimens. Above, the M16 entered the United States Army service in 1963 and featured in the film Scarface . 'Say hello to my little friend'... A memorable line uttered by Al Pacino, as .

Veasey was unable to guarantee that the weapons X-rayed for the series were the exact models used in the films since many of the guns have been handled so widely, but they are in all cases the correct model . The 51-year-old used his signature X-ray . technique (combining photography and radiology) on firearms ranging from the tiny Derringer used to . assassinate Abraham Lincoln to the M60 wielded by John Rambo in the . film First Blood. 'If you’re at your most . impressionable age and you’re in with the wrong crowd, what gets you . into serious trouble?,' the artist said. 'If . you get into a punch-up, you can usually walk away from that, whereas . if you use a gun, it’s likely to affect the rest of your life, one way . or another. 'That’s the cycle we’re trying to break. They’re not glamorous, they’re machines for killing people.' The . most famous gun in the series is undoubtedly James Bond’s Walther PPK, . given a clear 'personality' when 007 turns, looks and fires the gun in . the opening sequence of the films. Above, James Bond's iconic Walther PPK, which featured in 007 films including From Russia With Love and Goldfinger . Sean Connery as James Bond, with the Walther PPK.

'If you get into a punch-up, you can usually walk away from that, whereas if you use a gun, it's likely to affect the rest of your life, one way or another,' Veasey said . Yet this is the same gun Hitler used to commit suicide with in the Fuhrerbunker - gifted to him as a present by Carl Walther himself as a thank-you for allowing him to arm the German army. The series features other famous cinematic guns including the Magnum 45, as used by Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry, Terminator’s Spas 12 and the M16 model brandished by actor Al Pacino as he utters the famous line: 'Say hello to my little friend!' in Scarface. The weapons were sourced from an armorer who provides guns to the cinema industry and were delivered to Veasey’s studio in Maidstone, Kent, by two handlers in an armoured van. Veasey was unable to guarantee that the weapons X-rayed for the series were the exact models used in the films since many of the guns have been handled so widely, but they are in all cases the correct model.

A Heckler & Koch UMP .45 was used in the film Bad Boys II (2003) 'For the film, they take away the . gun’s ability to fire a bullet, but it does fire a blank, so when you . pull the trigger it goes bang and a flash of light and puff of smoke . comes out the end,' Veasey said. 'What we’ve done to make them look authentic is reactivated them digitally. 'What they do is weld up the barrel, so we take that away and return the firing pin and we used live ammo. The M1 Garand featured in the 1998 film Saving Private Ryan.

The single-barrelled version appears in the films Wild Wild West and Back to the Future Part 3, and was most famously used in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . The Anschutz hunting rifle was used by Eric Borel, a French high-school student who, at the age of 16, murdered his family in Toulon in 1995. He later shot dead 12 others and injured four in the village of Cuers . 'We asked them how they deactivate the guns and then they’ve guided us through the process of retouching them as they would be live.' Asked which of the guns is his favourite, Veasey nominates the assault rifles, which he says are 'beautiful things to behold, but scary in the implications of what they can do.' A close friend of Veasey lost her teenage son to a gun and the artist is hoping that his images encourage teenagers to steer clear of firearms. 'We’re trying to make them look like scientific specimens, almost like a slab on the morgue,' Veasey added. 'Hopefully people will actually look at how they work and think, ""If I pick it up and pull the trigger, bullets come out of it"", rather than, ""If I pick it up, I’m going to be like Rambo or a character from Call of Duty"".'

Gerardo Hernandez became the first TSA officer killed in the line of duty Nov. 1 when a man authorities say held a grudge against his agency pulled a rifle from a bag and opened fire at the airport's Terminal 3.

Some 500 people turned out on Tuesday to honor Hernandez at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, including the two agents who were wounded. The nearly two-hour memorial began with a solemn eulogy offered by the Rev. Paul Griesgraber, who quoted Psalm 23. It was followed by a soulful rendition of 'Amazing Grace' that was performed by a chorus of blue-uniformed TSA officials. As the group sang, some in the audience of law enforcement officers, firefighters, military personnel and others wiped tears from their eyes. Those who attended included U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca and Mayor Eric Garcetti.

He was the perfect person to have around to lighten the mood of travelers and TSA agents during stressful times, several colleagues said. 'His charisma was contagious,' recalled fellow TSA Officer Lisandro Jimenez. Hernandez, who joined the TSA in 2010, was checking passenger IDs and boarding passes when he was shot.

As he was working, a gunman walked up, pulled a semi-automatic rifle from a duffel bag and shot him at point-blank range, then shot him again as he lay wounded, authorities have said. Paul Ciancia remains hospitalized but his condition was upgraded Tuesday from critical to fair. He has been charged with crimes that could get him the death penalty. The 23-year-old unemployed motorcycle mechanic had a handwritten letter stating he made the conscious decision to try to kill multiple TSA officers and 'instill fear in your traitorous minds,' according to authorities.

The ceremony concluded with the choir singing 'America The Beautiful.' Born in El Salvador, Hernandez moved to the United States when he was 15.

They believe the benefits of video gaming may also prove helpful in therapeutic interventions targeting psychiatric disorders. In order to examine how video games affect the brain, scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and Charité University Medicine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus, asked adults to play Super Mario 64 for 30 minutes a day over a period of two months. A control group did not play the game and the researchers measured brain volume using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. They found that in comparison to the people who did not play video games, the regular gamers showed increases of grey matter, in which the cell bodies of the nerve cells of the brain are situated. This growth was seen in the right hippocampus, right prefrontal cortex and the cerebellum.

'While previous studies have shown differences in brain structure of video gamers, the present study can demonstrate the direct causal link between video gaming and a volumetric brain increase,' said study leader Simone Kühn, senior scientist at the Centre for Lifespan Psychology at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. 'This proves that specific brain regions can be trained by means of video games,' he added. Dr Kühn and her colleagues believe that video games could be used as therapy for patients with mental disorders, in which brain regions are altered or reduced in size, such as schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s dementia. Psychiatrist Jürgen Gallinat, co-author of the study at Charité University Medicine St. Hedwig-Krankenhaus, said: 'Many patients will accept video games more readily than other medical interventions.'","German researchers found gaming can cause increases in the brain .

It isn't every day that The Queen drives past your front door and the grins on the faces of this excited family were only rivalled by that of the monarch as she cruised through Brixton in her Bentley. Smiling and waving as she rolled through South London, the Queen was spotted by the woman and two children as she rolled past the steps of their home on her way to an  inner city riding centre. Joined by daughter-in-law the Duchess of Cornwall, the monarch, still a keen rider herself at 87, was visiting the Ebony Horse Club and Community Riding Centre in gang-ridden Brixton. Scroll down for video . Nice to see you: The Queen waves to locals as she travels through the streets of Brixton in her chauffeur-driven Bentley with the Duchess of Cornwall yesterday . Are we nearly there yet? The Queen and The Duchess of Cornwall drive past an excited family in Brixton . Once she arrived at the centre, she watched local youngsters give a demonstration of their skills on horseback - and even play a little polo in a sawdust ring overlooked by tower blocks. Her daughter-in-law, Camilla, is president of the organisation which gives disadvantaged children from the London suburb, blighted by crime and rioting, a pastime away from the streets. Chatting to volunteers the monarch joked: 'It’s difficult to get them to do anything – children and horses.' She . added: 'It’s all about temperament'. On this it was not entirely clear . which she was referring to, although one suspects she meant both. Cheers: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived together and were greeted by a welcoming crowd . All smiles: The Queen, who looked cheerful in coral pink, smiled broadly as she was shown around the stables . The . two senior royals had made their way from Buckingham Palace through . several gritty housing estates in a chauffeur driven a Burgundy Bentley . before they arrived at the centre, which is situated in the heart of . bustling Brixton. Dressed in a geranium wool crepe coat trimmed with . gilt buttons over a contrasting salmon-coloured dress, the Queen was . clearly impressed by what she saw. After being introduced to its . founder, Ros Spearing, their host for the morning, she went straight to . meet some of the children the club has helped and their favourite . mounts. First was Kamina Edmundson-Brown, 18, whose love of horses . inspired by Ebony has now developed into a full-time career. She is . currently studying at the Royal Veterinary College. She was holding . the reins of one of the children’s favourite ponies, an 11-year-old . black and white Irish Cobb called Buddy, who had been picked for his . gentle temperament. 'I really don’t think he will do anything to embarrass us,' she said. The . Queen asked her where she lived and how long she had been riding and . sounded particularly impressed at Kamina’s choice of career. Double act: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived to the sound of applause from onlookers . 'He’s wonderful, very smart' said the Queen gesturing to Buddy. 'My heart was in my mouth,' Kamina said afterwards. Camilla, . wearing tartan Edina Ronay, was meanwhile making friends with the help . of a large bag of mints she had taken from her pocket. 'I think he’s my now favourite, he’s terrific,' she said of Buddy, who began to nudge her for more sweets. The . Queen also talked intently to 13-year-old Cameron Chapman and was . fascinated to learn that he lived in Kemble House, one of the run-down . tower blocks overlooking the centre. Demonstration: The royal guests were treated to a display of horsemanship before enjoying a tour of the school . Day out: The Queen beams as she watches the young riders at the Ebony Horse Club show their stuff . 'What you mean he lives up there?' she said gesticulating to the building. Cameron told the Queen that he had been riding for two years and that it had changed his life. He . said afterwards: 'I saw them building the centre and came down every . day to stand at the gates and bug them. I had never seen a horse before . but offered to do the sweeping up, all their odd jobs, anything to be . involved. 'Now I am here every spare minute I can. It’s really . changed my life. There’s not a lot to do round here, all my friends hang . around on the streets. People get into a lot of trouble. I am just . here, though.' He added: 'I’m really surprised she [the Queen] is coming to Brixton. It is full of trouble.' Impressed: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall appeared to enjoy the performance . Looks like fun: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall enjoy a virtuoso display from the Ebony Horse Club . Camilla, . meanwhile, was plying some of the other ponies with mints, prompting . the stable’s oldest resident, Marmalade, a 15-year-old Welsh Cob, to . bare her teeth in delight. 'The Duchess remarked she must be an old . lady but I told her there was still a lot of life in her,' said Safia . Fajemissin-Kham, 11. Among the other riders the Queen chatted with was Oulwakarede Asunloye, eight. He . said afterwards: 'She asked me whether my picture was up on the wall . [with the other success stories] and I told her that I had only had four . lessons. She said: ""I think it will be one day"".' The royal visitors . were then introduced to the families of two local boys, both of whom . were involved in the club but lost their lives in random acts of . appalling violence – Nathan Foster, who was shot in 2006, and Junior . Nkewelle, who was just 15 when he was stabbed last  September. The . Queen told Nathan Foster’s sister, Shanelle: 'It is a very unusual place . [referring to the location of the club] but what a good idea.' Visit: The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall walk side by side through the menage at Ebony Horse Club . 'I can’t believe she is here, let along spoke to me. It has been totally surreal,' she said. 'The . wonderful thing about riding is that is doesn’t matter who you are or . what you have done. 'The horse doesn’t know anything about you and . doesn’t care. You aren’t being judged. And if you don’t concentrate on . that horse then it will throw you or run off.' After touring the . stables the Queen and Camilla took their seats on a dais to watch a some . of the club's  riders go through their paces, including taking a few . jumps and even demonstrating a little basic polo. Afterwards the Queen chatted to the youngsters and volunteers including Jody Thorsby, 34, who works in PR. Miss Thorsby said: 'The Queen said: ""They aren’t your typical polo ponies, are they, but they have a lot of spirit.""' Surrounded: Camilla gets to know a group of the Ebony Horse Club's equine residents and their riders . Ebony . started 17 years ago when a lone volunteer, Ros Spearing, took five . children across London on public transport to go riding. Her aim was . to help them improve their life skills, education and aspirations by . providing access to horse riding, outdoor activities and mentoring. By . 2006 more than 80 youngsters were involved and two years ago the club . opened permanent stables for 135 in Coldharbour Ward, Brixton, one of . the most deprived neighbourhoods in Britain and in the top 15 wards in . London for crime. Many of the club members have never seen, let alone . sat, on a horse and are often children with special educational needs, . those at threat of expulsion and exclusion from school or in general . need of support. They are taught skills including punctuality, . regular attendance, commitment to improvement and team work in addition . to developing a love of riding.

And with a career spanning seven decades, a glamorous wife, half a dozen adoring children and an OBE to his name, audiences could be forgiven for thinking that Sir Bruce Forsyth hasn't got a care in the world. But as the 85-year-old entertainer continues to delight viewers in his current role on Strictly Come Dancing, it has been revealed that he is also nursing his first wife as she battles with dementia. The presenter has been caring for first wife Penny Calvert, 83, since 2008, when the former dancer’s health deteriorated to such an extent that she was moved to a residential care home. Sadness: Bruce and Penny in 1961. The veteran entertainer has been a regular visitor to his ex-wife's nursing home, where she has been treated for dementia since 2008 . And despite divorcing 40 years ago Sir Bruce remains a frequent visitor at the Kent care where Penny now lives and is apparently determined to keep her involved in family life. His daughter Julie - his second child . with Penny– has spoken of her father's ongoing commitment to his former wife even as here health deteriorated. Speaking to the Daily Mirror she said: 'It has become impossible to care for her anymore. My father and I continue to visit her. She might not recognise us anymore but we won’t forget her.’ Such is Sir Bruce's loyalty to Penny was received as a guest of honour at a special Mother's Day party at his Surrey home in 2009 where he presented her with a bouquet of flowers. The event was attended by Sir Bruce's current wife Wilnelia, 54, all six of his children, eight grandchildren and two great grandchildren - his second wife Anthea Red fern, 65 even telephone to offer her good wishes. Julie, 55, added: ‘We stood in a line for a photo and . as I glanced around me, at my sisters, my half-sisters, half-brother, . step-mother and mother, it struck me that this was probably my father’s . greatest achievement. How it was: Bruce fathered three children with Penny before their divorce in 1973 . Dancing sensations: Bruce and Penny in their dancing gear in 1961 . ‘To . have three wives and six children who adore him and get along, without . acrimony, rows or bitterness, is extraordinary. We are like a huge, . extended family. When we arrived, he gave the women a bouquet of . flowers. It was so typical of Dad’ But Penny did not appear in the family photograph and has rarely been seen in public since her split from Sir Bruce in the seventies. She was also guest at her ex-husband's 80th birthday party in 2008 but after suffering a stroke that year was forced to move into residential care. A source close to the legendary entertainer told the Mirror that despite two subsequent marriages Sir Bruce has remained close contact with his former wife and has been saddened by her illness. The source said: 'Penny and Bruce divorced a long time ago but things heal over with time and considering there are three marriages involved in his life, everyone is very friendly and civilised. 'It is a testament to his current wife, Wilnelia, that Bruce has such a wonderful and close family, which includes Penny.' Second time lucky: Bruce would go on to marry his Generation Game hostess, Anthea Redfern, with whom he has two daughters . Penny and Bruce met at the Windmill Theatre in London and became a song and dance double act before going on to marry in 1953. They . had three daughters together, Julie, Debbie, 55, and Laura, 51, but . their 20 years of marriage were wracked by the pressures of Bruce's . growing fame - and repeated infidelities. The pair finally parted company in 1973 after a decade of living apart lat the . same year he married former Generation Game hostess Anthea Redfearn, . with whom he would have two daughters before their eventual divorce six years later. Bruce . then married Puerto Rican former Miss World Wilnelia Merced – who is 32 . years his junior – in 1983, three-years after they met while judging . the 30th annual Miss Work pageant at London’s Royal Albert Hall. No sign of slowing down: Bruce, left,  with Strictly co-star Tess Daly, and right, in concert at the Symphony Hall in Birmingham in May this year . Happy couple: Bruce with his third wife, former Miss World Wilnelia Merced who he married 20 years ago, sources close to the star have credited her with helping him maintain close relationships with his ex-wives . Four years later she gave birth to his first and only son, Jonathan. The presenter has previously opened up about the strain his frequent touring would put on his first marriage. ‘Sadly, such prolonged absences eventually put a great strain on our marriage,’ he said. ‘There are always temptations. Whether you take them or not is up to you.

Seven people have been arrested by police investigating alleged abuse at a care home where residents were apparently locked in an unheated 'quiet room' overnight. The four men and three women were held on suspicion of mistreating or failing to properly look after people with learning difficulties. Devon and Cornwall Police launched the investigation in November 2011 after reports that vulnerable adults were being poorly treated at the Veilstone care home near Bideford. Residents at Veilstone Care Home (pictured), near Bideford, were allegedly locked overnight in an unheated room which contained only a blow-up mattress, a chair and a CCTV camera . The Care Quality Commission (CQC) also carried out unannounced visits and issued its owners with a formal warning for failing to meet welfare standards. They raised concerns about a 'quiet room' where residents spent time or slept overnight, while being monitored by a surveillance camera, describing it as 'unsuitable'. The report states how care workers told inspectors residents were 'verbally prompted or physically assisted' into the room. Inspectors discovered the unheated room contained nothing more than an armchair, an air mattress and a security camera. The report states: 'The window was locked, so there was no ventilation in the room if the door was closed, and there was no curtain or other window covering to promote privacy (the room is on the ground floor and can easily be looked into).' It goes on to say: 'We were told by the manager that the ""quiet room"" was used as a place for people to relax but it had no features of a relaxing, calming nature, as it lacked any form of stimuli and was stark and cold.' One of the residents who allegedly faced abuse at Veilstone had suffered abuse at the scene of Britain's worst care home scandal, Winterbourne View, in Bristol. The CQC also carried out unannounced visits at Veilstone and issued its owners with a formal warning for failing to meet welfare standards . The seven people arrested yesterday have been questioned and bailed in relation to offences under the Mental Health Act. The . alleged abuse is said to have taken place at a number of cares homes in . Devon run by Atlas Project Team Limited, which is no longer in . operation. Alison Millar a . specialist lawyer in abuse claims from law firm Leigh Day, who . represents clients from the Winterbourne View care home and Veilstone, . said: 'We are currently acting on behalf of a number of residents at . homes run by the Atlas Group in relation to abuse allegations. 'The . allegations we have heard make us believe this could be one of the . worst incidents of abuse towards vulnerable adults in residential care . and, moreover, that the abuse at Winterbourne View, which was shockingly . exposed by Panorama, was not just an isolated occurrence but a symptom . of a more systematic problem in the care sector. Solicitors representing residents at Veilstone and Winterbourne (pictured) have said the allegations suggest a 'systematic problem in the care sector' 'We . would encourage anyone with further information on the homes to come . forward and speak to the police to assist the ongoing investigation.' At . the time of the CQC inspections, Ian Biggs, deputy director of CQC in . the South, said the care methods were 'old fashioned' and 'stuck in the . past'. 'The allegations we have heard make us . believe...that the abuse at . Winterbourne View...was not . just an isolated occurrence but a symptom of a more systematic problem . in the care sector' - Lawyer Alison Millar, of Leigh Day . The arrested men are aged 38, 39, 42 and 67, while the women were aged 24, 26 and 28. All have since been released on police bail until March while investigations continue. Detective Inspector Steve White said: 'Throughout the investigation the safety, welfare and protection of vulnerable adults has been and remains the absolute priority of all the organisations involved. 'Due to the nature of the enquiry and complex needs of the victims this investigation will take many months. 'Throughout this time the police will continue to work closely with all agencies involved and the victims and families of those affected will receive ongoing support.'

A British drug mule has been jailed for 10 years in Japan after the country's Supreme Court overturned an earlier acquittal. Geologist Robert Geoffrey Sawyer, 56, claimed he did not know he was carrying 5.5lb of illegal stimulants - which have not been identified - in his luggage when he arrived at Tokyo's Narita Airport after a flight from Benin, Nigeria. The about-turn of the verdict has cast a spotlight on Japan's recently-reformed legal system. Robert Geoffrey Sawyer's case was heard at Tokyo's Supreme Court, pictured. Judges agreed with a lower court ruling that he knowingly smuggled drugs into Japan . Lawyer's first trial was heard under what is known as the new 'lay judge system' in which a panel made up of members of the public take on the role of inquiring judges, guided by three professionals. The judges, hearing how the stimulants were allegedly found in Sawyer's luggage when he arrived at Narita airport in 2010, found him not guilty, pointing out they could not be sure that he knew the package he was carrying contained drugs. Prosecutors disagreed with the 'laymen's' verdict and took the case to the High Court, where Sawyer's acquittal was overturned. Then the Supreme Court confirmed the High Court's decision, judges agreeing that Sawyer was a knowing drug mule and had almost certainly received directions from his handlers. 'A smuggling organisation usually gives a carrier instructions for how to return the luggage, regardless of whether or not it tells the person' that its contents were contraband, said the judges in a ruling posted on the Supreme Court's website. The ruling added: 'The defendant had no company for the trip and no reservations for accommodation as of his arrival in Japan. Sawyer flew from Nigeria to Japan where he was arrested . Sawyer was arrested after he got off a flight from Nigeria to Tokyo's Narita Airport, pictured . 'He also says he had no plans to meet anyone and no itinerary while in Japan. 'It would not be easy for a smuggling organisation to collect stimulant drugs from a person displaying such behaviour.' As well as being sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, Sawyer was fined five million yen (about £30,000). The new law under which Sawyer was first acquitted was introduced in 2009 for certain serious convictions. Before then, crimes were heard by a panel of professionals with no provision for trial by a jury made up of members of the public. The lay judge system has come under criticism for the powers that it holds. It is able to decide on both the verdict and sentence - and on one occasion in 2010 handed down the death penalty to a defendant who was a minor under local law.","Robert Geoffrey Sawyer, 56, has been through Japan's entire legal system from a laymen court to the Supreme Court of appeal in Tokyo .

With her mouse-brown curls and shy grin, the pretty girl in the seventh row of the black and white school photo bears little resemblance to the pouting blonde bombshell she would become. But she does have a glint in her eye that suggests she knew she was heading for greater things. In 1941, when the class photograph was taken, the future Marilyn Monroe was Norma Jeane Baker; just another pupil at Ralph Wardo Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles. Can you spot her? Norma Jeane Baker appears in this 1941 Ralph Wardo Emerson Junior High School class photograph. The 15-year-old was just a shy brunette at the Los Angeles school. She would go onm to become Marilyn Monroe - the most famous female screen star of the twentieth century . With curly brown hair and a shy grin, Norma Jeane Baker is far from the spotlight in this old school photo, which auction house Bonhams expect to sell for around £7,000 . The photograph, which is to be auctioned . next month, bears an inscription on the back by the then 15-year-old . Norma Jeane, dedicating it to a classmate of hers named George, a friend . she describes as a 'super swell fellow'. On the back of the 24-inch print the future film star wrote: 'To ""Georgie"". A super, swell fellow, in fact really keen! (I really mean it Geo.) Norma Jeane Baker.' The black and white photo, which is now being sold by a private collector, is expected to sell for $9,000 (£5,900) when it is auctioned by Bonhams in Los Angeles on May 5. It was taken in the summer of 1941, a year before Monroe married her neighbour's son, Jim Dougherty, in a bid to avoid having to go into care when her guardians moved away. She signed with 20th Century Fox in 1945, Columbia Pictures in 1948, and by 1952 was being described by Life magazine as 'the talk of Hollywood'. The 1953 film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, featuring her famous rendition of Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend, cemented Marilyn Monroe's celebrity, and smash hit soon followed smash hit. Norma Jeane Baker was just another pretty student at the high school in Los Angeles in the summer of 1941 - a decade later she was well on her way to global stardom . Lucy Carr, a specialist in entertainment memorabilia at Bonhams, said: 'Marilyn had a famously difficult childhood and the period this photograph captures, when she was living with family friend Ana Lower, was one of the few times of stability and relative happiness in her early life. 'Her childlike appearance in this photograph is quite different than the platinum blonde bombshell image she would become known for. 'Photographs signed by Marilyn as Norma Jeane Baker are quite rare and sought after by collectors, and only a few other signed examples of this Junior High School class photograph have ever come to auction.' She added: 'A variety of collectors are interested in Marilyn Monroe. Her appeal continues to grow and truly spans the globe. 'In the past, we have received bids on Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from clients in the US, Europe and Asia, as well as South America and the Middle East.' Marilyn Monroe, as she became early on in her career, became a sought-after actress and appeared in hits including Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Some Like It Hot .","Class photograph was taken at Ralph Wardo Emerson Junior High School in 1941 when Norma Jeane was just 15 .

In a speech to leading members of the Islamic community Prince Charles claimed President Assad's war against his own people was in part caused by drought and mishandling of the rural economy . Prince Charles courted controversy last night by blaming the Syrian conflict on mismanagement of the country’s natural resources. In a speech to leading members of the Islamic community, he claimed President Assad’s bloody war against his own people was in part caused by drought and mishandling of the rural economy. The prince blamed the same problem for other recent global conflicts, and although he did not name any in particular, many will take them to include Britain’s forays in Iraq and Afghanistan. Charles, who recently sparked division . after hitting out at Britain’s ‘failing’ pensions industry, said: ’We . are now grappling with all sorts of social and economic challenges that . have their roots in a problem not acknowledged, which has contributed to . so many of the conflicts around the world in recent times. ‘And that is the way nature’s capital reserves have been depleted; things we take utterly for granted like water and soils. ‘If these deteriorate and are not managed . on a sustainable basis, this can cause direct impacts on food and . energy security. The tragic conflict in Syria provides a terrifyingly . graphic example, where a severe drought for the last seven years has . decimated Syria’s rural economy, driving many farmers off their fields . into the cities where, already, food was in short supply. ‘This depletion of natural capital, inexplicably little reported in the media, was a significant contributor to the social tension that exploded with such desperate results.’ Paul Flynn, a Labour MP and member of the Commons public administration committee, described the prince’s comments about the civil war, which has seen Syria’s despotic president kill tens of thousands of his own people, as ‘bizarre’. ‘Again he is bordering on the eccentric with what is certainly a novel idea,’ he said. ‘He has spoken a great deal about national political issues in the past and it is surprising that he has strayed into international politics which is a very dangerous minefield indeed. This goes further than his usual obsessions. His job as head of state will be to be above politics and he should use the time until that happens to practice keeping his mouth shut.’ Charles has long been known for his outspoken views, but by straying into international politics, his speech to the World Islamic Economic Forum in London may be among his most controversial yet . Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Prince Charles has always been known for his blue-sky thinking, but I don’t go along with that analysis of the Syrian conflict. I think it’s quite clear from the Arab Spring what caused it, and it is that these people wanted to be free of dictatorship. ‘I’m not sure the environment is a contributory factor at all.’ An aide to the prince told the Mail last night: ‘The prince was making a point within the wider context of his speech about finance and certainly not claiming that this [the issue of rural mismanagement] was the only contributing factor to the Syrian conflict.’ Charles has long been known for his outspoken views, particularly over issues such as farming, the environment and architecture. Charles said that the conflict in Syria provided a 'terrifyingly graphic example' of a severe drought having decimated the rural economy . But by straying into international politics, his speech to the World Islamic Economic Forum in London may be among his most controversial yet. Saying the forum was sign of London’s ‘growing importance as a hub for Islamic Finance in the West’, he added: ‘You are meeting at an opportune moment and your efforts to establish bridges between cultures and countries could not be more important. ‘We are currently confronting challenges that will define our civilization, not least the wise management of our planet in the face of climate change, the depletion of natural capital and a rising population. It is clear from the Koran and, indeed, from the Bible too, that humanity has a sacred responsibility for the stewardship of the Earth.’","Prince claims  war was in part caused by mishandling of the rural economy .

A Pennsylvania mother of two has been missing for six months and the case grows increasingly cold as repeated attempts by police to question her estranged husband - the last person to see her - are refused. Melissa Ortiz-Rodriguez, 31, was last seen by Jose Rodriguez at their Collingdale home on April 19, according to initial statements from Rodriguez. He reported his wife missing four days later when Ortiz-Rodriguez failed to pick their two daughters, aged eight and 11, up from school or turn up for her first day at a new job. Missing mother: Melissa Ortiz-Rodriguez disappeared on April 19 and has not been seen since . Loving mom: Since she disappeared, Ortiz-Rodriguez has not contacted either of her beloved daughters, something friends and family say she would never do . The pair had been separated since Ortiz-Rodriguez discovered Rodriguez had fathered a child with another woman but relations had reportedly been warmer before Ortiz-Rodriguez's disappearance and he had been spending time at the family home. Police investigating the case have been stymied by Rodriguez's refusal to answer questions about inconsistencies in his initial statements to police. Rodriguez had one interview with police after reporting Ortiz-Rodriguez missing. Since then, he has hired an attorney and refused to undertake a polygraph test or submit to further questioning. Melissa Ortiz-Rodriguez had planned to stay with friends in New Jersey on the weekend of April 19, planning to leave her car at home and take public transport. She never arrived. Rodriguez told Detective Daniel Leight that he had left the house first that day, but later told police his wife left the house first to drop the children off at school. He said she was wearing gray pyjama pants and a t-shirt, but later said she was wearing a yellow dress. Troubled marriage: Ortiz-Rodriguez filed for a protection order from her husband following episodes of physical and emotional abuse . Leight told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Ortiz-Rodriguez had seen an attorney about getting a divorce from her husband before she disappeared. The two had been separated since Ortiz-Rodriguez found a receipt for a baby carseat and bottles and learned her husband had been having a relationship with a fellow Amtrak employee named Sarah Seclow, and that the two had had a baby. Court records also show a troubled relationship before Rodriguez's extra-marital affair. In February, Ortiz-Rodriguez filed a protection-of-abuse order against her husband. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, he had previously locked Ortiz-Rodriguez and the children out of the house and disassembled parts of her car engine. When she'd tried to leave him, he had ripped the suitcase from her hand and strewn its contents over the front lawn, broken her cell phone and pushed her. She withdrew the complaint two weeks later. According to the Philadelphia Inquirer she had told a friend that he 'was being nicer' to her, and had allowed him back into the house. Investigators want to know where Rodriguez spent the weekend when his wife was supposed to be in New Jersey. Rodriguez had been living in New Jersey with his new girlfriend and their baby, but the week before Melissa Ortiz-Rodriguez disappeared, he was in Collingdale with her and their two children. Police have executed search warrants on . both the Collingwood home and the home Rodriguez shares with Seclow in . New Jersey as well as his Amtrak vehicle, and obtained cell phone . records for him and Ortiz-Rodriguez. Hopeful: Ortiz-Rodriguez (top right) was excited to be starting a new job and had seen an attorney about divorcing her husband before she disappeared . 'In his statement he claimed he left for work at 8, 8:30 that Friday morning,' said Leicht told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'I have him at home [in Collingdale] at 12-12:30 [pm] that day.' Rodriguez also told police that he spoke to Ortiz-Rodriguez several times over the weekend, but records don't show any phone calls occurring between the two. Further mystifying police is the matter of cleaning supplies including two mop heads and a gallon of floor cleaner that Rodrguez obtained from his place of work. Cleaning supplies: Police want to know what Rodriguez did with two mop head and a gallon of cleaning liquid he obtained from his place of work the weekend his wife disappeared . The Delco Times reports that Rodriguez signed the supplies out of the New Brunswick, New Jersey Amtrak facility where he works on April 21. Video surveillance shows Rodriguez driving away in his red pick-up truck with another person in the passenger seat. Police want to talk to that person. Collingdale Police Chief Robert Adams says that if Rodriguez doesn't have anything to hide, he should be helping the police with their investigation. 'If he didn't do anything, his lawyer should have him here helping us,' said Adams told the Philadelphia Inquirer. 'The man has not reached out to me even once to ask about the status of the case,' he said. 'I have heard nothing from his side of the family whatsoever or his friends.' Meanwhile, Ortiz-Rodriguez's family and friends contact police for updates on the status of the case several times a week. In the case of her mother Olga Ortiz, it's every day. 'We are still in the darkness. We haven't gotten to the light,' said Ortiz. 'I keep hoping and praying that she is still alive,' she told the Philadelphia Inquirer. Adding to the family's misery is the fact that Rodriguez won't let them see Ortiz's granddaughters. Since his wife's disappearance, Jose Rodriguez has been living in New Jersey. According to NBC, the same day he reported Ortiz-Rodriguez missing, tried to transfer the couple's two children to a North Jersey school. 'Mr Rodriguez is as concerned as everybody else about the whereabouts of his child's mother,' said his attorney Michael Diamondstein. Write caption here . 'He's done everything he can to assist the police.' According to police, Rodriguez has not participated in local area searches for his wife and has returned only to take possessions from the Collingdale home. Melissa Ortiz-Rodriguez's neighbor Kathy Bauer told NBC that Rodriguez was at the home in May, and when she asked about the case to her that police had found his wife. 'I was so happy to see him,' said Bauer. 'He said they found her and were questioning her. But he wasn't real excited, just nonchalant.' According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, Rodriguez has put the Collingdale home on the market. Ortiz-Rodriguez, described as being five-feet-five-inches and 130lb with brown hair, remains missing.","Mother-of-two Melissa Ortiz-Rodriguez, 31, has been missing since April .

The Unite union’s campaign of bullying and intimidation has targeted more than 60 businesses in the past two years, the Mail can reveal. Packs of militant protesters hounded senior managers at country hotels, a children’s charity fun run and at the castle where Downton Abbey is filmed in dirty tricks operations designed to humiliate them into giving in to the union’s demands. And while the bullying campaign came to light during this month’s bitter Grangemouth oil refinery dispute, such brutal militancy has been going on unchecked since 2011. Campaign of intimidation: Unite militants with their giant inflatable rat outside The Pig, one of Ratcliffe's business interests in the New Forest, during the bitter Grangemouth dispute . Raising the 'levels of hostility': The union activists protested at Lymington Town sailing club . Three executives at a construction company which was caught up in a separate Unite row this summer involving the Crossrail project called the police after they were repeatedly harassed at their homes, causing huge distress to their families and elderly neighbours. Under attack: Jim Ratcliffe of Ineos . ‘There were multiple protests outside their homes,’ a friend said. ‘It embarrassed them in the neighbourhoods. It is victimising the people who are wholly unconnected to get to the people who are connected. These were issues relating to business – bringing it to people’s own homes is reprehensible.’ The bosses fear speaking out or being named in case of reprisal attacks. ‘They were worried about the company and its members being targeted again. As we know, they [the militants] play by their own rules,’ the source added. The full extent of Unite’s militant campaign has emerged after the Mail revealed this week that a sinister unit backed by general secretary Len McCluskey – known as the ‘leverage’ team – had invaded the front drive of one of the directors of Ineos, the chemical company which owns Grangemouth. The boss called 999 fearing for the safety of his wife and two young children. Ed Miliband’s close friend and major . Labour donor Andrew Rosenfeld has also been implicated in the scandal . after it emerged one of his firms has been aiding the union thugs by . supplying them with free mobile phone calls and text messages. Last night, former Labour parliamentary candidate Jonathan Roberts resigned from Unite following the Mail’s revelations. One militant squad descended upon the Limewood Hotel in the New Forest, chanting at diners for 45 minutes . Protestors targeted the Solent Half Marathon, which included a children¿s fun run . UNITE has instructed its members to have no limits and to show escalating ‘levels of hostility’ in targeting bosses. In a guide published in March 2012, activists are told to exploit ‘all areas of weakness of an employer – both direct and indirect’. ‘The Leverage Strategy has essentially come out of the simple need to beat the employer,’ it says. ‘It has not developed by theory or desk research, it has developed by the absolute need to win - whatever it takes.’ As it is ‘ever more difficult to win when faced with either determined employer attacks or resistance to our demands’, the guide says, a new approach must be used. ‘Leverage is an extension of the understanding that “weight of argument” does not change an employer’s mind. Leverage simply looks at what will change an employer position,’ it says. ‘An important part of leverage is the ability of those using it to be able to turn on and off the tap. To be effective leverage must be used sparingly and as part of a strategy.’ The union has, however, stood by its campaign to target bosses’ homes, saying it would not be ‘cowed in any shape or form’. David Cameron described the union’s actions as ‘shocking’ and ‘very serious’ and has demanded the Labour Party investigate one of its main paymasters. Documents seen by the Mail show Unite leaders instructed militants to use growing ‘levels of hostility’ and to do ‘whatever it takes’ in their leverage campaigns, which have been going on for almost two years. A 50-page union guide for activists details how they should identify ‘the potential vulnerabilities of the employer’ and states that ‘leverage treats the employer as an opponent’. As well as Ineos and Crossrail, Unite . mobs have targeted bosses at the Honda car plant in Swindon and he MMP . packing company in Bootle, Merseyside. In the Grangemouth dispute alone, . the campaign targeted at least 66 companies, homes and events connected . to Ineos, including customers, suppliers and banks. Police were called when activists turned . up to intimidate their targets carrying a giant inflatable rat and . wearing hoodies, waving flags, playing loud music and chanting. Ineos had threatened to close the plant at Grangemouth after a new pension package designed to save the business was rejected by Unite . Ineos had threatened to close the plant at Grangemouth after a new pension package designed to save the business was rejected by Unite. The union threatened to strike but finally gave in last week and agreed to call off the leverage team. During the dispute, one militant squad descended the Limewood Hotel in the New Forest, which is owned by Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe, 61. They arrived during Sunday lunch, chanting at diners for 45 minutes while putting leaflets attacking Mr Ratcliffe on customer’s cars. They left after police were called but also protested at the nearby Pig restaurant, which Mr Ratcliffe has invested in, and Lymington Town sailing club, where he is a member. Again, police were called. The group then marched down the local high street and targeted the Solent Half Marathon, which included a children’s fun run. They also posted pictures of themselves wearing hoodies and high-visibility jackets outside Highclere Castle in Hampshire, where Downton Abbey is filmed. It is believed leveraging started in late 2011 and  is a carefully considered campaign designed to ‘get around’ laws brought in under Margaret Thatcher to curb picketing. Unite yesterday shamelessly continued to defend its tactics. McCluskey said the union would not be ‘cowed in any shape or form’, adding: ‘If a company is engaged in what we believe is an unfair attack on workers and their families and their communities, then the idea that faceless directors can disappear to their leafy suburbs and get away with that type of action is something we think is wrong.’","Militant protesters hounded senior managers in dirty tricks operations .

It came from a faraway land - and gave Britain its first glimpse of a bizarre looking creature previously unknown to these shores. It stood upright, carried its young in a pouch and propelled itself in a series of giant leaps. Meet the kongouro, as depicted by celebrated 18th century British artist George Stubbs (perhaps better known for his animal paintings than for his spelling). The image was created from a combination of sketches, anecdotes and a preserved kangaroo skin that Captain James Cook brought back from his first voyage of discovery to the Pacific. Kongouro: George Stubbs' painting was created from a combination of sketches, anecdotes and a preserved kangaroo skin that Captain James Cook brought back from his first voyage of discovery to the Pacific . Stubbs is believed to have had the skin inflated to create a model from which to paint his masterpiece. The name 'kongouro' appears to have been a taken from a mishearing of what Aborigines called the 8ft marsupial. Yesterday a long-running tussle over whether the UK or Australia should provide a home for the painting, and for a partner work depicting a dingo, was finally resolved. Kongouro and 'Portrait of a Large Dog', the first known images of Australian animals in Western art, are to stay in Britain after an appeal backed by Sir David Attenborough. A £1.5million donation from shipping magnate Eyal Ofer enabled the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich to buy them. Stubbs, who died in 1806, was predominantly a painter of horses, dogs and sporting subjects. His portraits horses, studied in meticulous detail, were breathtakingly realistic and made him the foremost artist in this field.

"By . Andrew Levy . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 10 August 2011 . To the untrained eye it might seem like just another cheeky bit of monkey business. But when Milly the mandrill covers her face with her hand she is actually sending a serious message to her fellow primates: ‘Leave me alone!’ Experts believe the 15-year-old female invented the gesture to warn other monkeys at Colchester Zoo to give her some space. Covering her eyes: A 15-year-old female mandrill, called Mandy, invented the gesture to tell other in Essex that she wants to be left alone . And, remarkably, the signal has been picked by other members of the group, who use it when they too require solitude. Evolutionary biologist Mark Laidre . believes the behaviour is evidence of social culture among the . mandrills, which are the largest species of monkey and are best known . for the eye-catching colouring on their faces. Significantly, the sign language is . unlikely to have been influenced by human activity because, unlike apes, . dolphins and dogs, mandrills do not mimic humans. Mr Laidre expects further research . will uncover other monkeys using cultural gestures – suggesting ‘the . capacity to communicate with the hands in a meaningful way may have . existed a long time before humans came on the scene’. Zookeepers first noticed Milly, a . shy, low-ranking member of her group, covering her eyes – mimicking the . famous ‘see no evil’ gesture – in 1999, when she was three. At first, staff thought she was plagued with poor eyesight or simply shading her eyes from the sun. Unique: The gesture has not been spotted among other primates and is unlikely to have been influenced by human activity . It was only when Mr Laidre, of the . University of California, spent 100 hours studying the mandrills in 2007 . and 2008 that he noticed the significance of the gesture. ‘I’d never seen this before – I knew it was very interesting,’ he said. ‘By covering their eyes with their . hands, individuals possibly conveyed to others that they wanted to be . left alone and this message may have been respected as a “do not . disturb” sign.’ The signal, which can last up to 30 . minutes, involves placing the hands loosely over the eyes but with the . fingers parted to keep watch. While the hand is in place, the rate . at which other monkeys approach or touch the individual was seen to drop . dramatically. Those who rank lower in the social order also use the . technique to avoid attacks from more dominant group members. As the discovery appears to be unique . to Colchester Zoo, it suggests it is a local phenomenon that arose . naturally in the community of 25 mandrills. Curator Sarah Forsyth said: ‘We . believe Milly made up the signal and over the past five years some of . the younger mandrills have picked it up. We’re not sure why she started . doing it but it could be as simple as “I can’t see them, so they can’t . see me”. It really does show you how intelligent mandrills are.’ The monkeys are found in the wild in . Africa, mainly in the rainforests of Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea . and Congo, where they live in large groups often hundreds strong. They . live for around 20 years and adults typically grow to about 3ft and . weigh around 77lb.","A 15-year-old female mandrill invented the unique gesture at Colchester Zoo in Essex .

Three-year-old Missy also suffered serious injuries when she was bitten six times on the stomach during the the attack in Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester. But magistrates were told it had been placed in a new home with a family of six children, including a child with autism. During the hearing an animal behavioural expert said the bull mastiff was a 'lovely animal' that posed no threat to humans. Previous owner: Helen Sayle was ordered to pay Mrs Caffrey £150, plus £500 vet bills and £100 court costs. Her dog has now been given to new owners .

'It has had the taste of blood now and I dread to think what will happen next. It should have been destroyed. How long will it be before it attacks someone else?

The bull mastiff had escaped from Sayle’s garden and was running around the street but had been caught by neighbour using a child’s belt as a makeshift lead. The dog was being taken back to Sayle’s home when it suddenly snapped the belt and broke free as it spotted Mrs Caffrey’s tiny pet. In court Professor Barry Peachey, an animal behaviour expert who examined the mastiff, said that the animal only injured Mrs Caffrey because it was attacking a smaller dog. He said: 'The dog is patently not dangerous to human beings. It has no problems with big dogs. The mastiff charged at Mrs Caffrey and Missy after breaking free from a makeshift lead in Manchester . Fully recovered: Missy is back to her old self, but nearly died when the escaped mastiff lunged at her and repeatedly bit at her stomach . 'I have done hundreds of these cases and I would hardly ever be able to say I would rehome the dog myself but in this case I would. It is a lovely dog. 'The lady suffered an injury because the large dog was attacking a smaller one. If the lady was attacked by this Mastiff she would have been gravely injured.' In mitigation defence lawyer Gemma McGungle said: 'This is a series of events that have occurred not through any fault of the owner. The defendant immediately took steps to ensure the area from which the dog escaped is now secure. Serious injuries: Three-year-old Missy had to have extensive treatment after the attack . 'More importantly than that she used her contacts within the community to rehome the dog. 'The evidence is that Holly is not a dangerous, nasty or vicious dog, she is a playful dog. 'It just happens that the complainant has . been caught up in an altercation between two dogs. 'If this dog had of . gone for the human she would have been seriously injured. She was . injured in the melee. 'The defendant went to Mrs Caffrey’s . house after this happened to apologise and offer to pay the . compensation. This dog does not like small dogs. 'Rather than that being a characteristic that makes her dangerous she just requires a lead.' The mastiff will be allowed to live with its new owner on the condition that in public places it is . muzzled, kept on a lead, and under the care of someone over the age of 16. Mrs Caffrey claimed after the court case that she had attempted to protect Missy from holding her above her head, but the bull mastiff managed to bite her pet's stomach. She said: 'Missy had to have 6 tubes in her stomach to close up the wounds and some were so big that they couldn’t stitch them up. The whole ordeal was terrifying. 'I have always loved dogs but ever since it happened I have found myself going out of the way of bigger dogs to avoid them. If those lads weren’t there to help me I would have been in deep trouble.' After the hearing its new owner Barry Taylor-Lewis, 31, refused to comment. Sayle said: 'Holly is a beautiful dog and I’m happy with the new owners. I would never say Holly was ever a dangerous dog. 'It was all just an unfortunate event really. I’m happy she’s with a family now who can give her lots of individual attention.'","Dog bit Sylvia Caffrey, 60, as she tried to stop it savaging bichon frise .

What if darkness overtook our world and just a single source of light remained to pierce the gloom? That's the question photographer Julien Mauve asked himself when he came up with the concept for this series of dramatic pictures, entitled After Lights Out. The French photographer travelled the world to capture these eerie images, which are completely devoid of all artificial light but from a single source hidden behind a window. Haunting: This eerie image, which could be of a haunted house, is part of a set entitled After Lights Out by French photographer Julien Mauve . After the zombie apocalypse: The French photographer travelled the world to capture these eerie images, which are completely devoid of all artificial light but from a single source hidden behind a window . Lucky find: This photo, photo which shows a single light shining from a grand building seen over Prague's Vltava river, was shot just as Mr Mauve found it. Others required complex camera trickery . Chilling: In this shot he has used an off-camera flash triggered remotely to create the single source of light at just the moment the picture was taken . On his website, he explains how he was inspired to come up with the series by inescapable light pollution. 'Night no longer exists,' he says. 'City lights cover up the stars, and cell phone screens lighten even the darkest of alleyways. 'And soon, imagine a world in which our lights render even the sun gratuitous. 'In the darkness of space, light is a beacon of hope. What if darkness in our world once again overtook the night and as an affect, transforming even the most insignificant light into an exception – a mystical phenomenon? 'In a world in black and blue, the single incandescence of a bulb could be the greatest promise of an adventure about to start.' Serendipity: Mr Mauve told how the old woman in this shot arrived just at the right moment and stood perfectly still as the photograph was exposed. She then disappeared as mysteriously as she arrived . Edited: This image shows Buenos Aires, Argentina. Most of the lights in the windows of the buildings pictured have been carefully darkened using Photoshop . Grim: Timage of a jogger running in front of council estate-style blocks of flats was actually taken during the day with the night-time effect the result of a low shutter speed and ISO setting . All the photographs were shot with a Canon 5D, a high-spec 12.8MP digital SLR aimed at the so-called 'prosumer' market of dedicated amateurs. However, except for a few lucky finds, many of the haunting images required careful composition and a touch here and there of computer photo editing to get the desired effect. In some of the shots, Mr Mauve told PetaPixel, he has used an off-camera flash triggered remotely to create the single source of light at just the moment the shot was taken. In others, he has used Photoshop to remove the lights in the scene.

Remote: All the photographs were shot with a Canon 5D, a high-spec 12.8MP digital SLR aimed at the so-called 'prosumer' market of dedicated amateurs . Labour of love: Mr Mauve says the effect of light is a major influence on his photography . A forgotten world: The images hark back to an era when nightfall cast the world into inescapable darkness . The British phonebox seen in another of his images was another such stroke of luck, with the old lady standing nearby having simply entered the frame and remained there still as the photo was exposed. Half a minute later, she disappeared as mysteriously as she arrived. Other photos required complicated camera trickery. For example, the image of a jogger running in front of council estate-style blocks of flats, which wasn't shot at night at all. Instead Mr Mauve set up his flash in the scene, lowered his camera's colour temperature then exposed the photo with a very fast shutter speed and low ISO setting. Strange: A light source emanates mysteriously from the wreckage of a shipping boat in this ghostly image . Quick learner: Mr Mauve began considering photography seriously only three years ago . Apparition: A barely discernible figure stares back from the window in this unsettling image . Crumbling: This final photo shows a rural home, with another ghostly figure within staring back at the camera . Mr Mauve, 28, is from Paris, where he works as a digital project manager. 'As long as I can remember I have always had a camera in my hand, but going from Fischer Price to Canon took me quite a few years,' he said. 'I started to consider photography seriously only three years ago, while practicing on friends, landscapes and objects, trying to understand and apprehend natural lights. 'At these times I progressively found myself very interested by scenaristic photographs, being influenced by the work of people such as Philip-Lorca diCorcia, Jeff Wall, Duane Michals, Mac Adams, Gregory Crewdson or Ellen Kooi. 'Later on, in 2011, I began my first photography project with the will to experiment artificial lights.'

Hero: Miguel Alvarez stayed to look after 19 elderly citizens at a care home after other staff members walked out . Last Friday, Alvarez became worried about the elderly resident's health and called 911 several times. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, sheriff's deputies and firefighters came to rescue the remaining abandoned residents on Saturday. Alvarez, a stay-at-home father of one son and a stepson, took a job at Valley Springs Manor early last month to save extra money to buy Christmas presents for his children. He was paid $8 an hour to clean at the facility and met the owners just once. He told the Chronicle that the manager gave out paychecks and administered medications to the elderly residents but disappeared in the days before the state-ordered closure. Other staff members followed suit and Alvarez found himself frantically changing diapers, bathing and trying to feed the home's elderly residents. 'I'm a janitor - I didn't know what I was doing.

Caring: Alvarez stayed overnight at the home to ensure the safety of its elderly citizens even though he was never paid . Alvarez became emotional as he described the scenes of chaos at the home after the staff left, saying many people were shouting for help and became distressed and 'zombie-like' after not receiving their medications. 'I felt bad for them so I helped them,' Alvarez told the San Jose Mercury News. 'I felt... who's just going to leave these people? Just leave them for damn near dead?'

A judge has sided with Oprah Winfrey's estranged stepmother in a bitter divorce battle, ruling her 79-year-old father's 'adultery and inappropriate marital conduct' were behind the couple's split. The decision came just days after Barbara Winfrey, 66, reportedly dragged her billionaire daughter-in-law into the messy 18-month-long fight, alleging Oprah was trying to swindle her out of money. Vernon Winfrey's initial June 2012 petition for divorce was rejected in a November 1 ruling and Barbara's separate bid to end their 12-year union was granted, with Oprah's dad ordered to pay his ex-wife nearly $70,000 in attorney fees. Barbara claimed Vernon cheated on her . for years with prostitutes including one named 'One Tooth' and . threatened to shoot her. She also claimed a woman tried to blackmail him over a sordid sex tape. Divorce: Barbara Winfrey, pictured left in 2003, was granted a divorce from her husband of 12 years Vernon Winfrey, center, and Oprah Winfrey, right, was dragged into the battle . 'Barbara J. Winfrey is entitled to a divorce on the grounds of adultery and inappropriate marital conduct,' Tennessee Supreme Court judge Donald P. Harris wrote in his ruling, according to RadarOnline. The National Enquirer reported that court papers filed on October 11 by Barbara Winfrey alleged 'several pieces of marital property' had been placed in a trust to avoid sharing them with her. The documents also allege Oprah slashed her father's stipend in a bid to limit any income payments he may have to pay his ex-wife and also set up a trust that deliberately excludes her. Harris' November 1 ruling stated that the TV talk show star purchased a property her father and his wife owned after he had gifted it to another man, Thomas Walker, who then defaulted on the mortgage. 'The court finds (Vernon Winfrey) allowed (the marital property) to go into foreclosure knowing that it would be purchased by his daughter, Oprah, for his and Thomas Walker's benefit and to defeat any interest of Barbara Winfrey,' the ruling stated. As such, Harris ruled that Barbara should be 'held harmless from the payment of this indebtedness' and penalized Vernon, ordering that he be held liable for one of the pair's loan accounts. Property: The judge stated in the ruling that Vernon Winfrey had allowed his marital home to go to foreclosure knowing Oprah, pictured, would purchase it for his benefit . A spokesman for Oprah told Radar that she stepped in because she didn't want her father's 'life work to be dissolved.' 'The property was in foreclosure and when it went up for auction, Ms. Winfrey bid and got it because she didn't want her father's life work to be dissolved,' the rep said. Meanwhile, new revelations of the couple's split have emerged, with Barbara accusing Vernon in the same October 11 court papers of using his barbershop for 'sexual escapades' during their marriage that many in their community knew about, including the students Barbara taught at the local school. 'One Tooth' was the most humiliating visitor she alleged, as well as a woman who tried to blackmail Vernon, claiming she would hand over a 2008 sex tape to the local Channel 2 News if he didn't pay up. In May, Vernon reportedly admitted he'd been filmed in the act and that the offending tape had been offered to the ABC News affiliate for broadcast but he said 'I think the fellow refused to do so.' He added he was never going to pay up, and would have accepted the consequences of the tape going to air. 'Oprah is furious at Barbara for trying to drag both her and her father through the mud,' a family member reportedly told the Enquirer. 'Oprah loves her father but she's stunned at Barbara's sensational claims. The allegations about the prostitute and the gun are almost too much to take. The idea that her father would conduct himself this way is very disturbing to Oprah.' Barbara's court documents also describe how Vernon allegedly threatened to shoot her when he was 'drunk and angry' one night and 'chased (her) around the island in their kitchen with a gun in his pocket, saying he would shoot her.' Vernon reportedly admitted during the deposition that the couple had a disagreement and that he was in possession of a gun but said he never attempted to put his hand on his weapon.","Vernon Winfrey's initial June 2012 petition for divorce was rejected in a November 1 ruling in Tennessee .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 01:15 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:20 EST, 7 November 2013 . The remains of a new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the Earth 80 million years ago has been discovered by scientists in Utah. Paleontologists believe the dinosaur, which had been named the 'king of gore', was the largest living predator of its time with a big skull and huge teeth. Bones of the 24-foot-long dinosaur were unveiled at the Natural History Museum of Utah in Salt Lake City yesterday. It is believed to have lived 10 million years before its slightly larger relative, the Tyrannosaurus rex. Super-predator: An artist's rendering of the newly-discovered dinosaur, Lythronax argestes, whose fossils have been found in southern Utah . New discovery: The fossilized skeleton of a newly-discovered dinosaur, Lythronax argestes, on the display at the Natural History Museum of Utah . Scientists hope the find will help them better understand the ecosystem where the predator roamed. Discovered by workers for the Federal Bureau of Land Management in eastern Utah in 2009, scientists named the animal Lythronax argestes, or 'king of gore,' for its large teeth and apparent dominance as a predator. 'Discovering the Lythronax pushes back the evolution of the group that gives rise to T. rex, which is something we didn't understand before,' said Mark Loewen, a geologist at the University of Utah, who led the dig for the new dinosaur. 'Lythronax is like the great-uncle of T. rex.' Paleontologists have thought that members of the group with characteristics like T. rex - large bodies, tiny arms, thick skulls and forward facing eyes - dated as far back as 70 million years, but the Lythronax shows signs of being at least 80 million years old. 'Great uncle': The newly-discovered dinosaur is believed to predate the Tyrannosaurus rex by 10 million years . Deadly: The skull of the dinosaur can be seen with the original bones in the foreground with a model of what scientists believe the new species of tyrannosaur looked like . Like its relative, the Lythronax is believed to have been the top predator of its time, roaming a stretch of land from Mexico to Alaska, including parts of Utah, during the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous period. 'The really cool thing is that this shows that the origins of the last known tyrannosaurs were in the southern part of North America as opposed to Asia or far North America,' as previously thought, said Andrew Farke, curator at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont, California. Photos of the fossil remains of the newly discovered species were sent to Loewen and his team soon after they were discovered at the southern end of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, on the Utah-Colorado border. The group spent the following two years retrieving, preserving and assembling the bones. Then, they traveled to locations where other bones from the tyrannosaur group were being studied, including China; Birmingham, Alabama; Washington, D.C.; and New York. The 24-foot-long dinosaur is believed to have been the top predator of its time around 80 million years ago . The Lythronax bones were set between layers of volcanic ash, which allowed scientists to determine the age of the dinosaur by studying the decomposition of the ash crystals that surrounded them. 'This sort of discovery is very interesting and exciting because it's not just another animal from that era but a large predator from that era,' said paleontologist Peter Roopnarine, who studies the ecology of dinosaur periods for the California Academy of Sciences. Roopnarine said being able to learn about the Lythronax will reveal more about the ecosystem at the time of its reign. 'This is going to change our understanding of this older ecosystem,' Roopnarine said.

Jason Dernbach received a caution despite admitting 113 offences during a three-year crime spree . A burglar has escaped with a caution despite admitting 113 offences. Jason Dernbach, 24, was given the soft punishment after confessing to a three-year crime spree. At the time he was behind bars for 26 separate offences. Surrey Police, which made the decision, says it has suspended its policy of ‘multiple cautions’. Kevin Hurley, the newly elected police and crime commissioner for the county, said he would investigate the case. ‘It seems that if someone has admitted . 113 further offences then there ought to be an additional sanction for . this,’ he added. ‘I’ve never known a burglar who is locked up in D Wing . break into someone’s house.’ Last January, Dernbach, from Woking, . was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Guildford Crown Court after . admitting six burglary charges. He confessed to another 15 thefts and four car break-ins and these were taken into consideration as part of the sentence. The court heard that in 2011 he stole . more than £20,000 of games consoles, laptops and digital cameras to pay . for his drug habit. One offence took place while he was on police bail. Behind bars he made further admissions . to the police of 113 burglaries and car break-ins between 2005 and . 2007. Officers could have chosen to prosecute but opted instead for a . ‘retrospective caution’. Cautions appear on a criminal’s record but do not result in any further punishment. At the same time they allow the force . to declare a crime ‘solved’ and improve its conviction rate. Peter . Cuthbertson, of the Centre for Crime Prevention, a think-tank, said: . ‘Each year thousands of repeat offenders receive a caution for serious . offences like burglary. ‘Pathetic punishments like these only . serve to prove career criminals right when they say getting caught is . just an occupational hazard. Cautions should be reserved for minor . offenders.’ Official figures show nearly 28,000 offenders were handed multiple cautions in 2011. Of those, 3,531 were cautioned three times, 820 four times, 300 five times and 23 at least ten times. Kevin Hurley, the newly elected Surrey police and crime commissioner, said he will investigate the case . In May last year a court heard how a serial burglar who was spared prison went on to commit 22 more raids in nine months. Jason Reed, 39 and from Bristol, was . handed a suspended jail term despite admitting 12 burglaries and having a . previous conviction for rape, indecent assault and false imprisonment. On release he carried out another 22 home break-ins and was finally jailed for six years after admitting 49 other crimes. Official figures show the average burglar now has around 12 break-ins on his record – the highest number ever logged. And of those convicted last year more than 3,000 had been found guilty at least 20 times before. In the year to June 2012 around half . of all burglars escaped jail –with one in three given a community . sentence and 11 per cent a suspended jail term. A spokesman for Surrey Police said: . ‘Cautions for a large number of offences were only given out in . exceptional circumstances and only when a specific set of criteria had . been applied and met. ‘The criteria would include the . offender having already received a significant custodial sentence and . having the support of the victims.’ He said it brought closure for some . victims.","Jason Dernbach, 24, admitted the spree while in jail for 26 other offences .

The glamorous actress wife at the centre of the Morgan sports-car family feud has launched an angry tirade against the  ‘greed and ego’ of her husband’s relatives and former boardroom  colleagues. She said the legendary English car-maker in rural Malvern, Worcestershire had ‘sold its soul’ and that their treatment of her husband – including the removal of his beloved Morgan  company car -  had left their seven year-old daughter ‘crying.’ The outpouring came as Charles Morgan himself spoke emotionally on Friday of how his ousting from the company that has borne his family’s name for three generations was ‘extremely personally distressing’ on the tenth anniversary of his father Peter’s death. Meanwhile, his wife Kiera posted angry messages on Twitter about the family feud at the heart of the split, saying ‘greed and ego got the better of them.’ She tweeted of her husband’s ousting: ’It’s cruel &indecent. It's changed my view on families. Without Charles it's merely another lost business that sold its soul’. ’In this case the greed and the ego got better of them. It's as simple as that. There is no other justification to their actions. On the loss of the family Morgan, she added that  her seven year-old daughter was ‘crying’ and ‘scared’ about how she would get to school because ‘they are taking away daddy’s car’. She added: ’Today is the 10 year anniversary of Peter Morgan's death. I hope he can see the tears of his grandchildren and the unnecessary pain.’ Father of five Mr  Morgan, 62, a former ITN cameraman, married his current wife Kiera  – named in ‘Who’s Who’ as Kira Kopylova with whom he has a son and a daughter – in 2003. He has  one son and two daughters from a previous marriage. The Morgan firm was founded more than a century ago in 1910 by Mr Morgan’s grandfather Henry Morgan, his father Peter, and himself. Distressing: Charles Morgan said: 'Being asked to leave the company that bears my name is also extremely personally distressing.' Seven months ago Mr Morgan stepped down as managing director but retained  the post of ‘ambassador’ for the firm – until Morgan and its new MD Steve Morris announced this week he would no longer have a role in the running of the company. Mr Morgan said: ‘I have been asked to leave the Morgan Motor Company by the board. It is a sad decision that I am appealing. I remain a major shareholder in Morgan.’ He insisted: ‘I’d like to be clear that I am not a tycoon but a family man – I inherited a company not wealth –  and unexpectedly leaving its employment will be a hardship for myself and my family. ‘Being asked to leave the company that bears my name is also extremely personally distressing. That is made more painful as today marks 10 years since my father, Peter Morgan, died and I feel him in spirit with me in this dispute.’ He insisted: ’My primary concern is completely for the company I have spent 30 years helping to build, and specifically for Morgan’s employees, who I hold in the highest regard. I want nothing but success for Morgan Motor Company in the future and remain committed to this goal.’ Charles Morgan and his wife Kiera Morgan pictured driving a Morgan sport car during the opening of China's first Morgan sport cars showroom in Shanghai. On the loss of the family Morgan, Mrs Morgan said her seven year-old daughter was 'crying' and 'scared' about how she would get to school because 'they are taking away daddy's car' He expressed his gratitude ‘for the expressions of support received on twitter and elsewhere, particularly from the employees of Morgan.’ He said he was proud that  company’s annual production volumes are ‘double what they were at the start of my tenure’ adding: ‘Morgan remains a small but successful family firm.’ He added he would be ‘making no further statements for the time being’. However, Mr Morgan had hinted to a conference of business leaders on Thursday that a bitter family feud lies behind his dramatic exit in a boardroom coup. He regaled his audience of business chiefs with tales of his jet-set life with his glamorous young Eastern European actress wife Kiera, his driving adventures with her across America in the Gumball3000 rally, and his business deals in China to boost exports. Describing the car-firm’s founding he said: ’One hundred and four years later I represent the third generation of Morgan family’ marking a line that goes back almost as far as the dawn of the  motor industry. But he said: ’I no longer have an executive role.’ Tweets: Mrs Morgan posted a series of tweets lambasting her husband's relatives and board members . Statement: Charles Morgan posted his account on Twitter . He then set out how the family-run firm is divided among its members: ‘I have a 30 per cent shareholding. I’m also  one of the beneficiaries of a trust whose two trustees share 48 per cent of the company. ‘At this stage this is all I am prepared to discuss’. He also set out his own vision for Morgan, hinting again that these may have been areas of tension within the company. At the end of his speech, Mr Morgan was spirited out the back of the building – the Central Hall in London’s Westminster - where he was photographed getting on his bike having been told in so many words by his board:  ‘on your bike.’ Mr Morgan says he is appealing against the decision by Morgan Motor Company, which said he would no longer be a part of the managing team or the board of directors at Morgan Technologies, a subsidiary. Blog: Charles Morgan confirmed he was asked to leave his family business . Some of the 400 workforce at the Malvern factory took to Twitter to express their support. One tweeted: ‘We can't believe the company is not being run by a Morgan family member . ‘It's probably not best to name individuals on this account but the general feel around the factory is we would like Charles Morgan back’. Another supporter tweeted: ‘Can't see how the current management team can be better placed than Charles Morgan  to lead the organisation.’ Charles Morgan replied: ‘Thanks from the depth of my heart. You are the lifeblood of the company and must be treated with the respect that you deserve.’ ‘Every one of you make Morgan a great company and great cars, never forget that.’ The Morgan company said in a statement: ‘Further to decisions taken in January of this year, Morgan Technologies is now in a position to announce that Charles Morgan is no longer part of the management team or board of directors of the company.’ Setting out reasons for his enforced departure, the firm said: ‘The Morgan family recognises the management contribution that Charles has made to the family business as strategy director, and confirm that he remains a shareholder. ‘However, to ensure continuing success, Morgan must look to strengthen and review its strategies, and acknowledge that our management team are better placed to steer the company in the future.’ Mr Morgan joined the firm in 1985, working next to his father Peter who retired in 1999. Morgan is on course to sell a record-breaking 1,200 cars this year.","Kiera Morgan said the legendary English car maker had 'sold its soul'

More than 800,000 households will spend over half of their income on debt repayments if interest rates rise as expected, research shows. The effects of a rise in line with market predictions – to about 2 per cent by 2017 – could be disastrous for many. And if rates increase beyond expectations to 4 per cent, the number of households with such perilous burdens could surge well past a million. About 800,000 people will have to spend half their income on debt repayments, if interest rates rise . The report examines an ‘adverse but plausible scenario’ in which Britain has weak income growth in coming years, with the gains skewed in favour of richer households. Mark Carney, the Bank of England’s new governor, has attempted to quash speculation that rates will rise after four years at 0.5 per cent. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has tried to reassure people about interest rates . Nevertheless the report by the Resolution . Foundation think-tank, published today, marks the first full analysis . of how higher rates could affect different types of households. It warns that many are heavily dependent on rates staying at their current rock-bottom level. It argues that politicians must make the most of the low base rate to discuss how to tackle Britain’s debt burden, instead of storing up problems for the future. Matthew Whittaker of the Resolution Foundation told The Times: ‘There is now the real prospect that a large number of households already burdened with debt could collapse under its weight if economic conditions tighten. ‘Even if interest rates stay in line with expectations, we are likely to see a rise in the number of families struggling with heavy levels of repayment over the coming years. ‘If the squeeze on household incomes continues, Britain could be left in a fragile position, with even moderate additional increases in interest rates leading to a major surge in families with dangerous debt levels – especially among worse-off households.’","800,000 people will spend half their income if rates rise to 2% .

Here, a demonstrator cups a red ball . The inFORM 'state-of-the-art shape display,' which was created by Professor Hiroshi Ishii and his students at the MIT Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and impressively, it works in realtime. The 'tangible interface system' uses camera sensors from Microsoft's Kinect to read objects in three dimensions.

Here, a circular basket is placed under the sensors and is replicated on the table . This image shows the replication of the basket. The bars, which can move independently from one another, can also be lit and a red patch indicates where the ball in the 'real' basket under the sensors, is positioned . This information is then processed by a . computer, to move the small bars placed in a grid pattern within the . tabletop, which results very quickly in the replication of a person's . hands or an object like a basket. The researchers said the tabletop 'provides for variable stiffness rendering and realtime user input through direct touch and tangible interaction.' In a video, demonstrating the innovation, the researchers use a ball to show how the table has the power to move an object around on its surface, using the dynamic bars. The creators of inFORM (pictured) envision their innovation could be used to replicate objects remotely and even reproduce city maps, using 3D data.

The Chief Medical Officer is to write to all GPs to make it plain that abortions carried out solely on the grounds of the sex of the child are wrong. The letter from Dame Sally Davies will clarify the law on gender abortions and will make it clear what the government thinks are the information that doctors need to make a decision in good faith. It will also remind clinicians that the pre-signing of abortion certification forms is against the law. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies is to write letters to all GPs to make it plain that abortions carried out solely on the grounds of the sex of the child are wrong . Spot checks at more than 250 abortion clinics last year found evidence of blank forms being signed in anticipation of patients seeking a termination. The law states that, except in emergencies, two doctors must agree for a woman to have an abortion. Although doctors do not have to see the woman in person, they must certify that they are aware of her circumstances and why she wants to go ahead with the procedure. The fact that the letter will be sent out to all family doctors was revealed in an answer to a Parliamentary question by public health minister Jane Ellison earlier this month. She said the Department of Health would then work with relevant royal colleges and medical bodies to keep the guidance under review. A furious row blew up last month when the boss of the country’s largest abortion provider indicated that there was nothing wrong with terminating a baby on the grounds of its sex. Ann Furedi, the chief executive of BPAS, wrote on a website that doctors are legally free to terminate pregnancies when the parents are unhappy with the sex of the child. ‘While it is true that the sex of the foetus is not a legal ground for abortion, nor is rape, or incest, or being 13 years old.’ The law states that, except in emergencies, two doctors must agree for a woman to have an abortion . Her comments followed the decision not to prosecute two doctors who agreed to arrange abortions - as part of a newspaper probe - for women who said they did not want girls. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer, said there were grounds for charges but it would not be in the public interest to proceed. He also said the law at the moment was not clear enough because it does not specifically say that abortions should not go ahead on the grounds of the sex of the baby. Experts say it would be difficult to prove that a decision had been taken solely on the grounds of the sex of the foetus. Dame Sally’s letter to all GPs is an attempt to set out the steps they should take to ensure an abortion is within the law. Last night a spokesman for the Department of Health said: ‘We take this issue extremely seriously and intend to issue further guidance. ‘First there will be a further letter from the CMO and will cover sex selective abortions, pre-signing of abortion certification forms and the information that doctors need to make a decision in good faith. ‘Departmental officials will also be working closely with professional bodies, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the British Medical Association and the General Medical Council, to discuss what further support and guidance clinicians might need.’","Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies to write letters to all GPs .

A senior Tory MP has accused two barristers at the heart of the Leveson inquiry of failing to provide ‘basic information’ to a legal watchdog investigating their affair. Rob Wilson, Parliamentary aide to Chancellor George Osborne, has delivered a damning response to the testimony of Carine Patry Hoskins and a barrister representing advocates of draconian Press regulation, who have been revealed to have embarked on a romantic relationship. Mr Wilson has demanded a probe into whether the relationship between the mother-of-two, who is now divorced, and David Sherborne breached professional standards and could have compromised the Leveson inquiry’s findings. Carine Patry Hoskins, council for the inquiry, and David Sherborne have been accused of failing to give a full account of her relationship . The Bar Council advises lawyers it is ‘very unwise’ to start a relationship with an opposing lawyer because of the likely perception of a ‘danger of a breach of confidence or other conspiracy’. Mr Wilson said standards of conduct applying to sexual relations between barristers working at judicial inquiries should be at least as high as at adversarial court cases. Mr Sherborne, who represented actor Hugh Grant and other celebrity victims of phone hacking, went on holiday to the Greek island of Santorini with Miss Patry Hoskins in August last year. She was a member of the inquiry’s counsel team, charging the taxpayer fees of £218,606 between July 2011 and November 2012 for her work. She became known as ‘the woman on the left’ and received thousands of mentions on Twitter for her close attention to Mr Grant’s evidence during the 97-day inquiry. The couple claim they simply discussed the ‘possibility of a future relationship and decided against it’ while on their Greek holiday. Rob Wilson, Conservative MP for Reading, has demanded a probe into whether or not the pair's relationship breached professional standards . They say they changed their minds later and became a couple after the inquiry ended in December. Mr Wilson’s response to their evidence to the Bar Standards Board, which is investigating the affair, claims Miss Patry Hoskins ‘acknowledges that she knew she would be responsible for writing sections of the Leveson report before booking and going on a holiday to Santorini with Mr Sherborne’. The MP claims she admits she did not inform either Sir Brian Leveson or Robert Jay QC, the inquiry’s lead counsel, about the trip. In a letter to the Bar Standards Board, he complains that in a 19-page submission, Mr Sherborne ‘does not even provide basic facts about the relationship’, including ‘when they became friends, when relations between them became (i) romantic and (ii) sexual, and when they first realised that they may end up forming a relationship... ‘Nor does Ms Patry Hoskins explain when, during the course of her involvement with the inquiry, it became apparent to her and Mr Sherborne their “friendship” had the potential to develop into a romantic relationship. I suggest the Bar Standards Board will want to establish these basic facts for the sake of completeness.’ The MP also expresses alarm at the argument that the rules which apply to lawyers taking part in a court case do not apply in a judge-led inquiry such as that headed by Sir Brian Leveson. ‘Members of Parliament and the public would be deeply concerned to learn that the legal profession considers it appropriate to attach lower standards of independence and professional conduct to the legal staff of judicial inquiries than those that would be applied to barristers, solicitors and court staff in ordinary legal proceedings,’ he writes. Actor Hugh Grant was represented by David Sherborne at the Leveson Inquiry where Ms Hopkins was a member of counsel . The MP says depending on the Bar . Standards Board’s verdict, it may be necessary to spell out explicit new . codes of conduct for the staff of public inquiries, including . barristers. In his letter, . Mr Wilson added that it was a ‘matter of concern in itself’ that Sir . Brian had refused to ‘even entertain the thought that the relationship . between the barristers may have given rise to concern despite the Bar . Council’s clear advice’. Mr Wilson told the Mail: ‘In 50-odd pages of submissions, they didn’t even provide details about when they became friends. ‘For a member of the Leveson inquiry . team who wrote up part of the draft Leveson report to have had an affair . during the inquiry with a barrister who has made a career out of . opposing the Press…is a serious matter. Mr Wilson found it worrying that Lord Justice Leveson refused to 'even entertain the thought that the relationship between the barristers may have given rise to concern despite the Bar Council¿s clear advice' 'The Bar Standards Board needs to get to the truth about what happened and when.’ Sir Brian has flatly rejected any suggestion that his report into Press standards may have been tainted by the relationship. The Bar Standards Board can impose punishments ranging from words of advice, fines or suspension to ultimately having a barrister struck off.","Rob Wilson has delivered a damning response to barristers' testimony .

Tower of flames: A huge fire broke out in a North Texas field Thursday after a Chevron crew accidentally punctured a 10-inch gas pipeline with a drill . Haunting: The entire town of Milford, population 700, was evacuated amid the haunting black smoke after the explosion around 9:30am for fear the flames could trigger additional explosions . Sheriff's spokesman James Saulter said no injuries have been reported. Chevron requested that Milford be evacuated. Saulter said deputies went door-to-door advising people in the town of about 700 to leave. Milford school Superintendent Don Clingenpeel said all students and staff were evacuated to the nearby town of Italy. ‘The biggest concern right now is the pipelines that are around to make sure there's not going to be additional explosions,’ Saulter said. No casualties: The cloud of thick, black smoke could be seen for miles following the explosion, which thankfully injured no one in the town of Milford . Still flowing: Officials are allowing the fire to burn out but have not shut off gas to the line because, according to one official, the flow of gas cools down the pipe . Another 14-inch line runs a few feet from the one that blew up and gas was still flowing because stopping it would increase the risk of a secondary explosion, Tom Hemrick, director of Hill County Emergency Management, told KTVT. ‘It is still flowing because the flow cools the line,’ Hemrick said. Saulter said Chevron has indicated it could take 24 hours to bring the fire under control and cap the ruptured line. He said it's not clear how long the evacuation will last.

Now, in a campaign against fraud, they have published some of the most outrageous excuses given by cheats. One fraudster said she needed the swindled money to pay for a TV in all of her children’s five bedrooms as they had attention deficit disorder. Jobseekers' allowance? Officials said many fraudsters continued to work while still claiming benefits . But the woman, from West Lothian, Scotland, failed to mention that the children no longer lived with her. A claimant caught using a fake ID said her skin colour changed from black to white in a road accident that also changed her face shape. A man with two Pakistani passports was investigated for identity and benefit fraud. Both passports listed the same children. The man, who lived in Glasgow, told officials: ‘You have me confused with my evil twin brother. He lives in Pakistan and visits the UK regularly. My brother has children born on the same dates with the same names.’ A disability living allowance claimant was asked why she was claiming benefit to pay for a cleaner while working full time as a cleaner. ‘By the time I come in from work, I’m that knackered,’ she replied. The excuses, made this summer, have been publicised by the Department for Work and Pensions to encourage the public to shop fraudsters. High fraud areas will be hit with investigations, local advertising and letters to claimants. Other examples included a claimant in Liverpool who insisted she was not in a relationship with a man who stayed most nights in a week. When it was pointed out that they had had three children in five years, she said: ‘We’re all entitled to a one-night stand aren’t we?’ When told it would be impossible to have three children of different ages from one liaison, she answered: ‘Well, a three-night stand then.’ Wanting: Ministers from the Department for Work and Pensions say the benefits system needs reforming . A claimant from Folkestone in Kent failed to declare her partner. ‘He doesn’t live here, he just comes every morning to collect his sandwiches,’ she said. And a man who was pretending to be single said: ‘It’s not my partner, it’s my sister.’ When the investigator held up their wedding certificate, he replied: ‘It was a drunken mistake.’ A night watchman in Folkestone who was claiming out-of-work benefit explained: ‘I only claim benefits during the day – what I do at night is my own business,’ he said. David Freud, Minister for Welfare Reform, said: ‘Hard-working taxpayers lost an outrageous £1.2billion in benefit fraud last year. ‘Universal Credit will close the gaps in the welfare state that cynical benefit cheats try to take advantage of. The new benefit will reduce fraud by £200million.’ However, the programme has been delayed by technical glitches and the sudden death of a leading official. Richard West, of the Department for Work and Pensions, said: ‘We are used to fraudsters telling tall tales to hide their crimes . . . Some keep on trying to lie as a way out – even to the point of ridiculousness. They usually just end up digging them themselves deeper into a hole.’","Department for Work and Pensions releases 'best' benefit fraud excuses of the summer .

The top 1 per cent of working-age households in Britain now take home 10 per cent of all income paid in the economy - compared to the 18 per cent taken by the bottom half, it emerged today. The figures came in research by a think-tank that revealed the super-rich and bottom 50 per cent of working-age households in Britain shared the same proportion of income growth from 1994 to 2010. But this split up when looking at 1994 to 2011, when 13 per cent of growth was claimed by the top 1 per cent, and 17 per cent by the poorest half of Britain - thanks in part to the 50p tax band launch. Proportions: This Resolution Foundation diagram shows how the share of growth in working-age income dropped for the top 1 per cent in 2010-2011 to 10 per cent, after being 13 per cent for 1994-2011 .

The 50p top tax rate on incomes above £150,000, brought in by Chancellor George Osborne in April 2010, saw a slide in the very richest’s earnings, but it will fall to 45p in April, reported the Observer. While the poorest half of working-age households now receive just 18p of every £1 of income generated, down from 19p in 1994-95, the richest 10 per cent receive 33p of every £1, up from 29p. The share of households which fall below the richest top 10 per cent but are above middle income - known as the upper middle income group - has fallen from 52 per cent to 49 per cent. Wages went down in real terms across income groups during the recession years of 2008 to 2011. Cash in hand: While the poorest half of working-age households now receive just 18p of every £1 of income generated, down from 19p in 1994-95, the richest 10 per cent receive 33p of every £1, up from 29p . But in the five years prior to the recession - 2003 to 2008 - the top 10 per cent of earners saw their gross wages continue to grow in real terms, from a full-time average of £75,980 to £79,650. 'The growing gap in incomes is pronounced when you look at the top 10th of households and overwhelming when you consider the position of the top one per cent.  The rest of society hasn’t kept up' Matthew Whittaker, Resolution Foundation senior economist .

Doctors have performed a pioneering procedure to 'vacuum' a huge blood clot out of a man's heart, which they feared could kill him instantly. Todd Dunlap, 62, became the first person to successfully undergo the procedure in California after a CT scan revealed a 24-inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart, which ran the risk of breaking loose and lodging in his lungs. The minimally-invasive procedure, which used a devices called AngioVac, was offered to Mr Dunlap as an alternative to open-heart surgery and could be used more widely in future. Todd Dunlap became the first person to successfully undergo a life-saving procedure in California after a CT scan revealed a 24-inch clot stretching from his legs into his heart. The minimally-invasive procedure used a device called AngioVac (pictured) to 'vacuum' out the clot as an alternative to open-heart surgery . Mr Dunlap, a new grandfather and father to two sons, did not hesitate to pick the less invasive option offered to him by Dr John Moriarty in UCLA Medical Centre's emergency room in August of this year. Just a week after the pioneering procedure, he was back at home and eager to play with his 9-month-old grandson. To perform the procedure, a team of radiologists and cardiovascular surgeons slid a tiny camera down Mr Dunlap's esophagus to visually monitor his heart before guiding a coiled hose though his neck artery to plug one end into his heart, against the potentially fatal clot. They threaded the other end through a vein at the groin and hooked the hose up to a powerful heart-bypass device in the operating room to create suction. 'Once in place, the AngioVac quickly sucked the deadly clot out of Mr. Dunlap's heart and filtered out the solid tissue,' said Dr Moriarty. The surgeons slid a tiny camera down Mr Dunlap's esophagus before guiding a coiled hose though his neck artery to plug one end into his heart, against the clot. They threaded the other end through a vein at the groin and connected the hose to a heart-bypass device to create suction . Red blood cells and platelets trapped in a fibrin blood clot. Dr Kwon said retrieving a clot from within the heart used to require open-heart surgery, resulting in longer rehabilitation times . 'The system then restored the cleansed blood through a blood vessel near the groin, eliminating the need for a blood transfusion.' The procedure lasted three hours and doctors observed Mr Dunlap for seven days, first in intensive care and then in the hospital's cardiac ward. Open-heart surgery takes twice as long to perform and often requires the surgeon to divide the breastbone lengthwise down the middle and spread the halves apart to access the heart. After the heart is repaired, surgeons use wires to hold the breastbone and ribs in place as they heal, which requires a longer period of rehabilitation before the patient makes a full recovery. Dr Murray Kwon, a UCLA cardiothoracic surgeon who collaborated on Mr Dunlap's procedure, said: 'Retrieving a clot from within the heart used to require open-heart surgery, resulting in longer hospitalisation, recovery and rehabilitation times compared to the minimally invasive approach provided by the AngioVac system.' The procedure (pictured) lasted three hours and Mr Dunlap stayed in hospital for a week. Open-heart surgery takes twice as long to perform and often requires the surgeon to divide the breastbone lengthwise down the middle and spread the halves apart to access the heart resulting in a longer period of rehabilitation . A clot-busting drug known as tPA typically takes three to four days to work and failed when doctors tried to use it on Mr Dunlap due to the clot's large size and density. Dr Moriarty said: 'The AngioVac was the last resort for Mr. Dunlap. 'The clot clogged his heart chamber like a wad of gum in a pipe.

But anyone who tried it out would get a nasty shock - when they plummeted 40ft down the side of the building. The slide has horrified locals in eastern China who are concerned that kids might reach the roof where it is located. Watch out below: This slide is located on top of a three-storey building and leads straight off the side . The frame is placed on top of a three-storey factory in Heze, Shandong province, where the slides are manufactured. It is located so that the end of the slide leads straight off the building, so that any foolish thrill-seeker would drop directly onto a concrete car park. Neighbours have voiced fears that the colourful object could prove irrestible to teenagers. 'We worry that our children might get in there at weekends and try to play on it,' one said. 'You'd have to be mad to put a slide there.' Tempting? Locals are concerned that children could climb up to the roof and use the slide . Factory managers say the slide is meant to advertise the company's wares, and is not intended to be used by anyone. However, following the local outcry, they have agreed to take the object away. 'We can understand people's fears so we will be removing the slide,' a spokesman said. This is not the first time that Chinese authorities have been blasted for showing an apparently lax regard for public safety. Earlier this month, a five-year-old boy was left bruised and bloodied when he was propelled into the air by excessively powerful water jets at a public fountain in Hubei province. Sometimes it is members of the public themselves who court danger - in February, two tourists at a national park were pictured riding on top of a cable car.","Slide is located on top of toy manufacturer in Shandong province .

'But finally enough was enough and I had to accept that it was a medical condition that was just part of me. I now realise it's nothing to be ashamed of. 'I want people to understand I'm not trying to be a man and that my facial hair is something that can't be helped.' Before her diagnosis, Sarah suffered other symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), including weight gain and irregular periods. 'I didn't know what was happening to me and I was sick of people staring at me in the street,' she says. But it was a load off her mind when she was finally diagnosed with PCOS and realised there was a reason for her symptoms. The Movember fundraising challenge sees people being sponsored to grow their facial hair in aid of prostate cancer and men's mental health.

Her normal ritual is to use hair-removal cream prescribed by doctors to get rid of the hair, but she isn't sure how much hair she will grow over the month. She usually also uses tweezers to get rid of stray hairs in between cream treatments. She said: 'I might grow a full beard, you never know! I don't know what will happen, but it should be fun.

A mother almost died when she was engulfed by flames in a horrifying wickless candle accident.

A spark from the candle, sometimes known as a gel burner, flew off and hit her chest. Accident: Anna Cooper, right, suffered third degree burns following a freak accident with a wickless candle. The accident happened just two months after she got married to partner Gavin, pictured . Mrs Cooper, from Dereham, Norfolk, tried to flick the burning ember off her, but within seconds she was engulfed in flames. A friend managed to extinguish the flames with a glass of lemonade before screaming at her to go and get into the shower. Mrs Cooper was taken hospital where she was given morphine and put on a drip to replace the vital fluids she'd lost. The businesswoman was burned all over her chest and . right arm following the accident - which took place during a family get-together. She remained in hospital for a week. The terrifying incident happened in . July - just eight weeks after the mother of Isla, eight, and Oliver, 11, . got married in Jamaica to her partner Gavin. Mrs Cooper said today she had joked with her new husband that something would happen to 'burst their bubble'. Mrs Cooper, who also has three stepchildren, said: 'I'm very lucky to be here, I could easily have died.

'If I had gasped in, that would have gone down my airways and I probably would be dead.' Gel burners or wickless candles are commonly used both inside and outside the home. Users fill a small well-like area with special gel fuel that is then set alight - creating a flame. Following the horrible accident, Mrs Cooper has started a new business venture - tending graves for families who cannot visit them very regularly. New start: Mrs Cooper is now fully recovered from the accident and has opened a new grave-tending business . Mrs Cooper said: 'Being in hospital made me realise I wanted to provide for my children and gave me some time to think. 'I lost my father four and a half years ago and his ashes are in Surrey. 'I don't get the chance to go down there as much as I would like and give him flowers. 'It got me thinking that there must be people here who don't get the chance to go to their loved one's graves and I'm trying to offer them a service.'","Anna Cooper, 35, suffered first-, second- and third-degree burns when she was accidentally covered in vapour from a wickless candle on her patio .

A mother who became pregnant after months of gruelling cancer treatment suffered further heartache when her baby son was diagnosed with meningitis. Nikki Anderson, 28, had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland. But to her total surprise, she discovered she was pregnant after months of gruelling surgery and chemotherapy - only for baby Cody to be diagnosed with meningitis when he was just three weeks old. Nikki Anderson, 28, had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland. But shortly after finishing gruelling chemotherapy, she discovered she was expecting baby Cody . Doctors discovered the tennis-ball sized tumour on top . of Mrs Anderson's kidney in August 2011 when looking for a cause for her . continual weight gain. The tumour was causing her to overproduce testosterone - making her pile on the pounds - and stopping her from getting pregnant. It . was removed a month later, and she endured three months of daily . chemotherapy before doctors found a second tumour, removed in May. Shortly after that, and to her total surprise, she discovered she was expecting. Mrs Anderson, from Bristol, said: 'I really thought that my body was just ruined by all I had been through. 'I . had to have fertility treatment before for my daughter, so with all the . chemo, operations, and scarring on top of that, I thought I would never . get pregnant - not in a million years. Baby Cody arrived on September 14, weighing a healthy 6lb 1oz. But just three weeks later, he was rushed to hospital with a high temperature and diagnosed with meningitis . 'When I found out it was a big shock - you forget all the cancer. 'I do believe things happen for a reason and that really this was meant to be.' Baby Cody arrived on September 14, weighing a healthy 6lb 1oz. But just three weeks after he was born, he was rushed to hospital with a high temperature. Doctors warned Mrs Anderson and her husband Steve, 28, that Cody most likely had potentially fatal meningitis - which was later confirmed by a lumbar puncture. Mrs Anderson said: 'It was petrifying. When they first did all the tests I didn’t want to believe what was happening to my baby. Mother and son are both well again, although Mrs Anderson must have regular check-ups . 'We were sleeping at the hospital for four nights and I would rather have taken his place. 'They were telling us to prepare for things like brain damage. He was so tiny and wired up. Luckily it was viral, so he could fight it on his own and pulled through and he’s fine now, gaining weight and really healthy.' Mrs Anderson is now cancer free, but has to return to hospital every three months for check ups. She added: 'It is just all about waiting but for now I’m looking forward to a different Christmas with Cody and the rest of the family.'","Nikki Anderson, 28, had feared she would never have another child after suffering a rare cancer of the adrenal gland .

The son of IRA victim Jean McConville has revealed that his mother's death in 1972 still haunts him - more than four decades after her murder. Michael McConville says he still suffers nightmares about the day Mrs McConville, a 38-year-old mother of ten, was abducted by Irish Republican paramilitaries and executed. Speaking in BBC documentary The Disappeared, Mr McConville also talked of his life after his mother's murder, which orphaned her children and condemned them to a childhood in care. Nightmares: Michael McConville says he has never been able to overcome seeing his mother dragged away . Mr McConville and his sister Agnes also remembered the harrowing events of the day their mother was taken and offered memories of the family life that was denied them. 'There were ten of us all in one bedroom, . like ten wee rats,' remembers Mr McConville of his childhood. 'At that point of life, we hadn't got much but we had . each other.' But all that was to change. His mother, a Protestant widow who had been married to a Catholic man and who lived in the staunchly Republican Lower Falls Road in West Belfast, took pity on an British soldier injured during one of the street battles that characterised the Troubles. 'My ma put a cushion under his head,' says Mr McConville. 'My . ma would have helped anyone, that's just the kind of person she was. 'That's where it all started to go wrong for us.' Just days after the incident, the IRA came calling. Jean was enjoying a game of bingo when she was called out and told that one of her children had been injured. A car was waiting outside to take her to hospital. But it was a trap. In the early hours of the following morning, Jean was found wandering the streets, badly beaten and disoriented. Family: Jean McConville poses for a picture with three of her ten children the year before she was killed . Lonely: The remote spot on Templetown Beach in County Louth where Jean's body was finally found . 'There was a lot of blood on her and her face was all swollen . and everything. Black and blue,' remembers daughter Agnes. 'We got her a cup of tea and her cigarettes... and she must . have smoked the cigarettes one after the other as she drank her tea, and . she started to get sick, sick with her nerves.' Later that day, the IRA came back for Jean, but this time there would be no return home. Mr McConville remembers: 'Around teatime, a rap came on the door. 'She was in the bathroom getting washed and they were shouting ""Where is she? Where is she?"". Jean herself was distraught. 'She was screaming,' says Agnes. 'She was screaming her head off. She was shouting: ""help me"", ""help me"". But no one came. Mr McConville adds: 'All of us [children] was wrapped round her. All of us was crying and squealing. I . remember one of the [paramilitary] girls talking and I remember [her] because she hadn't got a . mask on, and she used to be a neighbour of ours. 'They kept trying to . calm us down because they knew us, and they knew us by name.' Going home: 31 years after her terrible death, the body of Jean McConville was finally recovered . Eventually, Jean was forced out of the house and down into the road. Agnes and Michael's older brother Archie attempted to follow their mother but the IRA men put a gun to his head and ordered him away . 'We could her her screaming, still screaming, and we looked over the . bannister down from the block of flats, and there she was, getting . thrown into the back of a red van and that was the last time I actually . saw her,' says Agnes. Later that day, a single shot to the back of the head ended Jean's life and her body was buried in a shallow, unmarked grave. Her 10 children were now orphans. Mr McConville said: 'I think it was . about five days later, an IRA man came to the door, rapped on the door, . and handed over my mother's purse and her wedding rings. 'I asked him . where my mother was and he said, ""Look, I was just told to bring these . rings to you. I know nothing about it"" and that was it, [he] walked away.' Agnes adds: 'I knew she wasn't going to come back. I knew straight away when the first knock came through. I knew then, no return.' With their mother gone, the children were left isolated. Neighbours and the local priest were unwilling to help and unsympathetic to their plight, as official documents that date from the time reveal. Inquest: Mr McConville addresses the media after an inquest found that his mother was not a British spy . At rest: Mr McConville (left) and his brothers carry their mother's coffin at her funeral in 2003 . Between 1972 and 1982, 'disappearing' people thought to be British informers or spies became a key part of IRA activities. Prior to 1972, alleged informers had been killed and dumped by the roadside. After, their bodies were hidden in shallow graves, their families left to wonder about their fate. Along with Jean McConville, 15 people were 'disappeared' during the Troubles, among them 17-year-old John McClory, 22-year-old Brian McKinney and 19-year-old Columba McVeigh. In the run-up to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1999, the IRA admitted responsibility for the killings and pledged to help the victim's families find their remains. Although nine have been found, another seven are still lost, including McVeigh. The 'Disappeared' whose remains are yet to be discovered include alleged informers Kevin McKee, Brendan McGraw, Seamus Wright, Seamus Ruddy, SAS officer Captain Robert Nairac and former monk Joe Lynskey. The family was split up, the children scattered into care homes around Northern Ireland while Jean's remains were left where they fell, the location known only to the men who murdered her. It wasn't until 31 years after Jean was taken that her children were finally given the chance to grieve and bury their mother. In 2003, her remains were discovered close to a beach by a local man, and Jean's nine surviving children came together again for her funeral. Afterwards, her coffin was placed in the grave of her husband Arthur, who had died early in 1972 from cancer. But although they, in a sense, have their mother back; for the McConvilles, the pain of losing her and having their lives turned upside down will never go away. Mr McConville says: 'I always wondered what was going through my mother's head, coming down [to the beach] to her death. 'I just can't get my head round how a human being can . do this to another human being. When they killed our mother, they knew . we were going to be orphans and we'd have to find someone else to look . after us. 'They knew what they were doing and they knew what they were . leaving behind. I just can't get my head round that. I have the same . nightmares about her all the time. Seeing them [the IRA men] coming in. 'It never goes . away and the hurt is always there too.'

After years cooped up indoors, you might think it's time for your teddy to get out and experience the world around them. And now, thanks to a Japanese company, that's possible. Staff at Unagi Travel take groups of up to ten toys on tours around the country - showing them several popular tourist attractions, including hot springs and temples. Wish you were here? A travel company in Japan provides package holidays for stuffed animals. One city tour on offer sees the toys visit the iconic Tokyo Tower, pictured . Smile for the camera! A group of toys visit the The Asahi 'flame' building in central Tokyo . For $45 dollars the toys may embark on the Tokyo tour, stopping at five major sightseeing stops in the city. They will first visit the fashion mecca of Japanese teens, Shibuya, before the Asakusa district and finally soaking up a beautiful view of the city from the Tokyo Tower. Or if a city break doesn't take their fancy, perhaps a tour of the hot springs - known as Onsen - would be more suitable for $55. A day and a half tour to Kyoto, the former imperial capital of the country,  is also on offer for $95 - where the toys are taken to sites such as old temples and shrines. Let's fly away: One teddy on a 'mystery tour' looks out a plane window over spectacular views of Mount Fuji . Nice view! Two twinned teddies soak up the view of the Tokyo Skytree tower . Cultural: Two teddy tourists, with what appear to be make-shift hats on, visit the Great Buddha of Kamakura . For the really adventurous toy out there, there is a $35 mystery tour - which can include a trip on a plane. Throughout the tours, the toys  sample some of the delicious Japanese cuisine including noodle soups and sushi. Owners of the stuffed toys will be able to enjoy the experience too, as tour guides make sure every moment is captured on video and through photo. Soak up the sights! A monkey visits Tokyo's replica of the Statue of Liberty on the island of Odaiba . River cruise: One stylish pup enjoys the sun while cruising down Tokyo Bay towards the Rainbow Bridge . Tranquility: Four toys enjoy a trip to a shrine for Emperor Meiji and Empress Shoken . All toys must be less than 250g. Owners must pay their toy's airfare to Tokyo, but on their return they get a free coach-class ticket. The company usually targets people who, for some reason, cannot visit the iconic places themselves. Unagi is not the only company catering for toys with itchy feet. If your inanimate friend is really stressed out and you want to send it to a relaxing retreat, a travel agency in the Czech Republic offer similar services - but offer massages, aromatherapy and even picnics for an additional cost. Inspired by the 2001 French hit movie, Amelie, Toy Traveling offer people the chance to send their favorite toys on a memorable journey through Prague. A bit of history: Two teddies pose in front of a statue of 14th-century samurai Kusunoki Masashige . Hungry work: Two toys tuck in to a bowl of Kenchin vegetable soup noodles . For an extra 60 euros on top of a 90-euro fee, toys can have a massage, aromatherapy and even a picnic. But perhaps the most adventurous toy of all is Curious George - the teddy who has been travelling for five years. Curious George has travelled around the world with its owner, visiting Sydney to Singapore, London and all across America. He has been snapped hanging out at the Sydney Harbour Bridge, drinking beer in Germany, posing for pictures on the River Thames and in the cat cafes of Tokyo.

Ever felt those pangs of sadness when you're sat at the far end of the dinner table or missing out on the biggest wedding party of the year? You're suffering from a serious case of FOMO, or Fear Of Missing Out. Not only is FOMO detrimental to our state of mind, it is also also costing us thousands of pounds a year. Despite budgets being tightened across the nation, Brits are shelling out an extra £1,463 on social activities they can't afford because they just can’t say no. A new study shows the social phenomenon FOMO is having a huge impact on the nation’s wallet with one in six Brits (16 per cent) revealing they’re unable to say no to social events even though they can’t afford it. Fear of missing out: Brits are shelling out an extra £1,463 on social activities they can't afford because they just can't say no . One in five (20 per cent) claim missing out on social occasions makes them feel depressed and, as a result, sufferers are going to extreme lengths to be part of the action; one in six (16 per cent) go without meals to fund the last-minute aspects of their social lives. Those susceptible to FOMO shell out an average of £28.13 extra a week participating in events they haven’t planned for, or agreed to, until the last minute. For around one in ten (9 per cent) the cost of FOMO is much higher with the real cost reaching £75 per week on last-minute social fixes. Holiday envy is the biggest cause of FOMO, with friends’ and family trips away rated the number one activity Brits hate to miss out on. Missing out: Birthday parties are what most people fear missing out on, while missing out on engagement parties and weddings is the third biggest cause of a serious case of FOMO . Birthday parties come second, while missing out on engagement parties and weddings is the third biggest cause of a serious case of FOMO. Fear of missing out is strongest in Wolverhampton where nearly two thirds (59 per cent) of residents confess to joining a last minute outing with friends once or twice a week. In Oxford, on the other hand, FOMO doesn’t appear to have taken hold - only one in 13 (eight per cent) throw caution to the wind and join in with an event they haven’t budgeted for. A spokesperson for VoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'We’re in the sixth year of the recession and despite the fact so many Brits are struggling to get by on their austerity budget it appears we’re still unable to say no to occasions we can’t afford. 'If you’re one of the 16 per cent of people who regularly go over their social budget to avoid missing out it’s probably time to admit you’re not setting enough aside for social activities. 'If your budget is completely maxed out think outside the box next time your friends suggest going for a drink.' 1. Holidays2. Birthday parties3. Engagement parties and weddings4. Dinner parties5.

A janitor has described how for two days, he took care of more than 19 senior citizens who were abandoned after a Castro Valley care home was forced to close amid safety and health violations last week. It comes as the first image of inside the Valley Springs Manor home emerge showing what the state of the home when staff abandoned the dependent elderly residents. Miguel Alvarez, 33, stayed at the home 24 hours a day when other staff members walked off the job after the operator's license was suspended on October 24 and they went unpaid for more than two weeks . Another staff member, cook Maurice . Rowland, also stayed on to help care for the home's elderly residents, . many of whom suffer from dementia and other ailments. Stepping up: Most of the staff at the Valley Springs Manor abandoned the home after it was closed down for health and safety violations but a cook and janitor stayed behind to care for the home's 19 elderly . Hero: Miguel Alvarez stayed to look after 19 elderly citizens at a care home after other staff members walked out . Last Friday, Alvarez became worried about the elderly resident's health and called 911 several times. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, sheriff's deputies and firefighters came to rescue the remaining abandoned residents on Saturday. Alvarez, a stay-at-home father of one son and a stepson, took a job at Valley Springs Manor early last month to save extra money to buy Christmas presents for his children. He was paid $8 an hour to clean at the facility and met the owners just once. He told the Chronicle that the manager gave out paychecks and administered medications to the elderly residents but disappeared in the days before the state-ordered closure. Other staff members followed suit and Alvarez found himself frantically changing diapers, bathing and trying to feed the home's elderly residents. 'I'm a janitor - I didn't know what I was doing. I just tried the best I could,' he told the Chronicle. 'I'd never want to see my parents or grandparents go through anything like that. I liked these people. I wanted to treat them well.' Caring: Alvarez stayed overnight at the home to ensure the safety of its elderly citizens even though he was never paid . Alvarez became emotional as he described the scenes of chaos at the home after the staff left, saying many people were shouting for help and became distressed and 'zombie-like' after not receiving their medications. 'I felt bad for them so I helped them,' Alvarez told the San Jose Mercury News. 'I felt... who's just going to leave these people? Just leave them for damn near dead?' He and Rowland took it in turns to sleep on a chair at the home, afraid to leave the elderly residents alone overnight. They were busy tending to other residents on Friday when Edmund Bascom, 65, walked out of the home and has not been seen since. Under investigation: The Valley Manor care home is being investigated for numerous violations . Bascom, who went by the moniker 'Goldfinger,' suffers from a mental illness and Alvarez is wracked with guilt about his disappearance.

New theory: Euclides Monteiro, a former Ocean's Club employee, may have stolen Madeleine in revenge for losing his job after stealing money to fund a drug habit, reports claim . The key suspect being investigated over Madeleine McCann's disappearance who died in a freak tractor accident was a heroin addict who robbed apartments to fund his habit, it has been claimed. Euclides Monteiro was fired from his job in the restaurant at the Ocean's Club in Praia da Luz a year before the McCann's came to stay in May 2007. But reports claim he was caught stealing from the tills and raiding the resort's rooms for valuables to sell in exchange for drugs. An investigation is now under way to determine whether Monteiro, who was run over by a tractor at the age of 40 in 2009, took Maddie in revenge for losing his job. Close friend Sergio Paulo, 44, a builder from Lagos, told the Daily Mirror: 'Toni was a good guy but he had some serious drug problems. He would smoke heroin and become a slave to it. 'I know he would sometimes break into apartments and rob them. He was taking valuables from rooms at Ocean Club and selling them for drugs.' Police identified him as their main suspect after mobile phone records indicated he was around the McCanns’ holiday apartment in Praia da Luz when Maddie disappeared on May 3 2007 . The flat is a 15-minute drive from the town of Lagos where he was living after he stopped working at the Ocean Club. Yesterday, it emerged Monteiro, from Cape Verde in West Africa, was convicted of theft in 1996 but escaped deportation after a presidential pardon. However, his family deny the allegation. Motive: Police are investigating whether Monteiro, who died in 2009 in a tractor accident, killed Madeleine . Prime suspect: E-fits of the man seen carrying a child 500 yards from the McCanns' holiday apartment . Monteiro's widow Luisa, who has been questioned by police, told local media: ‘They are looking for a suspect that can't defend himself. ‘Peoples' lives can't be exposed this way.’ A . source told Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha that police believe he may have killed the . youngster to ‘shut her up’ when he saw the huge media response to the . disappearance - and are now trying to find her body. Portugal’s Attorney-General gave the . go-ahead for the investigation into the girl’s disappearance to be . reopened last week at the request of local police – more than five years after the original inquiry was . shelved. Correio da Manha claimed: ‘Police suspicions about the former . Ocean Club employee arose during the review of the case carried out by a . PJ team from Porto. ‘This was the strongest new lead presented to state prosecutors which led to the investigation being reopened. ‘The . man, who died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009, was not on the . list of employees handed over to police during the initial investigation . by the Ocean Club because at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance he . was not working there.’ It . described his departure from the Ocean Club as ‘frictious’ and said: . ‘The motives that could have caused the ex-employee to kidnap the . youngster are still being investigated.’ Hope: The McCann's lawyer said that the couple, seen here with a computer generated image of how Madeleine might have looked in 2012, are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive . It . suggests that he may ‘have committed the kidnap as a form of . retaliation against the Ocean Club. His aim could have been to call into . question the security of the holiday club but something went wrong and . the youngster disappeared.’ Portuguese police and a spokesman for the McCanns declined to comment on the newspaper report yesterday. It emerged over the weekend that police were planning to reinterview several Ocean Club employees. More . than 130 workers were questioned during the initial inquiry, including . two men who fixed a blind in the McCanns’ apartment two days before . Madeleine disappeared. Portuguese . police are thought to have returned to the Praia da Luz area about a . month ago to carry out mobile phone tracking work. Last . week it emerged that Kate and Gerry McCann are to apply under . Portuguese law to become private ‘prosecutors’ and may now be able to . influence the course of the investigation and any prosecution. Their . status as ‘assistentes’ will allow their legal team to work alongside . state prosecutors, keeping the McCanns informed of all new developments . in the case. They could also bring a parallel private prosecution against any suspects charged over Maddie’s disappearance. A . secrecy order put on the case by Portugal’s Attorney General could also . be lifted just for them, giving access to all case files.

These sepia photographs, believed to be some of the first to depict iconic Scottish landmarks and characters from the 1800s, are expected to sell for tens of thousands of pounds this month. The work of David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, who were the creators of Scotland's first photographic studio, they date back 170 years to the early 1840s. Included are some of the earliest photographs of Edinburgh, including John Knox House and the Scott Monument when it was still under construction. There are also photographs of Mr Adamson's home town, St Andrews, in Fife. These photographs, by David Octavius Hill and Robert Adamson, showing St Andrews Castle fore tower (left) and John Knox House, Edinburgh, are some of the oldest images of Scotland and date back to the 1840s . This photograph, taken on North Street, St Andrews, shows women and children baiting fishing lines . An image of the Abbey Wall in St Andrews is in the collection, which is to be auctioned at Bonhams in London . Now caught on camera many times each day, these sites may never have been photographed before these images were taken. The collection includes pictures of a sergeant and private of the Gordon Highlanders at Edinburgh Castle. And there are also portraits of central figures of the First General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland, which Mr Hill used to create his famous painting of the event. This was believed to be the world's first work of art painted with the help of photographs. The 17 pictures will be sold at Bonhams in London on November 12, when experts believe they could soar beyond their £20,000 estimate. Matthew Haley, head of books and historic photographs at Bonhams, said: 'Hill and Adamson were among the world's first professional photographers, and these are among the first photographs. 'Edinburgh and St Andrews are particularly lucky to have been documented at this early stage, when photography was in its infancy. 'Hill and Adamson were breaking new ground.' Then and now: Bonaly Tower is pictured many times each day now, but this shot (left) was one of the first . This photo, left, is one of the first of St Andrews Cathedral (pictured from a birds-eye view, right) Scott Monument in Edinburgh, pictured in the 1840s (left) and the modern day (right) He added: 'The image of fishwives in St Andrews baiting their lines is fabulous. It is designed to look like a snapshot in time, but actually it would have been carefully staged. 'The people in these pictures may never have seen a photograph before. They had no conception of how important they were. 'The market for 19th century photographs is truly international. There is a huge market for early photography in America, the Middle East and beyond. 'We have valued them at around £20,000 but we might see fireworks.' Photographed are Reverend Davidson (left) and Dr Thomas Chalmers, the leader of the Free Church of Scotland . This photograph of South Street was one of a number taken in St Andrews, the hometown of Mr Adamson . The set also features a Sergeant and Private of the 42nd Gordon Highlanders by a canon at Edinburgh Castle taken in 1846 before the regiment moved to Ireland. For their photograph of the Scott Monument in construction in 1844, they hoisted themselves and their equipment on to the roof of what is now the Royal Scottish Academy to get a clear view. The set also includes photographs of clergymen present at the Disruption Assembly in 1843 when more than 450 ministers walked out of the Church of Scotland assembly and down to another Edinburgh assembly hall to found the Free Church of Scotland. Mr Hill, who was present at the historic event, decided to record the dramatic scene and used photography to get likenesses of all the ministers present. The photographs - salt paper prints from caloype negatives - include the central figure, Rev Dr Thomas Chalmers, the leader of the Free Church of Scotland, dubbed Scotland's greatest 19th century churchman. This photograph, taken between 1843-45, shows Grace Ramsay and four other fishwives in Newhaven, Edinburgh . The photographs are salt paper prints from caloype negatives and are estimated to sell for around £20,000 . Photographs of St Andrews include the fore tower of the castle, the abbey wall, the entrance to the cathedral precinct and South Street with W Smith's chemist shop and the town church. Mr Haley said: 'Photographs are inherently fragile, and examples from the 1840s are very rare, particularly in such fine condition. 'They have not been displayed or exposed to the light, and may have been in an envelope for the last 150 years. 'Had they been mounted and framed the images might almost be invisible now. 'For so many to become available together is unusual.' The relationship between Mr Hill and Mr Adamson ended in 1848 when the latter man died . Left is a photograph of Jimmy Miller, the son of surgeon Professor James Miller, and right are two members of the 42nd Gordon Highlanders, which was taken in 1844 . Perth-born painter Mr Hill joined St Andrews engineer Mr Adamson in 1843 to form Scotland's first photographic studio. They produced 'the first substantial body of self-consciously artistic work using the newly invented medium of photography'. Their brief partnership ended with Mr Adamson's death in 1848, though Mr Hill continued to photograph and paint, completing his painting of the Disruption Assembly in 1866. He died in 1870 aged 67.","Believed to be the first to depict iconic Scottish landmarks and characters .

The black and white images of coastal beauty spots were originally taken home by families as mementoes of their visit to the island.

Once the German Blitzgreig of Holland, Belgium and France was over, they planned to invade Britain in 'Operation Sealion.' Postcards and holiday snaps of the English seaside helped the Nazi high command identify suitable beaches to assault and help their troops recognise landmarks. The images were contained alongside annotated maps of the UK in eight booklets called Militargeographische Angaben uber England - Military Geographical information about England. The booklets were broken down into eight regions of Britain and were incredibly detailed, highlighting things like strategic locations to attack to the make up of soil. Areas of the low-level beaches that were ideal for an invasion landing were circled and a reference number appeared alongside to draw the reader to corresponding photos. An aerial map of Manchester highlights railways, . storage sheds and British administrative offices as places of note to German military strategists . Local municipal institutions like police stations and train stations were highlighted in red triangles and industrial sites such as factories were shown up in purple. The plans also detailed potentional weak spots the Germans could exploit, such as low-level areas of London that could be flooded. A military historian and author has since collected the booklets and is now selling them at auction. The Nazis collected thousands of postcards to build up a picture of Great Britain.

Testicular cancer is relatively uncommon, accounting for just 1 per cent of all cancers that occur in men. Each year in the UK around 2,090 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer, according to Cancer Research UK. The most common symptom is a painless lump or swelling in the testicles. Other symptoms can include a dull ache in the scrotum (the sac of skin that hangs underneath the penis and contains the testicles) or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum. Source: NHS .

The study found that companies were able to become more efficient and expand their business by hiring skilled foreigners.

Soap star Gemma Bissix has escaped a driving ban for doing over 100mph - after claiming she did not realise her car could go that fast. The former EastEnders and Hollyoaks star was clocked racing down the A1(M) at 108mph in a Ford Focus. Bissix, 30, of Walton-on Thames, Surrey, who was recently killed off in Hollyoaks after a car crash, told police she had just hired the car and didn’t think it could go above 90mph. She admitted the offence after hearing police evidence but was allowed to keep her licence by magistrates in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire. Bissix was fined £800 but escaped a ban after the court heard how she regularly uses her car to take her grandfather shopping. She was driving home from a theatre in Lincoln when she was stopped around 10.30 at night on a stretch of the A1 near the village of Sawtry in good conditions last May. Gillian McGivern, defending, said: 'She was of the genuine belief her vehicle was not capable of the speed. 'She drives a considerable number of miles every year as a professional and well-known actress. 'She has just finished a fairly lengthy stint with Hollyoaks four weeks ago, and currently has no role at the moment, but anticipates she will have employment in the near future. 'She is sorry for what she has done, and she said to me it is her first big mistake.' She added that Bissix had recently moved house and had no public transport nearby.

'We understand you were in a hire car, and you may not have known how it performs. 'There is also no suggestion you were driving in an inappropriate manner, other than your speed.

Meanwhile, the M4 was closed in both directions between Margam and Pyle after a caravan overturned in the winds. But Natural Resources Wales said only one flood warning remained in place in coastal Wales despite fears over high tides. Forecasters predict the 'unsettled weather' will mar most of the weekend, although it is not expected to be as bad as the powerful St Jude storm. Last night, winds of between 50-60mph lashed the British Isles, while coastal areas were expected to see gusts of 70mph.

The 36-year-old has told how the dog pounced on him with no warning or provocation and locked its jaws on his arm, narrowly missing a main artery and leaving him with 18 deep puncture wounds.

Attack: Alexander Wyness (left) said he felt lucky to be alive after he was attacked by his dog a year after it attacked his son (right) Vicious: Two-year-old American pitbull Sonny attacked Mr Wyness during a walk in the park . The father-of-one has also revealed the dog had mauled his son, also called Alexander, as he played in a tree last year. The attack left the youngster, then aged nine, in hospital with nasty injuries to his arms, but Mr Wyness said he kept the dog after his son begged him not to get rid of it. Mr Wyness, from Wishaw, North Lanarkshire, said: 'This is a dog that I used to allow to sleep in my bed and be around young children. I feel very lucky to be alive. 'These dogs are timebombs waiting to go off due to their unpredictable nature. 'I realise now that these dogs are not designed to be house pets due to their size and strength. They were designed to pull down cattle. 'I’m just glad it happened to me and not the child of some innocent passer-by.' Scars: The dog locked its jaws on both his arms, narrowly missing a main artery and leaving him with 18 deep puncture wounds . Treatment: Mr Wyness has said dogs such as Sonny 'are not designed to be house pets due to their size and strength' Mr Wynessr had visited a park with two-year-old Sonny and his partner Fiona Stewart when he let the dog off his leash to run around in a nearby field. The dog however ran out of the long grass and began viciously snapping at his arm. Mr Wyness said: 'I thought he was just overly excited and playing about but we quickly realised that he wasn’t. 'Sonny tried to get a hold of my neck but I held my arms up in defence. I shouted to Fiona to call the police and an ambulance. Damage: The clothes worn by Mr Wyness on the day he was attacked by the dog . 'Sonny kept biting at both of my arms and was vigorously shaking his head about. I knew that if he managed to fully lock his jaw on my arm and shake his head, he would have ripped my arm off. 'I tried to kick him off but it took several kicks from Fiona to get him off. 'For a few seconds, he appeared calm and he was just sitting in front of me panting, covered in blood. 'All of a sudden he went for me again and managed to get a strong grip on my right bicep, tearing a chunk from it. Injuries: The dog narrowly missed a main artery and left Mr Wyness with 18 deep puncture wounds after it attacked him . 'He then locked his jaw on the right inner forearm, ripping a huge hole. I started to feel weak because of all the blood I was losing.' Mr Wyness managed to get up and hold Sonny off before taking him by the lead to a nearby goalpost where he tied him up. The whole attack lasted ten minutes and left Mr Wyness with massive scarring and no feeling in his right forearm because of extensive nerve damage. He told police what happened while in the back of an ambulance and gave permission for his dog to be put down. He was taken to hospital where he spent two days being treated for his injuries. Mr Wyness said: 'I bought Sonny as a six-week-old pup as a present for my son’s birthday. This was his second chance after he had bitten him. 'I should have got the dog put down after he attacked Alexander but he didn’t want me to as it was his dog. 'I now think that only people who have the right environment for these breeds should have them. They are not suitable pets especially with young children about.'","Alexander Wyness said he feels lucky to be alive following attack .

Tragic: Chelsea Clark, 13, was found hanged at her home in July 2011 after struggling with depression . Hospital staff have been accused of failing a suicidal 13-year-old girl who hanged herself after they sent her home. Despite earlier attempts to end her life and her mother’s desperate pleas, Chelsea Clark was discharged. A month later the grammar school pupil’s parents found her dead in her bedroom. Staff at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton had missed several opportunities to help the troubled teenager, a serious case review found. Chelsea, who attended Wolverhampton Girls’ High School, had already tried to commit suicide. Her mother Margaret Clark told doctors she could not keep her daughter safe, but the schoolgirl was sent back to her home in Finchfield, Wolverhampton. In May 2011 she took painkillers in a ‘significant’ overdose that left her in hospital for eight days. Medics considered admitting her to a specialist adolescent unit but she was released without a customary pre-discharge meeting. Just two weeks before she died on June 29, 2011, Chelsea told a school psychologist she had tried to harm herself after hearing voices in her head. The review, by Wolverhampton Safeguarding Children Board, found ‘a number of examples of individual sub-optimal practice’ involving mental health staff, social and community services workers and the police. It said there was ‘undue optimism’ among mental health staff who dealt with Chelsea after her initial assessment on the day she was hospitalised. The board concluded that ‘had best practice prevailed, the risk of further suicide attempts would probably have been better identified’ and that a ‘more effective collaborative effort’ could have been made to keep Chelsea safe. More than 30 recommendations have been made to the agencies involved to improve standards of care. Identifying . Chelsea as FJ, the review said she was ‘lonely, helpless and stressed . in the face of high levels of pressure from within her family. Vulnerable: The teenager was sent home by a hospital even though she said she would kill herself . Home: Chelsea's parents found her dead in her bedroom at their house in Finchfield, West Midlands . It added: ‘Though FJ’s mood state seemed to vary she was  fairly consistent in offering verbal and non-verbal indications that she would self-harm or worse if returned home.’ An inquest into her death in September heard Chelsea may have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder from her ‘stifling’ home life. Mrs Clark told the hearing she had confiscated three mobile phones from her daughter and banned her from using social networks to stop her contacting her 14-year-old boyfriend. The teenager ran away from home in the months leading up to her death and wrote suicidal thoughts in her diary. Mrs Clark told the hearing: ‘She was resentful and angry towards me. It began to build up. I suppose she hated me. ‘We . all tried to talk to her about it but towards the end it was like . talking to a stone wall. I would be the one who was saying “you’re not . going down the road, you’re not mixing with those teenagers”. ‘She really began to hate me because I was the one who had to make the stands with everything.’ Struggles: Chelsea, pictured with a former teacher, had made a number of suicide attempts before her death . Pupil: The 13-year-old was studying at Wolverhampton Girls' High School at the time of her death . The inquest heard Chelsea was found hanged after her mother had been out for a walk. Mrs Clark added: ‘I went up but the door to her bedroom would not open … I put my shoulder to it and the door bowed. I could see that Chelsea was not at her desk or on her bed. ‘I knew she was behind the door. I called for my husband to come up. He put a lot more force behind the door and kicked it in. We both fell in at the same time.’ The inquest heard that Chelsea left a suicide note but was described as being ‘quite happy’ at school. A child psychiatrist told the hearing Chelsea was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder brought on by ‘what she regarded as her rigid upbringing’. Alan Coe, chairman of the Safeguarding Children Board, said: ‘While it is impossible to say that an incident like this could never happen again, the actions that the board has taken will go some way to making sure that we keep our children and young people safer in the future.’ For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or go to www.samaritans.org.","Chelsea Clark was admitted to hospital after taking painkiller overdose .

Former SAS soldier Robert Wood was discovered hanged at the home he shared with his mistress in Zimbabwe. A Surrey coroner has recorded an open verdict following an inquest into his death . The family of a former SAS soldier who ran a Zimbabwe goldmine and was found hanged at his mistess' home fear he may have been murdered, an inquest has heard. Robert Wood, 54, was found hanged at the home he rented with his mistress in Zimbabwe. A pathologist in the African country said Mr Wood had committed suicide. But his family has told a coroner the Zimbabwean authorities who investigated his death had identified four murder suspects but refused to co-operate with UK police who had also probed the death. Recording an open verdict, Surrey coroner Richard Travers said some of the evidence he had heard at the inquest into Mr Wood’s death was 'very suspicious' but there was insufficient detail to conclude what had happened. Glasgow-born Mr Wood - known as Rab to his friends - had been running a lucrative goldmine in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, on behalf of two British city investors in return for a 13 per cent stake in the business. The inquest heard a pathologist in Zimbabwe said Mr Wood had committed suicide after his body was discovered, but Mr Wood's family fear 'foul play' had been at hand. He was found hanged in the spare room of a house that he rented with lover Henrietta Dube on the morning of March 9 last year, after a night out drinking heavily. His brother Ian Wood, who travelled to the country to investigate the death earlier this year, claimed in court that Miss Dube, a director in the mine, had forged Mr Wood’s will. He also said Miss Dube’s boyfriend Bhekithemba Nyoni had 'stepped into Rab’s shoes' in running the mine and had emptied the company’s account in the process. Surrey detectives tried to investigate Mr Wood’s death but the inquest heard their inquiries had been thwarted by a lack of co-operation by the local police force and the 'problematic diplomatic situation' with Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe’s government. Mr Wood, pictured in his SAS days, had been running a lucrative goldmine in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, on behalf of two British city investors in return for a 13 per cent stake in the business . Mr Wood's elder brother David (left), his wife Susan (centre) and and his younger brother Ian (right) pictured outside the inquest. The former soldier's family fear 'foul play' was involved in his death . Ian Wood told the inquest police in Zimbabwe had told him they had identified four murder suspects - but he could not get any more information from the force. He also told how he had uncovered evidence that his brother’s mistress, Miss Dube, had given differing accounts of the death and had forged a will to try to cash in on Mr Wood’s assets after he died. The forgery was being investigated by the Zimbabwe police but again he could not get any information. He said: 'I got a phone call to say that Henrietta had been up to the mine with armed guards and taken over the mine. They stole gold, removed some vehicles and took over the mine. 'They emptied the company bank account on February 15, which was the same day the forged will was signed.' Mr Wood also showed the coroner an email . he had received from Miss Dube. He said: 'It says ""I don’t believe Rab . killed himself at all. I also want to see justice being done"". Mr Wood, pictured at work in the goldmine, had served in the SAS and his military training meant he was used to dealing with tough situations, the inquest heard . 'She’s the one who was supposed to have been in the house with him (when he died). Whether she got frightened or whatever, maybe she’s getting frightened because we are getting closer to the truth. 'Whether this guy Bhekithemba took over the situation and forced her hand, we don’t know.' Ian Wood also said he believed Mr Nyoni . had a fight with his brother on the day of his death and that he had . broken his glasses in the scuffle. He said: 'She (Henrietta) says he was in a fight that day but she does not know who with.' 'It has to be said that some of what I’ve heard does seem very odd and indeed very suspicious. But . I have to recognise that much of what has been said, in court terms, is . mere speculation. There’s an absence of direct evidence to support it' - Coroner Richard Travers . Robert Wood’s wife Susan, 59, said she was aware of the affair with Miss Dube but stuck by her husband, with whom she had two teenage sons aged 18 and 19 years, and had let him know it would not affect their family life. She told the coroner she had spoken to him the day before his death about him returning to their home in Windlesham, Surrey, to celebrate his 55th birthday with the family. The coroner heard Mr Wood had served in the SAS and his military training meant he was used to dealing with tough situations. After leaving the military, he had worked as a businessman providing security services to miners in Sierra Leone, before branching out into the mining industry there and in Zimbabwe. Mrs Wood described her husband as an optimist who was 'too full of life' to kill himself, and said: 'There was always something good around the corner.' Mr Wood’s older brother, David Wood, told the coroner he met with him in London one week before his death and that he 'looked troubled.' Giving evidence, he said: 'I said to him ""what’s wrong with you?"" He said to me: ""They are trying to get me out of the mine. I’m going back to sort it out"". 'At the time, I didn’t take note of anything.' The goldmine in Zimbabwe which Mr Wood ran on behalf of two British city investors . A post-mortem examination in Zimbabwe gave the cause of death as asphyxia due to hanging and a pathologist recorded it as a suicide. Mr Wood’s body was flown back to the UK for another post-mortem examination, which also gave the cause of death as asphyxia due to hanging. Detective Sergeant Gary White, of Surrey police, explained their inquiry had been hampered by a lack of cooperation from the Zimbabwe authorities. Giving evidence, he said: 'We have made . diplomatic attempts and requests for information through the right . channels. In this case, nothing has been forthcoming. 'He was a strong and wonderful husband and a loving father and an extremely positive person. We hope it will not be too much longer before we can get some answers about how he died' - Susan Wood . 'There appears to be suspicion of foul play by the family but there is no tangible evidence we’ve been able to ascertain to support that.' Recording an open verdict, Coroner Richard Travers said: 'It has to be said that some of what I’ve heard does seem very odd and indeed very suspicious. 'But I have to recognise that much of what has been said, in court terms, is mere speculation. There’s an absence of direct evidence to support it. 'In all of the circumstances, there is insufficient evidence for me to determine properly how Rab came by his death and I therefore record an open verdict.' Speaking after the inquest yesterday, Susan Wood said: 'He was a strong and wonderful husband and a loving father and an extremely positive person. 'We hope it will not be too much longer before we can get some answers about how he died. 'It has been tough, but he taught me a lot by his example. He was so strong, so resourceful, and so positive that in his memory I’ve been putting that in to practice to get through this.' Ian Wood, of Dover, Kent, said: 'We are happy with an open verdict. We hope publicity about this case will lead to answers and we are putting out a $25,000 dollars reward for information. 'We hope that may be a catalyst to spur someone on in Zimbabwe to come forward and talk about what happened to Robert.'","Robert Wood was found hanged at the home he rented with his mistress .

A paramedic was hurled against the window of an ambulance and punched repeatedly in the head until he lost consciousness by the drunken thug he had been trying to treat. In a depressing indictment of modern Britain, Akinwunmi Akinyuwa attacked Qasam Pervez as they were travelling to hospital in the early hours of the morning. The 29-year-old student, who had been found slumped and intoxicated in a communal stairwell at his home, began shouting ‘angel of death’ before unstrapping himself from the stretcher. He then threw Mr Pervez against the window so he hit his head on the glass before reigning blows on the back of his head as he lay defenceless on the floor. Akinyuwa, of Blackfriars in Salford, fled the ambulance when it came to a halt. He was arrested the next day. He pleaded guilty to assault when he appeared at Manchester Magistrates' Court yesterday. Barry Cuttle, defending, said the Nigerian-born defendant, was ‘deeply ashamed and deeply sorry’ for his actions. He said: 'This man has made the first mistake of his life and is deeply upset.'

But put it in his shed . It's not every day someone finds the priceless bone of a dinosaur-aged sea killer in their garden. But when 68-year-old John Lambert came across a pliosaur fossil while building a fence in 1997, he was in no rush to do anything about it. The retired merchant banker, who lives in Ipswich, put the fossil in his shed - and left it there for 16 years. Finally, he decided to take it to Ipswich Museum last week, where experts, astounded, confirmed it to be the bone of a 250-million-year-old reptile. The 16-inch bone, thought to be an upper limb, weighs 15lbs. Mr Lambert said he put it in the shed as he could tell it was worth keeping - but getting it checked out was never a priority. 'Life get's on top of you doesn't it,' he said. 'It did look like a really big bone that was tremendously heavy and I had earmarked that I would take it for identification but never did. 'Then one day I thought, ""what happened to that bone?"" and I found it in the workshop. 'I phoned the museum and they said ""bring it in, we'd love to have a look at it"".' The pliosaur, a 65-foot-long sea-based predator, was a distant cousin of the modern lizard. With sharp teeth and paddle-like limbs, they were fast and fierce, scientists believe. Their prey included fish, sharks and dinosaurs. Fossil specimen have been found in Africa, Australia, China, and the Americas. Dinosaur-age: Ipswich Museum confirmed the bone belonged to a pliosaur, a water-based predator . Experts at the Ipswich Museum have determined that the pliosaur was not native to the English sea, making the finding even more mysterious. Mr Lambert said: 'It is rather fun. 'I've been here 29 years and we've got eight acres of ground. 'We're keen on the gardening side and I can honestly say we've found nothing whatsoever of any kind of value apart from rubbish, so it's really fun to have found this. 'It will probably go to the museum now. 'Although it's not from Suffolk, in that it wasn't swimming around here, it is part of Suffolk's heritage.'","John Lambert, 68, was building a fence in 1997 when he found the bone .

Furious Tories have accused Commons Speaker John Bercow of deliberately helping Labour to take on David Cameron after the Prime Minister was rebuked during Commons clashes. Mr Cameron could barely contain his anger after after his attacks on Labour’s union links and NHS record was interrupted by Mr Bercow, who told him to ‘remember the essence’ of each question. The government’s deputy chief whip Greg Hands later claimed Mr Bercow had extended Prime Minister’s Questions to allow more Labour MPs to attack the government, a suggestion backed up by Number 10. Clash: Prime Minister David Cameron appeared visibly angry at the latest public rebuke from Commons Speaker John Bercow . Conservatives have grown increasingly tired of Mr Bercow’s apparent bias during high profile Commons debates, privately claiming he does little to hide his favouritism towards Labour. Two weeks ago it emerged senior Tory MPs were planning  to make an unprecedented formal complaint to Mr Bercow over what they see as his bias and ‘hatred’ for Conservatives. During today’s PMQs, Labour MP John Cryer challenged Mr Cameron over discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace, and plans to charge people £1,200 to go to industrial tribunals. He then accused Mr Cameron of having an ‘attack of the Lyntons’ - a reference to Tory strategist Lynton Crosby - by talking about ‘dreadful trade unionists’. Mr Cryer added: ‘I would just like to make it clear that I am a trade unionist and damn proud of it.’ Mr Cameron used the remark to turn his fire on Labour’s union links, and reports that Unite officials targeted the families of bosses from the Grangemouth oil refinery. Bias: A tweet by Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands appeared to suggest Mr Bercow allowed PMQs to last longer to help Labour attack the government . Bias: Senior Tories accuse Mr Bercow of giving more time to allow Labour to criticise the government . The Prime Minister said: ‘I think there are millions of people in this country who can be very proud of being trade unionists. ‘The problem is that they are led so badly by bully-boys, they are led so badly by people who seem to condone intimidating families, intimidating witnesses and intimidating the leader of the opposition (Ed Miliband).’ With heckling almost drowning him out, . Mr Bercow cut Mr Cameron off abruptly. He said: ‘Actually, I think the . question was about tribunals. It's a good idea to try and remember the . essence of the question that was put.’ Greeting: After the Commons clash, Mr Cameron welcomed South Korean President Park Geun-hye to Downing Street . Mr . Cameron was appeared visibly angry at the rebuke, and minutes later . returned fire during an exchange over the performance of poor . schoolchildren. With Mr Bercow apparently eager to intervene again and move on, Mr Cameron told him bluntly: . Mr Cameron added: ‘There are fewer workless households - I am keen to answer the question Mr Speaker and it's a very direct answer.’ His thinly-veiled challenge to authority of the Speaker was cheered by Tory MPs. Earlier Mr Cameron's attack on Labour's record on running the NHS was also cut short by the Speaker, as he told the Commons: 'I’m not going to take lectures from a government who had patients drinking out of vases.' Later Tory deputy chief whip Mr Hand took to Twitter to accuse Mr Bercow of extending Prime Minister's Questions by five minutes to give Labour more time to ask a difficult question. He tweeted: ‘#PMQs getting like Old Trafford. 5 minutes extra time in the hope that the Reds can score a late equaliser.’ Mr Hands tried to play down the idea he had claimed Mr Bercow was politically biased. He added in a further tweet: ‘Just some contemporary footballing banter.’ However Mr Cameron's official spokesman appeared to support the idea that Prime Minister's Questions was often extended in the same way that Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson would get more added time if they were losing. The PM's spokesman said: 'As a long suffering Spurs fan I have often recognised Fergie time.' The latest clash comes only a fortnight after Mr Bercow rebuked Mr Cameron for describing Labour leader Ed Miliband as a ‘conman’, saying the term was ‘unparliamentary’. Shelter: An aide offers an umbrella for President Park Geun-Hye outside Number 10 . He was also seen to smirk when the . Prime Minister stood to speak early by mistake. Backbenchers said he . permitted ‘a wall of noise’ from Labour, while turning on a handful of . Tory hecklers. Mr Bercow has repeatedly clashed with high-profile Tory MPs in the Commons. Last year he launched a prolonged attack on then-health minister Anna Soubry's. Mr Bercow bellowed at Ms Soubry three times in just 90 minutes, branding her behaviour in the Commons as ‘totally unacceptable’. Ex-minister Simon Burns also crossed the Speaker after describing him as a 'stupid, sanctimonious dwarf’ during a Commons row.","David Cameron's attacks on Labour over unions and NHS cut short .

With the war raging around him, Bao Tran made the life-saving decision to carry the baby he named  Precious Pearl to safety, placing her in an orphanage 60 miles away, People reported. In . May 1972 Bao Tran carried a baby girl he named Precious Pearl to the . safety of an orphanage after she was found in the arms of her dead . mother. Seven years . later, after being freed from a 're-education camp' at the end of the . war, Bao Tran tried to find Pearl but the orphanage had moved. The girl had also already been adopted by U.S. Airmen James Mitchell, who renamed her Kimberley and raised her in Wisconsin.

The young soldier spent seven years as a prisoner in a 're-education camp' but, when he tried to return and adopt Pearl, the orphanage had moved. Bao Tran, now 65, moved to the U.S., married and had a family of his own, but his thoughts were never far from the tiny girl he had saved. Unbeknown to him she had been adopted by American airman James Mitchell, who renamed her Kimberley and raised her on a Wisconsin dairy farm. Although she had a happy childhood, Miss Mitchell told People: 'I'd always wondered was it out of love I was put in an orphanage.' Her questions were finally answered after she was featured in a U.S.-based Vietnamese newspaper. By chance, Bao Tran saw the newspaper and, when he spotted her name, knew he had found his Precious Pearl. 'I called my wife right away and said ""Am I dreaming?"",' he said. 'In the article, it said that she was abandoned at the orphanage but I wanted her to know she was not abandoned,' he told CBS. The pair had an emotional reunion in New Mexico in March, where Miss Mitchell was finally able to thank the former soldier for taking the time to save a baby's life. Miss Mitchell said: 'I was thinking, ""Why would he want to save me?"" He must have love and compassion beyond any comprehension.' Rescue: Kimberley Mitchell's Vietnamese passport, bearing the name Precious Pearl given to her by Bao Tan . Mystery: Bao Tran, who fought alongside Americans during the war, says he never stopped thinking about the girl he saved . The young woman, who was a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy before starting a nonprofit veterans group in Washington DC, hadn't thought much about her adoption until she was an adult. 'I had a happy childhood so I never wondered much about my past when I was growing up,' she said. But, after celebrating her 40th birthday  Miss Mitchell returned to Da Nang to search for her roots. She knew little about how she came to be at an orphanage and didn't even know the translation of the name Bao Tran had given her until she met the nuns who looked after her in 2011. Roots: Kimberley with the nuns who run the orphanage Bao Tran left her at . Servicewoman: Kimberley, who was raised by a U.S. airman in Wisconsin, joined the Navy . After being reunited with Bao Tran, and learning that her biological mother had cradled her as she died, Miss Mitchell realized: 'I was obviously very important to her.' For Bao Tran, saving Pearl and learning that she has lived a full and loved life, has given his war experience meaning. 'I was meant to find Precious Pearl . that day,' he said. 'Finding her again has brought peace to my life.'","Bao Tran was helping Americans blow up a bridge when he saved baby .

These eerie images show how a gothic manor which was abandoned by its occupants has become a timewarp after being neglected for 20 years. The mansion in Hampole, near Doncaster, dubbed the 'doctor's house' by locals, is filled with old magazines, obsolete technology and vintage cars which are rusting away. Its state rooms are falling apart, while the swimming pool is covered with moss. Spooky: This manor house in Hampole, near Doncaster, has been abandoned for nearly 20 years . Garage: This Marcos 1800GT and 1964 Humber Super Snipe Series IV are two of the five cars found abandoned on the property . Crumbling: A dust-covered copy of Which Car is one of many old magazines found lying around the house . Derelict: The state rooms such as this one are completely empty since the last owner departed in the 1990s . The building, which is known as both 'Manor House' and 'Ivy Farm Manor', is believed to have belonged to a notorious psychiatrist who once discharged a patient two days before she killed an 11-year-old girl. Neil Silvester authorised the release of Carol Barratt from psychiatric care in April 1991 even though she had threatened a young girl with a knife and tried to strangle a medic. The 24-year-old patient then randomly attacked schoolgirl Emma Brodie and stabbed her to death in a Doncaster shopping centre. An inquiry found that Dr Silvester had made 'a serious error of clinical judgement' and he seems to have moved out of his Hampole home soon afterwards, although he continued to practice at Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Grounds: The home is set in an extensive garden which looks overgrown and neglected . 'Doctor's house': The home is believed to have been owned by Neil Silvester, a psychiatrist who in 1991 allowed Carol Barratt to leave hospital two days before she killed 11-year-old Emma Brodie . Overgrown: The swimming pool, overlooked by animals painted on an outside wall, is now covered with a layer of moss . Rediscovered: A bottle of moutwash was sitting on the shelf when photographers David Morley and Steve Vernon visited . A hint at the house's previous occupancy is provided by a crumbling copy of the journal Advances in Psychiatric Treatment which was found in the home. There are a number of magazines including copies of Which Car, a 40-year-old issue of Popular Hi-Fi and an edition of the now-defunct Today newspaper from October 1991. The last occupant's interest in cars is shown by the five vintage cars left in the garage and elsewhere on the property, including a Marcos 1800GT and a 1964 Humber Super Snipe Series IV. A reminder of how long the home has been abandoned is provided by the discovery of a Betamax tape, a format which went out of fashion nearly 30 years ago. Rotting away: Cars which could be very valuable if they had been kept in good condition are abandoned around the grounds . Hobby: It is clear that a former occupant of the home was a big fan of cars . Obsolete: A Betamax tape was found at the manor even though the format has barely been used for the past 30 years . Ancient: A copy of Popular Hi-Fi magazine from September 1973 was another old publication found there . Photographers David Morley, 30, and Steve Vernon, 36, both from Doncaster, explored the derelict building which has been left open to the elements. 'It was very eerie inside, the house was just abandoned,' Mr Morley said. 'It looks as if time has stood still. It's easy to imagine that the previous owner left his life behind to start again somewhere else. 'There were five vintage cars at the property. We got the impression that the old study would have been beautiful before it was abandoned. Papers had been thrown all over the place. Catching up with the news: A copy of Today, the now-defunct newspaper founded by Eddy Shah, dates back to October 1991 . Experience: The photographers said that the scene inside the house 'looks as if time has stood still.' Stripped: Some of the vehicles appeared to have had their most valuable parts removed . Scrap: The shell of another car with its seat, steering wheel and dashboard all stripped out . 'There is a big swimming pool in the back but it's now full of grass. The orangery was smashed to bits - there was glass all over the floor.' The Grade II listed building dates from the early 19th century, although parts of the house are thought to be much older. It is not known who currently owns the abandoned home. Neil Silvester, a psychiatrist believed to have lived in the abandoned manor house at Hampole, found notoriety after releasing Carol Barratt from hospital. The 24-year-old had been subjected to a 28-day detention order after threatening a young girl with a knife. However, half-way through the order, Barratt's mother asked Dr Silvester to authorise her release from Doncaster Royal Infirmary. Two days later, Barratt went to a Doncaster shopping centre and killed 11-year-old Emma Brodie in a random knife attack. The killer admitted manslaughter and was ordered to be detained in a mental health unit indefinitely. The victim's family sued the local health authority, and settled out of court for an undisclosed compensation payout. Dr Silvester was order to undergo additional training, but kept his job at the hospital. Unused: It does not seem that any attempt has ever been made to renovate the manor house . Atmospheric: Dozens of photographers have previously visited the house drawn by its eerie reputation .

When times are tough, we all think that little bit longer about where to spend our hard-earned salaries. But it seems that homegrown British businesses have managed to earn our trust – taking nine out of the ten top spots on this year’s list of the nation’s favourite brands. Department store John Lewis, which is owned by its staff, was named the overall winner, climbing from second position into the coveted first-place slot. Consumers praised the company for its service and the quality of its products, as well as its overall integrity as a brand. John Lewis replaced controversial US web giant Amazon – which fell from first to fourth place after facing a backlash for only paying £2.4million corporation tax on sales of £4billion last year. The study of customer perceptions, carried out by analysts Nunwood, also saw British success stories QVC, First Direct, Virgin Atlantic, Marks & Spencer, Lush and Ocado reach the top ten. And one iconic British brand managed to make something of a breakthrough this year – with Butlins rising from 165th to 14th place in the table. Historically, the company was known for its redcoats and a rather cheap and cheerful approach to hospitality. However its owners have spent millions developing new upmarket hotels and apartments, to make it a competitor to the likes of Center Parcs. Nunwood director David Conway explained that Amazon had been tarnished by its decision not to make a bigger contribution to public services in the UK this year. He said: ‘People expressed the view that if a company is trying to avoid tax, then what does that say about their reputation more generally? Amazon is not alone now, there is a lot of competition. ‘If that perception of Amazon holds for any length of time then you would expect it to affect their bottom line.’ By contrast he said that shoppers were keen to reward firms with strong British roots. He said: ‘The idea that in difficult times there is a flight to trust is something that is seen more widely in our study. Buying British: Consumers seem to be valuing homegrown brands over their international competitors . ‘There is a sense of people sticking with British in times of difficulty. ‘The brands that have done particularly well have focused on delivering a really good experience and have a strong British heritage.’ He added: ‘Unquestionably, there is a bit of an aura around John Lewis. The fact that it is owned by its employees has given it a halo effect. ‘Customers have a feeling that the staff try that bit harder and make an extra effort, so they view it as a brand that they can trust.’ Small UK companies to win plaudits included the online wine retailer Laithwaites, founded by Tony Laithwaite in 1969 and the cheap mobile phone tariff provider GiffGaff, founded by Cambridge graduate Gav Thompson. Mr Conway said: ‘These are brands that are both British, but are also identifiable by their owners. ‘There is an almost romantic appeal of British entrepreneurs, who are driving British businesses and making a success of them.’","John Lewis took first place from US web giants Amazon, which fell to fourth placing following a backlash over its corporation tax bill .

When it comes to working very long hours, the Turks lead the way, with the UK eighth in the table . Britain's relatively short average working week is partly the result of an increase in part-time employment . It also highlighted that one in eight Britons spend at least 50 hours at work every week, so Britain isn’t a nation of slackers and ranks well above average in this category. Turkey has by far the highest proportion of employees working very long hours, with almost half of them regularly working over 50 hours a week, followed by Mexico and Israel with nearly a fifth of employees working long hours. Conversely, in the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, very long working hours are rare, with only around one to two per cent of employees working over 50 hours per week on a regular basis. When it comes to overall standards of life, Britain earns a top ranking. The UK equals New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland and Scandinavian countries for personal security, job satisfaction and earnings, according to the OECD.","Britons spend 36 hours a week at work, compared to 48 hours for Turks .

Hero: Reginald Warneford single-handedly destroyed a Zeppelin and was awarded a VC but was left off a commemorative list because he was born in India . A First World War flying hero is to be honoured in his hometown - after a Government U-turn. Whitehall chiefs had banned Royal Navy Sub Lieutenant Reginald ‘Rex’ Warneford from having his name immortalised with an honour plaque because he was born in India. Rex was awarded the Victoria Cross aged just 23 when he became the first person to destroy a Zeppelin airship planning to bomb London. Over Belgium in 1915 he hit the German airship LZ-37 with a bomb sending it down in flames. It was expected that his name would lie alongside that of fellow VC hero submariner Lt Richard Sandford in their home town of Exmouth in east Devon. The stones are part of a Government plan to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of WW1 by laying plaques in the birthplaces of VC heroes. But then they ruled that only those born in Britain would be honoured and Rex was born in India and did not move to Exmouth until he was thirteen years old. There was an outcry over the exclusion of Rex and other foreign-born VC winners. But now Communities minister Baroness Warsi said: 'There are a number of VC recipients who may have been born in India like Sub Lt Reginald ‘Rex’ Warneford that have local ties. 'In cases like this we are happy to provide (East Devon Council) with a commemorative paving stone.' Rex’s nephew James Corkery said: 'We are delighted the Government has changed its mind. Exmouth was the only home Rex knew.' The Government plans to commemorate every British-born Great War VC winner. Rex's hometown honours his memory (right) - now the Goverment is set to do the same . Plans are now being made to unveil the tribute stones in the town’s Phear Park in the spring. Barbara Gilbert, archivist for the Fleet Air Arm Museum where Rex's VC is held, said eastern England had 'lived in fear' of the devastating Zeppelin bombing raids. 'Overnight, Warneford became a national hero and gave us hope,' said Mrs Gilbert. 'Killed in a crash only two weeks later, his death led to national mourning. 'Some 99 years on, it is fitting that we should remember him.' An artist's impression of the daring Zeppelin raid which was celebrated nationally and earned Warneford the Victoria Cross and France's Legion of Honour . Sub-Lt Warneford was born on October 15, 1891, in Darjeeling in the foothills of the Himalayas, where his parents served in the colonial service at the height of the British Empire. He had completed a dozen solo flights when on June 7, 1915, he was ordered to join a four-plane midnight attack on the Zeppelin sheds at Bercham in occupied Belgium. Sub Lt Warneford had never flown in the dark before and quickly lost his fellow pilots. Flying a tiny single-seater Morane Parasol, mostly made from just wood and canvas, he came across airship LZ-37 airship cruising at 7,000ft. The massive bomber was kept airborne by 953,000 cubic feet of highly flammable hydrogen. Rex was armed with just a revolver, a carbine, and six 20-pound bombs. He spotted the airship at Ostend and he followed it for 50 minutes over Bruges before Warneford shot at it. After the Zeppelin dropped to 7,000ft, Warneford was able to climb above it and dropped his bombs, which ripped the airship apart. Warneford's plane was enveloped in flames and he crash-landed 35 miles behind German lines. He found only his fuel line was broken and fixed the problem with a cigarette holder before coolly flying home. By the time he returned to base at 10.30am the next day, his exploits were being celebrated across the empire. King George V awarded Rex the Victoria Cross that day, while France followed up with its prestigious Legion of Honour. He won worldwide fame for becoming the first pilot to shoot down a feared Zeppelin. But he was killed 10 days later after he returned from France after collecting the award in a new biplane that bucked moments after take-off and the pilot was thrown out and killed.","Reginald 'Rex' Warneford lived in Exmouth but was born in India .

Heart-clogging trans fats have been slowly disappearing from grocery aisles and restaurant menus in the last decade. Now, the Food and Drug Administration is finishing the job. The FDA plans to announce later Thursday that it will require the food industry to gradually phase out all trans fats, saying they are a threat to people's health. Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said the move could prevent 20,000 heart attacks a year and 7,000 deaths. The FDA on Thursday is announcing a ban on all trans fats, which will be phased out by the food industry . Hamburg said that while the amount of trans fats in the country's diet has declined dramatically in the last decade, they 'remain an area of significant public health concern.' The trans fats have long been criticized by nutritionists, and New York and other local governments have banned them. The agency isn't yet setting a timeline for the phase-out, but will collect comments for two months before officials determine how long it will take. Different foods may have different timelines, depending how easy it is to substitute. 'We want to do it in a way that doesn't unduly disrupt markets,' says Michael Taylor, FDA's deputy commissioner for foods. Still, he says, 'industry has demonstrated that it is by and large feasible to do.' To phase them out, the FDA said it had made a preliminary determination that trans fats no longer fall in the agency's 'generally recognized as safe' category, which is reserved for thousands of additives that manufacturers can add to foods without FDA review. Once trans fats are off the list, anyone who wants to use them would have to petition the agency for a regulation allowing it, and that would be unlikely to be approved. Trans fat is widely considered the worst kind for your heart, even worse than saturated fat, which can also contribute to heart disease. Trans fats are often used in processed foods to preserve the texture and shelf life of food . Trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants, often to improve the texture, shelf life or flavor of foods. They are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil to make it more solid, which is why they are often called partially hydrogenated oils. Scientists say there are no health benefits to trans fats, and they can raise so-called 'bad' cholesterols, increasing the risk of heart disease — the leading cause of death in the United States. Many companies have already phased out trans fats, prompted by new nutrition labels introduced by FDA in 2006 that list trans fats and an increasing number of local laws that have banned them. Though they have been removed from many items, the fats are still found in processed foods, including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas, refrigerated doughs and ready-to-use frostings. They are also sometimes used by restaurants that use the fats for frying. Many larger chains have phased them out, but smaller restaurants may still get trans fats from suppliers. As a result of the local and federal efforts, consumers have slowly eaten fewer of the fats. According to the FDA, trans fat intake among American consumers declined from 4.6 grams per day in 2003 to around one gram per day in 2012. FDA officials say they have been working on trans fat issues for around 15 years — the first goal was to label them — and have been collecting data to justify a possible phase out since just after President Barack Obama came into office in 2009. The advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest first petitioned FDA to ban trans fats nine years ago. The group's director, Michael Jacobson, says the move is 'one of the most important lifesaving actions the FDA could take.' He says the agency should try and move quickly as it determines a timeline. 'Six months or a year should be more than enough time, especially considering that companies have had a decade to figure out what to do,' Jacobson said.","Food and Drug Administration says artery busting fats are no longer considered safe .

Among his bed-hopping exploits with Ulrika Jonsson, Faria Alam and Nancy Dell’Olio, it was perhaps a fleeting footnote. But the night Sven-Goran Eriksson fled a woman’s flat trouserless after her husband walked in on them naked on the sofa must surely rank among his most embarrassing. It seems the episode is one the unlikely lothario would rather have kept to himself, as it was not included in the English, Swedish, Italian,  Finnish or Danish version of his autobiography, serialised in the Mail. Quite an own goal: Sven-Goran Eriksson promotes his autobiography, the Norwegian version of which accidentally contains the story about how he was once caught naked with a married woman . But the story did make it into the Norwegian edition. The former England manager was caught in the act after a night out in Stockholm with Glenn Schiller, a former player from Swedish team IFK Gothenburg which Eriksson managed earlier in his career, and an unnamed female friend – who left with him. ‘We soon found ourselves naked on the sofa,’ wrote Eriksson. ‘She had not said anything about having a husband, but suddenly the door opened and there was a big man who said: “Who the hell are you?” I said: ‘I better leave,’ and he replied: ‘I think it’s probably for the best’.’ Couple: The affair between Nancy Dell' Olio and former England football manager Sven Goran Eriksson has been well-documented - especially by Nancy. But in his explosive memoir, Sven lifts the lid on his side of their turbulent romance . Eriksson left the flat dressed in only his underpants and shirt, leaving his jacket, trousers, wallet, mobile phone and size 6 shoes behind. He found a size 11 pair of basketball shoes in the stairwell as he fled. ‘I had to take them,’ he wrote, adding: ‘I wonder what would have happened if a photographer had seen me, walking around in nothing but a shirt with basketball shoes seven sizes too big? 'That would probably have created a few headlines.’ To make things worse Eriksson woke up the next morning in the wrong hotel. Staff there had recognised him and given him a room even though he had no money or credit card to pay the bill. The next day they located where he was supposed to be staying and helped him make a discreet entrance through the hotel’s garage. Eriksson said on Wednesday that the story was published ‘by mistake’. His editor Stefan Hilding told a Swedish newspaper: ‘We took bits out and put bits in. The Norwegians have not taken this out. They’ve simply messed up and we are very sorry for this.’","Sven-Goran Eriksson, 65, tells how he was busted by woman's husband .

Boris Johnson today warned the Tories not to ‘freak out’ at the rise of the UK Independence Party, days before crucial local elections. The London Mayor said UKIP’s leader Nigel Farage was a ‘rather engaging geezer’ whose ‘pint and cigar and sense of humour’ appeal and anti-EU policies should not mean bad news for the Conservatives. But Mr Farage sought to escalate the row between the two parties, hitting back at claims that his party is supported by ‘racists’ and dismissing revelations about online rants by candidates as 'silly things' posted after they have 'been to the pub'. Don't panic: UKIP leader Nigel Farage appeals to Tories with his 'pint and his cigar and sense of humour, Boris Johnson said but he warned the Conservatives against 'freaking out' about the anti-EU party's rise . UKIP policies and personnel have come under intense scrutiny in recent days, ahead of council elections on Thursday. Mr Farage’s party is fielding a record 1,700 candidates but has been dogged by allegations of anti-semitism and membership of the British National Party among those standing for election. Two UKIP candidates have been suspended amid claims of alleged racism. Anna-Maria Crampton from East Sussex allegedly made comments blaming Jewish people for the Holocaust, and Sue Bowen is a former BNP member. The family of a former Labour Cabinet minister has defected to the UK Indepdence Party. Liz Shore, the widow of Peter who served as Trade Secretary under Harold Wilson and Environment Secretary in Jim Callaghan's government, has switched to the anti-EU party. She will stand for UKIP in elections to Cornwall's unitary council. Mrs Shore, 85, said: 'I have been against the Common Market since day one and voted against it in the referendum in 1975 – but this is for county not for country.' Her daughter Tacy and and her husband Bob have also moved from Labour to UKIP to stand in Thursday's poll. Richard Wilkins, a candidate on the Isle of Wight, said Mick Philpott, who killed his six children in a fire, should have faced ‘chemical castration’ so he could not have claimed so much in benefits. Chris Scotton, a candidate in Leicester, has a Facebook page endorsing the far-right English Defence League. Mr Farage insisted he did not have the resources to 'vet' all of the party's candidates. 'This is a problem of social media – people get on Facebook, they got on Twitter and very often at night, possibly after they’ve been at the pub or whatever, people say very silly injudicious things. 'And what has happened here is a lot of money is being spent by Tory central office going through thousands of comments made.' A new analysis of UKIP tax policies and spending promises also suggested a £120billion ‘black hole’. It also emerged that both Labour and the Conservatives want to block the UKIP leader from the TV debates expected to be held ahead of the 2015 general election. The Tories appear split on how to . respond to the rise of UKIP, which believes it can reach more than 14 . per cent in this week’s elections. Cabinet . minister Ken Clarke said UKIP was a bunch of ‘clowns’ and he had met . supporters who ‘satisfy’ David Cameron’s 2006 assessment that UKIP is . packed with ‘fruitcakes and closet racists’. The party is also ‘against foreigners, it’s against immigrants’, he added. Almost 10,000 people are contesting almost 2,500 seats on in local elections in England and Wales on May 2 . Fight back: Mr Farage, pictured leaving ITV's studios today, claimed attacks from ministers including Ken Clarke (right) were proof the Tories had 'lost the argument' Labour leader Ed Miliband wants to block the UK Independence Party from having a role in the TV leader's debates, it emerged today. The Tories were already opposed to the idea of giving UKIP leader Nigel Farage equal status ahead of the 2015 general election. Labour had thought UKIP would only damage the Tories' election hopes. But strategists now fear UKIP's 'brand of anti-politics could damage all three main parties in unpredictable ways,' The Guardian reported. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg enjoyed a surge in the polls in the 2010 polls as a relatively unknown figure alongside David Cameron and Gordon Brown. But today Mr Johnson struck a more conciliatory tone, warning the party not to ‘freak out’ in the style of Hollywood actor Nicholas Cage in a many of his films. Writing in his newspaper column, the London Mayor said: ‘Take Nigel Farage, whom I met years ago and who has always struck me as a rather engaging geezer. ‘He’s anti-pomposity, he’s anti-political correctness, he’s anti-loony Brussels regulation. He’s in favour of low tax, and sticking up for small business, and sticking up for Britain. ‘We Tories look at him – with his pint and cigar and sense of humour – and we instinctively recognise someone who is fundamentally indistinguishable from us,’ he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. ‘Omigaaaad, we say to ourselves: they’re stealing our schtick! And we are tempted to do a Nicolas Cage – to overreact, to freak out, to denounce them all as frauds or worse. ‘I think there may have been a few ill-advised insults flying around in the past couple of days.’ Almost 10,000 people in total are contesting almost 2,500 seats in local elections in England and Wales. Election experts predict UKIP could can up to 40 council seats on May 2, with the Tories and Lib Dems braced for heavy losses. Mr Farage suggested the attacks on his party were proof that the Tories have ‘lost the argument’. The Tories swept the board in 2009, turning the electoral map almost entirely blue. Four years on they are under pressure from Labour, the Lib Dems and UK Independence Party . ‘Ken Clarke and others have decided that, rather than going for the ball, they are going to attack the player and that is exactly what this is about,’ he told ITV’s Daybreak. ‘They know that the British public are genuinely concerned about opening up the door to Bulgaria and Romania next year. ‘They are concerned because we have a million youngsters unemployed, we have wages being driven down and I am afraid a crime wave in London being caused by Romanians already. There is a £120billion black hole in UKIP’s election manifesto, it emerged today. It includes a combination of tax cuts worth £90billion and an extra £30billion in spending, The Times said. The manifesto promises to lead the European Union, saving £6.4billion-a-year. But it contains a raft of big spending promises, including boot camps for young offenders, doubling prison places and detention centres for asylum seekers. It also promises a 25 per cent flat rate of tax, axing national insurance contributions for employers costing £50billion, abolishing inheritance costing £.3billion, cutting carbon taxes £3.8billion, allowing councils to keep VAT receipts worth £10billion. There is also a pledge to increase defence spending by 40 per cent, costing £16billion-a-year. There would also be an extra £4billiuon in extra spending on military equipment. Tory MP Charlie Elphicke told The Times: ‘It is clear that there is a £120 billion financial black hole in UKIP's economic plans. ‘If implemented we would end up going the way of Cyprus and Greece much faster even than if we had a Labour government. 'UKIP's wacky policies can only be paid for by a massive increase in borrowing or wholescale sacking of teachers, doctors and nurses.’ The UKIP manifesto also includes county referendums on the hunting ban and a return to smoking in pubs. UKIP leader Nigel Farage recently admitted his tax policy is ‘incomplete… it need more work’ as he claimed the party’s manifesto sets out ‘aspirations’ rather than concrete promises. ‘These are tough subjects to talk about. All we are doing is talking the truth. There is nothing in UKIP that is racist in any way at all and Ken Clarke knows it. If he throws this abuse out, we will start having a proper debate.’ UKIP is investigating a handful of its record 1,700 candidates over links to groups such as the BNP and alleged racist and homophobic comments. Mr Farage, whose party has said it does not condone ‘unpalatable views’, told the programme UKIP is ‘the only party in British politics who does not allow former members of the BNP to even join us as a member, let alone be a candidate. ‘Labour has sitting councillors who are former BNP members, the Tories have BNP members in their party, we forbid it.’ In a high-risk manoeuvre yesterday, Mr Clarke took aim not just at UKIP leaders and their candidates, but also at voters who are considering backing the party, many of whom are disillusioned Tory supporters angry about David Cameron’s stance on immigration and gay marriage. UKIP called the Conservative onslaught a ‘morally reprehensible smear campaign’ last night – but the party has also faced a series of damaging claims about the background of some of its candidates. Asked whether he agreed with David Cameron’s 2006 assessment that UKIP is packed with ‘fruitcakes and closet racists’, Mr Clarke replied: ‘I have met people who satisfy both those descriptions in UKIP. 'Indeed, some of the people who have assured me they are going to vote UKIP I would put in that category. I rather suspect they have never voted for me.' He said he was sure that ‘most of the Ukip people are perfectly nice when they are having a drink’ but added: ‘It is very tempting to vote for a collection of clowns or indignant, angry people, who promise that somehow they will allow us to take your revenge on people who caused it.’ Mr Clarke dismissed UKIP as a protest party, saying: ‘It is against the political parties, the political classes, it’s against foreigners, it’s against immigrants but it doesn’t have any very positive policies, they don’t know what they’re for.’ He criticised UKIP for putting up candidates who have been exposed as former members of the racist British National Party or the English Defence League, who have been kicked out of the party in the past week.","London Mayor says Tories must relax about UKIP's 'pint and cigar' appeal .

The Pakistani Taliban have elected Maulana Fazlullah as their new chief following the death of the previous leader in a U.S. drone strike . A hardline cleric linked to the attack on schoolgirl campaigner Malala Yousafzai has been appointed the new chief of the Pakistani Taliban, it emerged today. Maulana Fazlullah, elected by the Taliban's supreme council, led the militants' brutal two-year rule in Pakistan's north-west valley of Swat in 2007 to 2009, before a military operation retook the area. Pakistani intelligence also believes . Fazlullah is linked to the failed attempt to kill schoolgirl education . activist Malala, who was shot in Swat in October 2012. Announcing the new leader at a press . conference in an undisclosed location in northwest Pakistan, caretaker . chief Asmatullah Shaheen said the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan would not . negotiate with the government 'until it announces the complete . enforcement of sharia'. Nicknamed . 'Mullah Radio' for his fiery speeches over the airwaves, Fazlullah . takes over leadership of the TTP after his predecessor Hakimullah Mehsud . was killed in a U.S. drone strike last Friday. During . Fazlullah's rule in his home area Swat, the Taliban imposed a rigorous . version of Islamic law, publicly beheading and flogging wrongdoers and . burning schools. Fazlullah . fled Swat when the army retook the valley, and is believed to have been . in hiding in the mountains of eastern Afghanistan. Pakistan says he has . directed attacks on its soil from across the border. His men were blamed for beheading 17 . Pakistani soldiers in a checkpost attack in June 2012, and he appeared . in a video posted online in September claiming a bomb blast that killed a . major general. In another video he vowed to do whatever it took to enforce sharia across Pakistan. 'We will eliminate anything that will . get in the way of achieving this goal: father or brother, soldier or . police, khan or malik (tribal elders) or mullah,' he said in the undated . footage. The . decision to appoint him leader of the TTP was greeted with heavy . celebratory gunfire in Miranshah, the main town in the North Waziristan . tribal area. Taliban . 'will be more brutal' The TTP, an umbrella organisation grouping . numerous militant factions, has killed thousands of soldiers, police and . civilians since 2007 in its campaign against the Pakistani state. Pakistani teenage activist Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban for campaigning for girls' education . The killing of Mehsud in North Waziristan on Friday came as government representatives prepared to meet the militants with a view to opening peace talks. It drew an angry response from Islamabad, with Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar accusing Washington of sabotaging peace efforts. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was more measured, but said his government was committed to seeking peace through dialogue and stressing that an end to bloodshed could not be achieved 'by unleashing senseless force'. Targeted: Hakimullah Mehsud (seated second from left), leader of the Pakistani Taliban, was killed in a U.S. drone strike . Sharif came to power in May partly on a pledge to hold talks to try to end the TTP's bloody insurgency, which has fuelled instability in the nuclear-armed nation. Imtiaz Gul, an author and expert on militancy in Pakistan, warned the choice of such an uncompromising leader would spell problems for the embryonic peace process - and a bloodier campaign from the TTP. 'The nomination of Fazlullah is a . continuation of the terror campaign in Pakistan since the creation of . TTP. It means they are not serious about any talks with the government,' Gul told AFP. 'TTP will be more brutal now.' On October 9 last year a masked gunman in Pakistan's Swat Valley . jumped into a pick-up truck taking a group of girls home from school . and shouted 'who is Malala?' before shooting her in the head. Her . father asked his brother-in-law to prepare a coffin for her funeral but . Malala was flown to the UK and woke up a week later at a hospital in . Birmingham. Following treatment she gradually regained her sight and . voice. The world's reaction to her attempted . murder led to the creation of the Malala Fund, which campaigns for . girls' education around the world. She . has since received multiple awards including the prestigious Sakharov . Prize for free speech, which is awarded by the European Parliament . annually in memory of Soviet physicist and dissident Andrei Sakharov. Previous winners include South Africa's Nelson Mandela and Burma's Aung . San Suu Kyi. No clear progress had been made in peace negotiations before the strike on Mehsud, and Shaheen dismissed the whole process as a sham. 'All the drama in the name of peace talks was staged to please America: on one side government wanted to talk to us and on the other side was talking to the Americans in Washington,' Shaheen said. 'We will not talk to the Pakistani government until it announces the complete enforcement of sharia.'Retired brigadier Mahmood Shah, a former security chief for the tribal areas, said Fazlullah's appointment had 'completely changed dynamics of the Pakistani Taliban'. 'Fazlullah was ousted from Swat valley, his hometown, and he is living in Afghanistan. He is wanted by Pakistan, so can he run the organisation smoothly from other side of the Durand Line?' Shah said. The Durand Line is the border with Afghanistan. Fazlullah, believed to be about 39, is the first leader not to come from the Mehsud tribe which dominates the TTP, or even the tribal areas, and Shah said this would weaken the movement's unity. 'There are other groups based in North Waziristan who were helping the Pakistani Taliban but they won't help Fazlullah as he can't even live among them,' he said. The Taliban's ruling council, or shura, took several days to reach a decision, indicating a lack of consensus about who should lead them, but Shaheen insisted the movement was united.","Maulana Fazlullah was elected by the Taliban's supreme council .

The brothers, originally from Cambusnethan in Wishaw, Lanarkshire, were among Scotland's best-loved entertainers. They performed to fans around the world for more than 50 years. In the 1950s, they started performing on stage in a series of talent contests across central Scotland. Jack was an accomplished piano player, while 79-year-old Tom favoured the accordion. They won every competition they entered between 1950 and 1956, according to their fan club biography. The duo then decided to play professionally - taking to the stage at Webster Theatre in Arbroath in 1958. They recorded more than 30 albums - the . first titled Highland Fling - and toured Canada, the United States, . Australia and New Zealand. They retired last year - following an impressive 54-year career - because Jack's health was failing. Both brothers were awarded MBEs for services to entertainment in the 2005 New Year Honours List.

Pressure: A new report had said that the 111 helpline is increasing pressure on healthcare services . The NHS 111 helpline could be putting even more pressure on A&E units - despite being set up to reduce the number of patients turning up at casualty, research has shown. A government-commissioned study found that in some areas the helpline led to an extra 400 patients and an additional 600 ambulance call-outs every month. Research by academics at the University of Sheffield, published in the British Medical Journal, looked at four areas where the helpline was introduced in 2011 and compared the number of patients going to A&E and ambulance call-outs a year later. They found in Nottingham, it led to an extra 400 patients showing up in A&E every month – an increase of 6 per cent – while there was a 5 per cent rise in Luton, which worked out as an additional 200 patients a month. The study also found that in Durham and Darlington nearly 1,000 extra patients turned up in urgent care centres every month, an increase of 8 per cent compared to the previous year. And in Nottingham the centres, which are usually located within normal A&E units, treated 900 extra people a month. The introduction of the helpline also led to an increase in 999 call-outs of between 6 and 11 per cent in all the areas being looked at – in Lincolnshire this worked out as 650 more a month. NHS 111 was rolled out this spring to give patients round-the-clock medical advice over the phone. The Government launched the helpline to replace GP out-of-hours numbers and the NHS Direct helpline. But the study concluded that in its first year, NHS 111 ‘did not deliver the expected system benefits of reducing calls to the 999 ambulance service or shifting patients to urgent rather than emergency care’. It is manned by call centre workers with just six weeks' training - who according to experts have been sending patients to A&E and calling out ambulances unnecessarily. Concerns have also been raised that patients who are not put through to a doctor or nurse hang up in frustration and end up going to casualty anyway. Call centre: Operators are given just six weeks' training before giving out medical advice over the phone . But the Department of Health said the study did not reflect how the helpline is now performing because it only looked at a few areas that had been involved in the pilot. And yesterday the NHS’s top doctor insisted that the helpline would be a solution to the crisis in A&E, saying it would let patients speak to doctors and nurses rather than going to their nearest casualty. Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, said he intends to beef-up the NHS 111 helpline by hiring more doctors and nurses. He also announced a major shake-up of A&E departments, introducing the idea of a two-tier system. This would see about half of A&Es dealing with heart attacks, strokes and serious injuries with the remainder treating less critical patients. The plans will also see GPs offering more same-day appointments and opening their surgeries at evenings and weekends to reduce the need for patients to go to A&E. But the idea has already run into controversy, with critics saying the new system will only end up confusing patients. Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham said: ‘2013 has been the worst year in a decade in A&E. It is a crisis of David Cameron’s own making. ‘It is clear that his decision to scrap NHS Direct and replace nurses with call handlers has added to the pressure on A&E.’","In some areas, the service is leading to 400 extra patients a month .

A new test for prostate cancer could spare thousands of men needless treatment which leaves them with debilitating side effects, researchers claim. The test can accurately pinpoint the less harmful tumours which do not have to be immediately removed by surgery or radiotherapy. Prostate is the most common form of cancer in men. There are 41,000 new cases in Britain a year, mostly among the over-65s. Despite half of all prostate tumours being less harmful varieties, 90 per cent of patients have surgery because they are difficult to distinguish from deadly ones . Around half have a low-risk type of prostate cancer which is not fatal and is highly unlikely to spread to other parts of the body. Yet due to a lack of effective tests, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between deadly tumours and less harmful ones. As such, more than 90 per cent of prostate cancer sufferers undergo surgery or radiotherapy which can cause incontinence and leave them infertile. But a team of British and American researchers believe a new test called Prolaris could spare thousands of men this treatment, enabling them to live normal lives. It costs £1,700 a time but the academics say by using it the NHS would save money as expensive radiotherapy and surgery could be avoided. The £1,700 test can determine whether a tumour is deadly or not and the makers say it will save money on expensive surgery and radiotherapy . A trial of the test involving 1,500 men, which will be presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference in Liverpool, shows that it accurately distinguishes between fatal tumours and the less harmful. Professor Jack Cuzick, a scientist at Cancer Research UK who is based at Queen Mary University of London, said: ‘Over-treatment of prostate cancer is a serious issue so it is essential that we have an accurate way of spotting those cancers that pose an immediate risk. ‘For patients with slow-growing tumours, it’s far safer and kinder to watch and wait. We’ve shown this test is accurate at telling apart these two different tumour types at different stages of treatment.’ The test works by analysing the genetic make-up of the tumour after a small piece has been removed. It then gives the patient a score from –3 and +3, with those at the top end suffering a more aggressive form. Presently the test can only be analysed in a lab in the US state of Utah so doctors have been reluctant to use it as they have to send samples away. But researchers are carrying out further trials on its effectiveness and hope it will be considered by NICE, the drugs rationing body, for NHS use. Dr Harpal Kumar, of Cancer Research UK and chairman of the National Cancer Research Institute, said: ‘Understanding more about the nature of a patient’s tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side effects.’ Last week, figures from Cancer Research UK showed the amount of men dying from prostate cancer has fallen by a fifth in 20 years due to better diagnosis and treatment. However, campaigners say too many men are being failed because of the lack of effective tests.","There are 41,000 cases of prostate cancer in Britain every year .

TMZ Charlie believed it was a burn, although Brooke insisted he had it . before he arrived at her home. According to TMZ, an enraged Charlie said: 'These crimes against my children will be exposed. 'These war criminals will be hanged at dusk to a cheering and jeering crowd, gathered together in love in support of all children who are mercilessly discarded like garbage by CPS. Which by the way stands for 'CAN'T PROTECT SH***.' He even quoted . his actor father Martin Sheen's famous film Apocalypse Now to describe the current . situation, whilst violating his gag order. Charlie allegedly told TMZ: 'I am beyond their timid lying morality, therefore I am beyond caring. 'What . my family and I are forced to deal with in the last four years, lives . outside the pale of any acceptable conduct or decency. 'I am battling an . amorphous enemy that needs to be swiftly disempowered.' Denise, 42, was granted temporary custody of Bob and Max after . Brooke was admitted to rehab for the 21st time earlier this year. The pictures emerged as Denise wrote a letter to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that she will no longer look after the boys because of their violent outbursts towards her daughters and dogs according to TMZ. Violent: While Denise Richards took in Charlie Sheen's sons earlier this year when their mother went to rehab, she says she can no longer care for them after they started attacking her daughters and dogs . The James Bond actress reportedly blames Brooke completely for the boys’ behaviour and TMZ reports she revealed they have lashed out at her and Charlie's daughters, Sam, nine, and Lola, eight, as well as her adopted child Eloise, two. The website says Denise claims her daughters have been 'strangled, kicked in the head and stomach, scratched, bit, slapped, punched in the face and head, and spit on by Bob and Max’. She also alleges they have thrown their own faeces at her daughters. After visiting Brooke, Bob is said to have thrown a toy at Sam which left her needing medical attention.

They . are also said to have attacked Denise’s dogs, with TMZ reporting they . ‘repeatedly kick her dogs in the head and squeeze their heads with both . hands while watching the dogs whimper in pain. Feud: Charlie and Brooke's relationship has deteriorated so badly that she recently sought a restraining order against him while he hit out calling her a 'whore' 'The kids will flip from sweetly petting the dog to strangling the animals and lifting them off the ground by the neck’. The twins, who Denise says often go into a 'zombie-like state', are said to have told her they ‘wanted to hurt and kill the dogs’. But their behaviour is not limited to home with Bob, in particular, reportedly attacking fellow students and teachers at the school they started in November. According to TMZ, Denise attributes the bad behaviour to time spent with Brooke and says the twins suffer terrible nightmares after spending time at her home. Richards claims she has been advised to get counselling for the twins but Brooke has refused to allow it. TMZ reports that the actress took an email to the L.A. Department of Children and Family Services written by Dr. Jay Gordon, an Assistant Professor of Paediatrics at UCLA Medical School. 'As we have discussed, because of recent events involving the boys' behaviour I think that they need urgent evaluation,' the email states. 'I am very concerned . about their escalating violent actions; The apparent lack of . understanding of the consequences and the safety of others is most . worrisome. ' The doctor then recommends 'a complete developmental and behavioural assessment' by a paediatric psychiatrist. But Denise alleges that Brooke is trying to 'block the treatment for Bob and Max' recommended in the email. News of Denise’s letter comes just . after Charlie, 48, branded Brooke a ‘chubby weirdo’ following her failed . attempt to secure a restraining order against him in court on Monday. He . wrote on Twitter: ‘Oh, by the way, nice try this morning Brooke. ‘you . are a chubby weirdo who will lose at every turn trying to get between me . and my boys (sic)’ The parents: Charlie is concerned about letting drug addict and rehab hopper Brooke have access to the twins and has lashed out calling her a 'whore' and a 'chubby weirdo', seen right in September . He also posted a bizarre 'birthday' message to her on Tuesday, even though Brooke turned 36 in August. He . captioned a picture of a grenade on top of a cake with the words: . 'happy Bday Brooke when you're done sucking off the parking lot at Home . Depot why don't ya 'blow' out this candle. c' According to TMZ, the petition claims Charlie said: ‘There will be a reckoning. There will be a whirlwind. That they will all reap while desperate begging for my forgiveness. You've all been warned. ‘I will exercise every resource at my . disposal. I will, I will, I will, I will empty my entire war chest and . if I can't get it done, I know a guy who can.’ A follow-up hearing has been set for next month.

Maternity care is being cut across half of England despite a baby boom, figures show. Five of the ten regions have slashed their budgets for maternity services in the last year with the East Midlands reducing it by 15 per cent. Figures obtained after a parliamentary question by Lib Dem MP Andrew George also show that nine of the ten areas do not have enough midwives to ensure mothers and babies are properly cared for. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said maternity staff are facing ‘unprecedented demands’ and ‘struggling’ to provide safe care. Cuts: Figures revealed that five of ten regions have slashed maternity budgets . Maternity units are becoming increasingly busy due to the rising birth rate, with the number of babies rising by 23 per cent in the last decade. Addressing the College’s annual . conference in Telford, Shropshire, she said: ‘There is not one midwife . practising today who has seen this level of births and demands on . maternity services. ‘I am constantly meeting midwives and far too . often they are telling me of the unprecedented demands on their time and . the struggle to deliver the safe, high quality care they aspire to.’ Midwives are also having to deal with more complicated labours because more  women are giving birth in their 40s - and a higher proportion are obese. But Dr Daniel Poulter, health minister, said the numbers of midwives had increased by 1,300 in the past three years. ‘We have very safe and high quality care,’ he added. Understaffed: The Royal College of Midwives says there should be one midwife per 28 births, but in the worst region the figure is one per 40 . He said: ‘We have very safe and high-quality care and the challenge is that we continue to increase that care.’ The College recommends that within a region’s maternity services there is at least 1 midwife for every 28 births that year. But only one region is meeting this safe-level – the North East – the other nine fall well below. The worst is South Central with one midwife to 40 births, followed by the East of England with one to 35.8. The figures were obtained by Mr George by a Parliamentary Question.","Some regions only have one midwife for every 40 births .

One of Britain’s oldest private schools is set to ditch its £10,000 annual fees and become a free school - blaming Britain's stuttering economy. Pupil numbers at Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School, in Blackburn, Lancashire, have plunged from 1,200 in 1997 to just 478 now as its head admitted today people just cannot afford to send their children. QEGS was founded in 1509 and given its royal charter nearly 60 years later by Queen Elizabeth I, but is now bidding to become a free school, funded by taxpayers. Open to all: Head at QEGS Simon Corns (right) and Chairman of Governors Jeremy Gorik say they must ditch the £10,000 annual fees because it is unaffordable . Yesterday school leaders told staff, pupils and parents about their plans to apply for the change next year. The move has been criticised by union bosses as ‘a cynical move to get taxpayers to fund private education’ while concerns have been expressed on the impact on nearby schools which could lose pupils. Backing: Local MP Jack Straw agrees the school should forget its fees and allow anyone to join . Parents currently pay £10,236 per year . in fees, with around 25 per cent of current students receiving some kind . of bursary. If it becomes a free school the Government would pay £4,500 . per pupil. Headmaster Simon Corns said: 'The local economy is such that it’s becoming increasingly difficult, even for high earning parents, to afford fees for education and that got us thinking about how we can positively move forwards. 'This will allow more pupils to come to the school and receive an excellent education. 'Despite our exam successes, it’s down to economics.' Mr Corns said if successful, the new status would take effect from September 2014 and the final entrance exam would take place in January 2013. A decision is expected next Spring but fees would still be expected for the 2013/14 year. 'We plan to return to around 1,100 pupils, which we believe we will be able to do. 'It’s possible we will get some backlash. However, I don’t think many parents will have chosen the school because of its exclusivity.' Free schools were introduced by Education Secretary Michael Gove as part of his controversial schools shake-up. They receive their payments directly from Government, but are not controlled by the local education authority. Founded in 1509 as Henry VIII came to the throne  - the school survived the Reformation and in 1567 was granted a Royal Charter by Queen Elizabeth I. After moving to a new site in the 19th century its premises hosted early Blackburn Rovers games. The school became know as Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, offering free education, before becoming a fee-charging school in the 20th century. Notable former pupils include footballer James Beattie, Channel Four's Krishnan Guru-Murthy, TV presenter Russell Harty, designer Wayne Hemingway and film director Michael Winterbottom. If QEGS is granted permission it will still be able to set its own extended curriculum, term dates and length of school day. Simon Jones, NUT Union Blackburn with Darwen secretary and national executive member, said: 'Regardless of where they have come from, free schools are neither wanted nor needed. 'They are only going to cause further havoc with the local authority admission planning for school places. 'I believe this is a cynical move to get taxpayers to fund private education that parents previously paid for and that there are plenty of excellent community comprehensives to choose from.” He said the change could also impact on other schools in the area as QEGS would be seeking to take on 600 extra pupils. But Blackburn MP Jack Straw said: “I think it’s very sensible and it will have the effect of preserving the ethos and character of QEGS, whilst making the school more viable for children of families from more modest backgrounds.'","Queen Elizabeth’s Grammar School has seen its pupil numbers plunge .

A boy who stabbed a teenager to death on a bus on his 16th birthday has today been jailed for at least 12 years. Shawn Green, 16, was found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey for a 'senseless act of violence' after he attacked Derek Boateng in broad daylight. Derek, who was on his way home Hackney, died after being stabbed in the heart on the 393 bus in Highbury New Park at around 3pm on April 23. Shawn Green (left) was today sentenced to at least 12 years in jail for the murder of Derek Boateng (right) who was stabbed to death on the day of his 16th birthday on a bus in broad daylight . The incident happened as Green was coming home from Highbury Grove School and saw Derek, a former pupil at the same school, sitting at the back of the bus. Green, from Romford, Essex, admitted stabbing Mr Boateng but denied murder on the grounds that he had acted in self defence. Prosecutor Tom Kark QC said there appeared to have been some 'previous dispute' between the boys. 'The specific circumstances of that may not be very clear and may not matter very much. 'Whatever had gone on before, we say this act was a senseless act of violence. It resulted in the tragic and untimely death of a young boy. 'Furthermore is the sad fact that both the defendant and the victim Derek Boateng were carrying knives and both produced them. 'But the prosecution suggest that it’s clear who was the aggressor in this incident, and that was the defendant.' The jury were shown CCTV footage of the moment Green pulled a knife from his waistband before attacking Derek. After being stabbed Derek remained . standing for a few moments before collapsing from massive internal . bleeding. He was airlifted to hospital but died the next day. After the clip was shown the trail had to be halted for 10 minutes as one juror burst into tears. Mr . Kark told jurors that Green, who has no previous convictions, . 'aggressively' moved past other passengers towards the teenager and . asked 'something of the nature of ‘do you remember me’?' He . said the defendant then produced what was described by witnesses as a . six to eight inch kitchen knife from his clothes and was seen to push it . towards Derek 'two or three times'. 'There was panic, there was shouting and screaming on the bus as the passengers started to realise what was happening,' he said. The fatal stabbing happened at around 3pm as Green boarded the 393 bus outside his school. He saw Derek, a former pupil of the school, sitting at the back and attacked him in front of other passengers . The barrister said Derek was 'very much hemmed in' where he was sitting, but witnesses told of how he tried to move back towards the window in an attempt to get away from his attacker. Judge Peter Thornton QC sentenced Green to detention during Her Majesty’s Pleasure with a minimum of 12 years before parole. The judge said: ‘You were just 15 years old, a schoolboy in uniform, when you stabbed another boy to death on his 16th birthday. ‘With that single blow you took the life of Derek Boateng on his 16th birthday. He had his whole life to look forward to. ‘I have seen no remorse, no expression of regret on your part for the loss of Derek’s life.’ Judge Thornton also lifted a reporting restriction on naming Green, saying that it was in the public interest to know, given that it was a knife crime in a public place. In an impact statement, Derek’s parents Davis and Comfort, who are originally from Ghana, said: ‘The death of Derek has left our whole family devastated completely. Our world has collapsed right in front of us.’ Following the verdict, detective chief inspector Chris Jones, from Scotland Yard’s homicide and major crime command, said: 'It is dreadful to think that Derek, who was celebrating his 16th birthday, lost his life over nothing more than a brief clash with another teenager. 'This dreadful tragedy has left a family grieving for a much-loved son, brother and friend who had everything to live for. 'The incident has also wrecked another teenager’s life and Derek’s 16-year-old attacker will now spend many years behind bars. 'It demonstrates the devastating consequences of carrying knives and the serious harm it has on our communities.'","Shawn Green, 16, has been sentenced to at least 12 years in jail for murder .

A British farmer has cultivated a 'tree of fire' that has yielded over 1,000 of the world's hottest chillies. Joy Michaud, 55, has a glut of the . Dorset Naga chillies on her hands and just one of the pungent red fruits is thought to contain more heat than eight vindaloo curries. They measure an eye-watering 1.2 million units on the Scoville heat scale, compared to a mere 30,000 in the average red chilli. Chilli out: Joy Michaud with a bowl of the Dorset Nagas. The chilli is grown from the Naga Morich, native to north-east India but given a British twist by Mrs Michaud on her farm in Sea Spring Seeds, Dorset . The Naga, originally native to north-east India rather than south-west England, usually has 800,000 Scoville units - the scale used to measure chilli heat. But their heat has been turned up this year thanks to the red hot summer. Mrs Michaud has now submitted an application to Guinness World Records. She started growing the chillies in 2005 and sells the wickedly fiery treats at the local farmer's market - eight for three pounds to the bravest customers. While handling the dangerous fruit the farmer two pairs of latex gloves and a plastic mackintosh to protect her skin from the heat. She also advises that people wear goggles or glasses while preparing the chilli and to tie long hair back. Just a small taste can cause burning eyes, a streaming nose, and uncontrollable hiccups. Warning signs: The chillis come with there own caution, warning customers . of their ferocity while (right) Mrs Michaud smiles next to this years' bumper haul .

Police have been forced to deny claims the force covered up the crimes of a paedophile policeman and allowed him to escape justice for 25 years. Danny Bryant, 65, was finally jailed this week for six-and-a-half years for a decade of abuse involving five boys. Many of the offences took place as he ran a police life-saving club - a role that saw him honoured by the Queen with the British Empire Medal. One of his victims said Bryant abused him from the age of 14 and in 1988 he gave a detailed statement to police when he heard another boy had fallen into his clutches. Tormented Russell Dawson, who waived his right to anonymity, said police wrote back saying they 'did not feel they had enough evidence to prosecute'. His family then considered legal action but an officer allegedly visited them and warned about the 'horrendous ordeal' a civil case would be and they decided to drop it. Bryant continued as a Pc in Devon and Cornwall Police until 1993 when the force was alerted a fourth time to his crimes when another victim came forward. Mr Dawson said his mother offered to help . police investigate the fresh claims but was told they did not need her . help and asked not to call them again. Bryant was allowed to take early retirement the following year on ‘ill-health’ but was not arrested until April this year, when Mr Dawson demanded another investigation, and carried on working with life-saving clubs in North Devon. Bryant continued as a Pc in Devon and Cornwall Police until 1993 when the force was alerted a fourth time to his crimes when another victim came forward . He admitted ten counts of indecent . assault against five boys between 1974 and 1985 and was jailed at . Taunton Crown Court in Somerset on Thursday. Many of the offences took place at the now-defunct Devon and Cornwall Police Surf Life-saving Club which he was a founder member of. Jailing Bryant, of Bideford, North Devon, Judge David Ticehurst said it was 'a matter of regret that the force did not bring him to justice before'. He was jailed this week for six-and-a-half years for a decade of abuse involving five boys . Mr Dawson, 44, who went to court to see Bryant jailed, said the disgraced officer started abusing him in 1983 and the effect on his life had been 'crippling and devastating'. He said: 'It has been incredibly difficult getting on with my life. 'I only wish that the Devon and Cornwall Police had handled the matter differently when I first reported the abuse in 1988. 'I’m sure that would have prevented other children from being abused by this man in whom I had placed my trust. 'People must not be afraid to speak out against their abusers even if these people are respected in their community or hold a position of authority.' Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Dave Thorn said: 'The reason it wasn’t prosecuted was not as a result of a cover-up. It was the result of insufficient evidence. 'Having said that, we are willing to learn lessons if there were investigative techniques which we used at the time were not up to scratch.' Devon and Cornwall police said they voluntarily referred the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission in April. A spokeswoman added that the IPCC had determined that the case was suitable to be investigated locally and it had been referred back to the force. The force said: 'Danny Bryant’s crimes have had a significant impact on the lives of his victims and we are doing everything possible to support them at what is an extremely difficult time. 'The fact that Danny Bryant committed these crimes while a serving police officer makes them all the more serious and an unforgiveable abuse of trust which the public should quite rightly give to a police officer. 'These offences are historic and safeguarding procedures have changed significantly since the 1980s when they have taken place.' The IPCC have been contacted for a comment.","Disgraced former officer Danny Bryant, 65, was finally jailed this week for six-and-a-half years for a decade of abuse involving five boys .

Brooke Mueller's brother Scott has been awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twin sons Bob and Max. The news came after Denise Richards felt compelled to give up her guardianship of the four-year-old boys due to their 'violent behaviour' towards her daughters and pet dogs. According to TMZ, the Department of Children And Family Services signed off in court on Scott becoming a guardian and he will take charge of the children on Friday night. They are also now investigating allegations that someone hurt Bob in regards to a deep cut on his back. Keeping it in the family: Brooke Mueller's brother Scott has been awarded temporary guardianship of Charlie Sheen's twins . But in another twist to the increasingly complex family saga, Scott and the children will reportedly be 'moving in' with Brooke. Sources connected with the case told TMZ that the judge who granted the guardianship felt it was important for Bob and Max to stay in the same school. And with Scott residing in a 'far away' beachside community, 'the judge ruled he could move in with Brooke,' which would effectively give her custody. However, as the website reports, the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services has not yet given Brooke full custody rights, feeling the children should be 'reintroduced gradually,' following her drug problems. Blame game: Brooke is allegedly pointing the finger at Denise Richards for a cut on Bob's back . Brooke had apparently been set to regain full custody of the boys by Christmas. But now, Scott is allegedly set to be moving in to the house once purchased for Brooke by Sheen in his own gated community. TMZ is also reporting that DCFS have opened an investigation into allegations over Bob's injury, which allegedly happened on Denise Richards' watch and Brooke is blaming the Drop Dead Gorgeous star for the cut, that was deep enough to scab over. Social workers went to Bob's school and determined it had been there for more than a week, which means it could have happened while Bob was under Brooke's care, reported TMZ. DCFS then interviewed Denise, who said the cut had been there for more than a week. Taking charge: Brooke's brother Scott Mueller has been awarded temporary guardianship of twins Bob and Max . Scott has also requested '$55,000 in child support' from Sheen claim Radar. 'Scott . has formally notified Charlie Sheen’s lawyer he wants $55,000 in child . support because he has been appointed Bob and Max‘s temporary guardian,' a source close to the situation told the website. 'He . expects to be paid, immediately, even though Charlie already pays for . all of the boys expenses including their pre-school, doctors visits, . etc. During the time that Denise Richards was their guardian, she didn’t . ask Charlie for one dime in child support, she actually turned it . down.' The website reports that Brooke's . child support payments were recently cut in half due to her not being . 'their primary caregiver.' However, she will again be awarded the full $55,000 when she takes on full custody. Still angry: Charlie Sheen leaving court on Wednesday after he was ordered to stay 200 yards away from Brooke . According to TMZ, this is what Charlie has been telling friends about his troubled ex and her family: . 'This pig circus overflowing with buffoons, sycophants and heretics cannot be trusted to safely raise a colony of ferrets.' 'Brooke will fail and her brother [who lives by the beach] will be selling his ass under a pier and the evil nanny will die from ugly.' 'When, not if, this psychotic and desperately irresponsible sham goes sideways, DCFS will burn to the ground, topped off with the smoldering robe of the judge.' Denise, . 42, has been watching the boys as a favour to her ex-husband Charlie, 48 . - who she divorced in 2006 - after Brooke, 36, went into rehab for the . 21st time earlier this year. But this week the former Bond girl wrote to the Los Angeles County . Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) to inform them that . she can no longer look after the boys because of their violent . outbursts, according to TMZ. In a letter, the actress detailed how the twins . tried to strangle her own daughters Sam, nine; Lola, eight; and Eloise, two. She also . complained the twins relieved themselves in their maid's bathtub and . also tortured her dogs. On Wednesday, a judge put a restraining order on Charlie, asking him to not . go within 200 yards of his ex-wife Brooke, from whom he split in 2011. He . replied with a 'thank you'.

Another source had told Radar: 'The . meeting has been called in hopes of convincing Denise to keep the boys . for at least another three weeks until Brooke is scheduled to get them . back.' However, TMZ reported a different version of events - claiming that Brooke and Denise were 'cordial' with each other and are close to calling a truce.

The news of Scott Mueller being awarded custody comes just days after photographs emerged of Bob with severe bruising to his head. The shocking images show injuries on Bob's face, which it has been alleged in a document submitted to an LA court were sustained while the boy was in the care of his mother Brooke or his grandmother Moira Fiore.

If you happened to have walked through Cambridge recently, you may have noticed something strange occurring to the pathways. In particular, a stretch between the city centre and the Grafton Centre seems to be shining in dark with a peculiar blue glow. Aliens, however, haven’t landed. Instead, scientists from Surrey have decided to spray the pathway with something called ‘Starpath’. Scroll down for video . A spray-on coating that makes ordinary pathways glow in the dark could replace street lighting in the future, according to Surrey-based Pro-Teq Surfacing . Starpath is a luminescent, rain-resistant coating that aims to replace street lights throughout the UK. The coating is applied in three layers, with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs UV energy during the day, which is then released as a blue glow when it's dark. The system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together. According to the Pro-Teq Surfacing, the company behind the technology, it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac, concrete and wood. A path across Christ's Pieces in Cambridge which glows in the dark is the first of its kind in the world. The illumination comes from ultraviolet particles in the pavement at the Cambridge beauty spot which absorb energy during the day and release it as light overnight . Starpath reacts to varying levels of light. If the sky is lighter, such as on the left, it won’t release as much luminosity. At night (right) it glows brighter. 'It’s almost like it has a mind of its own,' said Hamish Scott . Unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls, Starpath reacts to varying levels of ambient light. ‘This product adjusts to the natural light, so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances,’ said Hamish Scott, owner of Pro-Teq Surfacing. ‘If the sky is lighter, it won’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly, it’s almost like it has a mind of its own.’ Reports suggest the group could begin to use different colours in order to create a cycle lane during the night. While the technology is currently being trailed at Christ's Pieces in Cambridge, the council sad they are now considering using the path elsewhere in the city. With some councils turning off lights at night, Pro-Teq claims Starpath could be a viable, low-maintenance alternative to keep people safe in the dark. The Cambridge pathway measures 150 square metres and took only 30 minutes to spray the material on. The surface was ready for use less than four hours after the job commenced .","Starpath coating is being trialled on a road in Christ's Pieces in Cambridge .

"Kate Mulvey . PUBLISHED: . 19:39 EST, 23 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:39 EST, 23 September 2013 . Health anxiety: Like many women worried about their health, Kate turned to alternative medicine . Several months ago, I started feeling unusually tired. Walking to the shops felt like wading through treacle, and I would wake every morning with splitting headaches and stomach pains. I got every cough and cold going and the glands in my throat were like golf balls. I couldn't seem to shake off anything and the symptoms went on for more than six weeks. Like many women worried about their health, I turned to alternative medicine - something I had never done before. A few years ago, I would have dismissed alternative remedies as useless, but I was swayed by friends who swore by their nutritionists (and, I admit, celebrity endorsements). I typed my symptoms into Google and many websites sprung up suggesting I had leaky gut syndrome and candida. 'Leaky gut', I read, is caused by a build-up of toxins - including environmental pollutants, chemicals and harmful effects from things such as coffee, alcohol and sugar - as a result of my liver not working at its optimum. Apparently the small intestines become inflamed and irritated, which allows these toxins to enter the bloodstream. The immune system reacts to this, and becomes overloaded, leading to symptoms including infections, tiredness and headaches. Candida is a yeast that can destroy gut flora (good bacteria) and allow bad bacteria and viruses to exist in the gut. Good bacteria is destroyed by a diet high in sugar, alcohol and antibiotics. What the websites suggested was a liver cleanse for the leaky gut (detoxing the  liver to enable it to work properly) and  taking a host of supplements and herbal remedies to improve my health and immune system and tackle the candida. Liver cleanses have become increasingly popular as more celebrities embark on weird and wonderful diets and cleanses to detox their system. I did half question if this could work, but felt so ill I was willing to try anything. And the sites seemed so convincing and dressed it all up in medical language, so I didn't think of going to a doctor. I'd become slightly disillusioned by the NHS as it always took so long to get an appointment, but this seemed quick and easy. Getting healthy this way is certainly not cheap. As I loaded my basket with nutritional supplements and liquids, I was shocked how expensive they were, ranging from £8 to £35 for a bottle of pills. There was L-glutamine, an amino acid designed to repair the intestinal wall; acidophilus pills (probiotics) to keep the gut flora healthy; liver 'support' tablets such as L-orinthine - a non-essential amino acid said to help regenerate the liver and aid the immune system; and milk thistle, a flowering Mediterranean herb used to treat liver problems. Disgusting: Kate's DIY liver detox mixture tasted so horrible, she nearly threw up . Candida tablets and oregano oil capsules to get rid of fungus in the gut were also among my purchases. For the liver cleanse the choice ranged from pre-packaged versions with herbal pills, to more extreme ones using Epsom salts. I opted for the extreme version as it was cheaper, which consisted of Epsom salt 'cocktails' and concoctions of olive oil and grapefruit juice. The Epsom salts apparently detoxify and act as a laxative, while the olive oil and grapefruit juice help detox. I bought these in a DIY kit, costing £10 in total. I started on a Saturday at 5pm, after fasting all day and drinking only apple juice the day before, as recommended. I also swore off coffee and sugar, and refined carbohydrates, cheese and red meat, as recommended by the websites. I took the first dose of Epsom salts and the olive oil and grapefruit juice. The mixture tasted so disgusting I nearly threw up, but I still continued with the second dose two hours later. That night, my stomach was gripped with pain. By 3am I could not move from the bathroom, and woke feeling wretched and my head was spinning. Liver cleanses vary, but with mine I could introduce juices and fruit after a day and a half. By the third day, although the liver cleanse was over and I'd started my supplements, I still felt unwell. I drank gallons of dandelion tea as recommended, which did me no good. The worst thing was the headaches and crashing fatigue that had taken over. By day four, I was also shivering and my muscles ached. I was convinced I had flu. I couldn't get up without feeling dizzy, and although I was managing a few smoothies, anything I ate made me more nauseous. I stayed in bed, drinking water. After six days the worst was over, and although I gradually upped my food intake to include vegetables, chicken and brown rice as suggested, the headaches, fatigue and sore throat continued. Finally, two weeks after starting the cleanse I threw my supplements away and went to see a doctor. He sent me for blood tests and prescribed medication to help calm the stomach. 'I took the first dose of Epsom salts . and the olive oil and grapefruit juice. The mixture tasted so disgusting . I nearly threw up, but I still continued with the second dose two hours . later.' The test results showed I had low lymphocytes. These make up about 38 per cent of white blood cells, and are responsible for immune function - making my low count likely to be behind my initial fatigue and ill health. My extreme and sudden symptoms, however, were the result of the liver cleanse - giving up coffee, sugar and going on a near-starvation diet didn't help. And not eating properly was completely the wrong thing for someone with a compromised immune system. My doctor said having low lymphocytes is not serious and is likely to have been caused by a viral infection. He advised me to rest, eat a balanced diet and take gentle exercise to help my immune system, and prescribed antibiotics as he said I had a chest infection. I will soon have more tests to see if it improves naturally, but if my count has dropped further, other treatments will be considered. But these won't include supplements, as Terence McCoy, a senior biochemical scientist at St Thomas's Hospital, London, specialising in immunology, explains: 'No dietary condition causes low lymphocytes. These mean the immune system is not working and a specialist would be the next logical step.' Bedridden: The liver cleanse gave Kate headaches, crashing fatigue and nausea . It's a salutary reminder about the pitfalls of self-diagnosis online. And as for a liver cleanse, the idea is a nonsense, says Ursula Arens, a nutritional scientist and a spokesperson for Sense About Science, a charity that campaigns for science-backed treatment. 'There is no evidence that demonstrates that the treatments and remedies available have any effect of decreasing toxins,' she says. 'The liver has specific enzymes that break down harmful toxins into harmless substances that are then secreted by the kidneys. 'You cannot influence the rate at which the liver produces enzymes or make them more efficient. The only way to optimise the liver is sensible lifestyle and eating habits.' Limiting harmful substances such as alcohol and tobacco means the liver isn't overworked. I wish I had seen my doctor at first instead of spending £150 on useless supplements and detoxes. It's been an expensive lesson.","Kate's liver cleanse gave her headaches, fatigue, aches, and nausea .

Elite British sports stars have launched legal action against the World Anti-Doping Agency to ensure athletes caught using recreational drugs are treated 'sympathetically'. The Professional Players Federation want WADA to give a lesser punishment to players caught taking non-performance-enhancing drugs than those who cheat. The union, which represents more than 15,000 people including some of the biggest names in football, golf, rugby and cricket, says a proposed two-year ban is 'draconian'. The Professional Players Federation has launched a legal bid to ensure WADA bans athletes caught taking performance-enhancing drugs for longer than those who are found to have taken recreational drugs . It has today launched legal action in a Swiss court - the only judicial body to that has the power to review WADA decisions - to try to overturn the proposal. The union is challenging moves by WADA to punish offenders in the same way for a positive test, irrespective of whether they had used performance-enhancing or recreational drugs . The PPF said the focus should be on trying to help sports stars who take drugs like cocaine and cannabis. Simon Taylor, general secretary of the PPF, said: 'WADA’s treatment of recreational drugs is still stuck in the twentieth century. 'It is depressing that a group who refuse to even recognise the term ""recreational drugs"" is now seeking to undermine the good work that is being developed on mental wellbeing and rehabilitation for sportsmen and women with addiction problems. 'Recreation drug abuse has no place in professional sport but it would be naive in the extreme to think that it does not exist. England rugby international Matt Stevens (left) was given a two year ban for a positive cocaine test while a athlete Mark Lewis-Francis (right) was stripped of a medal after testing positive for cannabis in 2005 . 'Sport and WADA has a ""duty of care"" to provide appropriate support and treatment rather than just ruin players lives and careers with draconian two year bans that prevent athletes even training.' A number of British sport stars have been banned or cautioned in recent years for taking recreational drugs such as cocaine and cannabis. England rugby international and former British Lion Matt Stevens was banned from rugby for two years on February, 2009, after testing positive for cocaine. Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis was stripped of his 2005 European Indoor Championship silver medal after he tested positive for cannabis. He was given a warning by UK Athletics after the body accepted he had not taken it for performance reasons. Other notable world stars to have been banned for recreational drug use include former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis, who tested positive for cocaine in 2007; and former Chelsea stars Adrian Mutu and goalkeeper Mark Bosnich were both sacked from the club after the class A drug was found during tests. Former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis announced her retirement from the sport in 2007 after testing positive for cocaine at the tournament - although she denied taking the Class A . WADA removed clause 10.4.3 (on substances of abuse) from the new 2015 World Anti-Doping Code, which expected to be ratified at the World Conference On Doping In Sport, beginning on November 12 in Johannesburg. The clause recognised that recreational drug abuse was wrong but was different from performance enhancing drugs so should have a lower tariff with a focus on rehabilitation as well as bans. WADA itself had previously noted 'a strong majority of stakeholder' in favour of clause 10.4.3.but it has been dropped. PPF lawyer Dr Lucien A Valloni has filed papers with the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority seeking an urgent review of the decision. WADA's main media spokesman, who is based in the Canadian city of Montreal, was not available for comment.","Professional Players Federation challenging World Anti-Doping Agency .

One misdirected email led an American writer to fall in love with and marry a British archaeologist. Adele Geraghty, 61, sent a message containing a writing sample to lecturer Phil Sidebottom, 66, when his email address was wrongly given as a contact in a call for submissions in her local newspaper. The simple mistake led her on an incredible journey to a new life with Phil in Sheffield, more than 3,000 miles away from her native Brooklyn, New York. Adele and Phil pictured in 2002. She sent an message containing a writing sample to lecturer Phil when his email address was wrongly given as a contact in a call for submissions in her local newspaper. She said: 'It's amazing to think how different our lives would have been, were it not for the incorrectly printed email address. And not just our lives, but our children's lives, and the lives of our friends.' The advert in newspaper should have directed writers to submit their work to an email address beginning 'author45', but instead gave the address as 'author54' - Phil's personal account. Adele recalled: 'I received a reply the next day. 'It was from Phil. He said he was not the person I was seeking, and was worried that his email had been given out illegally because he received a few emails from people he didn't know. 'I thought it was only polite to offer a full apology, and a full explanation. I think he was quite impressed that I had taken the time to write back to him properly, and that began a conversation.' Intrigued, Adele looked up Phil online and discovered he was an archaeology lecturer at the University of Sheffield. Adele and Phil pictured in 2005. After Adele's first email the couple would talk online for five hours a day . The couple pictured in 2006, a year before their wedding . The couple soon struck up an intense cyber friendship, chatting online for up to five hours a day, swapping to voice messaging when Phil bought a computer with a microphone. Adele said: 'We talked about everything - our families, what we studied at university, and how we both liked to write. We could both express ourselves clearly, which allowed us to become in tune with one another. It was as if we were learning everything about each other.' Then, seven months after Adele's first email, Phil suffered a devastating heart attack. The setback only strengthened the bond between them. Adele said: 'I waited by my computer all night for an email from him. In hospital, Phil asked where he could get internet access so he could send me a message to reassure me that he was alright. 'Later that month, I suffered an injury to my back. Even though I couldn't move, I asked my son push my bed closer to my desk so I could keep in contact with him.' Finally Adele, who has six children from a marriage which ended in divorce in 1985, decided to take the plunge and visit England for the first time. Adele and Phil pictured at their wedding in 2007 . She said: 'My son thought I had lost my mind. He was worried that my relationship wasn't real, and that I was setting myself up to be scammed. My daughter was more enthusiastic - she thought it was a great romantic adventure.' Phil, who has an adult son and daughter, was in the process of getting divorced when Adele arrived at Heathrow airport. He said: 'I wondered whether we would recognise each other - whether Adele would be left to wander around the airport lost. 'As soon as I saw her, I stood there beaming. I couldn't believe she was actually real.' Adele said: 'It might be cliche, but it was love at first sight. He was even better looking than he was in pictures on the internet.'

My family emigrated to America from there in the 19th century, and even up until the 1930s members of my family were speaking with British accents. 'To become a UK citizen was a very special moment in my life.' The couple have launched a publishing venture combining their love of literature and archaeology. They have named their independent publishing house 'Between These Shores', to reflect their amazing love story. A collection of Adele's work, entitled 'Skywriting in the Minor Key' was published in late 2010. Reflecting on the twist of fate which brought her together with her husband, Adele said: 'Were it not for those two numbers in the email address being swapped, none of this would have happened.

A 62-year-old zookeeper died this morning after an Asian elephant called Patience charged at him in her enclosure as he fed her. John Phillip Bradford, elephant manager at Missouri's Dickerson Park Zoo, had been with two other keepers in the animal's barn at about 8.45am when the incident happened. It is not yet known what caused the 6,000lb elephant to attack her keeper, who had worked at the zoo for 30 years. Tragic: Senior zookeeper John Bradford was killed by a charging elephant . However, the elephant had a history of aggression, which is why Mr Bradford was accompanied by other keepers while in her enclosure, according to ABC News. 'The elephant charged at him,' city spokesman Cora Scott said, adding that police were interviewing his co-workers to try to find out what happened. Mr Bradford, who had worked with the animals for 25 years, died of his injuries before medical assistance arrived. He had no immediate family but his brother, who lives in a different state, has been notified, according to KOLR10. Assistant zoo director Mike Crocker said in a statement: 'This is very sad day for the zoo family, as well as our community as a whole.' The zoo has not said what will happen to Patience, who has lived at the popular attraction since 1990.

Fraudsters are selling ordinary honey as exclusive manuka honey, the health supplement that has been nicknamed ‘liquid gold’ and can sell for up to £45 a jar. The honey – championed by celebrities including singer Katherine Jenkins and tennis champion Novak Djokovic – comes from bees and hives in a remote part of New Zealand. Its antibacterial properties are thought to help combat various ailments, including skin problems and allergies. Real manuka honey is produced by bees whose hives are placed by flowering wild manuka bushes, which mainly grow on New Zealand's North Island . However, rogue producers and stores have been accused of passing off cheap baker’s honey as manuka. The Food Standards Agency has now issued a nationwide alert to all trading standards departments asking them to watch out for fakes. The main honey suppliers’ organisation in New Zealand believes 1,700 tons of manuka honey are produced there every year, but 1,800 tons are being sold in the UK alone. And they estimated that 10,000 tons of what is supposed to be manuka honey are sold around the globe, suggesting that consumers are paying premium-level prices for misleading products. John Rawcliffe, from the Unique Manuka Factor Honey Association, said: ‘There is potentially huge fraud. ‘There are higher and ever-increasing volumes of honey being labelled as manuka that are not manuka.’ The honey is produced by bees whose hives are placed by flowering wild manuka bushes, which mainly grow on New Zealand’s North Island.

A love triangle that ended with a woman poisoning her husband’s pregnant mistress has ended up in the Supreme Court after she faced a chemical weapons charge for spreading poison on the woman’s mailbox. Carol Anne Bond of Lansdale, Pennsylvania, is being prosecuted on federal charges- because tampering with mailboxes is a federal crime- saying she violated an international chemical weapons treaty and she is challenging her conviction. The drama started when Bond, who is unable to carry children of her own, learned that her best friend Myrlina Haynes announced that she was pregnant. Unusual attack: Carol Anne Bond put an arsenic-like substance on the door handle and mail box of her former best friend and neighbor who had an affair with Bond's husband . But Bond later found out her husband of more than 14 years, Clifford Bond, was the father. Bond, a laboratory technician, stole an arsenic-based chemical called 10-chloro-10H phenoxarsine from the company where she worked and purchased potassium dichromate on Amazon.com. Both can be deadly if ingested or exposed to the skin at sufficiently high levels. Bond combined and spread the chemicals on Haynes' door handle and in the tailpipe of Haynes' car. Haynes noticed the bright orange compound but could not get local police interested in investigating. She called at least a dozen times, but police suggested that she take her car to a car wash and suggested that the chemicals might be cocaine. The law was passed to fulfill the United . States' international treaty obligations under the 1993 Convention on . the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of . Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. The chemical weapons law makes it . illegal to ‘develop, produce, otherwise acquire, transfer directly or . indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, own, possess or use, or threaten . to use, any chemical weapon.’ Justices . went down a long list of everyday items that could be prosecuted under . the law since they could cause harm to humans or animals, including the . use of kerosene, matches, performance-enhancing drugs used in sports, . and even vinegar - which would poison goldfish if introduced to a . fishbowl. Bond's defense team argues that the charge she faces is an example of federal overreaching, and the court agreed with her in 2011 when it first was argued in front of the Supreme Court. Justice Samuel Alito later drove home his point by . saying under the law, even innocent ordinary actions could become . questionable if the government's power is not limited. ‘Would it shock you if I told you that . a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great . number of children?’ he said to laughter from the courtroom. ‘On . Halloween, we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so . it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons’ law.’ When Haynes found the compound on her mailbox, she complained again to police, who told her to call the United States Postal Service. Federal investigators videotaped Bond going back and forth between Haynes' car and the mailbox with the chemicals. Postal inspectors arrested Bond, saying that Bond tried to poison Haynes at least 24 times between 2006 and 2007. ‘The state of Pennsylvania exercised its prosecutorial discretion not to pursue this matter,’ Bond's lawyer said. But . a federal grand jury indicted her on two counts of possessing and using . a chemical weapon, applying a federal anti-terrorism law. The law was passed to fulfill the United . States' international treaty obligations under the 1993 Convention on . the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and use of . Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction. Bond pleaded guilty and was given six years in prison. This is her second time in front of the Supreme Court. In 2011, the court unanimously sided . with Bond to allow her to challenge her conviction despite arguments . from federal prosecutors and judges that she should not even be allowed . to appeal the verdict. Lower courts subsequently rejected the appeal, leading to her current challenge. A . couple of justices were very critical of government prosecutors for . choosing even to prosecute Bond using the chemical weapons law. ‘If . you told ordinary people that you were going to prosecute Ms. Bond for . using a chemical weapon, they would be flabbergasted,’ said Justice . Samuel Alito. ‘It's so far outside of the ordinary meaning of the word.’ Justice Anthony Kennedy said it ‘seems unimaginable that you would bring this prosecution.’ The . chemical weapons law makes it illegal to ‘develop, produce, otherwise . acquire, transfer directly or indirectly, receive, stockpile, retain, . own, possess or use, or threaten to use, any chemical weapon.’ Justices . went down a long list of everyday items that could be prosecuted under . the law since they could cause harm to humans or animals, including the . use of kerosene, matches, performance-enhancing drugs used in sports, . and even vinegar - which would poison goldfish if introduced to a . fishbowl. Fighting the issue: Mrs Bond hired attorney Paul Clement, seen here with Arizona governor Jan Brewer when he was arguing for her immigration law in front of the Supreme Court in 2012 . Alito later drove home his point by saying under the law, even innocent ordinary actions could become questionable if the government's power is not limited. ‘Would it shock you if I told you that . a few days ago my wife and I distributed toxic chemicals to a great . number of children?’ he said to laughter from the courtroom. ‘On . Halloween, we gave them chocolate bars. Chocolate is poison to dogs, so . it's a toxic chemical under the chemical weapons’ law.’ Bond's . lawyer, former Solicitor General Paul Clement, said the law should have . never been applied to Bond, considering that it was passed to deal with . countries. ‘With all due . respect, I don't think that nation-states poison romantic rivals, . attempt to commit suicide or try to get rodents out of their houses,’ Clement said. And since they did apply it to her, it was an unconstitutional overreach by Congress, he said. ‘If . the statute at issue here really does reach every malicious use of . chemicals anywhere in the nation, as the government insists, then it . clearly exceeds Congress's limited and enumerated powers,’ Clement said. ‘This court's cases have made clear that it is a bedrock principle of . our federalist system that Congress lacks a general police power to . criminalize conduct without regard to a jurisdictional element or some . nexus to a matter of distinctly federal concern.’ But . Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan pointed out that since the . treaty was legal, then the implementing legislation would have to be . legal as well, a position Verrilli supported. Highest court in the land: This is not the first time the case is being seen by the Supreme Court, and they previously ruled in Mrs Bond's favor but lower courts rejected it and sent it back to the Supreme Court . Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted that the federal government regulates the use of marijuana. ‘Why is it, if it's OK to regulate the possession of marijuana, a purely local crime, why is it unconstitutional to regulate the use of something that can kill or maim another human being?’ she said. She also noted that federal officials have criticized Syria for that country's supposed use of chemical weapons. Syria is believed to possess around 1,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin. Washington and U.S. allies accuse the Syrian government of being responsible for an August 21 chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb, while Damascus blames rebels. ‘It would be deeply ironic that we have expended so much energy criticizing Syria, when if this court were now to declare that our joining or creating legislation to implement the treaty was unconstitutional,’ Sotomayor said. Justices are expected to make a decision before summer.","Carol Anne Bond of Pennsylvania found out that her best friend Myrlina Haynes was pregnant with her husband's child .

The mother of the heaviest baby born in the U.S. this year recalls her painful final weeks, when she could barely leave her bed. Utah mother Sara Brandon gave birth to son Joel Brandon Jr (nicknamed J.J.) on May 9 at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem and she and her husband were shocked when he weighed in at 14lbs. For comparison, that's the weight of a typical Thanksgiving Turkey. 'It's painful let me tell ya,' she told Good Morning America today. 'My last couple weeks I really couldn't get out of bed.' Scroll down for video . Bath time: Utah mom Sara Brandon gave birth to son J.J. in May and he weighed 14lbs - the heaviest born this year in the U.S. Not an easy birth: The mother of Joel Brandon Jr says her final weeks of pregnancy were so painful she could barely get out of bed . Not what we were expecting: Both parents were 'shocked' by the weight of their baby . Now six months old, J.J. has nearly doubled in weight to 24 lbs - just two pounds shy of his two-year-old sisters. While J.J. isn't the biggest baby born in the world this year, he has been confirmed as the heaviest baby born in the U.S. The largest all-around baby is believed to be England's George King who weighed 15 pounds 7 ounces. 'It really was just a big surprise for us - how large he was,' J.J.'s father said. Because of his size, he needed two doctors to help with the caesarian-section birth, rather than one, and required special maneuvering as he was 'so big and crammed in there', she told the Huffington Post. Big bundle: His mother expected J.J. to weight closer to 11lbs . Big brother: Six months later, J.J. is just two pounds shy of his older sisters . Losing the baby fat: Doctors say that J.J. will slim in his toddler years . In a league of his own: J.J.'s father says 'he's on his own scale' After he was born, he suffered respiratory problems and needed to spend a week in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. But he has since returned home and is in good health, his mother said. At his last check-up, J.J.'s doctor said he was in the 150th percentile for height and weight for his age group - and he's so big that he is wearing the same sized diapers of his twin sisters, aged 2. KSL reported that his size could be because of his mother's Type 1 diabetes or simply because of her family's history of big babies and her husband's height. But doctors said that as J.J. grows and becomes a toddler he'll slim down closer to average size. Together: His mom said his big sisters love to play with him - but he's too big for them to hold on their own . Better now: J.J. suffered respiratory problems after his birth but recovered after a week in the NICU . Comparison: 14 pounds is about the average weight of a Thanksgiving turkey . Big son, little daughters: On the other side of the scale are J.J.'s older sisters who were only 4lbs when born . 'He's just on his own little scale,' his father said. 'You just have to accept that.' 'This big bubba melts my heart,' Brandon said. 'I love him more than I ever imagined I could love a sweet baby boy. He is my squishy cuddle bug.' Brandon joked that she doesn't think she can have normal sized babies as her two-year-old twins were born weighing just 4lbs each.

Ed Miliband’s plan to encourage businesses to pay a ‘living wage’ would put 300,000 young people out of work, a former aide to Tony Blair warned yesterday. The Labour leader will today announce that he would offer tax breaks to firms who pay their employees £8.80 an hour in London and £7.65 in the rest of the UK – far higher than the minimum wage, which is £6.31 an hour. But John McTernan, who helped Mr Blair introduce the minimum wage in 1999, warned yesterday that the policy would be a disaster for jobs and hit young people particularly hard. Political adviser John McTernan who helped Tony Blair roll out the minimum wage in 1999 has warned new living wage estimates will be dangerous to jobs . ‘The national minimum wage was subject to intense economic scrutiny to make sure you set the level at a level which would not destroy jobs,’ he said. ‘The London Living Wage is £8.80 an hour, which is a 40 per cent increase or more on the minimum wage. ‘I don’t think you can increase wages that much without destroying jobs. ‘A study says that if you implement it across the country it would lead to 300,000 young people losing their jobs and I don’t think we can afford that at a time of high unemployment. ‘Many decent people support this campaign. But they are wrong.’ The Labour leader is expected to suggest people are 'working for poverty' in a speech today . Mr Miliband will use his speech today to say that there is a ‘low-pay emergency’ in Britain, with people ‘working for their poverty’. ‘More than five million people are now paid less than the living wage – up 1.4 million in just the last four years to one in five of all employed workers,’ he will say. ‘And low wages aren’t just bad for working people, they cost money in benefits too as the country has to subsidise more and more low-paid jobs with higher and higher tax credits and benefits. ‘Many businesses now recognise that a low-pay economy is bad for them, too. Better pay means lower turnover of staff, higher productivity.’ Attempting to make the cost of living the major battle line before the general election, Mr Miliband will again press his calls for state controls on energy prices. Labour figures – audited by the House of Commons Library, – show how the wholesale cost of energy has risen at an average rate of 1.6 per cent a year since 2011, while the Big Six energy firms have increased retail prices by an average of 10.4 per cent a year. Labour will force a vote in the Commons tomorrow on Mr Miliband’s plan for an energy price freeze for 20 months after the next election. The Labour leader challenged the Tories and Lib Dems to back the plan.","John McTernan warned the policy will hit young people particularly hard .

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' wife has left a scathing one-star Amazon review for a new book about her husband. Brad Stone's The Everything Store was published early last week to critical acclaim, but MacKenzie Bezos disagrees with the praise. She slams the book for inaccuracies, 'techniques that stretch the boundaries of non-fiction' and 'unbalanced reporting.' Critique: MacKenzie Bezos (left) does not think the book about her husband Jeff Bezos (right) worthy of more than one star . According to the Los Angeles Times, Amazon has confirmed that the review was indeed written by MacKenzie Bezos, who makes the disclosure early in her 900-word review that she has been married to the Amazon billionaire for 20 years. For Mrs Bezos, who is a novelist, the problems begin in chapter one. Stone writes that 20 years ago, when Bezos made the decision to leave his job and create an online bookstore, he was reading Remains of the Day by Kazuo Ishiguro, in which an old man looks back on his personal and professional life choices. Mrs Bezos says that in fact, Jeff Bezos did not read the novel until a year after he started the company. Her other complaints are more serious: Opinions that don't fit into the narrative Stone wants to tell, she claims, are dismissed. 'For example, when the author does include people whose accounts of a supportive and inspiring culture contradict his thesis, he refers to them dismissively throughout the book as robots,' MacKenzie Bezos writes. Inside story: Brad Stone (left) is veteran business and tech writer and drew on interviews with more than 300 people for his book (right) She includes examples of positive letters and emails her husband has received from staff over the years to redress the imbalanced impression she feels Stone leaves of her husband. She also cautions readers to beware of techniques that purport to reveal Jeff Bezos's motives. Own write: MacKenzie Bezos (left) is a novelist and has been married to Jeff Bezos (right) for 20 years . '... the book passes off speculation . about his thoughts and intentions as fact. ""Bezos felt…"" ""Bezos . believed…"" ""Bezos wanted…"" ""Bezos fixated…"" ""Bezos worried…"" ""Bezos was . frustrated…"" ""Bezos was consumed…"" ""In the circuitry of Bezos’s brain, . something flipped…"" When reading phrases like these, which are used in . the book routinely, readers should remember that Jeff was never . interviewed for this book...' she writes. In response, Brad Stone has said that he will happily correct any mistakes in his work. 'I talked to 300 people to get a . picture of one of the most interesting and secretive companies around,' Stone said in an interview with USA TODAY. 'I stand by my book. To the extent that I made mistakes I will gladly fix them.' Jeff Bezos reportedly declined to participate in fact-checking of the book and was not interviewed for it. 'While Jeff didn't give me interviews specifically for the book,' Stone told New York Magazine, 'I drew on my discussions with him for the past decade.' According to  TechCrunch, . Amazon was a pioneer in customer reviews and was one of the first . companies to allow negative reviews of the products they sold to appear . along with the listing. So . far Mrs Bezos's appraisal is the only one-star review on Amazon's review . page. Five-star reviews outstrip all other categories, with 31. There . are also 10 four-star reviews and two three-star reviews. MacKenzie Bezos' review, seen here, gave the book a paltry one star rating - and Amazon users have found the screed helpful . 20 years later: Mackenzie Bezos, seen here with husband Jeff Bezos arriving for a conference in July this year, has been around from the beginning of the Amazon story . Two other people well-acquainted with Jeff Bezos have also availed themselves of Amazon's review facility. Jonathan Leblang, director of Amazon’s Lab126, and former Amazon executive Rick Dalzell gave mostly positive reviews of Stone's work. Leblang gave The Everything Store four out of five stars, and Dalzell gave it three. Stone told New York Magazine that while he wasn't pleased to see a one-star review of his book, he feels his account is a much more accurate representation of Bezos and Amazon than what MacKenzie Bezos believes. 'I can assume I’m less biased than Jeff Bezos’s wife,' he said.","MacKenzie Bezos left a one-star review of a new book about her husband, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos .

David Cutler has now shared a copy of the memo that he sent three years ago with CBS, showing how called for the inefficiencies to be addressed but was ignored. Head start: Healthcare advisor David Cutler sent a memo to Larry Summers warning him of the problems with the proposed healthcare roll out in May of 2010 . 'I do not believe the relevant members of the Administration understand the President's vision or have the capability to carry it out,' Cutler wrote in a memo to Summers, who was working as a top White House economic advisor at that point. In the wake of the massive technical problems with the website, there have been a number of memos and documents released showing the waves of unheeded warnings. The most explicit of which came from the tech contractors hired out to create and test the website before the launch on October 1. The September 6 report states that they viewed it as a 'near certainty' that problems would result from their 'limited testing timeframes' and the small number of predetermined scenarios that they were given for trouble shooting. Blame game: Larry Summers, who previously served as the Treasury Secretary, was heading up the White House National Economic Council at the time that he received the memo . The major differences between that . report, which was directed to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid . Services, and the memo written by Cutler are the time and direction. Mr Cutler's memo was written more than three years before the contractor's report, and he sent it directly to Summers. Mr Summers went on to serve as the head of the White House's National Economic Council, meaning that he worked closely with the administration and should have been able to alert his colleagues about the stern warning as they crafted their public message. 'You need to have people who have understanding of the political process, people who understand how to work within an administration and people who understand how to start and build a business, and unfortunately, they just didn't get all of those people together,' Mr Cutler told CBS News. 'It is frustrating any time you really want to see something succeed because you believe it's good for people, and it doesn't get off on the right foot.' Under fire: The President's Healthcare website has been up for more than a month and he continues to ignore calls for it to be taken down and rebooted given the major technical problems .","President Obama's healthcare aide sent a memo to then-White House advisor Larry Summers in May 2010 .

A property tycoon embroiled in a High Court cash fight with his estranged wife is still worth £700m despite claiming he lost a fortune as his marriage collapsed, a judge was told yesterday. Businessman Scot Young, 51, who is in a financial dispute with Michelle Young, 49, over his fortune, claims he is bankrupt with debts adding up to £28m. But a financial investigator told Mr Justice Moor that Mr Young has in fact 'restructured his empire' and moved assets around in the wake of his separation from wife. Burke Files alleges the property magnate is still worth at least £700m and claimed he has seen a note written by Mr Young about securing $4.8bn (£2.8bn) profit in Facebook. He told the court this note had been seized during a search of Mr Young's hotel room. Battle: Michelle Young, 49, pictured left, told a High Court . judge that her estranged businessman husband Scot, pictured right, is still worth 'a few billion at least' despite claiming he is bankrupt . He continued: 'I have seen a Post-It note talking about a $4.5bn profit in Facebook.' But he said there had been no disclosure to add the Facebook profit to his assets. Mr Files, who was asked to investigate Mr Young's finances by his wife, said the practice of moving financial assets around was 'not unusual in the least bit'. He added: 'The money is a tool. It goes back into the system to be used. The velocity of the money circulation ... can only be guessed.' Mrs Young says she enjoyed a 'very luxurious' lifestyle before separating from Mr Young in 2006 and estimates he is worth 'a few billion at least' and says 'there was a vast fortune hidden'. She says she wants her 'fair share' and would settle for £300m plus legal expenses. She says she wants a £25m house and wants to live in Belgravia, central London. Mr Young disputes Mrs Young's claims . and has said he is 'penniless and bankrupt', a victim of 'financial . meltdown' and 'hopelessly insolvent'. Mr Justice Moor will have to decide how much Mr Young is worth. The judge has heard that the Youngs, who . both live in London and have two daughters, separated in 2006 after . starting a relationship in 1989. They have been fighting over money for . several years. Lengthy court case: Property magnate Scot Young, pictured arriving for the first day of the High Court battle on October 31, claims he is a victim of 'financial meltdown' Mr Young's current partner Noelle Reno told the court they have been in a relationship since since 2009 and are living together in a rented property. She said the rent was about £4,000 a month and one of Mr Young's friends - 'named Nick' - paid the bill. Miss Reno also said she had loaned Mr Young £25,000 and that she paid the utility bills and for shopping. 'I am not supporting him,' she told the court. 'I have loaned him some money. I pay the utility bills. I pay for the Tesco shopping.' Catherine Thomas, representing Mr Young's wife Michelle said the £25,000 loan was in cash and asked why. 'Maybe he had an arrangement with the person to pay them cash,' said Miss Reno. 'Maybe he didn't want me to know who the person was.' The lawyer asked why someone who was bankrupt would owe such a sum and suggested Miss Reno was being 'misleading'. 'I am absolutely not misleading you,' she said. 'I try to get involved as little as possible.' She added: 'I am being persecuted for helping someone. I have my own problems. I'm being dragged into this. I don't want to know.' Ms Thomas suggested she was a 'cash courier'. She replied: 'I have not been acting as a cash courier for Mr Young.' She added: 'I know that he wants to support his daughters. It kills him that he can't. And he wants to support Michelle.' But Miss Reno added: 'Nobody wants to do business with Scot right now.' Ms Thomas asked why Mr Young 'can't go and get a job in Tesco?' Miss Reno replied: 'Even Tesco probably wouldn't want to get involved.' Mr . Justice Moor has expressed concern about the legal costs being run up . in the High Court cash fight and said he had no doubt that he was 'going . to be saying something' about costs incurred in the dispute. The . trial - being held in the Family Division of the High Court in London - . began on October 31 and is expected to last several weeks. 'I have no doubt I am going to be saying something about the costs in this case,' the judge told the court today. 'It has concerned me, the amount of costs being run up in this case.'

A new drama about the English teacher who was held over the murder of Jo Yeates has begun filming. Trollied star Jason Watkins had shoppers doing a double take as he walked the streets in his latest TV role about Christopher Jefferies, who was arrested on suspicion of killing the 25-year-old. Watkins bears an uncanny resemblance to the landlord, 68, who was arrested following the murder of the landscape architect Jo at Christmas 2010. Actor Jason Watkins on the set of 'The Lost Honour' in Clifton playing  landlord Christopher Jefferies . The Lost Honour is a two-part dramatisation of the ordeal 68-year-old Christopher Jefferies went through after Joanna Yeates was murdered in December 2010 . The dramatisation is written by Peter Morgan, who wants to make sure no-one forgets that Mr Jefferies was never charged . ITV are creating a new two-part dramatisation called ‘The Lost Honour’ - with doppelganger Jason Watkins, from Sky 1s  'Trollied' and BBC Three’s ‘Being Human’, playing Mr Jefferies. The lookalike was today seen wandering around the streets of quaint Clifton, in Bristol. The drama begins the day before Jo disappeared and follows Mr Jefferies through his arrest, release and subsequent isolation. As filming began Jason Watkins, dressed all in black, could be seen buying a loaf of sourdough bread in one scene, and walking along famous Clifton streets in another. The dramatisation is written by Peter Morgan, Bafta-winning writer of Frost/Nixon and The Queen, and directed by Roger Michell, director of ‘Notting Hill’ and ex-pupil of Jefferies’. Christopher Jefferies, seen on the left in 2010, is fully behind the project and has read and approved the script . 'No-one will ever forget the man with the eccentric hair who became so connected with the murder of Joanna Yeates,' Mr Morgan said. 'I want to make sure no-one forgets the same man who was acquitted, who fought back to clear his name and became a very British kind of hero.' In fact Mr Jefferies was never charged, let alone tried and acquitted. Mr Michell added: 'It’s a story that celebrates our right to be eccentric and it also, as it happens, is the story of a rather brilliant man, who was once my English teacher.' Mr Jefferies is fully behind the project and has read and approved the script. Scenes such as the police interrogation are based on transcripts from the interviews he actually had. Producer Kevin Loader said: 'This is about what it’s like to be accused of a crime you know you didn’t commit and being in police custody, not realising you’ve become the most famous man in Britain for all the wrong reasons.' Joanna Yeates, 25, was killed by neighbour Vincent Tabak, who was jailed for a minimum of 20 years . Jo disappeared from her home in Bristol after going for Christmas drinks with work colleagues. Her body was found dumped on a verge in north Somerset, on Christmas Day . Filming will also take place at Bottle Yard Studios, where Mr Jefferies’ flat and police interview rooms have been recreated. The two-part drama is being made by Carnival Films and will be screened on ITV1, late next Spring. In a bid to be as realistic as possible, Mr Watkins’ balding hair has been dyed to match how Mr Jefferies looked after he had been exonerated. Ms Yeates' body was found by walkers on Christmas Day 2010 after she vanished from home eight days before on December 18. Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak, Ms Yeates’ neighbour, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years in October 2011 after being found guilty of her murder.","Jason Watkins plays Christopher Jefferies who was arrested on suspicion of Jo Yeates' murder .

Fanatic fiasco: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed gave police the slip by entering a London mosque in his regular clothes - then leaving disguised in a burka . A new tagging fiasco has plunged the monitoring of Britain’s most dangerous terror suspects into chaos. Three men who were accused of tampering with their supposedly state-of-the-art monitoring equipment walked free from court after their lawyers successfully argued the tags were ‘faulty’. One of the men – Al Qaeda-trained fanatic Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed – was last night the subject of an international manhunt after going on the run only a few hours after the case collapsed. After being freed, the 27-year-old jihadist gave police the slip by entering a London mosque in his regular clothes – then leaving disguised in a burka. Lawyers for the Somali-born British citizen had claimed he had damaged his electronic tag when kneeling down to pray. The other two men involved in the tagging case are a fanatic linked to the foiled 2006 airline liquid bomb plot and an Iranian explosives expert. The shocking revelations have led to a review of the tagging regime. Last night there were also demands from MPs for the burka to be banned. Tory MP Philip Hollobone said the burka had proved the ‘most complete disguise for a Muslim terrorist suspect’. On a day of drama at Westminster, Home Secretary Theresa May appeared before MPs to explain what had gone so badly wrong with the monitoring of Mohamed. He is linked to the Al-Shabaab terror group and is accused of plotting attacks against Western interests in east Africa. Mohamed was under a terrorism prevention and investigation measures order, or T-Pim, to restrict his movements. Along with eight other men who are the subject of a T-Pim, the conditions included wearing a new GPS electronic tag, which allow their every step to be tracked on a computer screen. Mohamed, along with two other terror suspects, was accused of tampering with his tag – a crime which potentially carries a five-year jail term. But last week the case against all three men collapsed when the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence. Defence lawyers say that the cases had to be dropped because the design of the new tags is flawed. They say that the tags do not appear to have been stress-tested to cope with a devout Muslim who prostrates himself in prayer five times a day. Faulty: Mohamed, along with two other terror . suspects, was accused of tampering with his tag. But their lawyers . successfully argued the devices were damaged by the stress of the . five-times-a-day Muslim prayers . Caught on CCTV: Mohamed entered the An-Noor Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in Acton, West London, at 10am. He was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a burka (right) It was in the immediate aftermath of . the verdict in his case on Friday that Mohamed entered the An-Noor . Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in Acton, West London, at 10am. He was last seen inside the mosque at 3.15pm before leaving disguised in a burka. Somali-born Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, has been linked to the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab – the extremists behind the Kenyan mall massacre – and is accused of plotting attacks on Western interests in east Africa. It is understood he took part in terrorist training in 2008 and is believed to have helped various individuals travel from the UK to Somalia to allow them to engage in terrorism-related activity. Mohamed, who is 5ft 8in and of medium build, is also suspected of helping to plan attacks in Somalia and overseas, including an attack intended for the Juba Hotel in Mogadishu in 2010. He is thought to be a member of a UK-based network which had access to money, false passports and documentation, as well as equipment, and is understood to have procured funds and weapons for terrorism uses for the network. It emerged last night that he repeatedly purchased phone cards used to call contacts overseas in the weeks before he fled. He bought the international Lycamobile cards from a newsagent close to the An-Noor Masjid Mosque and Community Centre in West London – the same mosque from which he made his escape dressed in a burka last Friday. The purchase of the phone cards will fuel suspicions he had long been plotting to escape abroad, possibly back to his Al-Shabaab associates in Somalia. It was also revealed last night that the son of extradited hate preacher Abu Hamza is viewed as a local ‘celebrity’ at the mosque. Uthman Mustafa Kamal was said to have built up a following at the mosque. He has also prayed for holy war in a video uploaded to the mosque’s YouTube site. The case immediately led to an on-going international manhunt. Security officials fear he may already be overseas. In the Commons, Shadow Home Secretary . Yvette Cooper demanded to know the role the tagging fiasco had played, . asking: ‘Why did the Government drop the case? Were the tags faulty?’ She . also attacked the T-Pims which the Coalition introduced as an . alternative to Labour’s control orders. Mohamed is the second man to . flee while under a T-Pim in only ten months. Unlike . control orders, it is no longer possible for the police and security . services to force a terror suspect to relocate to another part of the . country and so break up their support network. Mohamed, . who had originally been subject of a control order and moved out of . London, was allowed to move back when T-Pims came into force in January . 2012. Miss Cooper said: ‘This Home Secretary has made it easier for terror suspects to disappear and that is irresponsible.’ Mrs May denied T-Pims had put the public at risk and said Mohamed’s tag was thought to have be working correctly when he absconded. Officials were aware he may have gone on the run on Friday afternoon and began urgent work to track him. His identity was made public on Sunday night. The Ministry of Justice said it was investigating whether ‘a very small number of GPS tags currently in use ... may be overly sensitive to tamper alerts’. █ The Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the Government’s multi-million-pound contracts with security firms G4S and Serco for tagging criminals. An audit suggested that the companies had been charging for tagging criminals who were either dead, in jail or never tagged in the first place. In some cases bills continued to be paid for months or years after tags were taken off, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told MPs. Both G4S and Serco said they would ‘co-operate fully’ with the investigation. ANALYSIS by JAMES SLACK . Fiasco: Nick Clegg's insisting control orders must be significantly watered down may have paved the way for Mohamed's escape from custody . It was Theresa May who was dragged to the Commons yesterday to explain how another terrorism suspect had been allowed to slip through the net. But this is a fiasco covered in the fingerprints of Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister. When the Coalition was formed in 2010, both sides committed to a review of Labour’s controversial control order regime, which allowed fanatics to be placed under virtual house arrest. They could be made to stay indoors for up to 16 hours a day, banned from having computers and mobile phones and – crucially – forced to relocate to another part of the UK. Months of wrangling between the Tories and Lib Dems followed, with Mr Clegg insisting control orders must be significantly watered down. Mrs May fought hard on behalf of the security services, but, in order to keep the overnight curfew element of the control orders (albeit reduced to ten hours), she was forced to sacrifice the power of relocation. Labour now insists she is paying a heavy price for this compromise – which stripped MI5 of a powerful tool that could be used to break up terrorist support networks. As we report today, Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed had previously been the subject of a relocation order when he was subject to a control order. But, under the T-Pim regime insisted upon by Mr Clegg, he was free to move back to London in early 2012. Would he really have been able to plot his escape – or get away so easily – had he been living in a smaller town or city, without having his associates and support network close by? What is certain is that he is not the first terror suspect to vanish after having his relocation order quashed. Ibrahim Magag – an associate of Mohamed, who attended training camps in Somalia – had been sent from London to live in the west of England under the terms of his control order. Back in the capital, he gave the police the slip by jumping into the back of a black cab in London’s Triton Street on Boxing Day 2012 and hasn’t been seen since. The fanatic is now understood to be abroad. Heavy price: But it was Home Secretary Theresa May who had to answer to the Commons about it yesterday . Mrs May says the scrapping of the relocation power should not be blamed, pointing out that under Labour’s control orders there were seven absconds and six of the suspects were never apprehended. Currently there are nine terror suspects, including Mohamed, subject to a T-Pim, which are used against those who cannot be prosecuted in court because there is insufficient admissible evidence. Normally, this is because handing the evidence to suspects would expose secret intelligence gathering techniques or put agents’ lives at risk.","Three men accused of tampering with tags walk free after lawyers argue it was their regular prayer that interfered with the devices .

It is believed Chen's gang are also responsible for smuggling shipments through Hong Kong where illegal loads have been seized in recent months. Several members of his group were also arrested and almost 2,000 kilograms of ivory was seized in August. A man called Mr Liu was named as the second black market boss who is being investigated by  Xiamen Customs Anti-smuggling Bureau. Ivory is seen as a symbol of wealth and status in China, and has become increasingly popular in recent years with the growth of the wealthy middle class. Seized: Customs officers look at some of the 3,188 pieces of ivory which was intercepted in Xiamen City, China . Three Chinese nationals were arrested in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Tuesday after nearly 800 tusks were found hidden in bags of garlic at their homes. According to a recent survey by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, 70 per cent of Chinese people did not know that elephants are killed for ivory products. The survey revealed that most thought elephants lost tusks in the same way humans lose teeth. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said at a news conference on Tuesday that China was committed to working with the international community to protect wildlife. The U.S. is the world's second largest consumer of ivory products behind China.","The 3,188 pieces of elephant tusks have an estimated value of 603 million Yuan on the black market .

Interacting with the touchscreen machines not only interests and challenges the animals, but keeps dominant members of the group busy, which mirrors life in the wild and relieves social tension. Researchers studied a social group of Sulawesi crested macaques at Marwell Wildlife, Hampshire, to come up with their findings. Researchers studied a social group of Sulawesi crested macaques at Marwell Wildlife Park to come up with their findings. Here, one of the dominant monkeys relaxes by playing with the touchscreen . The scientists, from the University of Portsmouth, taught the rare monkeys to operate computer touchscreens so they could conduct studies to understand the animals' cognition and communication. The researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques, using touchscreen computers, has improved the group’s cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour. Lead scientist on the study, Jamie Whitehouse, from the university’s Department of Psychology, said: 'Having one individual leave the group mimics conditions in the wild when it’s common for a lone macaque to break off and return later. The researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques, using touch screen computers, has improved the group¿s cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour . Natural habitat: Tropical forest and mangrove swamps . Diet: Bark, roots, bulbs, fruit and leaves; also, insects and other invertebrates, small reptiles and birds’ eggs . Behaviour: The monkeys live in small groups on the forest floor. They signal to one another by using a variety of calls, facial expressions and by raising and lowering their crests . Threats: Hunting for food and habitat destruction . 'At Marwell it’s usually the dominant macaques leaving the group to use the touchscreens, which leaves the others to enjoy some time without the top ranking animals.' Just like humans and many other primates, macaques use complex social interactions. Sulawesi crested macaques, native to Indonesia, employ sophisticated and subtle communication techniques, relying on many different facial expressions, body positioning and vocalisations to make themselves understood, according to the study published in the journal PLOS ONE. Mr Whitehouse said: 'We can use our understanding of their social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare.' The research shows that when dominant individuals leave the group, the ‘lipsmacking’ behaviour of the other macaques increases – where they protrude their lips and then smack them together repeatedly. The monkeys were able to choose between images and videos of their species displaying different facial expressions . Mr Whitehouse said: 'This behaviour is a friendly gesture between the macaques, which they use to maintain their social bonds. 'The fact that this increases on days when they are taking part in our studies, shows that our research is having a positive effect on the group.' The macaques live in their social group and can voluntarily enter a specialised research area, separate from the researcher. The animals are free to end the sessions whenever they like and return to their daily activities. They receive food treats – tiny amounts of healthy titbits – when they take part in the studies. The scientists plan on using their understanding of the monkey's social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare .","University of Portsmouth scientists taught macaques to use tablets so they could understand the animals' cognition and communication .

If those fine lines on your face appear to be multiplying, it may be that your mother is to blame. Scientists have found a set of genes passed down only by mothers that appear to influence the ageing process. When the inherited DNA is defective, the result is premature ageing – not only wrinkles but a shorter lifespan – a study says. The researchers discovered that damage to our mitochondria – the tiny powerhouses in our cells that turn the food we eat into energy – speeds up age-related conditions. Scroll down for video . Like mother, like daughter: It is not hard to believe that Gwyneth Paltrow, 40, inherited her apparent ability to remain ever-youthful from her mother Blythe Danner, who looks still looks glowing at age 70 . Teams from Sweden and  Germany found . the ageing process is influenced not only by the  accumulation of . mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) damage during a person’s lifetime, but also by . any genetic mutations inherited from their mother. Normal and damaged DNA  is passed down from generation  to generation. But while the DNA that influences how . we develop comes from both parents and is held within a cell nucleus, . the genes in mitochondria are entirely separate and come only from our . mother. Following experiments on  mice, the . researchers found defective mDNA can result in serious genetic diseases. But even mild inherited damage can accelerate the ageing process. Writing in the journal Nature, lead . researcher Professor Nils-Goran Larsson from the Karolinska Institute in . Sweden, said: ‘Our mother’s mitochondrial DNA seems to influence our . own ageing. If we inherit mDNA with mutations from our mother, we age . more quickly. With Demi Moore as a mother Rumer Willis (left) has little to worry about as she gets older . ‘Ageing is the accumulation  of . various types of cell damage. Much of the damage will be a result of . environmental and lifestyle  factors, which means the inheriting mDNA . damage can never be  the only explanation for ageing. But it is an . important part of the ageing process.’ Mitochondria, the power houses of every cell, may be responsible for how we age . Defective mDNA is implicated in a . host of age-related diseases such as heart problems, diabetes and . neurodegenerative conditions including dementia. Over the course of our . lifetime mDNA is more susceptible to damage than normal DNA, the . researchers said. When inherited mutations are added to those that occur naturally, it can cause us to age prematurely. Ageing comes about as a result of . damage to the body’s cells, making it more likely for an individual to . suffer from an age-related disease or condition such as cancer, heart . problems – as well as wrinkles. Professor Doug Turnbull of Newcastle . University, an expert on mitochondria, said: ‘This is very interesting. The genes you inherit can have some effect on the ageing process, but . the most important factor still remains your lifestyle.’ Although damaged mDNA passed down . from a mother to children could influence the ageing process, it is . still unclear to what extent. But the research could help scientists . find ways to slow the ageing process in humans using drug treatments, . diets or supplements. A co-author of the study, Dr Barry .

Missing: Police fear for the safety of Jaidon Hill, 7, who vanished with his mother and step-father . The hunt for a missing Mississippi family has ended in tragedy after detectives found three bodies in an abandoned house near the spot where the family's SUV crashed and burned. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation arrested 42-year-old Timothy Lydell Burns Tuesday after he led authorities to the remains of Jaidon Hill, 7; his mother, Atira Hughes-Smith, 30; and his step-father, 34-year-old Laterry Smith in rural Copiah County. All three were shot to death. However, police have not commented on the circumstances of their deaths or why Burns allegedly killed them. It is not known whether Burns knew the three victims or whether he was a stranger. The circumstances of the disappearance of Hill, Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith has baffled police every since they vanished Friday night. Hours later, the family's SUV was found burned out and flipped on its roof in a ditch along side a rural road. WDBD-TV showed video of detectives carrying three body bags out of the woods near the abandoned, run-down house Tuesday. On Monday Mrs Hughes-Smith's ID, clothes and other belongings were found in a garbage Dumpster outside a grocery store in nearby Jackson, Mississippi. Suspicious: Atira Hughes-Smith, 30, (left) told her family she was leaving town with her husband Laterry Smith, 34, (right) before they vanished . The Jackson Clarion-Ledger reports that the garbage bin is near the house where Laterry Smith's mother and two sisters lived. The three family members reportedly had moved out of the house on Sunday night after the family was reported missing. Jaidon, . Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith were last heard from Friday night when . Mrs Hughes-Smith called family members to say she was leaving town for a . few days. However, the call abruptly dropped. On Saturday morning, police found the family's burned out SUV overturned in a ditch. The vehicle was charred and its front-bumper was smashed and it was resting on its roof. The family was nowhere to be found and there are no clues as to what may have happened to them.

Police initially thought that Mrs Hughes-Smith and Mr Smith torched the truck as a form of insurance fraud - a practice not uncommon in the area. However, they have since ruled out that explanation. Jones will not say whether he believed foul play is involved, though he will not rule it out, either. Jaidon is 3 feet tall, 44 pounds, black skin and brown eyes.

According to Canada Star, Doriana Silva says in her claim that shortly after starting her job, she was given just three weeks to type up 1,000 'fake female profiles' meant to lure in male customers, which in turn caused her to develop severe pain in her wrists. The company apparently refused to grant her workers' compensation for the injuries, and now she is seeking a share of the money earned through the profiles she created.

'Our service is 100per cent authentic, as described in our terms and conditions,' he added. 'And we resent any implication otherwise and are certain we will be both vindicated and victorious in court.' Ms Silva, a Brazilian immigrant living in Toronto, was hired in March 2011 to help the website launch its Portuguese-language homepage.

In addition to gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and the well-publicized mayoral race in New York City, a number of states have regional issues that they are asking residents to vote on. LIGHTING UP: MAINE PUSHES FOR LEGAL POT AND COLORADO WANTS 'WEED TAX' Legalizing marijuana was a controversial ballot measure in the 2012 election for residents of Colorado and now Maine is following suit by having a vote on the use of small recreational amounts of the drug. Colorado has brought the issue up again, but this time lawmakers have proposed a 25 per cent tax on the drug. The money from the proposed tax will go to school construction but opponents see the tax as a threat that will drive up black market sales. Reaping the benefits: Colorado legalized marijuana in 2012 and now they are pushing a measure to tax it by 25 per cent. Maine also has a ballot measure that could legalize recreational marijuana in that state . SELLING BEER UP FOR DEBATE IN ONE OF UTAH'S LAST DRY CITIES . Utah is dealing with their own controversial move as there is a measure to sell beer in the town of Hyde Park.

Four women have now come forward to say that a neighbor of notorious kidnapper and rapist Arial Castro raped them, with three of the alleged victims being family members. Elias Acevedo has confessed to the kidnapping, rape and murder of two women in a Cleveland neighborhood in the 1990s, at a time when he lived close to Castro, as well as additional rape and kidnapping charges. A fourth woman has now come forward to report that she too was raped by Acevado, and paternity testing has shown that he fathered a child with one of his own family. Scroll down for video . Confession: Elias Acevedo has confessed to raping and killing two women in the mid-90s . Elias Acevedo, 49, has been charged . with the kidnapping, rape and murder of 30-year-old Pamela Pemberton who . was found strangled in 1994, and Christina Adkins, who was 18 and five . months pregnant at the time of her disappearance in 1995. He faces 293 counts, including charges involving the rape and kidnap of children. Acevedo lived on the same block as sadistic Castro during the 1990s. Castro died while serving a life sentence, plus 1,000 years, and was found with his trousers round his ankles after dying while indulging in auto-erotic asphyxiation. Following the discovery of Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus, who had been missing for 10 years, languishing in the basement of Castro's home, there was a renewed focus on missing persons cold cases. 'Because the public became more aware and investigators were determined and relentless, people were re-interviewed and there was an increased interest in these missing person cases,' FBI spokeswoman Vicki Anderson said. When police questioned Castro's neighbors, it was discovered that Acevedo was a convicted sex offender and hadn't reported his address to police. Locals: Christina Adkins (left) and Pamela Pemberton (right) both went missing in the mid-90s . Neighborhood: Cuyahoga County Sheriff deputies patrol the neighborhood outside Ariel Castro's home in Cleveland in May, the same block where Acevedo lived . Acevedo was arrested on June 11 in connection with a 1993 rape case after a rape kit taken at the time was tested for DNA evidence. According to Cleveland.com, the woman Acevedo raped in 1993 was his brother's common-law wife. She dropped the charges against him because he had seven children and twins on the way at the time. Tragic: Christina Adkins was 18 and five months pregnant when she was murdered by Acevedo . When detectives spoke with her about Acevedo this year, they were able to start building up a profile of his behaviour, which involved strangling, keeping the underwear of his victims and a tendency to return to certain geographical areas. The 1993 rape occurred close to the spot where his neighbor Pemberton's body was found in 1994. Pamela Pemberton was found dead in a field on West 11th Street, near Clark Field, by three youths going to school October 24, 1994. Homicide detectives said Pemberton had been strangled and was found naked. She had been going to meet a friend at a bar and never returned home. Acevedo was then linked to the 1995 disappearance of Adkins, who was last seen close to Acevedo's home. A spokesman for the Cuyahoga County prosecutor's office said that Acevedo has confessed to the murders, which means authorities will not seek the death penalty. Victims: Christina Adkins (left) and Pamela Pemberton (right) were murdered within a few months of each other . The Guardian reports that Acevedo led detectives to the spot where he dumped Adkins' body in a manhole under a busy highway overpass on the Ohio city’s west side. Remains recovered from the manhole were sent for DNA testing and test results today proved the remains were those of Adkins. Acevedo has a long criminal history that dates back to 1988, including theft, receiving stolen property and a 2003 rape and kidnapping case for which he served three years in prison. The 293-count indictment, unsealed Thursday, charged Acevedo with aggravated murder, as well as 173 counts of rape, 115 counts of kidnapping and one count of gross sexual imposition. Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were all kidnapped by Ariel Castro after accepting a lift from the sadistic abuser. Once at his Cleveland address, they were subjected to a decade of torture, rape and emotional abuse which involved them being confined to a darkened room and treated like animals. The girls escaped on May 6 this year after Miss Berry realized that when leaving the house, Castro had forgotten to lock the inside door. (LtoR) Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were subjected to years of torture and abuse by Ariel Castro . Amanda Berry: Miss Berry was taken by Castro a day before her 17th birthday on April 21 2003. The last person to hear from her was her sister, when she called to say that she was getting a lift home from a local Burger King. Amanda was subjected to years of sexual abuse by Castro, and gave birth to his child in December 2006. Michelle Knight: Miss Knight was 21 when she was abducted by Castro after leaving her cousin's home. She left behind a young son, and after her rescue police admitted that they spent limited resources in the search for her. Gina DeJesus: Miss DeJesus was 14 when she was last seen by her friend, Castro's daughter Arlene on April 2, 2004.

'I don't believe it': Grumpy grandads such as Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson, appear to be on the decline as more aging men say their later years are the best of their lives . Women are grumpier than men when they reach old age, a survey reveals today. The nationwide research appears to challenge the idea of men becoming bad tempered with age - epitomised by the archetypal grumpy old man Victor Meldrew in One Foot in the Grave. Both men and women are happiest during middle age but women become more cantankerous the older they get. Exactly the same number of men and women - 21 per cent - said they felt happiest with their life as a young adult. A total of 36 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women said they were most content during middle age. But surprisingly, 30 per cent of men said they were the happiest when they passed 65 - compared to just 26 per cent of women. The results also found that life does indeed begin at 40, with 64 per cent saying their happiest times have been from middle age onwards. The survey, commissioned by British manufacturer Stannah, questioned 1,000 men and women over the age of 65 about the happiest times of their lives. Just four per cent of men and women said the happiest time of their life was when they were a child and another four per cent said that time was still to come. An overwhelming 77 per cent of people quizzed said they think older people can either make a valuable contribution to society or do more if given the chance. The research also shows 66 per cent of pensioners think society values elderly people less than they did when they were young, while 60 per cent feel their needs are not understood by the Government. pugh.jpg . Patrick Stannah, joint managing director of Stannah Lift Services, said: 'The results of this research bring out some entertaining comparisons. 'But on a more serious level they confirm that for most people life really does begin during middle age. 'Whilst at times society may seem to value youth over experience, these results indicate that when it comes to happiness, Britain’s middle aged and over 65s are far more satisfied with life. 'Despite this, it is unnerving to see that Britain’s 10 million over 65s still feel undervalued by society and misunderstood by government. 'As we celebrate UK Older People’s Day we must consider how we can all work together to engage Britain’s over 65s, who are extremely keen to continue contributing positively to society.'","Survey suggests old men like Victor Meldrew are on the wane .

The International Space Station (ISS), orbiting 220 miles above Earth, is scary enough without cyber attacks damaging the computers. But that’s exactly what the ISS team were faced with when a Russian cosmonaut accidently infected the spacecraft’s computer systems with an unspecified virus earlier this year. Eugene Kaspersky said that the International Space Station was infected by a USB stick used by a Russian astronaut . ‘The space guys from time-to-time are coming with USBs, which are infected,’ Russian security expert Eugene Kaspersky told reporters at the National Press Club event in Canberra, Australia. ‘I'm not kidding. I was talking to Russian space guys and they said, “yeah, from time-to-time there are viruses on the space station”,’ Mr Kaspersky said. The ISS’ control systems used to operate on Windows XP before moving over to Linux. Mr Kaspersky did not provide details on how badly the virus affected ISS operations or how the problem was dealt with by the engineering crew . The ’Stuxnet’ worm, discovered in June 2010, brought home the reality of the danger posed by cyber crime. Named the world’s ’first cyber super weapon’, Stuxnet was thought to be designed for attacking equipment associated with Iran’s Bushehr power plant. The worm was widely reported as being from a government agency or well-funded source and could target control systems used to manage oil rigs, water supplies and power plants, signalling a new age in cyber warfare. Like the virus unleashed on the International Space Station, Stuxnet did not require an internet connection to hack into computers. This mean that astronauts who used Windows programs on Earth could have brought a virus onto the ISS via a USB stick. Mr Kaspersky did not provide details on how badly the virus affected ISS operations or how the problem was dealt with by the engineering crew. According to a report on ExtremeTech, in 2008 a Windows XP laptop was brought onto the ISS by a Russian astronaut infected with the W32.Gammima.AG worm. This rapidly spread to other laptops on the spacecraft which were running Windows XP. Mr Kaspersky said this highlights the threat of cyber attacks even when a system isn't connected to the internet. Systems that are not connected the internet are normally considered secure as a hacker would require physical contact with the computer. Mr Kaspersky noted another example of the infamous Stuxnet virus which attacked a nuclear power plant in Russia– also disconnected from the internet - and badly damaged their internal infrastructure. The ’Stuxnet’ worm, discovered in June 2010, brought home the reality of the danger posed by cyber crime.

Mr Kaspersky warned of the repercussions for releasing viruses such as Stuxnet. ‘What goes around comes around,’ he said. ‘Everything you do will boomerang.’ Named the world's 'first cyber super weapon', Stuxnet was thought to be designed for attacking equipment associated with Iran¿s Bushehr power plant .","Eugene Kaspersky said viruses are able to infect the ISS from 'time-to-time'

Derelict: The historic building has been left crumbling away for more than 20 years, with its wooden features, art deco styling and equipment hidden from public view . Last chance: The power station was today revealed to the public for the last time before it undergoes a radical multi-billion pound redevelopment across the whole site . Visitors were able to view and take photos of the famous red brick building, which was built in 1933 and, 50 years later, decommissioned in 1983. It has since been left in a derelict, ruined state. Robert Deas, 49, from Richmond in south-west London, said:  'This is the last chance any of us will have to see Battersea Power Station. 'We've all been looking at it as we've . commuted over the Thames for years, wondering what's inside, and now at . last we get a chance to see.' However, some of those waiting to enter the power station criticised . the queuing system, which saw two lines - one running along the promenade . at Battersea Park, and another down Queenstown Road - meet near the . entrance. The Grade II listed structure, which was built in 1933, now faces redevelopment into offices and flats . Speaking from outside the building, Mr Deas said: 'We've been in the queue, in total, about an hour-and-a-half, and that has been poorly managed. 'There are now two queues, one running . back to Albert Bridge, and one to Vauxhall in the other direction, and . where they meet there has been quite a lot of ill feeling. 'I think it should have been . anticipated that most of London would want to see inside Battersea Power . Station, and I really think the whole building should have been left . standing open for a week so that everyone could just wander in at their . leisure.' Ross Pike, 29, who is originally from Belfast but now lives in London, said the queue had been 'jovial'. Historic: Battersea Power Station was decommissioned in 1983 and has since been left vacant . Ruin: Known for its landmark four chimneys, the building is now dirty, damaged and falling apart . He added: 'It's a big iconic building . we've never been able to go into before, and before it gets cordoned off . and turned into apartments, I thought it would be a good opportunity to . look inside it, having seen it from the street for so long.'

In an interview published on Monday, Egypt's army chief said he had told Mursi as long ago as February that the president had failed, about five months before the military removed him. General Abdel Fattah al-Sisi made the remarks before dozens died on Sunday in clashes involving security forces, supporters of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood and their opponents.

Militant violence elsewhere in Egypt has raised fears that an Islamist insurgency, like one eventually crushed in the 1990s by then president Hosni Mubarak, could take hold beyond Sinai.

Foreign spies? Authorities had warned that anyone protesting against the army during Sunday's 1973 war anniversary would be regarded as an agent of foreign powers . The death toll from clashes in Egypt rose to 53 on Monday, state media said, as calm returned to the streets after one of the bloodiest days since the military deposed Mursi. Traffic flowed normally in central Cairo where thousands of Mursi supporters had battled security forces and army supporters on Sunday on the anniversary of the 1973 war with Israel. State radio said security forces had regained full control of Egypt, which signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979. In addition to the dead, state media said 271 people had been wounded in the clashes. Most of the casualties were Mursi supporters, security sources said. Further confrontations may shake Egypt this week. An alliance that includes the Muslim Brotherhood has urged Egyptians to stage more protests against the army takeover from Tuesday and gather on Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday. Bloodshed: Militant violence elsewhere in Egypt has raised fears that an Islamist insurgency, like one eventually crushed in the 1990s by then president Hosni Mubarak, could take hold beyond Sinai . No surrender: The Brotherhood remains defiant, organising demonstrations, even if they are much smaller than ones staged weeks ago . Political turmoil since the army unseated Mursi on July 3 has unnerved foreign investors and hammered tourism, a pillar of the economy, but there is no sign of reconciliation between the Brotherhood and the army-backed government. Security forces smashed pro-Mursi protest camps in Cairo on Aug. 14, killing hundreds of people. In an ensuing crackdown, many Muslim Brotherhood leaders were arrested in an attempt to decapitate Egypt's oldest Islamist movement. Authorities had warned that anyone protesting against the army during Sunday's 1973 war anniversary would be regarded as an agent of foreign powers, not an activist - a hardening of language that suggests authorities may crack down harder.

Army chief Sisi, in an interview published in a privately owned newspaper, al-Masry al-Youm, said Egypt's national interests differed from those of the Brotherhood as an organisation. In the interview conducted before Sunday's violence, Sisi also spoke about his previous meetings with Mursi, whose time in office he said had driven Egypt in the direction of civil war. 'I told Mursi in February you failed and your project is finished,' al-Masry al-Youm quoted Sisi as saying. Sisi denied Brotherhood allegations that the army had intended to remove Mursi through a coup, saying it had only responded to the will of the people. Before Mursi's overthrow, Egyptians disillusioned with his year-long rule had held huge rallies demanding that he quit. Last month, a court banned the Brotherhood and froze its assets, pushing the group, which had dominated elections held in Egypt after Mubarak's fall in 2011, further into the cold.","The attack took place near the Suez Canal city of Ismailia this morning .

The eldest of the three Ochoa brothers who founded one of Colombia's most notorious cocaine cartels has died of a heart attack at age 65. Juan David Ochoa died on Thursday at a private clinic in Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, Hospital officials and a cousin said.

She may still be wearing her diamond wedding ring but the widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died two years ago, may have found love again as she has now been romantically linked to former Washington DC mayor Adrian Fenty. Laurene Powell Jobs, who was married to the famed tech entrepreneur for 20 years, is said to have bonded with Adrian Fenty over a shared passion for school reform after they met at an education conference in 2011. Their friendship reportedly developed into a romance shortly after Mr Fenty announced he was leaving his wife, sources told the Washington Post. New love: Laurene Powell Jobs has been romantically linked to former Washington DC mayor Adrian Fenty . Tender moment: Steve Jobs met Laurene Powell when she was a grad student at Stanford, and they married two years later in 1991. They were said to have had 'an exceptionally close marriage' (seen here in 2011, months before his death) Political family: Fenty- seen holding his daughter Aerin while the couple's twin sons Matthew and Andrew stand behind Michelle on the local Election Day in 2010- has not yet had his divorce finalized . The couple's relationship is not believed to have been behind the break up of Mr Fenty's 15-year marriage. Mrs Jobs, who has three children, inherited an estate of about $10billion when her husband died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 56 in October 2011. Despite being one of the richest women in the U.S, the 49-year-old has kept a deliberately low profile as she continues with her charitable work. In a rare interview in April Mrs Jobs said of her husband: 'His private legacy with me and the kids is that of husband and father. And we miss him every day.' Grieving: Laurene with her husband and Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died in October 2011 . As she pushes her charity work, Mrs . Jobs has started to increase her public profile, and friends suggest . that it is time that she starts to make a name for herself that is . removed from her husband's legacy. 'She’s been mourning for a year and was grieving for five years before that,' said Larry Brilliant, of Skoll Global Threats Fund, told the New York Times earlier this year. 'Her . life was about her family and Steve, but she is now emerging as a . potent force on the world stage, and this is only the beginning.' She married the Apple founder two years after meeting him when Jobs gave a talk to Stanford Business School while she was a student there. His half sister, Mona Simpson, took a moment during his eulogy to reflect on her late brother's love of Laurene, telling how he called her on the day that he first met his future wife. One with nature: Steve and Laurene got married at the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite Valley in March 1991, and their first child, a son named Reed, was born six months later . Spiritual: Their wedding ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs . Tough times: Laurene and Steve were married for 20 years, though friends said how she was grieving for the final few as he grew more and more sick (seen here together in 2011 months before he died) 'There’s this beautiful woman and she’s really smart and she has this dog and I’m going to marry her,' he reportedly said on that fateful day. 'His abiding love for Laurene sustained him. He believed that love happened all the time, everywhere,' Simpson said. Their wedding took place in March 1991 at a hotel in Yosemite Valley, and the ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs. Their eldest child, a son named Reed, was born six months later, and the couple had two daughters in the years following. Separation: Adrian and Michelle Fenty's 15-year-marriage is said to have ended in January . During Steve's lifetime, Laurene kept her profile extremely low, focusing on raising their three children and running their home while her husband, an infamous workaholic, launched the groundbreaking tech firm. While she was on the boards of several companies and charities during his lifetime, it was only after he died that she began to speak publicly and use her fame to draw attention to the causes that matter to her- education reform and school accessibility for the children of immigrants being the two biggest passion projects. Her connection to Mr Fenty increased after he joined the board of College Track, a non-profit program for students that she founded in February last year. In a statement released at the time she said: 'Adrian Fenty is one of our country’s . great advocates for education reform. His sense of urgency and record of accomplishment is . unparalleled.' Devoted: Laurene Powell Jobs was pictured still wearing her wedding ring while on holiday in Italy last month . In contrast to the privacy courted by Mrs Jobs, Mr Fenty has been a public figure since his election as Washington DC mayor in 2006. He and his wife Michelle, who have twin teenage sons and a young daughter, were often spotted at high profile parties and events in the city. When he was elected to run the nation's capitol, a number of glowing profiles mention his athletic build, with The Washingtonian describing the now-42-year-old as 'an attractive, unstoppable political force, a buff triathlete, a proud father of three, the local mirror image of President Barack Obama'. Better times: Michelle made only a few appearances at gala events like the state dinner for the Indian Prime Minister's visit in 2009 (left) and the White House Correspondent's Dinner in 2010 (right) Separate lives: Michelle, a lawyer, began spending much of her time in Trinidad and Tobago for work last year . Since his defeat in 2010 Mr Fenty has focused on acting as a consultant to education tech companies and his position as special adviser at Andreessen Horowitz, which led to him splitting his time between Washington and Silicon Valley. His wife took a job in Trinidad and Tobago with the Inter-American Development Bank in 2012, which led to her also splitting her life between two places, according to the Washington Post. On January 14 of this year, the couple announced that they were separating and their divorce is said to be close to completion but formally done. Both Mrs Jobs and Mr Fenty have declined to comment on speculation about their relationship.","Couple are believed to have met at an education conference in 2011 and have been close friends with similar interests since then .

A couple have spoken out about the benefits of their 'open adoption' arrangement, which allows their son to have full contact with his biological family. Liane Thatcher and Kerry Keane from South Orange, New Jersey, who were unable to conceive naturally, told the Today show that they went down this route because they didn't like the idea of 'having secrets.' For the past 12 years they have been working with their son Phelan's birth mother, Moriah Dailer, 'as a team' and today the trio say their set-up provides everyone with what they need. An open arrangement: (From left to right) Adoptive parents Liane Thatcher and Kerry Keane, Al Roker from the Today show, their adopted son Phelan and his birth mother . Indeed, Ms Thatcher says that Phelan gets double the amount of motherly love and has dozens of relatives to play with - something which he grown to appreciate. Ms Dailer, from Washington state, was 19 years old, unmarried and a college dropout working as a waitress when she fell pregnant with Phelan. Without the funds for an abortion she went through with the pregnancy and put her baby up for adoption. 'It's inexplicable how excited he gets and how much he literally needs his birth mother' Over the months she became increasingly attached to her unborn son and tried to find an alternative to the traditional 'closed' or 'confidential' adoption route. 'Feeling him move the first few times, that was amazing,' she recalled. She . was put in touch with Ms Thatcher and Mr Keane, a married couple who were keen to adopt . but wanted to maintain ties with their child's birth parents. Best buddies: Phelan says his birth mother (pictured) is 'really fun to hang out with - I really love her' They believed this would help avoid problems that can come later down the line when children go hunting for their blood relatives. Ms Dailer told the couple that her main priority was to tell her son that she loved him one day. 'Phelan was my family and I had to pursue that,' she said. When it was time for Ms Dailer to give birth, Ms Thatcher and Mr Keane were there in the delivery room. 'Feeling him move the first few times, that was amazing. Phelan was my family and I had to pursue that' They selected a half-dozen names then let Ms Dailer make the final choice. Phelan Daniel Thatcher-Keane was born on September 29, 2001, weighing 7lbs and 9oz. Since then all have been part of each other's lives. Ms Thatcher says she is thrilled to see her son’s connection with his birth mother. 'There’s an amazing thing that happens when we get together - when Phelan first sees Moriah,' she said. 'It’s inexplicable how excited [he gets] and how much he literally needs her.' Proving a point Phelan said: '[Moriah's] really fun to hang out with. I really love her.'

Showered with love: Phelan sits with his birth mother Ms Dailer (left) and adoptive mother Ms Thatcher (right) Ms Thatcher says  Ms Dailer has also been someone she has been able to share her joys and heartaches of motherhood with. 'She’s the first person I think to call - just as quickly as I call my sister.' Despite the openness, giving up a child still had an emotional impact on Ms Dailer and she later went through therapy. 'The good news is that adoption in our country is traveling a road toward greater openness and honesty' According to a report last year only about five per cent of infant adoptions in the U.S. now take place without some ongoing relationship between birth parent and adoptive family. Based on a survey of 100 adoption agencies, the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute said of the roughly 14,000 to 18,000 infant adoptions each year, about 55per cent are fully open. ‘The good news is that adoption in our country is traveling a road toward greater openness and honesty,’ said Adam Pertman, the institute's executive director. 'But this new reality also brings challenges, and there are still widespread myths and misconceptions about open adoption.' The challenges, according to Mr Pertman and other adoption experts, often involve mismatched expectations as to the degree of post-adoption contact.",According to a report last year only about five per cent of infant adoptions in the U.S. now take place without some ongoing relationship between birth parent and adoptive family .

A newlywed bride who allegedly pushed her husband to his death from a cliff just eight days after their wedding had blindfolded him before the fall, prosecutors have now claimed. Defense attorneys for Jordan Linn Graham, 22, said they were shocked by the '11th hour' theory. Graham, from Kalispell, Montana, previously told investigators she pushed her husband Cody Johnson during an argument, forcing him off the cliff in Glacier National Park on July 7 this year. She has pleaded not guilty to murder - as well as to a charge of making false statements to law enforcement after she allegedly told officers she had come across Cody's body while searching for him when he failed to come home. Accused: Jordan Linn Graham, center, leaves the federal courthouse after pleading not guilty to charges last month. Prosecutors have now claimed she blindfolded her husband before pushing him off a cliff . But now defense attorneys have claimed that an FBI interrogator failed to properly record interviews with Graham - and then later twisted her words. They also said they were shocked by claims by the prosecution on October 25 that they had evidence to support their accusation of first-degree murder because of the blindfold. The defense heard 'for the first time' that Graham placed a blindfold on her husband before pushing him over the ledge - which the prosecution claims shows premeditation, HLN reported. In a motion to dismiss charges against Graham - filed November 8 - the defense fought back: 'If, as is stated in the complaint . affidavit, Jordan and Cody were arguing intensely on the ledge it hardly . seems plausible that the argument would cease abruptly so Jordan could . apply a blindfold. 'Frankly at this point the defense has no idea of how . the government intends to try this case.' Another . motion filed by prosecutors says DNA tests are being carried out on a . piece of cloth found in the area where Johnson's body was found. Loss: She told investigators she had pushed her husband of eight days, Cody Johnson, during a fight . It asked the judge to delay the trial until February as results could take more than a month. Graham spoke about a blindfold in an interview with police on July 16, the defense's motion reveals. 'I didn’t want to do that trail because I was afraid that, I mean there is a cliff right there,' Graham said. 'And you could fall. And he said, ""I could do this with a blindfold on"". And he said, ""I could just put it on, take a step but I wouldn't even fall"". And I was like - and it just kept going through my head that, um, you are going to fall or something.' The defense is now fighting to dismiss the charges. Federal public defender Michael . Donahoe claimed in documents filed last week that an FBI interrogation specialist . questioned Graham alone for nearly 90 minutes without . recording it. Donahoe argues the agent did so in order to 'shape' Graham's statements. Donahoe says investigators then distorted her statements about what happened on the cliff. Wedding day: She had told a friend she was going to talk to her husband about having 'second thoughts'. They are pictured on the day of their wedding - just eight days before he fell to his death . 'Killed': She told authorities she pushed him after he grabbed her and called the death an 'accident' According to earlier court documents filed in the case, Graham had told police they had gone on a hiking trail little over a week after their wedding and they had started fighting. 'Graham stated their argument intensified,' the affidavit states. 'At one point in time during their arguing, Graham turned and began to walk away. She stated Johnson grabbed her by the arm.' Graham said she turned around and 'pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,' the affidavit says. His body was found several days later. The affidavit also states that Graham had texted a friend earlier that night, saying she was planning on talking to her husband about having 'second thoughts'. 'I'll pray for you guys,' her friend responded. Graham replied: 'Dead serious, if u don’t hear from me at all again tonight, something happened.'","Jordan Graham, 22, accused of murdering husband Cody Johnson in July .

Tasers are being fired up to five times a day in the UK as police officers rely increasingly on the potentially deadly stun guns. There has been a huge investment in the 50,000-volt weapons in the decade since they were introduced, and police chiefs estimate they are now fired as often as 1,800 times  a year. Senior officers are bracing for criticism as use of the stun guns soars. Figures published today show the number of confrontations involving Tasers more than doubled between 2009 and 2011, from 3,500 to 7,250. Tasers are being fired up to five times a day in the UK after their availability was expanded to specialist units . But the statistics do not reflect how much they have been used over the last two years. There are 14,700 officers trained to use Tasers, after their availability was expanded from highly trained marksmen to specialist units and beat officers. Experts estimate that each officer will draw his weapon once every two years and fire it once in eight years. The latest figures will reignite the debate over the increasing reliance on stun guns. Police argue the weapons offer a less lethal alternative to live ammunition (file picture) Police argue that the weapons offer a less lethal alternative to live ammunition and can help resolve some of the most challenging stand-offs. But critics question whether training and monitoring have kept pace with the higher use amid fears that British police are being ‘armed by stealth’. Some claim Tasers are increasingly being used as a threat to force people to obey police. Kate Allen, of Amnesty International, said the rising use of Tasers across Britain was a ‘grave concern’, adding: ‘We are worried about every bobby on the beat having a Taser on their belt. It’s not a modern truncheon. ‘A Taser doesn’t just give a little tingle – it’s a potentially lethal 50,000-volt weapon and should not be spoken of as some sort of ‘natural progression’ of the standard policing kit. ‘Tasers should only be kept in the hands of a small number of specially trained officers and used only in a limited set of circumstances.’ More than one in ten police have passed the three-day course that lets them wield a Taser. But several incidents have tarnished the weapon’s reputation. Last week, prosecutors decided not to charge an officer who shot blind man Colin Farmer, 63, in Lancashire after mistaking his white stick for a samurai sword. In April, Andrew Pimlott, 32 – who doused himself in fuel and was threatening to kill himself – died in a fireball as he was a Tasered at his Plymouth home. And investigators are examining the death of Jordan Begley, 23, who collapsed and died in Manchester after being Tasered. Colin Farmer, 63, (left) who is blind, was Tasered by officers who mistook his white stick for a samurai sword and Jordan Begley (right) collapsed and died after being Tasered . A critical report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the use of Tasers may be delayed until April. It addresses concerns about the use of ‘drive-stun’ mode, in which the gun is pressed to a suspect’s body and discharged. Officials also raised fears over the Tasering of children, the old and the mentally ill, and the use of Tasers in custody. Lawyer Sophie Khan, who represents Taser victims, said training and monitoring had ‘not kept pace with the appetite of chief officers for these weapons’. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the national lead on Tasers, said the rise in use matched a greater number of weapons, adding: ‘We’re not getting more trigger happy, we’ve got more Tasers out there. ’","Number of confrontations involving Tasers doubled between 2009 and 2011 .

UTA Flight 772 was flying from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo to Paris CDG Airport in France on September 19, 1989, when a bomb went off in the luggage compartment. The blast resulted in the plane tearing apart mid-air, killing everyone on board - including Bonnie Barnes Pugh, wife of the U.S. Ambassador to Chad. Evidence traced the bomb back to Libya. The least accessible memorial in the world which was built to remember 170 people who died when a plane blew up over the Sahara desert in 1989 can be seen on Google Earth . The Libyan motive was said to be revenge on the French government for supporting Chad in a border dispute with Libya. Eventually a special court in Paris found six Libyans guilty. They were not in court themselves because Libya refused to hand them over. Despite 170 people losing their lives, the event became known as the forgotten flight. But 18-years later, families of those who perished gathered at the crash site where they built a memorial to remember their loved ones.

The memorial itself was created by Les Familles de l’Attentat du DC-10 d’UTA, an association of the victims’ families along with the help of local inhabitants.

One hundred and seventy broken mirrors were places around the memorial to represent each victim of the crash. The main part of the memorial is actually held up by the starboard wing of the aircraft which was transported from 10 miles away. It had to be dug up and emptied of sand.

A professional surfer fled the waves during a competition yesterday after claiming he saw a large shark in the water 'coming straight at him'. Hawaiian surfer Dusty Payne left the water at San Francisco's Ocean Beach during the Rip Curl Pro Search event after spotting 'the biggest fin I've ever seen' a short distance away. A jet ski was launched to investigate the sighting but the competition featuring ten-time world champion Kelly Slater was able to continue. Taking no chances: Dusty Payne, 22, withdrew from the surf competition in San Francisco after the alleged shark sighting . The sighting at Ocean Beach, San Francisco (above) came just days after another surfer was attacked by a shark in Monterey County, California . Investigation: The competition, featuring ten-time world champion Kelly Slater, was able to continue once officials looked into the sighting . Speaking to Rip Curl Pro Search event's camera crew, Payne said: 'I was just sitting there, and I was waiting for a wave. I’ve seen dolphins before, and it wasn’t a dolphin. 'It was the biggest fin I’ve ever seen in my life coming straight at me.' Dave Prodan, media director for the Association of Surfing Professionals, said a jet ski saw a dolphin rather than a shark, but wouldn't rule out the possibility both could have been in the water at the same time. He said: 'Aside from Payne’s initial report, no further sighting of the animal was confirmed and the competition resumed without pausing.' The sighting follows a shark attack on a surfer on Saturday at Marina State Beach in Monterey County, California. Eric Tarantino, 27, was surfing with . friends on Saturday morning at Marina State Beach in Monterey County . when a nine-foot shark bit him on the neck and right forearm.

They came from all over Britain to fight in the trenches of Flanders, in the skies above the battlefields and in the warships of the Royal Navy. And now, to mark the centenary of the First World War, the conflict’s Victoria Cross heroes will be honoured in the communities from where they set off to battle. Each one of the 430 men awarded the British Empire’s highest medal for military valour will have their name enshrined in a paving stone in their home town. The skies over Highclere Castle, the setting for ITV's Downton Abbey, will be filled with WW1-era aircraft to mark the centenary of the start of the conflict. Pictured, a British Sopwith Camel biplane . Highclere Castle, better known as Downton Abbey, functioned as a fictional hospital for wounded soldiers in . the First World War.

HMS Lance was a Laforey-class destroyer of the Royal Navy. It was launched a few months before the outbreak of the First World War and took part in several engagements during the war, including the Battle of Texel. She was fitted with three QF 4-inch (101.6 mm) Mk IV guns, one of which fired the first shot of the war at the Konigin Luise, a minelayer. Acting on reports from fishermen of a suspicious ship in the Thames Estuary, Lance and HMS Landrail spotted the steam ferry and gave chase through a rain squall. The Konigin Luise took heavy fire and the captain, Commander Biermann, took decisive action to scuttle the ship. 46 of the 100 crew were rescued by the British ships. She was the first German naval loss of the war. Remarkably, after treatment at a German field hospital, he survived the war and  died in 1957. Corporal . Garforth, who died in 1973 at the age of 81, earned his VC for a series . of heroic acts which began on August 23, 1914 at Harmingnies, France. They included rescuing a sergeant from beneath a dead horse while under fire. The paving stones were designed by architect Charlie MacKeith, 50, winner of a nationwide competition. Communities . and Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said the stones will ‘keep . the memory of local war heroes alive for hundreds more years’. The centenary of the  start of the war will be marked with a programme of more than 2,000 plays, performances and exhibitions.

A mother was so scared of falling over and squashing her baby that she lost ten dress sizes over the course of 18 months. Tanya Oliver-Grieves dropped more than nine stone by abandoning comfort eating and taking up regular exercise, after realising that her weight problem could endanger her nine-month-old son Daniel. She said: ‘Daniel loved crawling everywhere and trying to clamber up onto our sofa - I remember watching him as he kept falling onto his bottom, in the way that babies do. Tanya dropped 10 dress sizes and 9st 4lbs in 18 months after changing her diet and taking up exercise . Tanya with her sons Tyler, right, and Daniel, left who inspired her weight loss . ‘I was so overweight that I wasn’t very mobile or steady on my feet. As he kept falling down, I had a terrible vision in my head. I imagined how terrible it would be if I fell over and squashed Daniel by accident. ‘I realised that I’d barely be able to lift myself off the floor, let alone help him. I decided to do something about my weight problem once and for all.’ By the time of her revelation Ms Oliver-Grieves, 33, had been struggling with anxiety caused by poor self-esteem for years. She began piling on the pounds 12 years ago, shortly after meeting the father of her two sons Daniel, now eight, and Tyler, six. She said: ‘Life was comfortable. I stopped going out and preferred to stay in with takeaways. I didn’t look after myself at all. After her son Tyler (pictured) was born, she began a simple exercise regime in her living room and, as her health slowly improved, she found it easier to venture outside . Tanya's new-found confidence inspired her to start a personal training business and she hopes to soon qualify as an occupational therapist . ‘After Daniel was born I fell into a cycle where I wasn’t happy about the way I looked, so I ate more to distract myself from how I was feeling. ‘Ready meals were my weakness. The only problem I had with them was that if anything they took too long to cook. I was always looking for quick, instant lifts for my mood.’ At her heaviest Ms Oliver-Grieves weighed 19st 11lb and wore size 26 clothes. ‘I became very anxious and paranoid. I remember going to my local shop, buying a sandwich and eating it on the street without waiting to get home. I imagined passers-by were thinking, ‘look at that fat person, no wonder she’s so fat if she eats like that’. ‘As I became more afraid of other people, I couldn’t face leaving the house. I became a prisoner in my own home.’ As well as exercise Tanya began dieting, swapping ready-meals and takeaways for reduced-calorie options and fruit juice . It was then that Daniel’s innocent play inspired his mother to turn her life around. Ms Oliver-Grieves, of Houghton Le Spring, Tyne and Wear, said: ‘I thought, ‘even if I don’t fall on him, if he falls and bumps himself, would I be able to get over to him in time to look after him?’ Tanya has now reached her target weight of 10st 7lb and she is a healthy size 12 . ‘I couldn’t even get up from the sofa without rolling onto my side and heaving myself up.’ She began dieting, swapping ready-meals and takeaways for reduced-calorie options and fruit juice. After her son Tyler was born, she began a simple exercise regime in her living room and as her health slowly improved, she found it easier to venture outside. She said: ‘I began by going into the garden, and then into the street outside, and eventually I could manage to go all the way into town without having a panic attack.’ But as the weight fell off, Ms Oliver-Grieves found she had become psychologically dependent on dieting and exercise. In 2009, 18 months after her weight-loss programme began, she could fit into size six clothing. She said: ‘I know I went too far the other way and became obsessive about losing weight. My friends and family were worried I was getting too skinny. I felt as if I was constantly battling against myself. ‘It was only after I organised my exercise properly and figured out a diet tailored just for me that I was able to find the right balance. Eventually I was able to sustain a sensible weight.’ Last year Ms Oliver-Grieves had reached her target weight of 10st 7lb and she is now a healthy size 12. Her new-found confidence inspired her to start a personal training business and she hopes to soon qualify as an occupational therapist. She said: ‘I get a huge kick out of making people’s lives healthier and happier. ‘People find themselves in unhealthy situations they feel they can’t get out of - I know I did. If I can do anything to help them feel less trapped, then I think that’s wonderful.’","Tanya dropped 10 dress sizes and 9st 4lbs in 18 months .
