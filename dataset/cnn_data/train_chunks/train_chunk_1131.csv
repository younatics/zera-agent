"It's the most widespread celebrity photo hacking scandal to date - and now its time to pay. A large group of the women whose personal email accounts have been compromised - with the stolen intimate shots of stars including Jennifer Lawrence, Rihanna and Kim Kardashian subsequently disseminated online - are now threatening to sue Google for $100 million, according to a new report. Page Six are reporting that lawyers representing the women claim the search giant should have been able to remove the images from the internet and, in failing to do so, 'made millions from the victimization of women'. Top Hollywood attorney Marty Singer has written a letter to Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin accusing them of 'blatantly unethical behavior' on behalf of over a dozen of the stars involved, the gossip column reported. 'Because the victims are celebrities with valuable publicity rights you do nothing - nothing but collect millions of dollars in advertising revenue - as you seek to capitalize on this scandal rather than quash it,' the letter reportedly said. Scroll down for video . Taking action: Some of the female celebrities who have been targeted the photo hacking scandal - with Rihanna (left) and Amber Heard (right) among the most recent victims - are threatening to sue Google, claiming they could have helped stop the pictures from spreading . The exact women involved in the potential lawsuit have not been named. Reacting to the potential lawsuit, Google said they have been trying to eradicate the photos from the web in response to complaints about privacy violation. 'We've removed tens of thousands of pictures -- within hours of the requests being made -- and we have closed hundreds of accounts,' a Google spokesperson said. 'The Internet is used for many good things. 'Stealing people’s private photos is not one of them.' The letter comes after hacked photos from celebrities including Rihianna and Amber Heard were still believed to be easily accessible on social media sites. Two topless images of Rihanna appeared online via 4chan and Reddit on Sunday while Heard has been one hardest-hit celebrities, with more than 50 nude snaps of her surfacing. According to TMZ, one featured a message believed to be for her fiancé Johnny Depp. Despite stringent policies about removing abusive content, the images remained in the public sphere today - and were believed to be easily accessible on Twitter. Another huge wave of leaked images took place around September 20- with nude photos of Kim Kardashian, Vanessa Hudgens, Kate Bosworth and Hope Solo all being released. Gabrielle Union said she would be contacting the FBI after she confirmed images of her online were genuine. Union said in a statement to TMZ alongside her husband Dwyane Wade: 'It has come to our attention it has come to our attention that our private moments, that were shared and deleted solely between my husband and myself, have been leaked by some vultures. 'I can’t help but to be reminded that since the dawn of time women and children, specifically women of color, have been victimized, and the power over their own bodies taken from them. 'These atrocities against women and children continue worldwide.' Victim: Actress Gabrielle Union said in a statement photos of her that were published online are genuine . In the wake of the stolen images, Union is reaching out to the FBI, TMZ reported. 'For anyone out there also being affected by these and other hacking and hate crimes - We send our love, support and prayers,' the statement also said. ' We have done nothing wrong.' The other previously unseen images allegedly feature reality TV star Kim Kardashian, American goalkeeper Hope Solo and actresses Kaley Cuoco and Vanessa Hudgens. They also reportedly include Nashville star Hayden Panettiere, singer Avril Lavigne and actress-turned-fashion designer Mary-Kate Olson. It comes just three weeks after naked photos of actress Jennifer Lawrence and '100 other stars', including supermodel Kate Upton and actress Aubrey Plaza, were published online. Victims: The latest wave of naked images are also alleged to feature actress Vanessa Hudgens (left) and American goalkeeper Hope Solo (right). They were reportedly posted to image-sharing forum 4chan and RedditRead . Targeted: Parks and Recreation actress Aubrey Plaza (left) and The Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco have also been named as victims . Although most of the latest victims were named on an original list of targeted celebrities, posted by a hacker to the anonymous image-sharing forum 4chan last month, Kim Kardashian was not. According to TMZ, the images were reportedly uploaded to 4chan and Reddit, but the latter quickly removed them due to its stringent policy on hacked photographs being shared on the site. While a representative for Kardashian declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline, the snaps which allegedly feature her have garnered much attention. They show a woman who resembles the star taking nude selfies in a bathroom setting. It is not the first time Kim, who is married to rapper Kanye West, has had to deal with racy material being leaked to the public. In 2007, her sex tape with then-boyfriend Ray-J was published online. The reality star filed a lawsuit against the tape's distributors, Vivid Enetrtainment, which was finalled dropped when she settled for $5 million. Reality star: Nude pictures allegedly showing TV personality Kim Kardashian (pictured) have been leaked online . The same year, Vanessa was forced to issue an apology after private photos of her were leaked online at the time she was appearing in Disney's High School Musical 2. According to E! Online, nude photos allegedly showing actresses Leelee Sobieski and Lake Bell were also uploaded online this morning. Three weeks ago, compromising images of dozens of celebrities - including model Cara Delevingne and Jessica Brown Findlay - emerged online after a hacker reportedly gained access to their iCloud accounts and stole their pictures. While it appears that she was unaffected by the attacks, actress Cameron Diaz recently expressed her thoughts on the scandal while in London to promote her latest movie Sex Tape. Speaking on ITV's This Morning in the UK, she said: 'Whoever has done it, they will be caught and made examples of. This can happen to anyone. If these guys can do it to this group of people then everyone's vulnerable to it. 'I think that people really need to look at... how would they feel if it happened to them?' Last month, actress Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticize technology giant Apple when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter. The Spiderman star tweeted 'Thank you iCloud', the day after naked photos of her were published online. Last month, actress Kirsten Dunst became the first celebrity to publicly criticize technology giant Apple when she posted a sarcastic message on Twitter . Meanwhile, Jennifer Lawrence, a three-time Oscar nominee who won for her role in Silver Linings Playbook, contacted authorities after the images began appearing. 'This is a flagrant violation of privacy,' Lawrence's publicist Liz Mahoney wrote in a statement. 'The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.' Apple has denied that its iCloud system was compromised during the attacks, which were the result of 'a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions'. 'We take user privacy very seriously and are actively investigating this report,' Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris earlier told MailOnline. The firm, which said it was 'outraged' by the security breach, has now advised worried customers to update their accounts with a 'strong' password and enable two-step verification.

"A 113-year-old woman has married her 70-year-old toyboy six months after the pair fell in love at a nursing home in China. Bride Azatihan Sawuti finally tied the knot with groom Aimti Ahemti, after initially rejecting his first proposal, during a ceremony at Bachu County in the western Xinjiang province.

A number of residents from the care home attended the low-key wedding last week. The bride wore a veil and the groom a hat as they sat at a table to share their vows. After the wedding, Aimti said: 'We are very happy together. I don't care she is much older than me. 'She takes good care of me, and gives me her portion of meat during meals.' They met in December 2013 and have been inseparable ever since. Aimti said his first proposal was refused by Azatihan, who felt ashamed to get married at such an old age. 'I started to chase her, like a young man'. Eventually, this April Azatihan accepted his proposal,' he added. Last year a 127-year-old Chinese woman was named the oldest in the world.

"A Saudi Islamic preacher accused of torturing his five-year-old daughter to death has been sentenced to just eight years in jail and 600 lashes. Lama al-Ghamdi died in October 2012 having suffered multiple injuries. Her skull was crushed, a finger nail had been pulled off, her ribs and arm broken and she suffered extensive bruising and burns. There were also reports that she’d been repeatedly raped, though this was denied by her mother. Lama suffered multiple injuries including a crushed skull, broken ribs and back, bruising and burns. She had also been raped repeatedly . Lama spent ten months in hospital before succumbing to her injuries .

The mother, Syeda Mohammed Ali, told CNN in February: 'My dear child is dead, and all I want now is justice . so I can close my eyes and know she didn't die in vain.

The money is compensation for the next of kin under Islamic law. Activists said the judge ruled the . few months al-Ghamdi spent in prison since his arrest in November 2012 . was sufficient punishment. He has reportedly agreed to pay £31,000 ($50,000), which is believed to have gone to Lama's mother. The amount is half that would have been paid if Lama had been a boy.

"The future looks bright for a dark corner of England which has been named one of the world's best places to gaze at the night sky. A 370,000-acre expanse of rural Northumberland has won coveted protected status, the largest to do so in Europe, in a backlash against the light pollution which thwarts stargazers in towns and cities. Astronomers hope it will encourage a new wave of 'stargazing tourism' to the zone, which skirts Hadrian's Wall and will be named the Northumberland International Dark Sky Park. Scroll down for video . The sky's the limit: Stars above Northumberland's Kiedler observatory, pictured, are among Europe's brightest . Sycamore Gap, a famous point on Hadrian's Wall, will be included in the zone which is hoped to draw tourists . Night sky: Few parts of Britain have escaped light pollution which makes viewing the stars all but impossible . The zone, which includes parts of the Northumberland National Park and Kielder Water & Forest Park, on the Scottish border, has already been the focus of a fervent campaign to preserve the night sky. In 2008 a team of dedicated volunteers opened of the Kiedler Observatory, one of the most modern in Britain charged with getting ordinary people excited about stargazing. Astronomer Royal for England Sir . Martin Rees said: 'I'd like to offer warm support to this development. It is a further boost for Kielder Observatory and stargazing throughout . Northumberland National Park. 'All humans, everywhere in the world and throughout history, have looked up at the sky and wondered at it.

'It's a sad thought that such genuinely dark sky sites are becoming increasingly rare. 'We must value them, preserve them and ensure they can be enjoyed by as many visitors as possible who may take in the majesty of a spectacularly non-light polluted night sky.' Elisabeth Rowark, chairman of the Northumberland Dark Skies Working Group, said: 'We have worked so hard together to reach this tremendous day for everyone committed to securing protection for England's largest area of starry skies. 'We do not want to turn off the lights, but rather encourage better lighting using the latest technology.

"Texas officials have voted to fire a police officer who shot dead an armed 93-year-old woman during a confrontation at her home. The city council unanimously voted on Saturday that Officer Stephen Stem should be removed from the force after killing Pearlie Golden on Tuesday. It took less than half an hour for the council to take the vote, which came after Hearne mayor Ruben Gomez told demonstrators he could recommend Stem be dismissed. Fired: Hearne council voted to have Officer Stephen Stem dismissed after he shot dead an armed 93-year-old woman on Tuesday . Loved: Pearlie Golden, right, was a respected member of the community, who neighbors remembered fondly . Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting, which happened at Ms Golden's small brick home behind the railroad tracks that run through this mostly poor community of 4,500 people. Stem had been responding to a 911 call about a disturbance involving a woman and a gun, when Ms Golden allegedly fired two shots. Her nephew, Roy Jones, said on Friday that his aunt had become upset after her application to renew a driver's license was denied. He said that the elderly woman armed herself and, after she fired two shots, Stem fired back at her. Robertson County District Attorney Coty . Siegert said Thursday that a preliminary autopsy showed Ms Golden had been shot . twice in the body and was grazed by a third bullet. Siegert said because the case is still under investigation he could neither confirm nor deny that Ms  Golden fired her gun. The shooting was the second time Stem has killed a suspect since joining Hearne police in 2012, Siegert said. 'It's a loss of confidence in the community. We can't have an officer the citizens have lost confidence in,' Gomez said. Campaign: Protesters carry signs to the police station on Thursday as they call for Officer Stephen Stem to be fired. He was dismissed on Saturday . Stem's attorney has said that his client's actions were justified. Stem has not responded to a request for comment. Hearne police said in a statement that Golden 'brandished a gun' when Stem arrived, but have declined to comment further. Stem was on administrative leave while Texas Rangers investigated the shooting. Candles left in vigil were left outside the home where Ms Golden had lived alone. Her husband had served as a police officer in the same force Stem has been fired from. Hazel Embra, a geriatric nurse and a City Council candidate in Saturday's local election, said she saw Ms Golden last week at the grocery store. She described a spry, sharp woman who was known by many people as 'Miss Sulie' and enthusiastically greeted friends with 'Hey, baby! How you doing?' Authorities say a revolver believed to be the weapon Ms Golden had at the time of the shooting was found at the scene. 'That lady should be living today. She should not have died like she did,' Ms Embra said. Memorial: Friends and family have been living candles outside the home of Pearlie Golden, since the 93-year-old was shot dead by a police officer outside her home on Tuesday . Home: Golden, whose home is pictured here, was well-liked in her community of Hearne, where she has lived for at least 50 years . The circumstances surrounding Stem's first fatal shooting on the job in Hearne were far different. Stiegert said several officers had responded to a call of shots fired and wound up chasing three men who fled on foot. The . one who died wasn't armed when shot by Stem, Stiegert said, but had . been during the pursuit. He said officers can be distinctly heard on . tape yelling to put the gun down before shots were fired.","Stephen Stem dismissed after Pearlie Golden was killed outside her home .

"Managing director of John Lewis, Andy Street, launched an astonishing attack on France, describing it as 'finished' The boss of John Lewis has been forced into a grovelling apology after describing France as ‘finished’. Managing director Andy Street insisted his tirade against Europe’s second biggest economy had been ‘tongue-in-cheek’. But in a statement he apologised for the comments, in which he described France as ‘sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat’. ‘The remarks I made were supposed to be light-hearted views, and tongue-in-cheek. On reflection I clearly went too far. I regret the comments, and apologise unreservedly’, he said. Mr Street’s apology, an acute embarrassment for Middle England’s favourite department store, came too late to prevent a furious response from the French embassy. And prospective customers – France is John Lewis’s second biggest market and it is about to open a French website – took to Twitter in their hundreds to accuse John Lewis of ‘French bashing’. But Mr Street was backed by UK business leaders, with the head of the Institute of Directors describing France as ‘living on borrowed time’, one economist branding France ‘the sick man of the world’ and a leading commentator accusing the French of being ‘bone idle’. Mr Street made the controversial remarks after visiting Paris earlier this week to pick up an international retail award. Safely back on British soil, he told a conference in London on Thursday evening that France was ‘finished’. ‘You get on the Eurostar from something I can only describe as the squalor pit of Europe, Gare du Nord, and you get off at a modern, forward-looking station [London St Pancras],’ he said. ‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’ The 50-year-old Oxford graduate, who joined John Lewis from university 30 years ago, described the ‘plastic’ retail award given to the company in the French capital as ‘frankly revolting’ adding: ‘Every time I [see it] I shall think, “God help France”.’ He even said the food and drink in London was better than that he had been offered in Paris. He described Gare du Nord in Paris as the 'squalor pit of Europe' after visiting on the Eurostar . Andy Street has spent his career at John Lewis, joining after graduating from Oxford with a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics in 1985 - the same degree read by Prime Minster David Cameron. He became Managing Director of John Lewis in 2007, during which time the retail giant has opened 16 new shops and seen annual sales of more than £1b. Mr Street said on its rise: 'It used to be that every city needed a cathedral, now it's a John Lewis.' His holiday home, which he calls his 'chill-out place' in Snowdonia is co-owned with Michael Fabricant, the eccentric Conservative MP for Lichfield. John Lewis, which will not take any action against Mr Street, was forced into damage-limitation mode yesterday over fears of alienating French customers. One said on Twitter: ‘Insulting your future customers... interesting marketing strategy’. The French embassy said: ‘France is the fifth biggest economy in the world... so obviously many foreign businesses do not seem to share Mr Street’s view.’ Ann Kenrick, of the Franco-British Council, said the attack was an example of ‘a festering antagonism with the French and France from the British.’ City grandee Lord Levene said Mr Street’s comments were ‘very silly’ and ‘mindless’. The high profile businessman and former Lord Mayor of London added: ‘It’s completely inappropriate for someone running a big company to do this. It doesn’t matter whether the criticism is right or wrong.’ But Mr Street’s comments struck a chord with some in the business community, who believe the 75 per cent tax on top earners introduced by Socialist president Francois Hollande and the country’s labour laws – including a 35-hour week – have stunted the economy. The high tax regime has already sparked an exodus of business leaders and celebrities. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ‘Foreign direct investment in France has fallen by more than 90 per cent since 2005. Hollande’s government has been a disaster. France is living on borrowed time.’ Mr Walker cited the decision by French car giants Renault and Peugeot to expand production in Spain and cut jobs in France as further evidence of the country’s malaise. David Buik, a veteran City commentator for stockbroker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Mr Street is a hero. He is right. France is almost a great country. But the French are bone idle – that have got themselves into a rut and refuse to dig themselves out of this hole.’ The graph shows the sales figures for the week ending September 27 for John Lewis, which shows that it was 15 per cent ahead of last year - the retail giant now turns over more than Marks and Spencer . This week, France's public debt topped two trillion euros for the first time, which represents 95.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) - compared to 21.1 per cent in 1974. The European Union target is 60 per cent. President Francois Hollande is by far the most unpopular president in the recent history of France, according to all recent polls. His disastrous handling of the economy - the second largest in the eurozone after Germany - has seen hundreds of thousands regularly staging public demonstrations against him and he has been branded the new 'sick man of Europe.' Recent polls have shown Francois Hollande as being one of the most disliked presidents in recent history . France's jobless rate was recorded at 10.2 percent in the second quarter of 2014, with more than three million people out of work. Last month, France's new finance minister Emmanuel Macron said: 'France is sick. It's not well. We have to describe the situation as it is.' The French introduced the 35-hour working week rule in 1999 to combat unemployment, . Two key ratings agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poor, deprived France of its triple AAA rating in 2012. Credit ratings are used by banks and investors to decide how much money to lend to particular borrowers. Unlike many other countries in Europe, France aims to bring down its huge public deficit by raising taxes as well as some spending cuts. France has a 75 per cent tax rate on salaries of more than one million euros a year. However, this tax is paid by firms rather than employees. The highest tax rate in the UK is 45 per cent and is applied to individuals. Football clubs in France threatened to go on strike last year over the issue, saying many of France's clubs are financially fragile and could spark an exodus of top players who are paid huge salaries, such as Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic at Qatari-owned Paris Saint-Germain. There was also a chorus of protest from businesses and wealthy individuals who have condemned the tax - including film star Gerard Depardieu, who left the country in protest. Mr Hollande has made the decision to reverse pensions reform, meaning that most French people will retire at 60, and many at an even younger age. The French government's response to the economic crisis is the so-called 'Responsibility Pact', a €40bn (£32bn) package of tax breaks for business, financed with €50bn in public spending cuts. But the plan has been the target of left-wing politicians for being too business-friendly and too austere at a time of economic crisis. John Lewis - the founder of the famous retail chain - was born in Shepton Mallet, Somerset, in 1836. The original John Lewis store opened at 132 Oxford Street in the spring of 1864. It was Lewis's son, John Spedan Lewis, who pioneered its practice of distributing a share of its profits to its employees, which still exists today. The first John Lewis shop opened in Oxford Street in 1864 - today it has more than 40 stores and 91,000 staff . In September 1940, in the midst of the Blitz, Oxford Street's John Lewis store was bombed, although incredibly no staff were killed or injured. In 1953, the main John Lewis store - still being rebuilt following its near destruction during wartime bombing - was used as a viewing point for the Coronation procession. Over the past 150 years, the retailer has transformed itself from a humble Victorian draper to a chain encompassing more than 40 stores and employing 91,000 permanent staff and has been described as 'the new darling of the British high street.' Every member of staff from the chairman to Saturday shelf-stackers gets the same level of bonus – which has this year been set at 15 per cent, or about eight weeks' pay. Despite John Lewis's decision not to run adverts on television until 2007, the retailer has won a reputation for creating memorable Christmas campaigns. This year's sales were boosted by the retailer's hugely successful Christmas advert – the Bear and the Hare cartoon – which became a YouTube sensation with 12.4m views.","Managing director of John Lewis, Andy Street, said France is 'finished'

"The father of one of the Navy SEALs who was killed in the Libya consulate attack has criticised the White House reaction to his son's death - especially a bizarre and obscene comment Joe Biden made to him. Charles Woods, father of Tyrone Woods, said he thought Barack Obama had 'no remorse' over the attack and felt Hillary Clinton was 'not telling the truth'. And he revealed that at the ceremony for the return of Tyrone's body, the Vice President approached his family and asked, 'Did your son always have balls the size of cue balls?' Mr Woods added that the President seemed cold and distant at the time, saying: 'Shaking hands with him, quite frankly, was like shaking hands with a dead fish.' Scroll down for video . Inappropriate: Joe Biden apparently asked the father of dead Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, right, 'Did your son always have balls the size of cue balls?' Mr Woods launched his blistering attack on the Obama administration during an interview with Glenn Beck on The Blaze yesterday. Tyrone died on September 11 alongside his colleague Glen Doherty while the pair were protecting a CIA building next to the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. Ambassador Chris Stevens and diplomat Sean Smith were also killed in the raid, which has become a controversial issue in next month's presidential election due to ongoing confusion over how much the administration knew about the circumstances of the attack.. Mr Woods told Mr Beck that he was disappointed by his meeting with senior officials at the event marking the return of the dead men's bodies. He said that Mr Biden had acted inappropriately, asking the Woods family in a 'loud and boisterous' tone, 'Did your son always have balls the size of cue balls?' Mr Woods asked, 'Are these the words of someone who is sorry?' Cold: Charles Woods also criticised Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for their demeanour when they met him . Issue: The Benghazi attack has become part of the election campaign between Mitt Romney and Obama . The President, by contrast, was apparently much more subdued, to the point of coldness. 'When he finally came over to where we were, I could tell that he was rather conflicted, a person who was not at peace with himself,' Mr Woods said. 'Shaking hands with him, quite frankly, was like shaking hands with a dead fish. His face was pointed towards me but he would not look me in the eye, his eyes were over my shoulder. 'I could tell that he was not sorry. He had no remorse.' When Mr Woods met Mrs Clinton, she made a reference to the U.S.-made YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad which was originally thought to have been behind the attack. 'When she said that, I could tell that she was not telling me the truth,' he said. Violent: Tyrone died during an Islamist assault on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11 . Aftermath: The events leading up to the raid are still under official investigation six weeks later . His recollection of the reception differs sharply from that of Tyrone's mother, who last month took to Facebook to praise the officials who organised the event. Writing about the repatriation of her son's body, Cheryl Croft Bennett said: 'The entire afternoon was overpowering and unreal. 'Little did I know that I would find myself in a reception room being comforted, hugged, and, yes, even kissed by the President of the United States. Along with the President, there was Vice-President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and General and Mrs Colin Powell. 'They were all wonderful. They held my hand, offered condolences, gave warm hugs, and were extremely compassionate and genuinely sad for my loss, as I fought back tears and tried to project an image of strength to honor my SEAL son.' Mr Woods also denounced the White House for officials' failure to protect the four Americans, saying: 'They denied the pleas for help and they watched my son die.' Victim: Ambassador Chris Stevens, pictured here with a Libyan shopkeeper, died in the attack . Fallen: Diplomat Sean Smith, left, and SEAL Glen Doherty, right, were the other two American victims . In a statement he described Tyrone as 'a true American hero' who had 'voluntarily sacrificed his life to protect the lives of other Americans'. He called for further investigation of the circumstance of the attack, concluding: 'This is an opportunity for the person or persons who made the decision to sacrifice my son's life to stand up.' This is not the first time a parent of one of the victims has publicly spoken out against the President's handling of the tragedy. Sean Smith's mother Pat last week slammed Obama for describing the situation as 'not optimal', telling MailOnline, 'It's . insensitive to say my son is not very optimal - he is also very dead.' She added: 'I am still waiting for the truth to . come out and I still want to know the truth. I'm finally starting to get . some answers but I won't give up.' The Benghazi raid has become one of the most divisive issues in the presidential battle between Obama and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney. GOP congressmen have accused the White House and the State Department of misleading the nation by pinning the attack on the anti-Islam video, entitled Innocence of Muslims, when there were early signs that it had been a premeditated terrorist operation. In addition, government officials have been criticised for scaling back security in Benghazi over the summer, despite Stevens' concerns about his safety and that of his team.

"The study from Edinburgh University claims the link between height and intelligence is 70 per cent genetic . They are already cursed with the rather unflattering label of ‘vertically challenged’. Now experts say short people may also be intellectually challenged too - or at least in comparison to their taller counterparts. A new study has found a link between IQ and height, suggesting that those who are shorter are on average more likely to be less intelligent. Academics identified genes that influence both height and IQ, and said there was a ‘significant genetic correlation’ between the two factors. The research, which covered more than 6,800 unrelated people, is the first to analyse DNA markers in such a way. Riccardo Marioni, from Edinburgh University’s Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, said the link was small but important. He said: ‘We tested whether DNA-based genetic similarities among people related to their similarities in height and intelligence. ‘Previous studies have used twin or family data to examine similarities between height and intelligence, whereas ours was the first to examine this using actual DNA markers in unrelated people. ‘What we found was a small association between height and intelligence such that people who are taller tend to be smarter.’ The claim is likely to be disputed by millions in Britain who fall short of the average height, 5ft 3in for women and 5ft 9in for men. One is certain to be John Bercow, Speaker of the House of Commons, who at 5ft 5ins is dwarfed by his 5ft 11in wife, Sally. But among those who appear to prove the theory is David Cameron, who is 6ft 1in is blessed with both height and intelligence. Others include actress Kate Beckinsale, who studied French and Russian literature at Oxford and is fluent in both languages. Stephen Fry, the host of QI, the puzzle-based television show, is 6ft 5in. Marioni conducted his study in partnership with academics from Aberdeen University and University College London. They based their findings on data compiled from thousands of people recruited for the Scottish Family Health Study between 2006 and 2011. IQ was measured by tests which examined reaction times, powers of recall and linguistic ability. In a paper submitted to Behavior Genetics journal, the team explained that about 70 per cent of the link can be explained by genetics and the rest by environmental influences. They added: ‘We found a moderate and statistically significant genetic correlation between height and general intelligence.’ Prove the theory? QI presenter Stephen Fry (left) is 6'5"", and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) is 6'1"" It is hoped that revealing the genetic correlation between height and IQ could help predict a person’s health problems, the Sunday Times reported. Previous studies have linked short stature to heightened risk of cardiovascular disease. Higher IQ has been linked to longevity and a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and suicide. Previous studies have also claimed that short-man syndrome, known as the Napoleon complex, does exist. Researchers at Oxford University recently found that feeling smaller makes people paranoid, distrustful and scared of others. In fact, men of about 5ft 4in have been shown to be 50 per cent more likely to be jealous and distrustful of their partners than those measuring 6ft 6in. Studies have also claimed smaller people are more likely than taller ones to have poor mental health.","Edinburgh University study claims 'significant correlation' between factors .

"Students at an Orthodox Jewish school in Brooklyn have been banned from wearing the thick-framed retro glasses that are currently very fashionable with celebrities and local hipsters alike. Parents at the Bobover Yeshiva B’Nei Zion school in Borough Park, which caters to members of the Bobov sect, recently received a letter written in Yiddish from the school telling them about the new policy. ‘We are asking that everyone buy simple glasses,’ reads the letter. ‘The yeshiva will not tolerate thick plastic eye glasses.' School children at the Bobover Yeshiva B'Nei Zion school in Brooklyn are now banned from wearing thick-framed retro glasses so beloved by hipsters . Thick frames are currently very trendy . amongst people attempting to look 'nerdy' or seem more 'intelligent' than they really are. Celebrities who have been photographed wearing . these glasses include LeBron James and Justin Timberlake. But that hasn't impressed officials at Bobover Yeshiva B’Nei Zion. They believe the glasses 'give the child a very course look’ and represent the 'new modernism.' 'What we have to commit ourselves to is we have to stand on top of this and not tolerate the new modernism,' the letter reads. 'The good deed that accompanied the Jews in Egypt was that they didn’t change their names and clothes, and this same strength is still accompanying us and maintaining us in exile - in all generations.' LeBron James and Justin Timberlake are amongst the celebrities regularly seen wearing think-framed retro glasses . Other celebrities who wear the fashionable glasses include rapper T.I. and comedian Andy Samberg . 'It doesn’t matter what age - a student cannot come to yeshiva with these glasses.' Parents are asked to exchange the 'immodest' frames and told that the expense should be viewed as an 'educational boost.' Lumiere Eyewear, a local optical shop, said it has already exchanged 30 pairs in just two weeks, reports the New York Post. While school officials are also reported to have visited another local eye-wear shop, MS Optical, to decide which glasses are acceptable and which are not.

"To look at this flourishing mass of plant life you’d think David Latimer was a green-fingered genius. Truth be told, however, his bottle garden – now almost in its 53rd year – hasn’t taken up much of his time. In fact, on the last occasion he watered it Ted Heath was Prime Minister and Richard Nixon was in the White House. Scroll down for video . Still going strong: Pensioner David Latimer from Cranleigh, Surrey, with his bottle garden that was first planted 53 years ago and has not been watered since 1972 - yet continues to thrive in its sealed environment . For the last 40 years it has been . completely sealed from the outside world. But the indoor variety of . spiderworts (or Tradescantia, to give the plant species its scientific . Latin name) within has thrived, filling its globular bottle home with . healthy foliage. Yesterday Mr Latimer, 80, said: ‘It’s . 6ft from a window so gets a bit of sunlight. It grows towards the light . so it gets turned round every so often so it grows evenly. ‘Otherwise, it’s the definition of . low-maintenance. I’ve never pruned it, it just seems to have grown to . the limits of the bottle.’ The bottle garden has created its own . miniature ecosystem. Despite being cut off from the outside world, . because it is still absorbing light it can photosynthesise, the process . by which plants convert sunlight into the energy they need to grow. Lush: Just like any other plant, Mr Latimers's bottled specimen has survived and thrived using the cycle of photosynthesis despite being cut off from the outside world . Bottle gardens work because their sealed space creates an entirely self-sufficient ecosystem in which plants can survive by using photosynthesis to recycle nutrients. The only external input needed to keep the plant going is light, since this provides it with the energy it needs to create its own food and continue to grow. Light shining on the leaves of the plant is absorbed by proteins containing chlorophylls (a green pigment). Some of that light energy is stored in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that stores energy. The rest is used to remove electrons from the water being absorbed from the soil through the plant's roots. These electrons then become 'free' - and are used in chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, releasing oxygen. This photosynthesis process is the opposite of the cellular respiration that occurs in other organisms, including humans, where carbohydrates containing energy react with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and release chemical energy. But the eco-system also uses cellular respiration to break down decaying material shed by the plant. In this part of the process, bacteria inside the soil of the bottle garden absorbs the plant's waste oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide which the growing plant can reuse. And, of course, at night, when there is no sunlight to drive photosynthesis, the plant will also use cellular respiration to keep itself alive by breaking down the stored nutrients. Because the bottle garden is a closed environment, that means its water cycle is also a self-contained process. The water in the bottle gets taken up by plants’ roots, is released into the air during transpiration, condenses down into the potting mixture, where the cycle begins again. Photosynthesis creates oxygen and . also puts more moisture in the air. The moisture builds up inside the . bottle and ‘rains’ back down on the plant. The leaves it drops rot at . the bottom of the bottle, creating the carbon dioxide also needed for . photosynthesis and nutrients which it absorbs through its roots. It was Easter Sunday 1960 when Mr Latimer thought it would be fun to start a bottle garden ‘out of idle curiosity’. He said: ‘At the time the chemical . industry had changed to transporting things in plastic bottles so there . were a lot of glass ones on the market. ‘Bottle gardens were a bit of a craze and I wanted to see what happened if you bunged the thing up.’ Habitable zone: The spot under the stairs where Mr Latimer has kept the bottle garden for the past 27 years . The idea of a bottle garden is to create a world in microcosm. It will have its own special habitat and should require little maintenance, writes NIGEL COLBORN. First choose a glass container. It will need a wide neck for easy access and to look attractive. A goldfish bowl is ideal, or for children, a big jam jar might do. You'll also need some good-quality potting compost, shingle or coarse grit and, of course, the plants.Use a large spoon to insert a layer of grit into the jar and cover that with compost deep enough to accommodate the plant roots. Finally, introduce the plants. You'll need very few and they must be tiny specimens - unless it's an enormous receptacle. Little ferns such as indoor maidenhair or Adiantum, small varieties of Tradescantia and baby plants of Chlorophytum will all establish easily. Miniature trailers such as 'Mind-your-own-business' (Soleirolia) will also flourish. Move each plant gently into position, adjusting them with a stick or with kitchen tongs until you've got them where you want them. Adding a final layer of grit after planting will hold the compost down and make your micro-garden look prettier. Water with extreme care (your jar won't need much) and place the finished mini garden in a well-lit spot, but not on a hot south-facing windowsill. Into a cleaned out ten gallon carboy, . or globular bottle, which once contained sulphuric acid, he poured some . compost then carefully lowered in a seedling using a piece of wire. He put in about a quarter of a pint . of water. It was not until 1972 that he gave it another ‘drink’. After . that, he greased the bung so it wedged in tightly... and has not watered . it since. The bottle stands on display under . the stairs in the hallway of his home in Cranleigh, Surrey, the same . spot it has occupied for 27 years after he and his wife Gretchen moved . from Lancashire when he retired as an electrical engineer. It was revealed to the world when he . took a photograph of it in to BBC Radio 4’s Gardeners’ Question Time and . asked the panel of experts if it is ‘of scientific or horticultural . interest’. Garden designer and television . presenter Chris Beardshaw said: ‘It’s a great example of the way in . which a plant is able to recycle... It’s the perfect cycle of life.’ He added that this process is one reason why NASA was interested in taking plants into space. ‘Plants operate as very good . scrubbers, taking out pollutants in the air, so that a space station can . effectively become self-sustaining,’ he said. ‘This is a great example . of just how pioneering plants are and how they will persist given the . opportunity. ‘The only input to this whole process . has been solar energy, that’s the thing it has needed to keep it going. Everything else, every other thing in there has been recycled. That’s . fantastic.’ Organic gardener Bob Flowerdew was less enthusiastic. ‘It’s wonderful but not for me, thanks. I can’t see the point. I can’t smell it, I can’t eat it,’ he said. Mr Latimer agrees the bottle garden is . ‘incredibly dull in that it doesn’t do anything’, but remains fascinated . to see how long it will last. He hopes to pass on the ‘experiment’ to his grown-up children after he is gone. If they do not want it, he will leave it to the Royal Horticultural Society.","David Latimer first planted his bottle garden in 1960 and last watered it in 1972 before tightly sealing it shut 'as an experiment'

"Comedy Central has announced Stephen Colbert’s replacement. Larry Wilmore, currently of ‘The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,’ will replace the ‘Colbert Report’ host when he jumps ship next year to replace David Letterman as host of ‘The Late Show.’ The 11.30 p.m. Monday to Thursday show following Stewart will be called ‘The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore,’ according to Variety. It will launch in January. He finally has his own show: Larry Wilmore has been tabbed to replace Stephen Colbert starting next year . ‘I’m beyond excited to have this chance to continue my relationships with Comedy Central and the brilliant Jon Stewart,’ Wilmore said in a statement. ‘I love the city of New York and promise to only wear my Laker T-shirts when I’m layering.’ ‘While Larry Wilmore is a brilliant comic and showrunner, this is all just a complicated ruse to get him to move to New York and turn him into a Knicks fan,’ Stewart added. The 52-year-old Los Angeles native currently serves as the ‘Senior Black Correspondent’ on the ‘Daily Show.’ ‘Minority Report’ will have a different format than either the ‘Colbert Report’ or Stewart’s show.It will feature Wilmore hosting a rotating cadre of comedians and other celebrities, according to the network. ‘The series will feature a diverse panel of voices currently underrepresented in comedy and television.’ Wilmore is a show business veteran who has an Emmy Award to his name and has written for several shows including ‘In Living Color,’ ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,’ The Office’ and others.He also co-created ‘The Bernie Mac Show.’ Wilmore was also recently listed as a showrunner for the recently-greenlit ABC comedy ‘Black-ish’ starring Anthony Anderson, according to Variety.

"Driverless cars will be on British roads in just six months time, Business Secretary Vince Cable has announced today. The Government will allow the first trials of computer-controlled cars to start in January, as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars on UK roads. Ministers have previously admitted that the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves. Scroll down for video . The Government will allow the first trials of computer-controlled cars to start in January 2015, as part of a move to update the law to allow driverless cars on UK roads. Pictured: Google's ‘hands-free’ self-driving car . In the U.S. driverless cars are only allowed on roads in certain states if someone sits in the driver's seat. The California Department of Motor Vehicles is expected to start granting licences to certain driverless cars and their human co-pilots as soon as September. Changes to the United Nations Convention on Road Traffic, which dates back to 1968, are also afoot. It used to state: 'Every driver shall at all times be able to control his vehicle or to guide his animals.' An amendment agreed in May would allow a car to drive itself, as long as the system 'can be overridden or switched off by the driver'. A driver must be present and able to take the wheel at any time. The convention covers European countries, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Russia, although not the United States, Japan or China. The vehicles work by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s position on an electronic map. In June, Google unveiled its computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals. Instead, it has buttons for start, pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing the planned route. Google plans to have prototypes ready to test later this summer and says the goal is for the car to ‘shoulder the entire burden of driving’. In the UK, ministers will look at current road regulations to ensure there is an appropriate way to testing driverless cars. Two areas of driverless technology will be covered in the review: cars with a qualified driver who can take over control of the driverless car and fully autonomous vehicles where there is no driver at all. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: 'The excellence of our scientists and engineers has established the UK as pioneers in the development of driverless vehicles through pilot projects. 'Today’s announcement will see driverless cars take to our streets in less than six months, putting us at the forefront of this transformational technology and opening up new opportunities for our economy and society.' He also announced that UK cities can now bid for a share of a £10million competition to host a driverless cars trial and up to three cities will be selected to host the trials from next year. Each project is expected to last between 18 and 36 months and start in January 2015. Transport Minister Claire Perry said: 'Driverless cars have huge potential to transform the UK’s transport network. They could improve safety, reduce congestion and lower emissions, particularly CO2. 'We are determined to ensure driverless cars can fulfill this potential which is why we are actively reviewing regulatory obstacles to create the right framework for trialling these vehicles on British roads.' However, motoring groups have warned that road users will be wary of the introduction of driverless cars. Steering wheels, handbrakes and pedals could become a thing of the past when driverless cars are introduced . AA president . Edmund King said that a recent survey of more than 23,000 AA members . showed that 43 per cent did not agree that UK legislation should be . amended to even allow trials of the technology. And . the RAC said: ‘We suspect it will be difficult for people to come to . terms with giving up control of their vehicle to a computer.’ The survey showed only a small minority of drivers were eager to take their hands off the wheel and let the car take over. Those most keen were drivers aged 25-34, while those least keen were pensioners. Mr King said: ‘Today's announcement takes us closer to seeing fully autonomous vehicles on our roads but it will take some time for them to become commonplace. ‘Many drivers are still resistant to change as 65 per cent enjoy driving too much to ever want the vehicle to take over from them. ‘Cars have become more automated. However, there needs to be a big leap of faith by drivers from embracing assistance systems to accepting the fully automated car.’ RAC . technical director David Bizley said: ‘Many vehicles already have . features such as automatic braking and it is claimed that driverless . technology is able to identify hazards more effectively than a person . can. ‘But . many motorists will be concerned about not being able to control the . speed of their vehicle for the conditions or layout of the road in front . of them.’ Driverless pods (above) are already being used to transport passengers to Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport . ‘There is also the question of whether a human would still have to be present or not to take control in the event of a computer or system failure, or will we really have driverless vehicles on our roads? ‘This is no doubt something that will involve new legislation before we actually get to see driverless vehicles taking to our roads.’ There is also the question of who is responsible for the vehicle. Jon Wilshire, chief underwriting officer for esure told MailOnline: 'In terms of insurance, there are significant issues around liability and legislation that will need clarification. 'Overall though, it is an exciting technology that could have many benefits including making roads safer. esure became the first insurer to offer premium reductions to drivers of cars fitted with autonomous emergency braking systems fitted as standard due to the safe driving benefits of the systems. Some see this technology as a prelude to autonomous cars. 'Anything that can go some way to saving lives should be explored.' Despite trepidation from drivers, politicians are keen for the UK to take the lead in the production of technologies for autonomous vehicles. Science Minister Greg . Clark said: 'Britain is brilliantly placed to lead the world in . driverless technology. It combines our strengths in cars, satellites, . big data and urban design; with huge potential benefits for future jobs . and for the consumer.' In June, Science minister David Willets told MailOnline that he was in talks with the Department for Transport about rewriting the law to allow autonomous vehicles on UK roads, claiming that Britiain is a 'world leader' in the area. A British version of a driverless is being developed in Oxford. ’There is British technology, and it's a lot cheaper than the Google technology,’ Mr Willetts said. ’But whereas the Google car, they have notched up more miles, so we have got to ensure that the British has its own opportunity to get tested in a wider range of environments and that's what we are working on with the department for transport. ’But the technology is being developed at Oxford as we speak.'","First trials of driverless cars on British roads will start from January 2015 .

"Deciding where to place a Wi-Fi router at home to minimise signal blackspots is a fine art. But a physicist has attempted to tackle the problem by mathematically working out the optimum position for a router. He studied how walls and reflections affected signal strength and concluded that, as common sense might suggest, there’s just no beating the centre of a house for router location. Jason Cole at Imperial College London simulated Wi-Fi router locations (shown above in the diagram of Mr Cole's flat). He found that the best location, as common sense might suggest, was in the centre of a home. He had grown frustrated after finding blackspots in his flat . The 'complex' research was carried out by Jason Cole, a PhD physics student at the John Adams Institute at Imperial College London. Wi-Fi signals use very low intensity radio waves. Whilst similar in wavelength to domestic microwave radiation, the intensity of Wi-Fi radiation is 100,000 times less than that of a domestic microwave oven. The type of radiation emitted by radio waves (Wi-Fi), visible light, microwaves and mobile phones has been shown to raise the temperature of tissue at very high levels of exposure - but that's much higher than what people are subjected to on a regular basis. This is called a thermal interaction, but researchers are divided as to whether the radiation we receive daily can cause damage. The UK Health Protection Agency (HPA) has been monitoring the safety of Wi-Fi. It says people using Wi-Fi, or those in the proximity, are exposed to the radio signals it emits - and some of the transmitted energy in the signals is absorbed in their bodies. However, the signals are very low power. Sitting in a Wi-Fi hotspot for a year results in receiving the same dose of radio waves as making a 20 minute mobile phone call. Frustrated at finding numerous Wi-Fi blackspots around his flat, Mr Cole turned to mathematics to find out how he could improve his internet connection. The detailed research can be seen in his initial study and a more in-depth follow-up. Using something known as the Helmholtz equation, which can resolve physical problems in both space and time, Mr Cole simulated his flat in a program called Matlab. In the simulation he mapped out his flat and then created a virtual router and computer. He then tested out what happened to the router’s signal when it was placed in different locations around his flat. He found that, when confined to one side of the flat, the waves were hindered not only by walls and closed doors but also when they went around corners. This, he says, is because the signal loses strength when it bounces off objects. ‘I suspected that the thick Victorian walls were absorbing the radiation or scattering it away from my computer,’ Mr Cole tells MailOnline. ‘I found an equation which approximates the behaviour of high-frequency electromagnetic waves such as Wi-Fi, and tried to solve it by placing a virtual router in the floor plan of my flat. ‘After crunching numbers for a few minutes I was able to generate maps of Wi-Fi signal strength inside the flat, showing poor signal near my computer. ‘I can now test putting the router in different positions to improve the situation.’ Walls, doors and corners were found to greatly decrease signal strength (shown). Mr Cole found there was no substitute for direct line-of-sight to the router, especially when it was place at one side of his flat. The simulations were created in a program called Matlab . In order to get the best signal strength around a home, Mr Cole says nothing beats placing the router at the centre (simulation shown). While he has yet to test the simulations in real life yet, some commenters on his website suggested he tape an antenna to a robot vacuum cleaner . By showing how weakened the signal can be when it moves across the flat, Mr Cole found that no matter where his router was placed at one side of the flat, there would always be blackspots elsewhere. Instead, he suggests that the only solution to ensure as few blackspots as possible is to place the router in the middle of the flat. ‘It turned out that the model I developed was very sensitive to every little detail, so it was difficult to say other than the common sense advice: direct line-of-sight to the router is best,’ he explains. ‘There is also some reflection of the signal around corners, but engineers tell me reflections are bad too. ‘In my case, the best position was as central as possible, preferably near open doorways.’ He says he hasn’t tried any physical tests of the simulation yet, but has been given suggestions by commenters on his website. ‘Some inspired online commenters have suggested taping an antenna to a robot vacuum cleaner and letting it sniff around the flat,’ he says. ‘There have been many other helpful comments which will no doubt improve the methodology in the future, and a surprising number of people asking for an app to test their own houses or offices, so there's plenty of work to do.’","Jason Cole at Imperial College London simulated Wi-Fi router locations .

"Proposals: Iain Duncan Smith wants to impose a benefits cap of £26,000, which is the same figure as the income of an average family . Scores of workless families with ten or more children are living on state benefits worth more than £60,000 a year. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show that there are 190 families with at least ten under-18s where one or both of the parents gets an out-of-work benefit. These families are eligible for £61,183 a year in state support – much more than they could hope to earn if they entered the job market. A family in work would have to earn £93,000 to be left with this amount of money after tax. The statistics illustrate the extent to which enormous handouts condemn such families to a life on benefits, because it would not be worth their while to take on work. One minister has suggested that parents should think twice about having so many children if they cannot support them without the help of benefits. Nearly 100,000 people on benefits have four or more children, with more than 900 claimants having at least eight. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants to impose a benefits cap of £26,000 – the income of an average family – on workless families. Sources say the cap is essential to stop workshy families using extra children as revenue-raisers, getting more child benefit and perhaps a larger house. But the plan is hitting trouble in the House of Lords, with some Lib Dems arguing that the cap should be set higher. The Tories are determined the original cap should go through to help bring the costs of the welfare state under control. A crucial vote will be held next week. Last night Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘Labour left our welfare system in a sorry state, with too many people better off out of work and on benefits than if they entered the working world. Pete and Sam Smith receive £95,000 a year in state benefits to look after their ten children aged one to 15. They live in a four-bedroom house rent-free and the council even pays for breakfast to be delivered. The Smiths were evicted from their previous home in Bath, leaving it uninhabitable, according to their former landlord who claimed that mattresses and walls were stained with human and animal excrement. But despite being given a new home by the council in Bristol, Mrs Smith, 36, complained: ‘It’s very cramped. We have four bedrooms with bunk beds for the kids and that’s it. We’ve been told we might not be given a new house for another nine months, which is ridiculous.’ Complaining: Pete and Sam Smith received £95,000 in benefits, live in a four-bedroom house rent free and even have breakfast delivered, but they are still not happy with what they have . She claimed they were so short of money that the children had only one Nintendo Wii games console between them. She said in September 2010: ‘We do get breakfast delivered but sometimes we have to ring them to remind them and it’s not like proper hot food. ‘It’s usually beans, tinned tomatoes and cereal, which isn’t really enough for us all.’ The couple have not worked since Mr Smith, 40, resigned from the Army in 2001 to care for his wife, who has curvature of the spine. At that time they had three children. The family receive child benefits, disability living allowance, carer’s allowance, tax credits and income support totalling £44,954 a year. They also have a £950-a-week bed-and-breakfast deal where the council pays for breakfasts delivered to their home. This comes to £49,400, making a grand total of £94,354 a year. ‘It’s not fair that benefit claimants can receive higher incomes than families who are in work, in some cases more than double the average household income. That’s why we’re introducing a cap on benefits – to restore fairness to our welfare system while ensuring that support goes to those who need it.’ Figures released following an FoI request show that there are 140 families with ten children in Britain receiving an out-of-work benefit. Another 30 have 11 children, and 20 families have 12, making a total of 190 with ten children or more. Pleased: Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers' Alliance said that it was only right that the Government is taking action . These families get a range of benefits including jobseekers’ allowance, incapacity benefit, income support and employment and support allowance. They are also entitled to other handouts, including housing benefit, child tax credits, child benefit and council tax benefit. A workless family with ten children under the age of 18 could receive around £1,177 a week in benefits if they were claiming all these. That works out at £61,183 a year, a total of more than £11million for all the families involved. Ministers believe the vast majority of the families will be claiming all the benefits to which they are entitled. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers feel that it is unfair that so many claimants are receiving so much more in benefits that many hard-working people. ‘This has to change and it’s right that the Government is taking action.’ It was reported last week that the Government is planning last-minute changes to the controversial cap on benefits for workless families in an attempt to quell a rebellion among Lib Dem peers. The £26,000 figure is based on average income for all families, including those on benefits, which means it is lower than the income of a family in work. Some Lib Dems argue that the cap should be set higher, to the level of the average income of a family in work. Just over a year ago, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt provoked a storm by saying it should not be the state’s responsibility to fund the ever-growing families of the workshy. He said: ‘The number of children that you have is a choice and what we’re saying is that if people are living on benefits, then they make choices but they also have to have responsibility for those choices. ‘It’s not going to be the role of the state to finance those choices. ‘You can have children but if you are going to ask for support that is more than the average wage that people earn, then we’re saying no, the state shouldn’t support that. ‘That’s not fair on working people who have to pay the taxes to pay those benefits.’","Statistic show extent to which handouts condemn families to life on benefits .

"Lynn mayor Judith Flanagan Kennedy, who claims over-age Guatemalan immigrants are using  schools . The mayor of a city in Massachusetts has claimed that some illegal immigrants who have entered from Guatemala and are enrolled in public schools have greying hair and more wrinkles than her. Judith Flanagan Kennedy, mayor of Lynn, said that many attending the schools are not children, but federal government will not allow officials to verify their ages. One of the students was revealed to be 35 years old, while others are clearly much older than 21 - the oldest at which you are entitled to attend public schools in Massachusetts - Ms Kennedy said. 'One of the things that we did notice when we were processing some of these students coming in was that they were adults,' she told CNS News at a press conference. 'There were people with greying temples,' she added. 'There were people with more wrinkles than I have around their eyes.' Most of the immigrants coming into the schools from Guatemala were claiming to be between 14 and 18 years old, but the schools have no way of officially verifying their real ages. Ms Kennedy says they have been told by the Department of Justice that they cannot, and with the number of Guatemalan students almost doubling from 2012-13 to the last academic year, she warned that this could lead to an increase in taxes, in order to pay for their education. In 2013-14, 101 Guatemalans enrolled at Lynn's public schools, compared with 56 the previous year. Public schools are required by law to enrol all children - no matter their immigration status. A child, according to federal law, is someone for whom State education is provided and is within the age limits. In Massachusetts, that is between 3 and 21 years old. Thurgood Marshall Middle School in Lynn, Massachusetts, around 10 miles north of Boston . Ms Kennedy said that despite there being no official way to tell if these alien students are in fact adults, it can be very easy to tell. 'Every once in a while, we’ll be able to determine that someone is well above the age at which they would be entitled to an education in the Lynn Public Schools,' she said. 'For example, if a student does not show up for a few days of classes, we will send our truant officers out to find out what’s going on at that home.' She told of how officials turned up at the door of one 'boy' who had repeatedly been missing school, only to be told by a woman who answered that he was 35 years old. The Department of Justice stated to public schools back in May: 'You must ensure that you do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and that students are not barred from enrolling in public schools at the elementary and secondary level on the basis of their own citizenship or immigration status of that of their parents or guardians.' Lynn is around 10 miles north of Boston, and is the ninth biggest city in Massachusetts. The district is home to 26 schools.","Lynn, Massachusetts mayor, Judith Flanagan Kennedy, made the claims .

"After eight years running a bar, Laura Maggi suddenly found men beating a path to her door. Not for the quality of her coffee  and aperitifs, but because she had started appearing for work in highly revealing outfits. Hundreds of male customers flocked there day and night, leaving their cars double parked in the surrounding streets. Congestion became such a problem that the lady mayor announced she was considering an emergency bylaw to limit traffic in the area. Causing controversy: Laura Maggi, 34, who runs a bar called Le Cafe, has dominated newspapers and TV chat shows, after pictures of her dressed in barely anything appeared on the internet . Pulling more than a pint: The women folk of Bagnolo Mella, . near Brescia, which is where Manchester City ace Mario Balotelli is . from, are up in arms and said that they had banned their partners from going to Le Cafe . Main attraction: On the walls of Le Cafe there are pictures of Laura, dressed in a bikini on holiday - while in other snaps she is wrapped in an American Stars and Stripes flag. Yet more pictures of her, semi-naked, have been turned into a calendar . You're not going anywhere: Bagnolo's mayor Cristina Almici has also banned her husband from going to Laura's bar and said: 'We have received several complaints from women in the town about the bar' Now women in the small northern Italian town of Bagnolo Mella have declared Le Cafe out of bounds to their menfolk – and 34-year-old Miss Maggi has become a national celebrity. Yesterday she was a guest on the Italian equivalent of This Morning and said: ‘I don’t see what the problem is – it’s just a bit of harmless fun. ‘If the guys come here what can I do? 'I know I have upset the women but that’s not my problem. 'It’s not my fault if guys want to come and have a drink in my bar.’ She added that some customers were travelling up to 70 miles just to have a coffee in her bar. On the walls of Le Cafe are pictures of Miss Maggi in a bikini on holiday. She has 5,000 new friends on Facebook while a local poll found that 46 per cent of respondents said partners of her male customers should be ‘asking themselves why their partners prefer Laura to them’. Several wives from the town have been on TV to complain. One said: ‘It is outrageous and should not be allowed. ‘This town is quiet and respectable. Now we are known across the whole country because of the little amount of clothing this barmaid is wearing to serve drinks. ‘The women in town are not very happy and we have complained to the council.’ Enjoyment: 'I don't see what the problem is - it's . just a bit of harmless fun. I like to dress in an attractive way and I . like to have fun,' Laura said on an Italian TV show . Selling point: 'If the guys come here, what can I do? I know I have upset the women but that's not my problem,' said the bar owner . Bagnolo’s mayor Cristina Almici said: ‘We have received several complaints from women about the bar and we are looking at what we can do with regard to public order. ‘There has been a huge influx of traffic into the town since the news of Laura started to spread and this has led to incidents of bad parking and some minor acts of vandalism. ‘We can’t stop people from going to her bar and I know it is very popular with men in the town – personally I don’t see any problem with how she looks or dresses. 'If anything, it’s the men who go there who have a problem.’ She added, however: ‘My husband is certainly not allowed to go there.’ Crowd pleaser: 'People have been turning up from 70 miles away just to have a drink here,' says the proud bar lady . No blame: 'It's not my fault if guys want to come and have a drink in my bar,' says the owner .

"Death: New images of Osama bin Laden's corpse have been discovered, but won't be released to the public if the Justice Department has its way . The Navy SEAL who claims he killed Osama bin Laden has spoken for the first time about the moment he shot the world's most wanted man three times in the head and watched him take his last breath. In an interview to appear in the March edition of  Esquire magazine, The . Shooter describes in extraordinary detail the heart-stopping two minutes that changed the course of history. The Team Six member - who is referred to only as 'The Shooter' for the safety of his family - reveals how the unit prepared for the daring mission, the moment he came face to face with the al-Qaeda leader and the fallout from the successful raid. In the Esquire interview The Shooter reveals that once they were given their mission, the female CIA agent - portrayed by Jessica Chastain's Maya in Zero Dark Thirty - told the team that bin Laden was '100 per cent on the third floor' of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. 'We got him,' she told us. 'This is him. This is my life's work. I'm positive.' Once he locked eyes on his target, the SEAL remembers being surprised at his appearance. Bin Laden was much taller than he expected him to be - taller than any of their guys, and skinny with a short beard and shaved head. He was holding his wife Amal in front of him as a shield and though The Shooter could see exactly what was going on through night vision goggles, bin Laden was in total darkness and could hear but not see. He also said he feared she might try to blow them up. He added: ‘I don’t know if she’s got a vest and she’s being pushed to martyr them both. 'I'm just looking at him from right here . [he moves his hand out from his face about ten inches]. He's got a gun . on a shelf right there, the short AK he's famous for. And he's moving . forward. I don't know if she's got a vest and she's being pushed to . martyr them both. He's got a gun within reach. He's a threat. I need to . get a head shot so he won't have a chance to clack himself off [blow . himself up]. 'In that second, I shot him, two times in the forehead. Bap! Bap! The second time as he's going down. He crumpled onto the floor in front of his bed and I hit him again, Bap! Same place. 'That time I used my EOTech red-dot holo sight. He was dead. Not moving. His tongue was out. I watched him take his last breaths, just a reflex breath. 'And I remember as I watched him breathe out the last part of air, I thought: Is this the best thing I've ever done, or the worst thing I've ever done? This is real and that's him. Holy sh**. 'His forehead was gruesome. It was split open in the shape of a V. I could see his brains spilling out over his face.' The Shooter, a father-of-two, then . describes the moments after the shooting and how the al Qaeda leader's wife Amal launched herself at him screaming. After zip tying her to the bed, he then realized bin Laden's youngest son, who . was about two or three years old at the time, had also witnessed his father being shot. 'He was standing there on the other side of the bed. I didn't want to hurt him, because I'm not a savage. There was a lot of screaming, he was crying, just in shock. 'I didn't like that he was scared. I picked him up and put him next to his mother.' He said the third-floor action lasted for about 15 seconds. Afterwards, he remembered that he had a bottle of urine in his pocket the whole time, after having to relieve himself on the helicopter ride on the way in. The Shooter's interview in Esquire describes how the job led to the breakdown of his marriage, and claims the U.S. government largely neglect their veterans after they retire. Scroll down for video . Crucial seconds: The Shooter describes the raid on bin Laden's compound in Afghanistan and how he was able to see his target through night vision goggles but that bin Laden 'could only hear but not see' On TV: Bin Laden is shown watching himself on television in this video frame grab released by the U.S. Pentagon May 7, 2011, six days after his death . Safe house destroyed: Osama bin Laden's Abbottabad, Pakistan, compound is pictured in May 2011, left, and as it was demolished in January, right . Viewing the raid: President Obama and his key staffers watch the Navy SEAL mission at Osama bin Laden's compound in this White House photo . Journalist Phil Bronstein, Executive Chair of the Center for Investigative Reporting, spent a year with The Shooter, earning his trust and carefully constructing his story for the 15,000-word piece for Esquire. As well as never-before-heard details of the raid, the piece offers a sobering portrait of life after the military and makes the case that the government largely abandons its most elite and highly-trained soldiers after their service is over. He told Bronstein: 'I left SEALs on . Friday. My health care for me and my family stopped at . midnight Friday night. I asked if there was some transition from my . Tricare to Blue Cross Blue Shield. They said no. 'You're out of the . service, your coverage is over. Thanks for your sixteen years. Go f*** . yourself.' He reveals that, in the aftermath of the May 2011 raid, his marriage with his wife ended yet they have been forced to live together to save money. Because the U.S. government have given him nothing - no pension, no health care, no protection for his wife, children or him - he has had to teach them what to do if an attack should be made on their home. He told his children in hide in their bathtub, as it is the safest, most fortified place in their house and trained his wife how to use their shotgun, with a 'backup' knife on the dresser. Then there is the 'bolt bag' of clothes, food, and other provisions for the family meant to last them two weeks in hiding. The Shooter also says that the night before the raid, all the members of Team Six wrote letters to their loved ones - fully believing they would die in the mission to take down bin Laden. He described how he sat on his bed writing a letter to his kids to be delivered on the case of his death, 'something for them to read when they are 35'. As he wrote he started to cry, because he believed they would either die, or end up in a Pakistani prison 'where we'd be raped for the rest of our lives'. His oldest child refers to his job as 'Crapghanistan' because his deployment means he misses birthdays, Christmasses and other important holidays. Under fire: New film Zero Dark Thirty, starring Jessica Chastain in the lead role (pictured), has been widely criticized for suggesting that torture played a major part in the hunt for Osama bin Laden . Last month, it was revealed that . gruesome images of Bin Laden's body could be made public if a . court rules in favor of their release. The autopsy and burial photos of the . former al-Qaeda leader have been classified since he was shot dead . during the dramatic May 2011 raid on his compound in Abbottabad in . Pakistan. A lower court has already upheld the . government's argument that the photos should remain secret in the . interest of national security, according to Westwingreports.com. But . a federal appeals court is now considering whether the 52 pictures . should be released following a lawsuit filed by the conservative-leaning . legal watchdog, Judicial Watch. The group says it is not seeking any information about equipment or techniques used in the raid. President Barack Obama said the photos' release could provoke violence against US citizens. During an appearance on the '60 Minutes' show on CBS he said it was important to ensure that . 'very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not . floating around as an incitement to additional violence or as a . propaganda tool.' After . bin Laden was killed the Obama administration said his body was buried . at sea off the USS Carl Vinson - in accordance with Islamic tradition. President Obama himself said in the White House Situation Room watching events unfold, 'We got him.' Before . the U.S Navy SEALS left the compound they destroyed one of the two top . secret stealth helicopters that had delivered them to the house after it . encountered difficulties on landing and therefore could not take off . again. Intelligence . recovered from the home made public in the aftermath of his death showed . Osama bin Laden wrapped up from the cold watching news coverage of . himself. And it was later . reported from Pakistan that one of bin Laden's wives told the Pakistani . authorities that they had lived there for five years without detection. In . February 2012, Pakistani security agencies demolished the building to . stop it becoming a shrine to the deceased al-Qaeda supremo. Following an outcry from lawmakers . over the portrayal of torture in a new thriller called Zero Dark Thirty and . its role in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, a Senate panel has launched an . investigation to determine whether CIA officials intentionally misled . the filmmakers. The . Senate Intelligence Committee will examine records detailing meetings . and conversations between intelligence officials, director Kathryn . Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal. The . goal of the probe is to determine whether the agency gave the . filmmakers 'inappropriate' access to classified material, and whether . CIA personnel fed Bigelow and Boal false information to convince them . that harsh interrogation techniques were effective in producing . information that led to Bin Laden. Since the film hit the big screen in . limited release last month, it has drawn high praise and sharp criticism . in equal measure, the latter mainly for suggesting that waterboarding . and similar techniques were important, if not key, to finding bin . Laden.","'The Shooter' speaks for first time about the '15 seconds' that changed the course of history .

"For the City of New York, this fire hydrant may as well be gushing liquid gold. Over the course of the year the city earned $33,000 in parking fines by luring unwary drivers who thought they were parking perfectly legally. It doesn't help that that the fire hydrant which is positioned on the sidewalk is some seven feet away from the road. However, if a car comes within 15-feet of such a device, that car will usually receive a ticket and be taken to the pound. No parking allowed: A combination of road rules and confusing road markings is allowing the City of New York to rake in more than $33,000 a year in parking fines . To park or not to park: The painted white boxes make it appear to drivers that they're parking in a safe spot. In actual fact, the spot is not legal because it is adjacent to a fire hydrant. They may as well be pouring $115 down the drain . 'If a particular address had a huge number of tickets, I suspected that something might be amiss. And with some help from NYC Open Data, I launched my so called 'investigation.'' wrote Ben Wellington, a statistics professor at Pratt Institute, for Gizmodo. The fire plug is on Forsyth Street on New York's Lower East Side. 187 unsuspecting drivers have been caught in the last seven months alone. Mr has calculated that with the fine costing $115, it works out to $21,505. Blurred lines: The Lower East Side fireplug gushes out a flood of money for the city some $33,000 a year, according to one estimate by luring unwary drivers who think they¿re parking in a legal spot . The drivers blame two factors: white lines on the street look like the wide 'boxes' that are often used when parking is permitted. 'One theory is that technically, the lane behind the cars is not a protected bike lane. You would never know it by looking at it, but it is not painted and there are no markings. It is simply an empty space that people bike in. Should that matter? Probably not, but the NYPD might think otherwise. Unless this is a deliberate attempt to craft a 'honeypot,' there should be clearer markings on the pavement to avoid this seemingly arbitrary ticketing,' says Mr Wellington. A sidewalk extension that looks like a bike lane also creates added confusion for road users who may not realize that it is still prohibited to park in front of a hydrant, despite the large gaps and painted white lines. Prepare to be towed: The painted white lines make it appear as though it is totally legal to park here, but the proximity of a fire hydrant should give cause for concern . The space between the lines is easily wide enough for a car and marked with diagonal lines at some points - but not in front of the hydrant. Mr Wellington guesses that it is this particular hydrant that brings in the most money for the city out of all of the 110,000  fire-protection devices . The pictures from Google Street View show what appears to be a protected bike lane between between the cars and the hydrant. The curb extension was constructed in 2008 to widen the sidewalk. There is also a misconception that drivers think it is perfectly legal to park on the traffic-side line when a bike lane is between the sidewalk and the traffic lanes - even when a hydrant is on the sidewalk. The law states that in such cases there has to be a sign specifically permitting parking there. Mr Wellington has said the Department Of Transportation have confirmed to him that they will review the markings.","The fire hydrant is based in the Lower East Side .
Drivers are confused because they see a bike lane with painted white lines that show a parking space .

"A Mississippi mother has launched an online campaign for justice after her little girl was allegedly severely beaten in a vicious playground attack last week. Disturbing images posted to the 'Justice for AvaLynn' Facebook page by mother Lacey Harris reveal the kindergarten student's bruising injuries, which her school claims happened when the five-year-old fell over. Harris refutes the official explanation from Arlington Elementary School and says that she wants a police investigation because her child's injuries are simply too severe to have been caused by a fall. Battered and bruised: These images taken last week by mother, Lacey Harris, reveals the seriousness of AvaLynn's injuries . According to Harris, her daughter AvaLynn was kicked until she fell off the slide in the playground during her first week at Arlington Elementary in Mississippi. The Pascagoula School District said that nothing violent happened to the little girl and she merely fell to the ground whie outside playing. A post on the 'Justice for AvaLynn' Facebook page gives Harris' alleged account of how her daughter was left with such severe black eyes and swollen features. 'AvaLynn informed Lacey that she was assaulted by another student: that she was kicked repeatedly in the face until she fell off of the slide on the school's playground. The school informed Lacey were no teachers present when the incident occurred, and because of that, no one could prove whether or not another student had harmed Ava,' the post reads. 'The school basically claims that Ava injured herself, as all the photos depicting her injuries will debunk. The local PD claims that there has been no criminal act, which the injury photos also disprove.' Wounded: AvaLynn and mother Lacey Harris pose for a picture posted over the weekend that show the five-year-old's injuries are improving . Before and after: AvaLynn was injured during her first week at Arlington Elementary School . Harris has retained the services of a lawyer, who has insisted she make no comment to the press while they press for a police investigation. She has also opened a gofundme page that has raised in excess of $5,000 to help with AvaLynn's treatment. 'There is a need for repeat CT scans, specialist visits to an ENT, ophthalmologist and quite possible orthopedics for her little face,' Harris wrote. The Pascagoula School District spoke to gulflive.com about the incident to say: 'A student was injured while playing on the playground at Arlington Elementary School Tuesday afternoon. School officials responded to the situation. 'The parent was contacted and the student received medical treatment. No other children were involved in the incident. The Pascagoula School District remains committed to the safety of all its students.'

"More than 60 people are believed to have been killed by an airstrike as they queued to buy bread in a rebel-held town in Syria. Anti-regime activists claimed a government warplane targeted the bakery in Halfaya yesterday. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights today said it has collected the names of 40 men and three women killed and seen photos of the dead bodies of a further 15 unidentified men. Amateur videos posted online showed many dead and wounded bodies lying in a street. Airstrike: Civilians and rebels carry bodies of people killed in the attack on the bakery yesterday . Britain today condemned the attack, and Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said that, if verified, it would be 'the most recent in a long line of human rights violations and abuses' committed by the regime of President Bashar Assad. Those responsible should be held to account, said Mr Burt, who added the incident made clear 'the urgent need for a political transition and end to the violence'. Syria's state news service also . blamed the attack on 'an armed terrorist group', accusing rebels . of filming the aftermath 'to frame the Syrian army'. It has overshadowed the visit to Damascus of international peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who today held talks with Assad. There was little sign of progress in the efforts of the envoy for the United Nations and Arab League to broker an end to the conflict during the two-day visit, which was due to end today. Following the discussions at the Presidential palace, Mr Brahimi told reporters: 'The situation in Syria is still worrying and we hope that all the parties will go toward the solution that the Syrian people are hoping for and look forward to.' Aftermath: Blood-stained streets outside the bakery where at least 60 people are believed to have been killed . Syria's state news agency quoted Assad as saying his Government supports 'any effort in the interest of the Syrian people which preserves the homeland's sovereignty and independence.' In a statement released in London, Mr . Burt said: 'I am appalled by emerging reports of the brutal shelling . and killing of civilians in Halfaya in Hama province yesterday. 'Opposition groups report that over 60 people were killed while queuing for bread with more believed to be buried in the rubble. 'If verified, this would be the most . recent in a long line of human rights violations and abuses committed by . the Syrian regime, which continues to wage a remorseless war against . its own people.

"Chancellor George Osborne was today forced to defend a Conservative party advert aimed at working class voters, claiming 'they' enjoy bingo and cheap beer. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps . took to Twitter last night to launch an advert devised by Tory HQ to . highlight Budget measures supposedly aimed at ‘hardworking people’. But it has been widely mocked online, and spawned spoof versions referring to whippets, clogs, eating swans, shooting poor people and suggesting the Tories think it is still 1961. Scroll down for video . 'PR disaster': Grant Shapps tweeted this Tory party advert about beer and bingo cuts in today's Budget . Tweet: The post was immediately slammed as 'ill conceived' by Labour's Ed Miliband . The . advert read: ‘Bingo! Cutting the bingo tax and beer duty to help hardworking people do more . of the things they enjoy.’ Mr Shapps urged Conservative supporters to ‘spread the word’. After waves of criticism and ridicule, a Tory source insisted: 'We stand by the advert.' But the Lib Dems accused their coalition partners of being 'patronising', Labour said it was ‘condescending’ and the writers of political comedy The Thick Of It said they would have rejected it from a script for being 'too far-fetched'. In a round of media interviews this morning Mr Osborne was repeatedly asked to defend the advert, distracting from his key announcements on help for savers and pensioners. Tory Chairman Grant Shapps, who tweeted the advert this afternoon after the Budget announcement . In yesterday's Budget Mr Osborne took . 1p off the price of a pint of beer and dramatically halved duty paid on . bingo from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. Both measures were seen as part of carefully crafted pitch to win over the skilled manual workers who backed Margaret Thatcher in their droves. But . the row over the advert - in particular the use of the word 'they' to . refer to people who like beer and bingo - has overshadowed the message . about help for bingo halls and pubs. 'These are important Budget measures, they are not the only Budget measures,' Mr Osborne told the BBC. 'This whole story... was whipped up by a Labour Party that didn’t have anything else to say about the economy. 'We . are communicating what’s in the Budget. The more people hear about the . Budget the more confident people can be that they are on the right . track.' But his Lib Dem deputy at the Treasury, Danny Alexander, made clear his unease at the ad from his coalition partners. He it was 'rather patronising' and 'demeans some quite sensible things' in the Budget. 'There . are good reasons to be supporting Bingo, there are good reasons to be . encouraging our pub sector to be stronger - that’s the analysis behind . those measures,' he told BBC 2’s Newsnight programme. 'This language, well that’s for Grant Shapps to justify.' Nick Clegg said Grant Shapps’ tweet of a Tory poster was “silly”, but should not detract from a strong Budget. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said: 'I think the tweet was a bit silly, partly because actually the issues involved in this Budget were really quite serious, including, by the way, giving support to the bingo industry – an important industry – giving support to our pubs and so on.' Speaking on his weekly radio phone-in on LBC, Mr Clegg added: 'There were just much bigger things at stake in the Budget as well, namely how are over 24million people going to benefit, which they will now do with an additional £100 tax cut. 'The very important package we’ve been working on for weeks to help savers... because people who save, first, should be trusted more with how they manage their own money, their own savings; but secondly, after years and years of low interest rates, we need to make sure as the recovery starts taking root that savers who haven’t really benefitted from that stand to do so from now on.' Stewart Wood, a senior aide to Labour leader Ed Miliband, described the advert as ‘ill-conceived’ and ‘condescending’. He said: ‘Of all the ill-conceived aspects of this Tory ad, it’s the condescending use of the word “they” that grates the most.’ Stephen Tall, editor of the grassroots . Liberal Democrat website LibDem Voice, described the ad as an . ‘embarrassment’, and said it ‘goes back to the 1950s’. Some Twitter users suggested the advert must be a spoof. Others . said it reminded them of Pulp’s hit record ‘Common People’ which mocked . the futile attempts of a rich student to understand the struggle faced . by working class people. Spoof versions of the advert were circulating on the Internet within minutes of its release by Mr Shapps. One said: ‘Cut the bingo tax and beer duty. That’s what you wretched proles get up to, isn’t it? 'So put on your clogs and grab your whippets and have at it’. But . some Tories were dismayed at the advert. One said: ‘Why are we talking . about beer and bingo, not cuts in income tax? We just look like we’re . talking down to people.’ Simone Blackwell, a writer on political satire The Thick Of It, said the ad was beyond satire . Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander last night distanced himself from the Tory advert. He told the BBC’s Newsnight programme: ‘I thought it was a spoof at first. It may be our budget, but it’s their words. It’s pretty patronising.’ Labour’s shadow Treasury chief secretary Chris Leslie described the advert as ‘quite astonishing’. ‘What better demonstration do you need that they are out of touch?’ The . overwhelmingly negative reaction to the advert is a major embarrassment . for Mr Shapps, a grammar school boy who prides himself on his . understanding of ordinary voters. Mr Shapps has made it a major priority for the Tories to increase their effectiveness on social media, such as Twitter. He is now likely to face questions about who designed the advert and why he agreed to sign it off. It is also embarrassing for David Cameron, who is sensitive to charges that he is part of an out-of-touch metropolitan elite. A major poll conducted by former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft last month found that the most common description of the Prime Minister by voters was ‘out of touch’. Mr Cameron has also faced discomfort over his reliance on fellow Old Etonians within his inner circle.Education Secretary Michael Gove sparked anger in Number 10 last week by describing the number of Old Etonians at the heart of Government as ‘preposterous’. In 2012, Andrew Mitchell, then chief whip, was . involved in a heated row with another police officer, Toby Rowland, . after he was refused permission to cycle through the main gate of . Downing Street. Mr Mitchell, accused of calling the officer a ‘pleb’, was forced to resign his post after a month of intense media interest. Two police officers were sacked over the so-called ‘Plebgate’. One, Keith Wallis, was jailed for a year at the Old Bailey for misconduct in a public office.","Party chairman Grant Shapps tweeted beer and bingo tax cuts advert .

"One man's trash is another man's treasure, as this artist proves by building mini-mobile homes for the homeless - from recycled rubbish. Greg Kloehn uses garbage like bed frames, pallets, car consoles and even washing machine doors to build his creative constructions. The 43-year-old artist only has to buy nails, screws and glue for the colourful constructions as the rest are collected on scavenger hunts for illegally dumped rubbish. Once they are completed, Mr Kloehn gives them away for free to the homeless people near his home in Oakland, California. One man's trash is another man's treasure, as artist Greg Kloehn with his mini-mobile homes for the homeless . The mobile homes made for the homeless from old rubbish in Oakland, California . The father-of-two used his first dumpster house as a second-home, until he had a eureka moment. Mr Kloehn said: 'After about a week of collecting and building, I had a 21st century home, built from the discarded fruits of the urban jungle. 'This sat at my studio for a number of months, just collecting dust until one rainy night, . Charlene, a homeless woman I've known for some 10 years, asked if I had a tarpaulin for her. 'I told her I didn't but as I went inside and walked past the home, it hit me, I should give her the house. 'So I ran back out and told her to come back tomorrow and I would have a home for her. The next day, she and her husband Oscar came round, I handed them the keys and a bottle of champagne and watched them push it down the street. 'It felt so good that I started making another one that same day.' Greg first started the project three years ago after being inspired by the materials homeless people use. 'His initial dumpster house included a camp stove for cooking, a toilet that can be hooked up to a septic tank and even a shower with hot water. To date he has made and given away 10 of the houses and admits he now loves the reaction they get.'

'One cried and got on his knees to thank me. I think it is extremely . important to help these people out as they keep getting moved by the . city and need to relocate every few weeks. 'This way, as the dumpsters are on wheels, they can be pushed around really easily.' Although . Mr Kloehn pours his heart into making them, as soon as he gifts a house . away, its future is in the hands of the new owner.

Mr Kloehn said: 'Tiny . houses strike a number of cords in our society as they aren't just . homes, but fast becoming a life style option. They are, usually, cheaper . than regular homes, giving more people the opportunity of ownership.

"A dedicated boyfriend who proposed and married his partner on the same day secretly planned her dream wedding - using her Pinterest page. Romantic Ryan Leak, 27, overheard his girlfriend Amanda Roman, 25, confessing to a friend that her dream was to get engaged and hitched at once. Ryan then committed a year to planning her perfect wedding, using her profile on the photo-sharing website Pinterest as guidance. Scroll down for video . Ryan Leak planned Amanda's entire dream wedding in secret and based on her Pinterest account . Amanda had created a folder entitled 'My dream wedding' on the website, which she used to 're-pin' over 220 wedding-related images . Ryan flew Amanda to Miami under the pretense of helping friends move, then dropped to one knee to propose to her . The website allows users to create and manage theme-based image collections and browse other pinboards and ‘re-pin’ images they like. It enabled Ryan to choose every aspect of Amanda’s dream wedding, from the flowers, to her dress, to the table decorations. Amanda had created a folder entitled ‘My dream wedding’ on the website, which she used to ‘re-pin’ over 220 wedding-related images. Ryan planned the day and then friends and family flew to the mysterious wedding destination where he had whisked Amanda on holiday. To her complete surprise he proposed and the couple from Dallas, America, then married just hours later. Amanda's favourite make-up artist and hair stylist was flown in to Miami to ensure her wedding look was exactly how she dreamed it would be . After Amanda accepted the proposal, Ryan took her to a lounge in the hotel where friends and family held up a banner saying 'today', unveiling the romantic surprise. Ryan said: 'Amanda basically planned her dream wedding without even knowing it. 'Planning a whole wedding is unbelievably daunting so Pinterest was amazing as it enabled me to pick exactly what Amanda would have liked. 'I always knew I wanted an extravagant wedding, but I never anticipated doing anything as drastic as this. 'For over a year I had to arrange to take calls in private and was forced to put locks on my phone just in case she saw anything. 'We had around 100 guests and apparently over 1000 people knew what I was planning so it’s pretty amazing she didn’t find out.' Motivational speaker Ryan proposed and wed Amanda on June 7 of this year, five years to the day after the couple first met. Romantic Ryan had planned everything down to the last detail, and proposed on the morning of the wedding- five years to the day from when they first met . Amanda Leak's Pinterest site where she had collected information about her perfect wedding which Ryan used to create her perfect big day . Ryan, from Dallas, Texas, chose Miami, Florida as the destination for their wedding as it was a place their friends and family could easily get to. He flew Amanda out to Miami the day before the wedding under the pretence the couple were helping their friends move cities. On the morning of the wedding Ryan collected Amanda from her hotel and drove her to the wedding venue where he dropped to one knee and proposed. After Amanda accepted the proposal, Ryan took her to a lounge in the hotel where friends and family held up a banner saying ‘today’, unveiling the romantic surprise. Ryan says: 'As soon as she said yes I knew nothing would matter and we would have the best day no matter what' Amanda, a psychology and education graduate, said: 'When I opened the door and I saw everyone that I loved standing there it was so overwhelming, I felt so overwhelmed with love.' The couple then went to a registry office to legally tie the knot before separating to prepare for the service and reception. Amanda’s favourite make-up artist and hair stylist was flown in to Miami to ensure her wedding look was exactly how she dreamed it would be. Ryan said: 'The day went pretty perfectly. As soon as she said yes I knew nothing would matter and we would have the best day no matter what. Amanda, who had no idea Ryan had been planning the big day, said: 'One day my friend and I were talking about wedding planning and I thought about how cool it would be to get married and engaged on the same day. 'I didn’t think through all of the details of how that would work, so I completely bypassed the fact that the groom would have to plan the entire wedding, I just pictured the day and thought how much fun it would be. 'I remember ending that conversation with my friend saying ""I don’t think that would ever happen, but it would be really cool"". 'The day was even better than how I would have planned it. Realistically I never thought that I would be able to pull off some of the things I saw on Pinterest, but Ryan is a risk taker and he didn’t settle for my watered down version of my ‘dream wedding’ - he went for the gusto.' To top off the romantic surprise, Ryan arranged for the newlyweds to fly to Naples and later Laguna Beach for their honeymoon. Ryan’s brother, a worship pastor, introduced the pair back in 2008 when Amanda attended a discipleship programme at his church. Rather than asking for traditional wedding gifts, kind Ryan asked for their guests to give to the charity A21, which fights sex trafficking around the world.","Ryan Leak, 27, proposed to and married Amanda Roman on same day .

"This is taking vegetarianism to painful new extremes. After piercing the cheeks, lips or tongue, religious devotees thrust metal implements, often several at a time, through the holes to purify themselves in a bizarre vegetarian festival in Phuket, Thailand. Thousands of people travel to the island each year for the festivities while the local ethnic Chinese population, about a third of Phuket’s population, abstain from meat, sex, alcohol and other vices during the ninth lunar month of the Chinese calendar. Scroll down for video . WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Pain for purification: This religious devotee has pierced his cheek and thrust several swords through the hole as part of a vegetarian festival in Phuket . They believe that the sacred rituals will banish evil from their community and give them good luck and fortune. Walking barefooted over hot coals, climbing ladders with bladed rungs and taking baths in hot oil are also part of the rituals done by entranced devotees. They believe being in a trance gives them supernatural powers and the ability to endure these excruciating tortures for the common good. The festival dates back to 1825 when travelling Chinese thespians were cured of tropical fever by keeping to a strict vegetarian diet . Entranced torture: This man holds a gun poking through his cheek and metal skewers through his ears, believing his suffering banishes evil and brings good luck . Piercing procession: This devotee has pierced his tongue, nose and ears with skewers for the festival celebrated by the local ethnic Chinese population in Phuket . Their suffering – they hope – draws evil out of the community around them and, in doing so, brings positive luck to their friends and village. Called Prapheni Kin Jay or Prapheni Kin Phak in Thai meaning the Festival for Eating Vegetables, is on until next Wednesday. For those who do not wish to put themselves through something that will require heavy reconstructive surgery once the party is over, there are other ways to scare off dark powers. The firework displays that take place during the festival – including the loudest and biggest, which rounds off matters on the final night – are also deemed to fend off evil spirits through sheer force of noise.

The ten-day self-cleansing festival’s origins are almost as odd as its unusual rituals. It dates back to 1825, and the visit of a traveling Chinese theatre company to the Thai mining town of Get-Hoe. When the touring actors succumbed to tropical fever in the jungle-clad region, they opted to keep to a strict vegetarian diet, hoping that this would please the gods – who would then relieve them of the illness. The plan worked – and whether or not the thespians’ improved health was down to better diet than celestial intervention – the festival was born. Wheel pain: These two have stuck car hubcaps .

"Hidden within the Himalayas, 155ft from the ground, these man-made caves are  one of the World's greatest archaeological mysteries. Thousands of holes are carved into the fragile, sandy-coloured cliff in a gorge so large it dwarfs the Grand Canyon. The astonishing number of caves, some dug into the cliffside, others tunnelled from above are thousands of years old but who built them and why remains a mystery. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Thousands of man-made caves 155ft from the ground lie hidden within the Himilayas in a gorge so large it dwarfs the Grand Canyon . Bizarre: With dozens of holes carved into the fragile, sandy-coloured cliff face this unusual 'neighbourhood in the sky' looks like a giant sandcastle . Dangerous: Climber Cedar Wright explores the series of caves near the village of Tsele . It is also not known how people climbed into the caves which are dug into a cliff 155-foot above the valley floor. An estimated 10,000 of these mysterious human-built caves have been found in the former Kingdom of Mustang in North, Central Nepal. Those who have seen the mysterious caves say the effect of them on the cliff face makes it look like a giant sandcastle. Adventure photographer, Cory Richards joined climber Pete Athans, archaeologist Mark Aldenderfer and a team of explorers to unearth the hidden relics of the ancient and remote caves. Mr Richards said: 'I was in Nepal working in this village called Forte, where Pete [Athans] and I were teaching a group of Sherpas climbing techniques, safe climbing techniques so they could climb Everest. 'And Pete asked me if I would be interested in this project in Mustang. Odd: The astonishing number of caves, some dug into the cliffside, others tunnelled from above, are thousands of years old but who built them and why remains a mystery.

The words he was using conjured these images of a place I couldn't really imagine. 'Quite honestly when I got there it was even bigger and more grand than anything I ever could ever have imagined. 'We're talking about somewhere that reminds us of the Grand Canyon, the desert south west but then has this incredible history to it. You see these caves carved into the rock and now they're completely inaccessible. 'As we started getting deeper into it, I started to see the magic of what we were approaching, the culture in practice, a 12th century village underneath the caves they used to live in, caves that are now forgotten. 'We started asking questions about how did people get into them? Impressive: This image shows eroded murals on the walls of the Ritseling Cave in Upper Mustang.

Discovery: A scientist enters a maze of rooms in a looted cave near Chuksang, left, while another member of the team hoists himself up at a Mustang cave entrance, right . Exploration: Members of the team  do a preliminary survey of a cave . 'I started wondering how do I light up people's imagination to make them think what it would have looked like thousands of years ago, that was my final challenge, how do I give people that imagination. 'One of the ways we did that was lighting up the caves, going them into them a night, spending the night in caves, using lights to light them up and strobes. 'Trying to give people the feeling this is a very ancient place, this is a place that has so many stories to tell us so much more than we can even really imagine in our lifetime.' Climbing into the sky caves was no easy feat, the rock was unstable and posed a real danger to the team of explorers. In fact climbing into the caves was so dangerous, Mr Richards lost his footing, fell and broke his back. On another assignment to Mustang the following year, videographer Lincoln Else was hit by a falling rock, fracturing his skull. He said: 'This was real exploration. It's dangerous it's loose rock it's scary. Everything is loose, everything around you feels like it's crumbling. You feel like when you're climbing everything is going to collapse.' 'One of the things I think we forget when we're talking about adventure, science and exploration is it gets dangerous at times one of the reasons its so exciting is because there are consequences and big consequences. 'On my first trip there I was trying to climb in and a foothold broke and I fell about 12-20 feet, I landed on my butt and I broke my back. 'It was an eye-opener because yes it this was really exciting, really engaging, I want to tell this big story but I just broke my back, maybe this isn't as important as I thought. 'The next year we came back to try again. I took this shot and my friend Lincoln Else was filming right next to me. 'Next thing I heard was Pete's wife scream, she said ""oh my god, oh my god"" Lincoln was lying on the ground with blood pouring from his head and convulsing. 'A rock had fallen from above, hit him and given him a 21cm skull fracture, it completely depressed his skull. 'Again it was a point of realisation that yes what you are doing is very important but it's also very dangerous and when you talk about adventure there are sides to it that are unpleasant. 'Lincoln made a full recovery, I thought for certain I think we all thought at the point that Lincoln was going to die. 'Essentially at the end of the experience, what was illuminated to me the marriage of science and exploration and culture is the ultimate in how we bring the world to everyone. 'We have to make it exciting, digestible but we also have to give the knowledge of what's out there to everyone else.'","An estimated 10,000 of the caves have been found in the former Kingdom of Mustang in .

"A Colombian woman suffering from stomach pain was found to have a 40-year-old fetus inside her. The 82-year-old, from Bogota, had what is known as 'lithopedion', or stone baby, when the unborn child develops outside the womb. The woman was originally thought to be suffering from a stomach bug, NTD TV reports. A Colombian woman suffering from stomach pain was found to have a 40-year-old fetus inside her . But an scans revealed lithopedion, where the fetus becomes calcified.There are fewer than 300 cases reported in medical literature. The woman will now will undergo surgery to have the fetus - mostly comprised of dead tissue - removed. According to NTD, Dr Kemer Ramirez of Bogota's Tunjuelito Hospital said that the doctor overseeing the woman noticed something 'abnormal in her abdomen' - and suspected gallstones. An ultrasound showed nothing then radiography of her abdomen revealed a tumour in her abdominal cavity. Dr Ramirez explained: 'This happens because the fetus does not develop in the uterus because it has moved to another place. Dr Kemer Ramirez of Bogota's Tunjuelito Hospital (pictured) explained the woman was suffering from 'lithopedion', or stone baby, when the unborn child develops outside the womb . 'In this case, the abdominal part of the . woman is not a viable (place) and this is what happened, a calcified . fetus because the body is generating defence mechanisms and it is . calcified until it stays there encapsulated.'

"A new class of millionaire football players just secured NFL contracts with the draft but the vast majority of them will not keep their fortunes secure for very long. The NFL is taking active steps to try to help curtail the staggering rate by which football players blow through their multi-million dollar contracts. Contracts awarded to top players- like this year's first round draft pick Jadeveon Clowney who landed a $22million contract with the Houston Texans- lead to spending excesses in a surprisingly high number of cases. Number one: Jadeveon Clowney was drafted by the Houston Texans and is expected to make between $22million and $25million in his first four seasons . In 2009, Sports Illustrated calculated that 78 per cent of all NFL players end up bankrupt or basically bankrupt within two years of their careers ending- if not sooner. 'I've made millions and Iost millions... I bought a ton of jewelry coming out, cars, a stereo system that was worth more than the car,' former first round draft pick Eddie George said to CNN Money. Taking care of mom: Clowney said that his first priority for his paycheck will be to make sure his single mother Josenna, who works at a potato chip factory, is looked after . George was the first round pick in 1996 and played for nine seasons before virtually running out of money. 'I found out real quick that money and ignorance is not a good combination.' Now the NFL has actively started addressing the issue and calls for rookie players to attend a three-day symposium where they are given some lessons in financial basics. 'The best advice I got was to remain humble,' former Tennessee Titans player-turned-Rhodes scholar and medical school student Eddie George said. 'There are veterans on the team who have six or seven cars they drive to practice and Louis Vuitton and Prada suits. If you give into that lifestyle, you go broke quickly.' Individual teams have their own guidance programs as well. Last year's Superbowl winners, the Seattle Seahawks, put 'Mo' Kelly, the director of player development, up to the task and he told CNN that the best way is to talk it through with the athletes individually by teaching them how to budget. 'A lot of these guys don't have any concept of money. I always ask the question: How many of you guys ever made over $10,000 a year in your life?' Kelly said. No one normally raises their hand. He then goes on to explain credit scores and the importance of calculating for taxes when looking at their paychecks. The . biggest paycheck from this season is undoubtedly going to Clowney, who . some estimated will make up to $25million in his first four seasons. 'This feels great, I've been waiting all my life for this,' he said following Friday night's draft. Words of wisdom: Former Tennessee Titans player-turned-Rhodes scholar and medical school student Eddie George (left) urges rookies to remain humble while Seahawks director of player development 'Mo' Kelly (right) goes through lessons on budgeting and credit scores with his new players every season . 'I grew up the hard way. A lot of people said I'd be nothing. 'But I always said I'd be something one day and here I am.' It was a life-changing moment for Clowney, who was raised by a single mother who has spent the last 20 years working in a potato chip factory just to make ends meet. 'The first thing I'm going to do is take care of my mom,' he said.","First draft pick Jadeveon Clowney expected to make $22million to $25million in his first four seasons .

"World leaders were greeted by a lavish display from Vladimir Putin at Russia's G20 summit today with a decadent ball which felt a world away from the realities on the ground in Syria. Women dressed in elaborate Marie Antoinette style costumes met the world's most powerful men and women in a display which seemed to be a celebration of luxury at the Peterhof Palace in St Petersburg.

Putin greeted Obama with a thin smile . and a businesslike handshake earlier in the day, a clear sign of the . strains between them. President Obama said he was convinced that the chemical attack in Damascus last month was the work of the Syrian government and reiterated his position that the world must intervene to prevent further attacks. He added that the use of chemical weapons is 'not only a tragedy but also a violation of . international law that must be addressed'.

"Global temperatures could soar by at least 4°C by 2100 if carbon dioxide emissions aren’t slashed, new research warns. Climate scientists claim that temperatures could rise by at least 4°C by 2100 and potentially more than 8°C by 2200, which could have disastrous results for the planet. The research, published in the journal Nature, found that the global climate is more affected by carbon dioxide than previously thought. Scientists added that temperatures could rise by more than 8°C by 2200 if CO2 emissions are not reduced. The research found that the global climate is more affected by carbon dioxide than previously thought . Fewer clouds form as the planet warms so that less sunlight is reflected back into space, driving temperature on Earth higher. When water evaporates from oceans, vapour can rise nine miles into the atmosphere to create rain clouds that reflect light, or can rise just a few miles and drift back down without forming clouds. While both processes occur in the real world, current climate models place too much emphasis on the amount of clouds that form on a daily basis. By looking at how clouds form in on the planet , scientists are able to create more realistic climate models, which are used to predict future temperatures. Scientists have long debated how clouds affect global warming. It could also solve one of the mysteries of climate sensitivity - the role of cloud formation and whether it has positive or negative effect on global warming. Researchers now believe that existing climate models significantly overestimate the number of clouds protecting our atmosphere from overheating. The study suggests that fewer clouds form as the planet warms, so that less sunlight is reflected back into space, driving temperatures up on Earth. Professor Steven Sherwood, from the . University of New South Wales, said: 'Our research has shown climate . models indicating a low temperature response to a doubling of carbon . dioxide from pre-industrial times are not reproducing the correct . processes that lead to cloud formation.' 'When the processes are correct in the climate models, the level of climate sensitivity is far higher. Protective: Researchers now believe that existing climate models significantly overestimate the number of clouds protecting the atmosphere from overheating . 'Previously, estimates of the sensitivity of global temperature to a doubling of carbon dioxide ranged from 1.5°C to 5°C. 'This new research takes away the lower end of climate sensitivity estimates, meaning that global average temperatures will increase by 3°C to 5°C with a doubling of carbon dioxide.' Professor Sherwood told The Guardian that a rise of 4°C would likely be 'catastrophic' rather than just dangerous. 'For example, it would make life difficult, if not impossible, in much of the tropics, and would guarantee the eventual melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet' he said. The costs of extreme weather events have risen dramatically, climate scientists warned last week. The national science academies of EU Member States believe Europe needs to plan for future probabilities of extreme weather, such as heat waves, floods and storms. Highlighting a 60 per cent rise over the last 30 years in the cost of damage from extreme weather events across Europe, the European Academies' Science Advisory Council (EASAC) warned of the grave economic and social consequences if European policy makers do not use the latest estimates of future droughts, floods and storms in their planning while adapting to global warming and the resulting climate disruption. The report urges EU nations to prepare for heat waves and think about how to reduce the number of deaths. Flood defence is also an area that requires improvement, as rising sea levels will leave coastal areas at serious risk from storm surges. Researchers also believe climate research and adaptation plans should be given more priority. The key to this narrower but higher estimate can be found by looking at the role of water vapour in cloud formation. When . water vapour is taken up by the atmosphere through evaporation, the . updraughts can rise up to nine miles (15km) and form clouds that produce heavy rains. The can however also rise just a few kilometres before returning to the surface without forming rain clouds, which reflect light away from the earth's surface. When . they rise only a few kilometres, they reduce total cloud cover because . they pull more vapour away from the higher clouds forming. Researchers found that climate models predicting a lesser rise in the Earth's temperature, do not include . enough of the lower level water vapour process. Most models show nearly all updraughts rising to 9 miles and forming clouds, reflecting more sunlight and as a result, the global temperature in these models becomes less sensitive in its response to atmospheric carbon dioxide. The scientists warned that such a rise in temperatures on Earth would lead to droughts (pictured) and make life difficult for people living in the tropics. A hotter planet would also likely lead to the melting of the Greenland ice sheet and some of the Antarctic ice sheet . When . the models are made more realistic, the water vapour is taken to a . wider range of heights in the atmosphere, causing fewer clouds to form . as the climate warms. This . increases the amount of sunlight and heat entering the atmosphere and as . a result increases the sensitivity of our climate to carbon dioxide or . any other perturbation. The . result is that when the models are correct, the doubling of carbon . dioxide expected in the next 50 years will see a temperature increase of . at least 4°C by 2100. Professor . Sherwood said: 'Climate sceptics like to criticise climate models for . getting things wrong and we are the first to admit they are not perfect, . but what we are finding is that the mistakes are being made by those . models that predict less warming, not those that predict more. 'Rises . in global average temperatures of this magnitude will have profound . impacts on the world and the economies of many countries if we don’t . urgently start to curb our emissions.'","Research by the University of New South Wales found that the global climate is more affected by carbon dioxide .

"They're supposed to be man's best friends, but as these two prove, dogs have just as much love for each other as they do for us. Here are the pictures which show the devotion of one male dog who spent 10 hours guarding a female who had fallen down a deep gutter in southern China's Hunan province. The white male's barking woke up Peng Xuemei, 77, who looked out of her window in Changsha and saw the animal standing by a gutter while another black dog cowered at the bottom. The male dog's barking was first heard by an elderly woman from her window at 12.30am . Instead of helping, the 77-year old went back to sleep, but when she got up again at 6.15 the dog was still there . She phoned the council office who sent a man out to help, but he was afraid to approach the dog in case the distressed animal bit him . Not wanting to disturb the 'furious' looking canine, the elderly woman went back to bed, but when she got up at 6.15am, they were both still there. She said: 'The white one was walking back and forth, looking at passing people and . vehicles in begging eyes, while the black dog groveled at the bottom of . the gutter.' No doubt impressed by the male dog's tenacity, Peng decided to phone the community office, who sent a worker, Lui Huihong, out to help. The job of rescuer eventually fell to local man Hei Ge who managed to gin the male's trust and fish the female out . After his night-long vigil finally came to an end the white dog was clearly glad to be back with his female accomplice . The pair were obviously happy to be reunited once again . But when Lui got there, he was afraid to approach the animal in case the he was attacked. 'We dared not to get close, as the white male dog looked hectic and quite alert,' he said. Eventually the job of rescuing the blighted black dog fell to local man Hei Ge, who gained the white dog's trust by slowly edging up to it. After the dog had calmed down Ge reached into the gutter and managed to fish the female dog out. Obviously full of relief for his unlucky lady, the male dog calmed down and after a few moments the pair ran off down the street, playing as they went. After a lengthy rescue operation the couple began playing before running off down the road together .","Accident happened overnight in Changsha, southern China .

"Passengers on board a research ship that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow after three icebreakers failed to reach the paralysed vessel - but it could still be weeks before they reach dry land. A helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers trapped on the Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy when there is a break in the weather. Ironically, the Akademik had gone in search of evidence of the . world’s melting ice caps but instead the team of climate scientists had to abandon their mission because the ice is . thicker than usual at this time of year. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) said the rescue would be a complex operation. Scroll down for videos . Passengers on board Russian ship MV Akademik Shokalskiy that has been trapped in Antarctic ice since Christmas Eve are expected to be rescued by helicopter tomorrow. Above, crew build an icy helipad today . A helicopter on board a Chinese icebreaker, the Snow Dragon, aims to collect the 52 passengers. The 22 members of crew will remain on the stricken vessel . This image, taken by passenger Andrew Peacock, shows the ship still stuck in the ice off East Antarctica, as it waits to be rescued . The research team had hoped the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis (seen here yesterday) would be able to crack through the thick ice and allow them to continue on their way . The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said the rescue would be a complex operation - and it could be several weeks before the passengers reach dry land. Above, Akademik expedition leader Greg Mortimer gives a briefing about the ice conditions yesterday . 'The helicopter is unable to fly in the current weather conditions and will hold off on the rescue until conditions improve,' AMSA said in a statement. 'Weather conditions are unlikely to start improving until tomorrow and decisions related to carrying out the rescue may be made at short notice.' The 22 members of the crew - who have built an icy helipad - will stay behind with the ship and wait for the ice to break up naturally, expedition spokesman Alvin Stone said. They had hoped the Australian icebreaker Aurora Australis would be able to crack through the thick ice and allow them to continue on their way. The ship isn't in danger of sinking, and there are weeks' worth of supplies on board, but the vessel cannot move. Above, the research team drill into the ice .

Professor Chris Turney, leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, is pictured talking to international media from the top deck of the stranded ship . Australian Green Party Senator-elect Janet Rice up early doing some stretching on the top deck of the MV Akademik Shokalskiy . The Aurora came within 20km (12 miles) of the ship on Monday, but fierce winds and snow forced it to retreat to open water. Today, the weather remained bleak, and the crew on the Aurora said their vessel would also be at risk of getting stuck if it made another rescue attempt. The Snow Dragon, which is waiting with the Aurora at the edge of the ice pack, was also unable to crack through the ice, as was France's L'Astrolabe. The passengers will be flown back to the Snow Dragon in groups of 12, and then transferred by barge to the Aurora. John . Young, AMSA emergency response division general manager, said the . Aurora Australis will then take several days to make its way to the . Casey Base in Antarctica to refuel before returning to Hobart in . Tasmania. 'It will be a couple of weeks before they are landed,' he told Ninemsn. The Chinese icebreaker Xuelong - meaning Snow Dragon - was deployed to rescue the Russian science ship . However just before midnight on Friday Captain Wang Jianzhong's ship (pictured) also became trapped . Scientists on board the Xuelong, including Liu Shunlin (left), are now studying the condition of the Russian ship while they wait to be freed themselves . A photograph sent in by the captain of the Russian ship suggests that the two vessels can actually see each other, albeit as a tiny speck on the horizon . Smile: The crew of passengers and researchers pose for a holiday photograph in the depths of Antarctica . Barbara Tucker, a passenger on Russia's Academic Shokalskiy, is pictured watching an adelie penguin . It is believed a simple shift in the wind could free the Akademik. Winds from the east have been pounding the ship and pushing the ice around the vessel. A westerly wind would help break up the ice, Stone said. The trouble is, no one knows when the wind will change. The ship isn't in danger of sinking, and there are weeks' worth of supplies on board, but the vessel cannot move. The . expedition, which set off from New Zealand on November 28, is being led . by Chris Turney, a climate scientist, who was hoping to reach the base . camp of Douglas Mawson, one of the most famous Antarctic explorers, and . repeat observations done by him in 1912 to see what impact climate . change had made. Trapped: 74 people, including scientists, tourists and a Guardian reporter, are stuck in thick ice sheets . Crew members routinely check the hull of the ship, which gathers fresh layers of snow every night . The looming helicopter rescue means the expedition will have to be cut short, Stone said. Still, those on board appeared to be taking it all in stride. 'Surprisingly, all the passengers seem to be considering it the adventure of a lifetime,' Stone said. Turney has also posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing the Chinese vessel, a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice. 'Everyone well,' Turney added. He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'. Passengers waved as a helicopter sent from China's retreated Snow Dragon flew by to check the snow levels yesterday . The researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well-stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of Tasmanian capital Hobart .

"He appeared in a video on Al Arabiya TV saying he is joining 'the people’s revolution' The man who heads Syria’s military police has joined the uprising against President Bashar Assad’s regime, Maj. Gen. Abdul-Aziz Jassem al-Shallal’s defection makes him one of the most senior officials to switch side during the bloody 21-month conflict. He appeared in a video on Al Arabiya TV saying he is joining 'the people’s revolution.' In a video broadcast on Al Arabiya TV, Syrian Maj. Gen. Abdul-Aziz Jassem al-Shallal says he is defecting and joining 'the people's revolution' Al-Shallal’s defection comes as military pressure builds on the regime, with government bases falling to rebel assault near the capital Damascus and elsewhere across the country. The human cost remains high. Today, it was claimed that government shelling in the north-east killed at least 20 people, including women and as many as eight children. Al-Shallal said in the video that the 'army has derailed from its basic mission of protecting the people and it has become a gang for killing and destruction’. Free Syrian Army fighters walk near damaged buildings in the Al-Khalidiya neighbourhood of Homs. Al-Shallal said in the video that the army has 'become a gang for killing and destruction' Free Syrian Army fighters and residents carry the bodies of people killed by what activists said were missiles fired by a Syrian Air Force fighter jet from forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad . He accused the military of ‘destroying cities and villages and committing massacres against our innocent people who came out to demand freedom’. Thousands of Syrian soldiers have defected over the past 21 months and many of them are now fighting against government forces. Many have cited attacks on civilians as the reason they switched sides. Syria’s crisis began with protests demanding reforms but later turned into a civil war. Anti-regime activists estimate more than 40,000 have died in the past 21 months.","Gen.

"Beggars at a religious folk festival in southern China have been ordered to stay in purposely built cages, or be removed from the festivities. Organisers gave the beggars an ultimatum saying their presence ruins the experience for visitors at the temple fair in Nanchang, Jiangxi province and if they wished to beg they had to do so from inside small cages. The zoo-like cages are so small adults are unable to stand and although they are free to leave at will, they are immediately banished from the festival area and have to leave the town if they do so. Caged: Visitors to the town fair in Nanchang, Jiangxi province walk past beggars in cages where they have been forced to stay so as not to spoil the experience for tourists . The annual fair celebrates a religious holy . day with a funfair, market and entertainment as pilgrims come to the temple from all over China. Due to the thousands of visitors it has become a magnet for down-and-outs looking for charity from tourists. ‘This year we decided we would no . longer accept beggars wandering everywhere, distressing our guests and . spoiling it for everyone else,' explained one organiser before adding that no one is forcing them to beg and that they have voluntarily entered the cages. ‘Over the last few years we have had . increasing numbers of beggars turning up at the festival and it was . becoming very intruding for our visitors. They were being harassed and . made to feel uncomfortable. ‘We had no choice but to ban them from . the grounds. We found the cages a good solution for everyone. People . can still give them donations if they desire too but are not harassed . and followed around the festival when they are having a day out with . their families. ‘The beggars are quite comfortable in . their cages, people send them food and water as gifts. In a way it is . better for them there than having to find a place on the busy streets.' Behind bars: A woman is laughing with a young child inside one of the zoo- like cages where beggars are kept during the temple festival after organisers complained they 'spoil' the celebrations . 'Human zoo': The cages are so small the 'inmates' are unable to stand and their conditions have outraged human rights campaigners in China who accuses the festival of keeping a 'human zoo' ‘Our guests come here to enjoy themselves and that is our top priority. ‘The beggars can leave whenever they like but they have to leave the city too, they can't go into the fair,’ they added. The cages have infuriated human rights campaigners in China who have branded them a human zoo saying it breaches human rights. ‘They are treating them like zoo animals. What will they have to do next - tricks for their food?,' one said. 'This is . nothing less than public humiliation.' ‘Do they want people to believe the . region has no poor people and just put on a good show? These people need . help. We should not be allowing them to be locked away in cages. These . people are human beings too.' Locked or banned: The festival organisers have said the beggars are free to leave their cages at any time, but if they do they also have to leave the city and the fair immediately . Many pilgrims who had some to enjoy the fair, but most importantly honour the religious holiday, were outraged by the treatment of the beggars. Lu Cheng who was visiting the temple . with his family said: ‘I was horrified to see these poor people in . cages. We came for a nice day out with the family, but it was . distressing to see fellow humans kept like animals in a cage. ‘These people deserve better treatment . and should be able to visit the festival just like everyone else. If . people decide to give them food, money or water that is up to them.' Traditionally people visited the temple to pay their sacrifices to Buddhist gods. Thousands of people from many . different provinces make the pilgrimage to the temples and due to its . popularity the nearby town has turned the event into a fair with folk . shows, traditional foods, markets with local delicacies and attractions . for children.","Temple fair in Nanchang, Jiangxi place beggars in 'zoo-like' cages .

"Swedish men are being warned against any inclination for nude swimming after a new species of fish has been discovered in their waters which enjoys biting testicles. A 21cm pacu fish, a relative of the piranha, was found by fisherman in the Oresund Sound off the south coast of the country last week. Known in Papua New Guinea as 'The Ball . Cutter', the pacu has reportedly been responsible for the deaths of two . fishermen in the Pacific nation, who died from blood loss after the fish . had bitten off their testicles. Nutcracker: The Pacu fish, a relative of the piranha, has been known to attack male genitalia . A freshwater fish, it can grow up to 90cm long and weigh up to 25kg. Mainly found in the rivers of the Amazonian basin, they have flatter teeth which are very similar to humans and perfect for crunching. Their . diet is mainly nuts, leaves, aquatic vegetation and snails - but on . occasion they have been known to enjoy the taste of human flesh. 'Keep your swimwear on if you're bathing in the Sound these days - maybe there are more out there!' the Natural History Museum of Denmark has warned. 'The pacu is not normally dangerous to people but it has quite a serious bite, there have been incidents in other countries, such as Papua New Guinea where some men have had their testicles bitten off,' said Henrik Carl, a fish expert at the Danish museum told Sweden's The Local. In 2004, The Scotsman newspaper reported . that an 18-month-old toddler required surgery after a pacu bit her . finger at Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World. Danger: Swedish men are being warned against enjoying their beautiful waters in the nude in case a Pacu fish attacks . Mr Carl admitted he cannot be sure if there are any more pacu in Swedish waters. 'They are almost identical to the . piranha, you couldn't even tell from the outside. It's just that they . have different teeth. Flatter and stronger, perfect for crushing,' he . added. So far, there have been no reports of . any pacu attacks in European waters, but after this first sighting, Mr . Carl said bathers should be cautious. 'It could become a problem some time . in the future if it's not the only one. This one was the first, but who . knows, it's probably not the last.,' he told the newspaper.","Pacu fish found in the Oresund Sound off Sweden's south coast .

"Tragedy: The parents of Luke Weaving-Shorrocks were told he was dead, only for the baby to be rushed to intensive care 36 minutes after his traumatic birth . Doctors told a first time mother her baby was dead only for the infant to start breathing and be rushed into intensive care 36 minutes after his traumatic birth, an inquest heard. Midwives had expected Victoria Weaving-Shorrocks, 33, to give birth after eight hours, but she was only offered a Caesarean-section after seven further hours of difficulties delivering naturally. When her baby Luke was born, weak and barely breathing, Mrs Weaving said she saw a 'look of dread and panic' on the faces of maternity staff - some who were reduced to tears during the delivery. Staff at Wigan Infirmary in Greater Manchester battled to . revive him for 20 minutes before paediatrian Dr Martin Farrier told her: . 'I think dad knows what I’m about to say. Unfortunately there was . nothing we could do.' However, around 36 minutes after his birth Luke . suddenly took a 'couple of breaths' and was rushed . into intensive care. He was kept in hospital for a further five weeks . before being sent home by doctors - to the surprise of his parents. Luke, was left severely brain damaged after his brain was starved of oxygen during the birth, died aged only three months after he  stopped breathing during a feeding session. At the inquest into her baby's death Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks, a travel firm consultant, claimed the length of the labour may have cost her son his life. 'I think labour went on incredibly long,' said Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks, of Wigan. 'I felt it should have been recognised that I had delivery problems naturally. 'After that lunchtime period I felt I . was just left. It wasn’t staffing issues because I had two midwives. I . wasn’t a priority, I was a first time mum having a long labour.' When asked about having a Caesarean-section . sooner she told the hearing in Bolton: 'I feel that it may have saved my . baby’s life. Letting me push the way I did, they couldn’t get him out. I . think that maybe in hindsight I would be demanding a c-section. Parents: Richard and Victoria Weaving-Shorrocks believe their son might have survived if his mother had been offered a caesarean section earlier in her labour . 'I would have asked for an earlier delivery. I felt they left me a long time. If they had to put me on a drip things weren’t going particularly normally. I just feel like something could have been done earlier.' The tragedy occurred after Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks, who conceived Luke after fertility treatment and had a normal pregnancy, was admitted to Wigan Infirmary at 1am on May 17 2011 when her waters broke. Midwives were initially happy with her progress and there was no suggestion she was at risk. 'I was told that I was fully dilated and everything seemed to be progressing normally,' she told the hearing. 'But by 10am I never really got a really strong urge to push, if anything things seem to be slowing down. By mid-morning contractions started to diminish and after midday I was reviewed by a consultant. Birth: Staff at Wigan Infirmary in Greater Manchester battled to revive Luke for 20 minutes before paediatrian Dr Martin Farrier told his mother: 'Unfortunately there was nothing we could do' 'Yet there was never any mention of there being any concerns with the baby’s heart rate. I was reassured everything was going as normal.' Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks later had an epidural to help her push for longer but by 3pm there was still so sign of her baby and she was taken to theatre for a caesarean section at 4pm. During the procedure it was discovered . Luke’s head had become stuck in his mother’s pelvis with doctors . struggling to extricate him. He was left with severe brain damage after being starved of oxygen and suffering a fractured skull and bleed on the brain. Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks said: 'Being a first time mum you expect a longer labour and there was nothing for me to be concerned about. The midwife were so reassuring, that I was heading towards a normal natural delivery. Breathing: Around 36 minutes after his birth Luke suddenly took a 'couple of breaths' and was rushed into intensive care. He was kept in hospital for a further five weeks before being sent home by doctors . 'There was never anything to make me feel there was concerns-until after 3pm. It was then I remember thinking ""I’m sure my baby should be born by this point"". I remember the midwife saying you should have had this baby born by 9am. 'I started to think why is it taking all this time. I remember the midwife saying she was going to find someone because they had not been to check on me for some time. 'A c-section was mentioned as a back up and I put all my faith in them to make the decision. If I had any concerns I would have asked to go in for a c-section earlier. 'I would never have put my baby at risk. I thought this was the natural progression and this was best for my baby. Tender: Mr Weaving-Shorrocks with his baby son, who was left with severe brain damage after the traumatic birth . 'In theatre there was no sense of urgency or panic and then the atmosphere totally changed. There was a sense of panic on people’s faces, a look of dread on people’s faces. I knew something wasn’t right.' Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks told the hearing that when her baby was born he did not cry, and she knew that something was wrong as she looked at her husband. 'I knew from Richard’s face that something wasn’t right and then it was when Dr Farrier came and told me that unfortunately he had not made it,' she said. 'I remember lying there and Richard sat at the side of me holding my hand. I remember asking why my baby was not crying. Everybody’s faces said it all. 'Then Dr Farrier said, ""I think dad knows what I’m about to say that unfortunately there was nothing we could do"". I always remember those words. 'I was in shock. All I was thinking was ‘this was my fault, how can I not deliver him’. I was taken to recovery to try and digest the news that this baby we were having had been born with no signs of life.' However, later in the recovery room another doctor told the couple Luke was in fact in intensive care on a ventilator and he was transferred to Hope Hospital in Salford. She added: 'Nobody ever mentioned life expectancy to us because nobody could tell us. There was a lot of confusion what was actually wrong with him. His heart stopped on a couple of occasions. We were even woken up at 3am to get him christened. 'They couldn’t tell us what ability he would have, if he would have any motor skills. It was a waiting game. It was a case of taking every day as it came.' Mr Weaving-Shorrocks, a vehicle technician said in the moments after the birth he saw midwives in tears and added: 'It went from him dying and straight into the intensive care. Infant: The couple were allowed to take their son home on June 25 after they were given just a short demonstration on administering CPR if he collapsed . 'After he had died he was in recovery. The doctor told us that he had never seen it before, that the baby had taken a couple of breaths and they have resuscitate him.' Luke regained consciousness but . doctors told the family he had a 'very limited' life expectancy. The couple were allowed to take their son home on June 25 after they were given just a short demonstration on administering CPR if he collapsed. Mr Weaving-Shorrocks said: 'I was quite astonished Luke being sent home later when we knew very little about his condition and the way we should approach the condition. 'We only got very little resuscitation lessons and I remember saying to Vic we should know more. 'He was never expected to live as long as he did. I remember receiving a letter saying cerebral palsy.' Condition: Throughout his short life Luke had to be fed through a tube. His condition deteriorated and on August 14 he was rushed back into hospital where he was pronounced dead . Throughout his short life Luke had to be fed through a tube. His condition deteriorated and on August 14 he was rushed back into hospital where he was pronounced dead. Midwife Christina Lowe said Mrs Weaving-Shorrocks had, 'been progressing really well' during labour. She said: 'I wasn’t concerned about the foetal wellbeing. It was a long labour but it can happen with first time mums. There was no sign of an obstructive labour.' Dr Farrier said attempts were made to revive Luke for 20 minutes after he was born but he showed no signs of life for a further 16 minutes after that. 'I remember looking at dad and recognising absolute terror,' he told the hearing. I did not expect Luke to survive, I believed the outcome was inevitable. 'I believe I said that I did not expect Luke to survive. Babies typically die some hours later, usually 12-24 hours, it was my expectation that he would not survive. 'It was the most extraordinary moment of my career when I recognised that he was breathing. We had 36 minutes of no significant output.' He said Luke would have suffered brain and heart damage because of the conditions he was born in. The hearing continues.","Luke Weaving-Shorrocks was born after a traumatic 15 hour labour .

"Wife: 'It is truly terrible. He loved his country with a rare passion' Tearful and scared, the three-year-old girl knows little of what lies behind the tension and turmoil gripping her homeland. She merely holds tight a picture of her father the way she will want to remember him. The youngster will certainly do best to forget the images that so shocked the world last week. For even in a land synonymous with violence, the way her father died seemed unusually inhumane. Tearful and terrified: Three--year-old Baraa (whose name means Innocence), clutches a picture of her father who was publicly executed and dragged through streets of Gaza by a motorcycle lynch mob . Horrific: Palestinian gunmen ride motorcycles as they drag the body of executed Ribhi Badawi, a Palestinian prisoner in Gaza suspected of working for Israel . 'Collaborator': Mr Badawi (pictured above) was killed on Tuesday for allegedly providing intelligence to enable Israel to pinpoint attack targets during the conflict with Gaza . Publicly executed minutes earlier as an alleged ‘spy for Israel’, his body was dragged through Gaza City by men on motorcycles, waving pistols triumphantly in the air. Substitute horses for bikes, noted one witness, and it could almost have been a scene from the Crusades. Along with five others, the ‘collaborator’ was killed on Tuesday for allegedly providing intelligence to enable Israel to pinpoint attack targets. He was shot twice and then ‘finished off’ with a blow from a heavy rock. Amid dizzying confusion at the height of the eight-day conflict, there were sketchy reports that the traitors were caught ‘red-handed’ with ‘high-tech filming equipment’. Beyond this, nothing else was known: not their identities nor the precise nature of any evidence against them. The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that the dead man in the picture is 37-year-old father-of-five Ribhi Badawi, a Palestinian prisoner in Gaza. Grieving: Mr Badawi's wife Kholoud with four of his children at their home in the Radwan district of Gaza . Stunned: Mr Badawi's eldest daughter, Worood, which translates as Rose, with the photo of her father . His family, neighbours and friends believe the notion that he spied for Israel is absurd – and there is much that supports their view, not least that as a prisoner Badawi was under armed guard during last week’s conflict. Badawi was a member of the Islamist group Jaljalat – Thunder – which takes its inspiration from Al Qaeda and is more hardline than Hamas. He had been in prison since 2009 when he was arrested on terrorism charges. It was alleged he was one of several fighters planning to launch attacks on Hamas. Badawi’s family claim that while in prison, he was tortured until he confessed to being a traitor. ‘Ribhi was a proud Palestinian. He loved his country with a rare passion and he was more opposed to Israeli occupation than Hamas is,’ said his widow Kholoud. ‘To see the body of my dear husband dragged through the streets like an animal is truly terrible. The men who did this were wild.’ 'Proud Palestinian': Badawi was a member of the Islamist group Jaljalat - Thunder - which takes its inspiration from Al Qaeda and is more hardline than Hamas . Sitting in her cramped home with three-year-old daughter Baraa (whose name means Innocence), Kholoud then reveals another irony – that her husband was wanted by an Israeli military court for conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism following a foiled bombing mission. The dead man’s family insists his execution had nothing to do with espionage but was rooted instead in political and tribal rivalry. ‘His enemies used the war as an excuse to kill him,’ said his widow, who alleges the man who arrested her husband had once been involved in a dispute with him. Badawi told his family he was tortured by Hamas in the months after his arrest. For days on end, he said,  he was suspended upside down and beaten. ‘They also put a machine gun in his mouth and threatened to shoot unless he signed a blank piece of paper,’ said his widow. ‘He is a tough man and he resisted but after 55 days he succumbed and signed. He was later charged with espionage and terrorism. He was sentenced to death and had been in jail ever since.’ Badawi wrote a 20-page account detailing the countless inconsistencies in the case against him. ‘I have been put under psychological and physical torture and forced to sign statements,’ he said. Ribhi Badawi’s house stands little more than a mile from where he was killed in a district just north of the city centre. People living nearby spoke of him as a local hero. One shopkeeper said: ‘The family has received many people since his death. They came to express their condolences. If Ribhi was truly suspected of being a traitor, they would have stayed away.’ Hamas said it could not comment  on the family’s claims but reiterated remarks made by its deputy leader that the killings were ‘unlawful’. - The remains of former Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will be exhumed on Tuesday to investigate allegations that he was poisoned by Israel – a claim the country denies. Arafat died in November 2004.","Dead man revealed today as 37-year-old father-of-five Ribhi Badawi .

"A huge painting of an impossibly slim and sexy woman, spread-eagled and completely naked, greets visitors to diet guru Pierre Dukan’s beautifully-appointed consulting room in an expensive Paris neighbourhood. Not exactly what one expects in your average doctor’s surgery, but the implication is clear: believe in me and miracles can happen. In the grand tradition of the travelling snake-oil salesman, Dukan sells dreams and - until this month when he was hit by a damning French official report branding him deceitful and unethical — he has done so hugely successfully. Discredited: Nutritionist and dietitian Dr Pierre Dukan . Their slimming secret? Jennifer Lopez and Pippa Middleton are said to have tried the controversial diet . An international weight loss phenomenon, he is credited with helping squeeze the Duchess of Cambridge into her wedding dress and with working similar slimming marvels on Kate’s mother, Carole, and sister, Pippa. Other celebrities who have followed his regime - usually to shed pounds after having a baby - include Jennifer Lopez, Penelope Cruz, Gisele Bundchen and Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins. And it wasn’t just faddy showbusiness stars who became converts. After interviewing Dukan on Woman’s Hour, Jenni Murray started down his calorie-busting path. Even President Francois Hollande reportedly adopted the Dukan diet so he could have more luck reining in his expanding waistline than he has had with runaway French spending. And where stick-thin celebrities lead, the public is sure to follow. Dukan’s diet book, published in France in 2000 and the UK in 2010, has sold more than 11 million copies worldwide, been translated into 14 languages and published in 32 countries. In the family: As well as Pippa, Kate and Carole were said to follow the Dukan Diet before the royal wedding . An international phenomenon, he launched an online diet ‘coaching’ business as well as online shops. There are enough Dukan books for a library, including The Dukan Diet Life Plan, The Complete Dukan Cookbook and Dukan: The Oat Bran Miracle. Last year, his company registered a turnover of £33 million. The charming, dapper Frenchman knows who to thank. When asked to explain his success in Britain, he said simply: ‘It works, and Carole Middleton.’ In late 2010, Mrs Middleton went on record about his diet to say she had been ‘doing it for four days and I’ve lost 4lb’. For many, the Dukan Diet did produce extraordinary, even life-changing, results. But there were always rumblings of dissent about his quick-fix diet formula of rapid weight loss tied to a strict regimen of 72 protein rich foods and a blanket ‘non’ to fats and carbohydrates. Hadn’t this been tried before with the Atkins diet, some asked. But who cared so long as he was winning the war on our waistlines? The Carole effect: Dr Dukan said Mrs Middleton's endorsement was a huge factor in his success in Britain . Now, though, the Dukan phenomenon is falling to pieces before our eyes. The 72-year-old nutritionist has been censured in the strongest terms by France’s national medical board for ‘breaching ethical regulations’ in prescribing the drug Mediator, an amphetamine derivative believed to have killed up to 1,800 people in France, to a patient who wanted to lose weight. ‘In resorting to untruthful assertions, Dr Dukan displayed behaviour which lacks probity and discredits the profession,’ reads the medical board’s ruling. He was given an eight-day ban from practising medicine and ordered to pay £5,160 in legal costs to the complainant. He denies wrongdoing and has said he will appeal. The penalties are purely symbolic as Dukan voluntarily struck himself off the doctors’ register last year after complaints. But it is a huge blow to the image and reputation of a man who has long traded on being a respected medical practitioner rather than a quack. The contents of the ruling are certainly damning. It says he prescribed a hugely controversial drug outside its main recommended use in treating overweight diabetics, and performed insufficient tests or follow-up checks. He also lied about the time frame of the prescription and about the patient’s medical history. Mediator - which was never approved in the UK or U.S. - was used for years in France on women who wanted to lose weight quickly. But it was withdrawn there in 2009 after the French health ministry blamed it for killing at least 500 people from heart-valve damage. Dukan’s patient - identified simply as ‘Marie-Claude’ in the French media - went to him to lose weight in 1971. Years later, she discovered she suffered heart-valve damage which experts traced to Mediator. Will this spell the end for Dukan’s diet empire? It is certainly true that he has never been branded a liar before. But the depressing truth is that the medical establishment has been attacking his dubious miracle claims for years, and yet people continue to flock to his banner. Unsustainable: Daily Mail columnist Jenni Murray regained the weight she lost . On one level, it is easy to see the attraction. The four-step diet is helpfully simple and prescriptive, unfolding with all the determined precision of a military assault. Step One is called the ‘Attack’ phase - two to seven days of eating as much as you want of 72 almost pure protein foods such as fish, lean meat, skimmed milk and fat-free cottage cheese. Step Two - ‘Cruise’ - involves continuing to eat the high-protein foods together with 28 types of carb-free vegetables such as brussels sprouts and spinach. Dukan calls Step Three ‘Consolidation’, adding fruit, bread, cheese and starchy foods. Step Four is ‘Stabilisation’, where you supposedly eat what you like without regaining weight, apart from on Thursdays when you must stick to meat and eggs. For the rest of your life. Medical critics have long argued it is dangerous, as are all heavily unbalanced diets. In 2011, it was voted the year’s worst diet by the British Dietetic Association - worse even than those that advocate binge drinking or eating according to blood group. ‘There is absolutely no solid science behind this at all,’ an association spokesman said. ‘This works on restricting foods, calories and portion control. Cutting out food groups is not advisable.’ Others have put it rather more forcefully. In the same year, Dukan lost a slander case against Jean-Michel Cohen, a nutritionist who told a French magazine the Dukan diet could cause ‘serious health problems’ such as a steep rise in cholesterol, cardiovascular problems and breast cancer. The hearing did not judge the case on scientific or health grounds but solely in relation to the slander claims. Last year, it emerged that Ashley Harrison, a 50-year-old British advertising company boss, was left in a coma after trying the Dukan diet. He recovered, but experts later confirmed he had suffered ammonia poisoning because of a genetic disorder that left him unable to get rid of the large amount of nitrogen - a by-product of protein breakdown - building up in his body. Bestseller: But the Dukan method has been criticised . Dukan was lambasted last year when he suggested France tackled its obesity problem (yes, even France has one, though Dukan trades heavily off his country’s reputation for slender women) by giving extra marks to secondary school students who lost weight or stayed thin. Critics accused him of trying to create a nation of anorexics. A different criticism that should surely register with his followers is that - in the long term - many believe it simply doesn’t work. Jenni Murray told in the Mail how she had lost 5st on the Dukan Diet, only to put it all back on again just as quickly. She was hardly alone. A survey of 5,000 French ‘Dukanians’, as followers are known, found 35 per cent regained the weight within a year, and 80 per cent had put it back on within four years. Dukan’s cunning solution has been simply to adapt his diet with new books, such as this year’s Dukan Diet Desserts And Patisseries. Dukan says he developed the diet in the Seventies as a humble GP when a patient asked him how he could lose weight without giving up meat. He has always insisted his methods are safe and healthy, claiming that he would never endorse his diet for anyone ‘who is healthy and at their right weight’. But how many women in the world think they are at their ‘right weight’? It seems like a recipe for disaster for anyone to start a radically different eating regime merely because a self-appointed expert says you should. But, as Pierre Dukan and his ilk know only too well, dieting ‘experts’ are preaching to a congregation of the desperate.","Carole Middleton, Katherine Jenkins and J-Lo have tried the Dukan Diet .

"An amateur photographer has captured an eerie photo from the shore of Loch Ness which could encourage those who believe in tales of a monster living beneath the surface of the lake. The image was taken by David Elder at Fort Augustus, at the south-west end of the 23-mile-long body of water in northern Scotland. It shows a long bow wave apparently caused by some sort of disturbance on the surface of the loch. Scroll down for video . Mystery: This bizarre picture of an unexplained phenomenon was taken from the shore of Loch Ness . The 50-year-old photography enthusiast insists the only thing that could have caused it is 'a solid black object under the water'. Mr Elder, from East Kilbride in Lanarkshire, was able to take still photos as well as filming a video of the mysterious scene. 'We were at the pier head at Fort Augustus and I was taking a picture of a swan at the time,' he said. 'Out of the corner of my right eye I caught site of a black area of water about 15ft long which developed into a kind of bow wave. 'I'm convinced this was caused by a solid black object under the water. The water was very still at the time and there were no ripples coming off the wave and no other activity on the water. 'Water was definitely going over something solid and making the wave. It looks like the sort of wave perhaps created by a windsurfing board but there was nobody on the loch at the time, no boats, nothing. 'The disturbance in the water began moving up the Loch sideways. It is something I just can't explain.' The extraordinary picture will doubtless fuel the imaginations of anyone who believes the story that there is a sea creature living in the lake, which is Britain's largest due to its 230m depth. However, sceptics will ascribe the wave to a freak gust of wind or other natural phenomenon. Iconic: This is the 'surgeon's photograph' taken in 1934 which purports to show the Loch Ness Monster . The story of the Loch Ness Monster goes back as far as the medieval period, but it first came to widespread public attention in 1933. That year a couple named the Spicers claimed to have seen a creature with a large body and long neck jumped in to the loch, causing a national sensation. The next year, the iconic 'surgeon's photograph' was published, purporting to show the creature swimming in Loch Ness with its head out of the water. Although that image has been debunked as a hoax, the search for Nessie has continued, with true believers undeterred by the failure of repeated attempts by scientists to find the creature.","David Elder, 50, takes mysterious picture while photographing a swan .

"Police in a Paris suburb are facing the sack after blackening up their faces with boot polish and eating bananas during a fancy dress party. The officers, from Kremlin-Bicetre, thought pictures of the party would remain private, however the images which show them smiling with their blacked up faces and afro wigs appeared on social media, where they quickly spread.

The department which investigates police officer behaviour in France, the Inspection Generale de la Police Nationale, is set to question them this week. It is thought they could be sacked or fined for insulting behaviour. The pictures have caused outrage across France with anti-racism groups slamming their behaviour. Louis-Georges Tin, president of the Conseil Represantatif des Associations Noires said: 'If the police officers who have the responsibility to fight racism are busy making fun of black people than defending them, it could explain why things have advanced so little in this domain.'

"A fitness buff has drowned after trying to save his beloved boxer from the sea. Sam Rizkallah, 58, who owned a laundry business in Largo, Florida, had attempted to reach four-year-old Oliver on Tuesday after he jumped in the water - but both were swept out to sea. Rizkallah, who was married and enjoyed to run and work out, became so weak that he was unable to hold on to a rescue device and his body was recovered an hour later. Oliver the dog survived. The family man was aboard his 27-foot boat with his brother, his niece, her husband and their children when he jumped into chest-deep water to anchor the bow, the Tampa Bay Times reported. Tragic: Sam Rizkallah, 58, has drowned in Clearwater, Florida after trying to save his dog from the water . His boxer, who had also been aboard the boat, spied his owner in the water and jumped in to join him. But as he began to swim, he was swept away by a strong current, authorities said. Rizkallah and his nieces husband, Todd Cochran, swam after his dog. There were 'not in deep water,' Wildlife commission spokesman Gary Morse said. 'But a strong current can have an effect on you no matter how strong you are or how well you had previously planned.' Another boater saw Rizkallah struggling in the water and threw him a lifeline but he was unable to hold on - due to the current or Rizkallah's exhaustion, Morse told the Times. Strong: Rizkallah (right) was fit and healthy but became exhausted as he tried to battle the sea's current . His body was found an hour later and the Medical Examiner's Office ruled he died of accidental drowning. Now his devastated family are trying to come to terms with the loss of a fantastic father and friend. Sam Rizkallah's wife .

He was a very strong man, and this is just out of nowhere.' She had been in a business meeting in Las Vegas when she learned what had happened and took a red-eye flight home to be with her family early on Wednesday. Rizkallah, whose full name was Isam, was originally from Palestine but immigrated to Detroit, Michigan in 1970 before moving to Clearwater, Florida in 1980 and meeting Patterson in 1993.

Morse, . who noted that Rizkallah had not been wearing a life jacket, said that . when people are trying to save their dogs from the water, the best idea . is to follow them in a boat.

"A slim mother of four fast becoming famous for her competitive eating feats has conquered another challenge. Molly Schuyler, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, bested the Mad Greek Deli Challenge Thursday in Portland, Oregon – a 12-pound sandwich, one pound of French fries and a large soda. She completed the incredible feat in less than an hour and is the only woman to finish, KPTV reported. On your marks, get set: Ms Schuyler flashes a grin just before beginning the challenge . Ms Schuyler had one hour to clean her plate, she needed only 54 minutes. She ate the enormous sandwich and fries after uploading a YouTube video only three weeks ago of her demolishing nine pounds of cottage cheese in under two minutes. ‘It's an unexplained phenomenon,’ Ms Schuyler told the station. ‘I was just born that way. I started doing this about a year ago, and I guess it's like a stupid human trick.' Halfway there: Ms Schuyler had about half of the sandwich gone in just under half an hour . She won $650 for finishing the food. When asked what the toughest part was, Ms Schuyler said the meat. ‘I don’t like salami or pepperoni,’ she said, apologizing. Another woman who tried to win the challenge alongside her was unable to finish. Ms Schuyler credits her childhood eating habits with helping become such a big eater. ‘We did that so much as kids, we kind of battled it out,’ she explained. ‘We've always ate big.’ The winner, and still champion: The Nebraska mother easily bested the challenge, and won $650 for her effort . Slender: Mrs Schuyler's slim physique, and the fact that she has birthed four kids, may come as a surprise to those who've watched her eat .

Safe: Heather Roteamel hugs her son Corey Gustafson who was one of the children that in the school bus . Investigators were looking into how the crash happened, but County 911 director Chris Davis said the bus apparently went off a bridge that Douglass School District officials described as a low-water crossing. Emergency personnel decided against using boats because of the swift current. Instead, they reached the bus on lines and putting the children and the driver in life jackets before pulling them to dry ground. The accident happened around 4 p.m. outside Douglass, a town of about 1,700 residents southeast of Wichita.

"Nurses shouted at relatives who tried to give their dying loves ones a sip of water, an inquiry into the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway revealed today. Ministers moved to scrap the end of life plan after a damning inquiry found it was being used as an excuse for poor care. Dying patients were placed on the LCP without their families knowing, left for weeks and in some cases months, and denied water despite the pleading of loved ones to let them have a drink. Write caption here . The shocking catalogue of abuse found that . some relatives were forced to give their loved ones water secretly when . the nurse was out of the room – because medical staff had forbidden it. Baroness Neuberger, who carried out the review, said that hydration problems were the ‘biggest issue’ raised by people who gave evidence to the review. She added: ‘The same stories keep emerging of poor care, appalling communications and oft a lack of attention or compassion. 'Among the worst stories were of people on the Liverpool Care Pathway for days going into weeks without communication or review or discussion. ‘And also desperate stories of . desperate people who are longing for a drink of water who were, through . misunderstanding of the Liverpool Care Pathway and poor care, denied a . drink. ‘Stories of nurses shouting at families who give a patient a drink were frequent as were stories of people who were just left to get on with it with no regular observations or review.’ Hundreds of thousands of people have been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway since it was developed in the late 1990s. Developed by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital and the Marie Curie Hospice in Liverpool to care for terminally ill cancer patients, it was later expanded to help anyone who was dying. It was supposed to alert clinicians to not just a dying patient’s physical problems but their emotional, social and spiritual needs in their final hours and days. But it has faced a storm of criticism, with relatives not told that loved ones had been placed on the LCP, and the guidance misinterpreted by some hospitals so that patients were even denied water. In November last year ministers ordered an independent review into its use after it was revealed up to 60,000 patients die on the LCP each year without giving their consent. A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones. The pathway involves withdrawal of lifesaving treatment, with the sick sedated and usually denied nutrition and fluids. Death typically takes place within 29 hours. Records from 178 hospitals also show that thousands of people on the pathway are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them comfortable while drugs are administered. Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. Health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million for putting more patients on the LCP. Now the government is to phase out the LCP and scrap the incentive payments to encourage trusts to end patients' lives. The LCP - which recommends that in some circumstances doctors withdraw treatment, food and water from sedated patients in their final days - has come under intense scrutiny. Reports have suggested that doctors have been establishing ‘death lists’ of patients to be put on the pathway but some hospitals have been accused of using it to cut costs and save bed spaces. The review recommended scrapping the LCP after finding doctors used it ‘as an excuse for poor-quality care’. They concluded that there were ‘too many cases where the LCP was simply being used as a 'tick box' exercise.’ Health minister Norman Lamb announced that the LCP would be phased out over the next 6-12 months after learning of 'too many examples of poor practice and poor quality care, with families and carers not being properly involved and supported'. In a statement to MPs he added: 'Instead, an individual approach to end of life care for each patient will be introduced, with a personalised care plan backed up by condition-specific good practice guidance and a named senior clinician responsible for its implementation. 'People who use health and care services have the right to be treated with respect, dignity and compassion by staff with the skills and time to care for them properly. 'We all want our own and our loved ones’ final days and hours to be pain-free and dignified, with individual needs prioritised and respected, and with families and carers fully involved.' The review found examples of patients being so heavily drugged that they could ‘never communicate again’, meaning their grief-stricken families never got to say goodbye. And some claimed their relatives had been given a ‘chemical cosh’ cocktail of drugs, with the express intent of hastening their deaths from dehydration. Every year, 130,000 patients have been placed on the pathway, which usually involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs. The Mail has been leading a campaign against it, highlighting examples of doctors putting patients on the pathway without asking for consent. We also revealed how some hospitals were being paid six-figure ‘bribes’ to meet targets about the numbers of patients on the LCP – leading to fears that doctors were put under pressure to use the pathway. Following our revelations, Mr Lamb asked Baroness Neuberger to carry out a review into the controversial pathway – in the face of opposition from the medical establishment. The report, More Care – Less Pathway, . says that although the LCP was working well in many places, there were . too many examples of abuse for it to continue. It will be replaced with . more individualised care packages, and all incentive payments to . hospitals will be scrapped. Under the pathway, nurses use wet . sponges to moisten the mouths of dying patients after food and drink is . withdrawn. The fact that some patients were seen sucking on the sponges . indicates that they were very uncomfortable and were desperate for water . – and perhaps not as close to inevitable death as thought. Treatment: Nurses banned family members from giving loved ones water during their final hours, the review found . It . raises uncomfortable memories of Mid Staffs hospital, where a patient . on an understaffed A&E was so dehydrated he was forced to drink from . a vase. The report concludes that in too many cases, the LCP is used as a ‘tick-box exercise’ rather than looking at what the dying patients actually need. ‘Where care is already poor, the pathway . is sometimes used as a tick-box exercise, and good care for the dying . patient or their relatives or cares may be absent,’ the report says. ‘Whether true or not, many families . suspected that deaths had been hastened by over-prescription of strong . painkilling drugs or sedatives.’ Baroness Neuberger spoke to dozens of people about the care their loved ones had received during their final hours. Some reported ‘disobeying instructions from medical staff to withhold fluids’ – instead secretly giving them water when the nurse had left the room. The report says: ‘Some talked about their relatives sucking on the sponges that they had been given to wet the patient’s mouth in an attempt to get fluid, when fluids had been deliberately withheld.’ It finds that in many cases, opiates were given in too strong a dose, making the patient ‘too drowsy and confused to be able to communicate and ask for water’. And it adds: ‘There was a feeling that the drugs had been used as a “chemical cosh” that reduced people’s desire to accept food or drink. ‘There have been too many coming . forward to the review panel to say they left their loved one in a calm . and peaceful state, able to communicate, for a short time, or with a . doctor or a nurse for a check-up only to return and find a syringe . driver had been put in place and their loved one was never able to . communicate again. ‘One family was left with the impression that their relative had been overmedicated so that he would die from dehydration.’ The Daily Mail has led the way in exposing shocking cases of abuse of vulnerable people on the Liverpool Care Pathway. Here are some of the chilling examples: . OLIVE GOOM, 85 . Olive Goom died alone aged 85 after hospital staff failed to tell her family she was being put on the pathway . Olive Goom, 85, died alone at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after doctors failed to tell relatives they were ending her life. Staff reassured relatives on the phone just hours before her death in February 2011 that there was no urgent need to visit – even though doctors had already removed tubes providing vital food and fluids. Her family discovered that she had died only when her niece, Marion Hebbourne, went to visit her and found she was already being prepared for the mortuary. THOMAS JAMES, 90 . Thomas James died on the LCP at home after he was given sedatives . The family of former soldier Thomas James said he was put on the pathway at his home without consulting them. The 90-year-old, who lived near Braintree in Essex, had cancer but insisted he was not ready to die until after his granddaughter’s wedding. But his family said he died at home in October last year after he was given sedatives by a district nurse. The next day they were unable to wake him to give him food or drink and he fell into a diabetic coma. ANDY FLANAGAN, 48 . Andy Flanagan was 'rescued' from the care pathway and lived for another five weeks . Andy Flanagan, 48, was said to be severely brain damaged and close to death after a cardiac arrest. His family gathered at his bedside last June to say their goodbyes at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, after it withdrew fluids and said it was going to let him ‘slip away’. But when Mr Flanagan’s sister, who is a nurse, gently moved him to change his bloodstained sheets, he started to murmur words. Every ten minutes relatives gave him drops of water before doctors eventually agreed to put him back on a drip. He was able to return home, lived for another month and was able to say farewell to his loved ones. His sisters called the LCP a ‘licence to kill’.","Ministers order Liverpool Care Pathway to be ditched within a year, .

"Anger: MP John Hemming said the controversial Court of Protection should pay 'a decent rate of interest or it borders on malpractice' A secret court is controlling £2billion of assets of thousands of elderly and mentally impaired people and paying them a paltry rate of interest. The controversial actions of the Court of Protection were criticised by an MP last night as ‘bordering on malpractice’. The interest rate – currently much less than they would receive in an ordinary bank account – means that the value of the financial estates are falling rapidly because the rate of inflation is 2.8 per cent. An investigation by the Daily Mail . has uncovered a litany of other complaints about the court, which came . under fire last week after it emerged it had jailed a woman for defying . its orders over the fate of her elderly father in a care home. The allegations include claims that: . The court sits in private and deals with . up to 23,000 cases a year. It was set up in 2007 by Labour to act in . the interests of those deemed incapable of running their own financial . affairs because of ill health or old age. It takes over when an individual suffers sudden mental impairment and has not already handed over power of attorney to a trusted friend or relative. Speaking out: Wanda Maddocks, the first person to be imprisoned by the Court of Protection, was trying to remove her father John from a care home where his family feared he was in danger of dying . Ordeal: John Maddocks was being held in a care home against his family's wishes . It now controls huge sums of money for 16,000 vulnerable people. The money is not at any risk. However, many families say the low interest rate – equivalent to the Bank of England base rate of 0.5 per cent – produces an income that it is impossible for their loved ones to live on. Lib Dem MP John Hemming said: ‘The money should be well-managed and pay a decent rate of interest or it borders on malpractice. 'The current rate is risible and losing these 16,000 people, who desperately need a proper income, tens of millions of pounds a year in total.’ The Ministry of Justice said: ‘These accounts are designed to protect funds awarded by the courts with a 100 per cent government-backed guarantee and at zero risk to the individual. 'These are not supposed to be an investment fund.’ Last year Wanda Maddocks, 50, was jailed for moving her father John from a care home against the instructions of the court. She was held to be in contempt and served six weeks of a five-month term.","Court controls huge sums of money for 16,000 vulnerable people .

"Chelsea Clinton - under scrutiny for her pricey contract with NBC News - hasn't been featured since January, but the network says it does expect two completed stories to air soon, and two others are in the works. Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter, who was hired in 2011, has done just a smattering of reporting for NBC News. Last week, Politico reported she is being paid $600,000 a year. Politico also said the 34-year-old, who is expecting her first child later this year, is now on a month-to-month contract that would ease her departure should her mother decide to run for president in 2016. While . it is not uncommon for well-known anchors to earn multiple millions per . year, but Clinton's reported annual salary is high for the frequency of . her segments. All grown up: Chelsea's wealth has allowed her to regularly dye her hair blonde and blow out her naturally frizzy hair . In the spotlight: The work of Bill and Hillary Clinton's daughter, who was hired in 2011, has attracted interest after it emerged  NBC News is paying her $600,000 a year . By comparison, her salary is higher than both of the last two editors of the New York Times. The . paycheck inevitably helped Chelsea, 34, and her husband when they . bought a $10.5million apartment next to New York's Madison Square Park . last spring. It is not . clear how much fellow first daughter Jenna Bush Hager, who is a Today . Show correspondent, makes as part of her contract. The news division has so far refused to reveal publicly any information about Clinton's contract or her work. A Clinton spokesman, Kamyl Bazbaz, referred questions . to NBC. Earning her keep: Chelsea switched from an annual to a month-to-month contract earlier this year (pictured with her mother watching over her at a function n New York City on Thursday) NBC News has aired two stories by Chelsea . Clinton so far in 2014, both on education programs targeting the . underprivileged that were shown on Nightly News in January. NBC . indicated, however, that Clinton has done two stories that are expected . to air on Nightly News shortly and two others for which filming has . been scheduled. Clinton is also busier with outside work, reportedly . taking a more active role in her parents' foundation, and NBC wanted to . avoid the appearance of a conflict by having her on the air around the . time Hillary Clinton was doing a round of media interviews about her new . book. Clinton began work at the network in November 2011. She was the second presidential daughter to get work at NBC; Jenna Bush Hager, daughter of George W. Bush, is a Today show correspondent. Besides Nightly News, Clinton was hired to do stories for Brian Williams' Rock Center newsmagazine, which has since been canceled. Clinton profiled designer Stella McCartney and author Judy Blume for Rock Center and also did a cringeworthy voiceover interview with the Geico gecko. Much of her work falls under the umbrella of NBC's Making a Difference stories, about various efforts to make communities better. Peacock pay up: Chelsea Clinton started working for NBC in 2011 and making segments for the now-defunct Rock Center with Brian Williams (pictured) but her most recent contribution aired in January . She's done stories on the Maya Angelou Academy, a school program for jailed teenagers; a restaurant chain that donates leftover food to the needy; a Rhode Island school program where teachers at public and charter schools swap ideas; and an Arkansas tutoring program. Her Nightly News stories this year were about a 'homework diner' in New Mexico that feeds free meals to schoolchildren and their families, and a boxing gym in Detroit where youngsters must prove they've done their schoolwork to put on the gloves. 'She has a niche on the 'Nightly News' profiling philanthropic, volunteer and community service programs, often in praise of these groups,' news consultant Andrew Tyndall, who monitors the content of network evening news programs, said Wednesday. 'She puts herself in the center of these groups' activities. It's a cheerleader style of reporting.' Bush's daughter seems genuinely interested in being a television journalist, while that doesn't appear to be the case with Clinton, Tyndall said. Bush Hager interviewed President Barack Obama about fatherhood for a Today story that aired earlier this month, and Michelle Obama this winter about the first lady's healthy living initiatives. She's also interviewed Jordin Sparks and reported on school curriculum efforts recently. Luxury look: Chelsea wore leather pants, a Chanel necklace and Christian Louboutin heels to an event two Thursdays ago . For a news division, an unspoken advantage to having a presidential relative on the payroll might be help in getting access to their famous family in newsworthy situations. George W. Bush gave his first television interview since leaving the White House to the Today show's Matt Lauer in 2010. Hager Bush also interviewed her father about his paintings for Today in April. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's first television interview on her new book went to Diane Sawyer of ABC News. Paying the mortgage: Chelsea and her husband Marc bought this four bedroom apartment overlooking Madison Square Park in Manhattan for $10.5million last spring . The NBC paycheck is just part of . her take-home pay, however, since she has been spending most of her . time working for her family's eponymous foundation. Her . mother's expected presidential run is not the only factor that could . weigh into her contractual switch from year to month since she is . expecting her first child this fall.

"Global warming could be triggering increasingly cold winters in some parts of the world, scientists have claimed. Researchers have discovered a link between rising ocean temperatures, and a large pocket of cold air known as the polar vortex. They discovered that as oceans heat up and melt the Arctic ice, warm air is released that destabilises polar air and sends cold blasts into the atmosphere. Researchers claim the most recent polar vortex (illustrated) was caused by melting polar ice, which was melted by warmer ocean temperatures. This caused warm air to destabilise the polar air and send cold air into the atmosphere. And as global warming continues to heats oceans, freezing winters could increase . The polar vortex was responsible for the extreme and freezing temperatures experienced in the US last winter. A polar vortex is a large pocket of very cold air that sits above the polar region during the winter months. During winter this air chills and contrasts with the warmer temperatures further away from the pole. A polar vortex is a large pocket of very cold air that sits above the polar region during the winter season. During winter, this air gets cold, and contrasts with the temperatures further away from the pole. Pressure contrasts between these temperatures create fast winds that swirl around the pocket of cold air. The polar vortex is weakest during summer, because there is less of a contrast between temperatures. Pressure contrasts between these temperatures create fast winds that swirl around the pocket of cold air. Researchers, led by Baek-Min Kim from Korea Polar Research Institute, compared recent weather trends and reports, with computer models. The modelling was designed to reveal what Earth would look like if it hadn’t experienced any Arctic ice loss. They discovered that the polar ice is melting because warmer water is travelling up the Gulf Stream from tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean towards Scandinavia and other areas of Europe. In particular, the water is causing ‘exceptional sea ice melt' in the Barents-Kara seas. This melting leads to areas of open water, which release heat into the atmosphere during winter months. In turn they found this causes the northern jet stream to weaken and move further south, taking cold, polar air with it. The warmer temperatures cause the colder, polar temperatures to destabilise and emit cold blasts into the atmosphere. Due to its location, Canada and the US in particular, faced the brunt of this cold air in more recent winters. But Eurasia is likely to also see the cooling effect impacting on winters. The polar vortex (illustrated) was blamed for extreme and freezing temperatures in the US this winter. It is a large pocket of cold air that sits above the polar region. During winter, this air gets cold, and contrasts with temperatures further away. Pressure contrasts between these temperatures to create fast winds . Researchers, led by Baek-Min Kim from Korea Polar Research Institute, compared statistical analysis of recent weather trends, including freezing temperatures in the midwest of the US (pictured), with computer modelling. The modelling was designed to see what Earth would look like if it hadn’t experienced Arctic ice loss . And, if global warming continues to raise ocean temperatures, the chances of more extreme winter weather will increase, claim the researchers. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. Earlier this year global warming was blamed for the ‘irreversible retreat’ of west Antarctic glaciers. But scientists recently claimed that warming of the planet is in fact behind a paradoxical growth in South Pole sea ice. They believe the shift is caused by water melting from beneath the Antarctic ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface. Earlier this week, reports even claimed sea ice cover in the Antarctic is now at its highest level since records began. This graphic shows trends in sea ice duration between 1979 and 2010. It shows large regional variations. Rather than disproving global warming, some scientists claim that a recent growth in sea ice may in fact be caused by westerly winds, created by an increase in greenhouse gases . Satellite images revealed 7.7 million square miles (20 million sq km) of ice surrounding the continent. But rather than disproving global warming, scientists claim that this growth may in fact be caused by it. The first theory is that westerly winds, which flow around Antarctica, are speeding up and moving south. This is thought to be linked to an increase in greenhouse gases and an increase in sea ice. The second theory is that sea ice forms easier due to the colder and fresher melt water from Antarctica's melting glaciers and ice sheets.","Polar vortex was responsible for freezing temperatures in the US this winter .

"Human remains dug up by rescuers in a dried-up creek belong to missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, local media has reported. Searchers found the body behind an abandoned house in Albermarle County, around ten minutes south of Charlottesville, Virginia, where Hannah was last seen on September 13 with suspect Jesse Matthew. Matthew has now been arrested and charged with abducting Hannah with intent to defile, and police say new forensic evidence links him to the death of another missing girl. It also emerged that Matthew, 32, grew up around Albermarle County and is familiar with the area. Scroll down for video . Missing: Hannah Graham disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia, on September 13 . Uncovered: Human remains were found five miles from where Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was found dead, according to the local police . Suspect: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 32, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile . At a press conference yesterday police called off further search efforts for Hannah and announced the find of a dead body - but said it had not yet been definitively identified. However, today law enforcement officials revealed to the local CBS19 channel that they are sure the find is Hannah.. The remains were found five miles from where Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was found dead, according to the local police. Sergeant Dale Terry has said that his five-man team stumbled across the body, along with tight, dark colored pants, after initially giving up the search of woodland at Walnut Creek Park. Terry said that his team were compelled to carry on searching to bring 'closure' to the family of the 18-year-old British-born student, one month after she went missing ten miles away in Charlottesville, Virginia, following a night out. The remains are those of Hannah Graham, law enforcement sources told CBS19 . Rural woodland: The image above shows the area around which the remains are thought to have been found . Terry said that he believes 'God wanted' them to discover her body - and end the uncertainty for her family. 'I don't know how else to explain it,' he said. 'Something inside me just told me to continue to look.' 'We stayed positive, upbeat,' said Terry to CBS 6. 'We knew we were here for a mission to bring closure and hopefully that's what we've done.' Terry told WTVR that the human remains were found five miles from where Morgan Harrington's body was found. In September, Virginia State Police said that there was a forensic link between suspect Jesse Matthew and Harrington. Roadblock: Officers closed off the road to the site where Hannah's body was found in Albermarle County . Difficult: Sergeant Dale Terry said that he and his team carried on searching the abandoned property to bring closure to to Hannah Graham's parents . Close: Hannah Graham disappeared one month ago during a night out in Charlottesville, Virginia, after becoming lost in the early hours of the morning . Sgt. Dale Terry told WTVR that the human remains were found five miles from where Morgan Harrington's body was found . The 20-year-old student disappeared after a concert in Charlottesville on October 17, 2009 and her body was found on an Albermale County farm on January 26, 2010. No arrests have ever been made in the death of the Virginia Tech student. Terry led the search himself at an abandoned property off Old Lynchburg Road in Albermale County and said that the human remains were taken to the Medical Examiner's Office in Richmond, Virginia, to be to positively identified and autopsied. The grisly find was made around an abandoned property on a rural road - the area where suspect Jesse Matthew, who has been charged with Hannah's abduction, grew up. The identity of the remains has not yet been confirmed - but officers have called off all other search efforts for Hannah in the meantime. Graham has been missing for over a month . The grisly find was made around an abandoned property on a rural road - the area where suspect Jesse Matthew, who has been charged with Hannah's abduction, grew up . In a press conference this evening, Chief Timothy Longo, Charlottesville police told reporters about the discovery - but said there would be no further detail until tests have taken place. Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr, 32, has been arrested charged with abduction with intent to defile. The sophomore was last seen on a surveillance video walking with kidnapping suspect Jesse Matthew in downtown mall in Charlottesville, Virginia on September 13. He said: 'Sometime before noon today a search team from the Chesterfield County Sheriff's department discovered what appears to be human remains. 'Forensic tests need to be conducted to determine the identity of these remains. But we wanted to be quick in informing the Graham family. 'This investigation is complicated, it's a complex criminal investigation, it is unlikely that we will have any more information in the near future.' Appearance: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr. is escorted into a courtroom for an appearance before 405th District Court Judge Michelle Slaughter regarding his extradition back to Virginia, on Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014, in Galveston, Texas . Graham family: Hannah's mother and father (front and back right) had recently released a fresh plea for people to look for her . Local and regional police talk to an unidentified property owner where a body was discovered almost 5 weeks after 18-year-old Hannah Graham went missing . Describing the 'unprecedented' search effort, he said: 'It was 35 days ago since University of Virginia student Hannah Graham disappeared from our downtown pedestrian mall. He added: 'Thousand of hours have been spent by hundreds of law enforcement and civilian volunteers in an effort to find Hannah.' It came days after Sue and John Graham, Hannah's parents, issued a last, passionate plea for Virginians to look out for signs of her. Writing on October 13 - a month after she vanished - they said: 'It is heart-breaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. 'It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all, and to relieve the searchers of their arduous task.' Last sighting: Hannah, seen left, was spotted with Matthew on the night she disappeared - she is pictured above just before 1am . Emotion: Charlottesville Police Chief Tim Longo is overcome with emotional at a press conference announcing the discovery of human remains . Witnesses have said they saw Matthew with Hannah on the night she disappeared. The spot at which the human remains were found, on Old Lynchburg Road in Albermarle County, is not far from where Matthew's mother used to live. He is said to have grown up in the area and to be familiar with it. Virginia State Police have said Matthew's arrest provided a 'forensic link' to the 2009 unsolved murder of Morgan Harrington, a 20-year-old who also went missing from Charlottesville. Morgan, a student at Virginia Tech, disappeared on October 17 2009 in Charlottesville. Her body was found only a few miles from where the discovery today was made. Link: Police have said DNA evidence connects Hannah's disappearance with that of Morgan Harrington, another student in Virginia who went missing . Concert: Morgan, 20, who was at Virginia Tech, disappeared after going to a Metallica concert in 2009 . She had been at a Metallica concert in Charlottesville, but was separated from her friends and left outside of the arena. Witnesses saw her trying to hitch-hike home. Her body was eventually found, more than 100 days after she went missing. Until Matthew was linked to the disappearance, no leads as to who may have taken her had been found. Matthew has never been charged in connection with Morgan, but it was recently revealed that police questioned him - but then let him go.","Hannah Graham, 18, went missing on September 13 in Charlottesville, VA .

"A federal judge has slammed Miami-Dade County for refusing to delay demolition of a soldier's home while he trained in California for deployment to the Middle East. The soldier's kids and pregnant wife were kicked to the curb and the house was razed in 2011 after U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Jesus Jimenez did not heed numerous county requests to fix building code violations. Jimenez had repeatedly asked for extensions to fix the problems while he training or on a mission. At one point his commanding military officer also weighed in, asking to officials to stay the hearing 90 days while Jimenez was conducting training on how to defuse improvised explosive devices in Iraq. Homeless: Jesus Jimenez, his wife, Laura, and their newborn son in 2011 after their house was demolished before Jimenez deployed to Afghanistan for the second time . Demolished: The couple's home was razed for code violations and Jimenez's wife didn't even have time to take out all their belongings . The family was able to save soem of their belongings, but much of what they owned was lost--including a piano--when the home was demolished. 'They didn't care,' 32-year-old Laura Jimenez told the Miami Herald. U.S. Judge Robert Scola Jr. sided with the father of four, last week, scheduling a September trial to decide what the county owes Jimenez. But he urged both sides to first attempt a settlement. At issue is a World War II-era law, reinstated in 2003, that allows for the temporary suspension of legal or administrative proceedings that could affect active duty military members' civil rights. 'While it is possible that the Jimenezes employed dilatory tactics to avoid remedying the violations on their property and complying with the applicable building ordinances,' Scola wrote, 'their behavior does not negate the (county's) failure to stay the proceedings....' The county argued that Jimenez was in the Army Reserves when it issued the violations. But Scola ruled that since Jimenez was on active duty when he requested the stay, he should have been protected. Before: The county complained the Jimenez home had a deteriorated roof and porch beams and Jimenez asked for more time to fix it, but to no avail . Fair? the county placed this notice on the home two months before they razed it . County officials declined to discuss the case with the Herald, citing the ongoing litigation. But in court filings, Miami-Dade representatives said they'd given Jimenez more than enough time to fix the violations between deployments. The family rented seven rooms in two houses without permission. Among the problems with their home that sparked the initial code enforcement citations: deteriorating porch beams and a deteriorated roof, as well as a damaged door and an uncovered electrical junction box. Jimenez says he tried to fix the initial problems but didn't have the money to take out the necessary construction permits. Then he was sent to a Wisconsin training base and was fined for failing to complete the work. Meanwhile, inspectors reviewed the house more closely and ordered more improvements, including covering exposed wiring and other hazards. After more failed negotiations over the home, the family's power was shut off. Eventually, Jimenez hired an engineer and an architect to make the necessary changes, but the county said the problems were so extensive it would be better to start from scratch. Jimenez says the county targeted his family while ignoring other similar houses in the neighborhood. His attorney wants the city to drop all liens, suspend code-enforcement activities and pay $395,000 in 20 days. In exchange, the family would agree to sell the property where the house was demolished, as well as two other neighboring homes they own. Fighting back: This sign now stands in place of the home, blasting the county for demolishing it. Jimenez is suing the county and a federal judge has sided with the soldier .","Army Staff Sergeant Jesus Jimenez was in California preparing to go to war in the Middle East in 2011 when his Florida was razed .

"Arrest: Matthew Reese faces up to 95 years behind bars when he is sentenced on Wednesday . A 31-year-old man knew he had HIV when he had sex with a 15-year-old virgin he'd met on a chat line - but she didn't know until she became infected with the disease, a Texas court has heard. Matthew Louis Reese pleaded guilty to three charges Tuesday, including aggravated sexual assault with a deadly weapon for repeatedly having sex with the girl without a condom. Prosecutors requested he serves 95 years behind bars and Judge Pat McDowell is expected to make a decision on Wednesday, the Dallas Morning News reported. Reese met the girl, who is now 17, when she called a chat line in December 2012 and when her parents caught them talking on the phone, he assured them he was 18. The two embarked on a seven-month relationship between 2012 and 2013 and after they met at a Dallas movie theater, Reese persuaded her to have sex with him in his car. When she told him she was a virgin and had never had a boyfriend, he said it was probably because she'd never had sex. He said if she didn't have sex 'it would make a man want to cheat'. 'He told me he could see himself being with me,' she told Judge Pat . McDowell in court. 'He was saying all the right things. He was telling me what I . wanted to hear.' Life-changing: The now 17-year-old victim, whose identity is being concealed, told the court that she only learned she had HIV after her kidneys failed and she slipped into a coma for two weeks . Months later, Reese was arrested on drug charges and sent to jail, but he and the girl - who was still unaware that she had become infected with HIV - continued to stay in touch through letters. She eventually fell ill, lapsing into a coma for two weeks and spending 40 days in hospital after her kidneys failed, and she was later diagnosed with HIV. During a phone call when she was in the hospital, Reese said he had 'symptoms' of HIV, but insisted he was 'clean'. Her mother, who is just four years older than Reese, said that family members discovered his actual age in September when they looked up his criminal record and learned he had convictions for drug charges, family violence assault, evading arrest and resisting arrest. Sick: Reese, being led in to court, told her that he was 18 - but her parents checked his criminal record . Love letters: Mail he sent her while he was locked up on drugs charges was shared with the court . When they confronted him about his real identity, he did not deny it, she told the court. The family then called police. The girl must now take medication every day to keep her viral load low. 'There was a point...where I wished death on him,' she said. 'I didn't deserve this. I don't like him at all.' Reese pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual assault of a child with a deadly weapon, in exchange for 55 years, aggravated sexual assault with serious bodily injury, in exchange for 20 years, and sexual assault of a child, in exchange for 20 years, the Morning Post reported. In his mug shot he is pictured wearing an eye patch for an injury, but he was not wearing it in court.

"Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the ISIS jihadi who led the executions of 21 Egyptians was an American recruit. The militant, who spoke English with a U.S. accent, appeared in a horrific video on Sunday showing the beheadings of a group of Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. Brandishing a knife, he declares: 'All crusaders... the sea you have hidden Sheikh Osama bin Laden's body in, we swear to Allah we will mix it with your blood.' The men are then forced to lie face-down before they are beheaded simultaneously. U.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns as has been done in the hunt for the British executioner known as Jihadi John, who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria. Scroll down for video . Was he radicalised in the U.S? Intelligence chiefs are investigating claims the Islamic State jihadi (above) who led the executions of 21 Egyptians on a beqach in Lbya was an American recruit . Manhunt: U.S. officials are understood to be analysing the militant's facial features and speech patterns . Professor Erik Thomas, a linguistics expert at North Carolina State University, believes he 'sounds like an American' with some Arabic influence, based on some of word pronunciations. Another U.S. specialist, who asked not to be named told ABC News that he may be a native Arabic speaker who learned English by spending 'a significant amount of time' in America. The suggestion he may have been radicalised in the U.S. comes as the Obama administration faced heavy criticism  for suggesting that defeating ISIS requires more of a jobs program for terrorists than a sophisticated approach to killing them. State Department spokesman Marie Harf said Monday night on MSNBC that 'we cannot win this war by killing them, we cannot kill our way out of this war.' Instead, she said, the administration should 'go after the root causes that leads people to join these groups' – including 'lack of opportunity for jobs.' 'We can work with countries around the world to help improve their governance,' Harf insisted. 'We can help them build their economies so they can have job opportunities for these people.' The embarrassing gaffe aired as the White House attracted new criticism for papering over religious aspects of a mass-beheading of Coptic Christians by the ISIS terror army. Executed: At least 35 more Egyptians are believed to have been kidnapped by jihadists in Libya, raises the chilling prospect of yet another mass execution like the one seen on Sunday when the Islamic State released a horrific video showing the beheading of 21 Christians on a beach (above) Similar analysis has been underway in an attempt to identify the British executioner known as Jihadi John (above with Japanese hostage Kenji Goto) who has appeared in a number of beheading videos in Syria . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest issued a 192-word reaction condemning the brutal killings as 'despicable' and 'cowardly' but made no mention of the religion of the killers or their victims. The words 'Christian,' 'Islam' and 'Muslim.' were not included in Earnest's statement. A CNN/ORC poll found 57 per cent of Americans disapprove of how President Obama is handling the threat posed by ISIS. Even among Democrats, 46 per cent say America's battle with ISIS is going badly. Public approval of the administration's anti-ISIS efforts has slipped by 8 percentage points since September. Part of that slide may be due to the State Department's focus on what conservatives deride as 'hashtag diplomacy' – a program of pushback through social media designed to strip away ISIS's glamourous appeal to would-be jihadis. Vice President Joe Biden has also called for immigrants to be fully included in the fabric of American society to prevent violent ideologies from taking root at home as he opened a White House summit on countering extremism and radicalisation. Joining local elected officials, community leaders and religious figures, Biden portrayed the U.S. as far better positioned than Europe, thanks to what he called America's successful record at cultural integration. Under fire: State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf insisted a jobs program could stem the tide of ISIS . Creeping influence: The Islamic State is cementing a foothold in Libya where the latest beheadings took place . He said societies must offer immigrants an 'affirmative alternative' to extremism, cautioning that military force alone could not address the threat. Across the Atlantic, deadly terrorist attacks in France, Belgium and Denmark have left Europeans feeling vulnerable to the type of violent ideology promoted by the Islamic State group and once thought to be confined mostly to the Middle East and North Africa. 'National security flows from a sense of community,' Biden said, adding that the most important lesson the U.S. can learn is that 'inclusion counts.' The White House has sought to use the three-day conference in Washington to stir a sense of urgency about the challenge of preventing home-grown terrorism and the radicalization and recruitment of Americans, particularly disaffected young people. Yet it comes as the Obama administration has struggled to match its stated strategy for fighting IS and other Islamic extremist groups with the realities on the ground in Libya, Yemen and other Mideast hotspots. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama was to address a gathering at the White House examining the response from U.S. cities, then speak at the State Department on Thursday at a gathering of representatives from roughly 60 countries. Britain, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and France are expected to attend. Global concerns that the Islamic State is drawing interest and support from communities far away from Iraq and Syria have only grown in recent days. As well as Egypt and Libya, Denmark is reeling from a weekend shooting spree by a 22-year-old gunman that authorities believe may have been radicalized in prison. Biden, in his remarks, held up Boston, Los Angeles and Minneapolis as examples of communities moving ahead with programs to counter extremism locally. He said the goal was to bring together broad coalitions of community leaders so that all Americans - and particularly Muslims - would feel like 'we see them.' 'We haven't always gotten it right,' Biden said. 'But we have a lot of experience integrating communities into the American system, the American dream.'","Militant led beheadings of 21 Egyptian nationals in horrific ISIS video .

"FBI counter terrorism agents have arrested two men in Texas following long running surveillance operations. The men, Rahatul Ashikim Khan, and Michael Todd Wolfe are both expected to appear in court in Texas tomorrow. They face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of supporting terrorism. The FBI said that Khan, 23, allegedly tried to recruit an FBI confidential human source to travel to Somalia to join al-Shabaab, while Wolfe, also 23, wanted to move to Syria to join ISIS. Rahatul Ashkim Khan, left, tried to recruit an undercover FBI informer to join Somali terror group al-Shabaab, while Michael Todd Wolfe, right, told a federal investigator of his plan to use a tax refund to join ISIS in Syria . Wolfe was arrested trying to board a plane in Houston with his wife and two children to Toronto, before continuing to Iceland and then Denmark where he planned to meet an undercover FBI agent. According to court documents, Khan was arrested after a major operation by FBI Special Agent Jason Cromartie. According to documents filed by agent Cromartie, Khan used several aliases on an internet chatroom featuring the sermons and lectures of former Brixton imam Sheikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Faisal, who was deported to his native Jamaica after serving four years of a seven year jail term for soliciting the murder of Jews, Hindus and Christians. Khan is alleged to have been recruiting people for al-Shabeeb on a website which featured the sermons of former Brixton imam Skeikh Abdullah Ibrahim Al-Faisal who was deported to Jamaica following his release . Special Agent Cromartie said: 'In or about March through May of 2011, Khan discussed guns, training, the war against Islam, his preparations for the Third World War, shooting, and getting the youth interested in jihad.' The FBI believe that Khan was involved with  the internet chat room administrator who wanted the Bangledishi born US citizen to find people he trusted. The group used 'an elaborate communication method' to ensure that 'the kuffar' (infidels/disbelievers) could not read their correspondence. Wolfe told an undercover FBI agent that he wanted to travel to Syria to join ISIS having earlier considered aligning with the Nusrah Front but did not want to get involved in a fight between rival Islamic groups . Special Agent Cromartie said that another individual, Co-Conspirator #2 was 'a contact for ""brothers"" from the UK going to Somalia'. Co-Conspirator #2, who has not been indicted, told the undercover FBI source  that 'they have brothers from the UK  that would guide' him. The source was told that he would have to undergo 'training' although he 'would not have to go to the UK, since the brothers are already in the field in ""Mog"". According to Special Agent Cromartie, Khan even admitted 'he was interested in participating in jihad in the future and that he could not wait to spill blood. 'Khan said that he was actively searching for recruits for Co-Conspirator #1 and he was the only person he knew of doing this. 'Khan talked about an individual in the UK, who Khan had passed to Co-Conspirator #1.' Special Agent Cromartie said Khan had expressed a willingness to join al-Shabaab and wanted to know of 'others who might be good potential recruits'. Meanwhile, the second suspect Woolfe, also known as Faruq, is accused of attempting to 'provide material support and resources to terrorists, including but not limited to personnel, including himself, knowing or intending that they be used in preparation for, or in carrying out, a crime of terrorism, including conspircy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons and damage property in a foreign country. Khan tried to recruit people to join al-Shabaab in Somalia, who are also conducting a terror campaign in Kenya . Woolfe, who was born in Houston and his wife Jordan Nicole Furr wanted to move to a Muslim country with their two children. Mrs Woolfe told an undercover FBI agent that she 'wanted to support her husband's goal of travelling to perform a violent form of jihad'. Mrs Wolfe admitted they wanted to move to an area under sharia control. Wolfe told a second undercover FBI agent that the hardest part of planning a jihad trip to Somalia and Syria 'was finding the right contact'. According to court documents: 'Wolfe indicated that he had learned that al Qaeda in Syria was training brothers from other countries (foreign fighters) and then sending those fighters back from Syria to their home countries to conduct terror attacks. Wolfe said he initially planned to join the al Nusrah Front but instead wanted to join ISIS. According to court documents: 'Wolfe stated that he had been researching the situation in Syria and he had seen the two groups make statements against each other. 'Wolfe indicated he still wanted to go for jihad, but did not want to get caught in the in-fighting between the two groups, which had nothing to do with his agenda.' He told an undercover FBI agent that he and his wife were expected a tax refund of $5,000, some of which, it was implied, would be used to fund his jihad trip. The 23-year-old suspect admitted to the agent that he was trying to earn some extra money by volunteering for a medical experiment'.","Rahatul Asikim Khan tried to recruit FBI source to join Somali al-Shabaab .

"A young Indian mother has been burned to death along with her infant daughter by her husband and in-laws for failing to pay dowry. Police in eastern Indian state of Jharkhand said 22-year-old Annu Devi was set ablaze while she was breastfeeding her daughter. They have now arrested her husband, Gunjan Masat, who allegedly poured fuel over Devi and her baby daughter before setting them on fire. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Annu Devi, 22, (far right) was burned to death in India by her husband and in-laws in a dispute over dowry which started when she gave birth to a girl . Gunjan Masat, Devi's husband, allegedly poured kerosene over her while she was breastfeeding her baby daughter before setting the pair alight. They were taken to hospital (pictured) but died on arrival . According to Raghuni Rana, Devi's father, the couple were happily married for more than a year, but problems started after Ms Devi gave birth to a baby girl. Devi's mother-in-law holds the body of her grand-daughter who was also burned to death in the attack . Mr Rana told police: 'They wanted a son, but didn’t realize that giving birth to a girl was not Devi’s fault. 'They started harassing and torturing her till things reached this pass when they decided to end her life.' Mr Rana added: 'Now they were demanding a TV set and a motorcycle. I had already given them two bighas (1.6 acres) of land in dowry.' To pass off her murder as an accident, the accused made the badly burned Devi sit beside a fireplace and placed a water container over it. Early in the morning on January 30, a local spotted Ms Devi and her daughter lying in a courtyard at the house, still alive despite suffering 90 per cent burns. The mother-daughter duo were rushed to the nearest hospital but the doctors declared them dead on arrival. Devi's brother-in-law, who has also been accused in the police complaint, is still at large. Calling . it a heinous crime, Superintendent of Police, Nirmal Kumar Mishra, . said: 'All the accused will be arrested and prosecuted according to the . law.' Dowry is one of the reasons why boys are preferred over girls in Indian culture. Thousands of girls are aborted every year after ultrasound scans reveal the sex of the foetus. Masat allegedly set Devi alight in the courtyard of this house, before allegedly placing her still-living body next to a fireplace to make it look like an accident . Gunjan Masat has been arrested, while his father Mahendra Basat (pictured), was interrogated. His other son has also been named on the police complaint but is on the run . A woman is killed over dowry ‘every hour’ in India, according to the data released by the country’s National Crime Records Bureau. '8,233 young women, many of them new brides, were killed in so-called 'dowry deaths' in 2012,' the report said last year. Domestic violence largely motivated by dowry demands is very common in the area, but killing of Ms Devi along with her baby girl has shocked the locals.","Annu Devi, 22, burned to death while breastfeeding her daughter .

"A teacher at an Arizona prison was alone in a room full of sex offenders before being stabbed and raped by a convicted rapist, according to documents about an attack at the facility. Jacob Harvey is accused of stabbing the woman in the head with a pen, forcing her to the . ground and raping her on January 30 at the Eyman prison's Meadows Unit, which houses about 1,300 rapists, child molesters and other sex offenders. The teacher, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was administering a high school equivalency test to about a half-dozen inmates in a classroom with no guard nearby and only a radio to summon help. Jacob Harvey is accused of stabbing the woman in the head with a pen, forcing her to the ground and raping her on January 30 at the Eyman prison's Meadows Unit, which houses about 1,300 rapists, child molesters and other sex offenders . Jacob Harvey is shown with the blood of his victim on his hands shortly after he is accused of attacking a state prison teacher . After . the last of the other inmates left, Jacob Harvey asked the teacher if . she could open the bathroom and then attacked her, records show. Harvey . is accused of stabbing her in the head with a pen, forcing her to the . ground and raping her. The teacher told investigators that she screamed for help, but none came. Afterward, Harvey tried to use her radio to call for help. It had apparently been changed to a channel the unit's guards didn't use, so Harvey let the woman use a phone, according to the reports. The Department of Corrections issued only a bare-bones press release after the attack, but the Associated Press pieced together what happened based on interviews and investigatory reports obtained under the Arizona Public Records Act. Carl ToersBijns, a former deputy warden at the prison, said the assault highlights chronic understaffing and lax security policies that put staff members at risk. ""Here you've got a guy that commits a hell of a crime ... and he's put into an environment that actually gives him an opportunity to do his criminality because of a lack of staffing,"" said ToersBijns, who was deputy warden at the Eyman prison in Florence until retiring in 2010 and oversaw the Meadows Unit for 19 months. Jacob Harvey is shown shortly after he is accused of attacking the teacher. He was in the first year of a 30-year sentence for raping a Glendale woman in November 2011 . State prison officials, however, dismiss the concerns. They say the assault at the prison about 60 miles southeast of Phoenix is a risk that comes with the job of overseeing violent prison inmates. Harvey was in the first year of a 30-year sentence for raping a Glendale woman in November 2011. Just 17 at the time, he had knocked on the woman's door in the middle of the day, asked for a drink of water, then forced his way inside, where he repeatedly raped and beat her while her 2-year-old child was in the apartment. He fled naked when the woman's roommate arrived home. He was arrested after DNA evidence connected him to the crime, and he pleaded guilty. Harvey was initially classified as a ""Class 4"" security risk, one notch lower than the highest level. Six months later, despite violating prison rules at least once, he was reclassified at a lower level. Department of Corrections spokesman Doug Nick said classrooms at prisons across the state are having cameras installed. But he said no administrative investigation was launched because there was no need, and no one was disciplined. He said all prisons are dangerous places and staff are trained accordingly. ""This is an assault that reflects the fact that inmates in our system often act out violently, and it is the inmate suspect who is responsible for this despicable act,"" he said. The attack took place at the Eyman prison's Meadows Unit in Arizona (pictured) Nick also said that not having a guard in classrooms or nearby ""follows accepted corrections practices nationwide."" That's not the case, said Carolyn Eggleston, a professor at California State University, San Bernardino, who started her career as a prison teacher in several states and now is director of the university's Correctional and Alternative Education Program. ""I have to say, I don't find that consistent with standards,"" Eggleston said. ""In a sex offender unit, especially, they should be counting the people leaving the classroom. They just should. And there should be somebody, not in the class ... but there should be somebody in proximity so they can help monitor that."" The woman, who was not critically injured, has filed a worker's compensation claim against the state and did not want to comment on case. Internal emails obtained by the AP show that prisons Director Charles Ryan ordered all non-corrections officer staff at prisons statewide to be issued pepper spray and trained in its use just days after the attack. And an internal memo sent the day after the assault ordered guards at a nearby prison to begin checking on civilian staff every hour. Nick said the pepper-spray order was in the works before the assault. And he said that, despite the internal memo from a major that ordered hourly checks, the actual practice is unpredictable and more frequent, with staggered checks three times an hour. ToersBijns, who is an advocate for prison safety and believes understaffing has put state prison staff at risk, said multiple errors likely led to the assault, including not having video cameras in the classroom, a lack of checks on civilian staff and use of an outdated classification system for inmates that led to a violent predator being misidentified as a relatively low-level threat. After the attack, Harvey was calm when confronted in the classroom, refused to talk to investigators and asked for a lawyer. He was charged last month with sexual assault, kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon. A public defender was appointed, and he pleaded not guilty at his arraignment. The public defender assigned to his case, Paula Cook, declined to comment. Harvey was convicted in a prison administrative hearing of sexually assaulting the staff member. Three weeks after the rape, he assaulted another prison employee, although records don't show any details. His security classification was raised two levels, to the highest, nearly three months after the teacher was assaulted.","Jacob Harvey is accused of stabbing the woman in the head with a pen .

"A man says that he was threatened with jail by a police officer in Atlanta after he tried to tend to his bleeding dog which the officer had just shot in the jaw. The incident occurred on Thursday evening when Doctor, a nine-year-old German Shepherd, ran to the front of owner Tim Theall’s Georgia home after being let out of the backyard. Before Theall could catch up with his lively pet, two gun shots rang out. A DeKalb County police officer investigating a false house alarm call at the house had been caught unawares by the dog and shot him in the throat. Tim Theall of Atlantia, Georgia, has said he was threatened with jail by a police officer after he tried to tend to his bleeding dog, Doctor, which the officer had just shot in the jaw . Fortunately Doctor was still alive, although bleeding profusely. Theall says he can understand why the officer shot his pet in the heat of the moment, but it's what happened next that shocked him. When Theall and his wife attempted to take the animal to the vet for treatment, the officer refused to let leave the neighborhood. ‘No steps were taken by DeKalb police whatsoever to try to save my dog’s life,’ Theall told NBC Atlanta. Fortunately Doctor survived the shooting wound, but when his owners finally made it to the vets they were told he needed $8,000-worth of oral surgery on a fractured jaw and busted palate . ‘The dog was still alive, clearly bleeding like crazy and the police officer blocked my exit,’ Theall continued. ‘Finally he convinced me that I would be thrown in jail if I didn’t just stay where I was.’ Fortunately Doctor survived the shooting wound, but when his owners finally made it to the vets they were told he needed $8,000-worth of oral surgery on a fractured jaw and busted palate. Theall’s wife, Melissa Brewer, set up a gofundme account to help try and pay for the pricy medical expenses. On the page she wrote that the police officer would not allow the couple to take Doctor for help 'due to procedure.' When a second officer arrived 20 minutes later, 'we found out that procedure was just to take pictures of the bleeding dog.' In just two days Doctor's owners have been able to raise the money required from him to have oral surgery following the shooting . She also said that the police officer who pulled the trigger said that animal control were on their way to assist Doctor. 'I find out that animal control was told to come pick up a dead dog and had no idea about the dog needing help,' she wrote. Fortunately for Doctor, donations have quickly surpassed the amount needed and over $10,000 has been raised in just two days. 'It really does restore some faith in humanity, really; we've got friends out there,' Theall told NBC. A DeKalb County police spokesman said that while he understands the couple were frustrated, the officers needed to keep Doctor at the scene in order to preserve evidence of the shooting.","Doctor, a nine-year-old German Shepherd, was accidentally shot in the jaw by a police officer on Thursday .

"A U.S. sailor from Washington State has been put in an almost impossible situation after being asked to appear in court as part of a custody battle to keep his six-year-old daughter, despite being thousands of miles away under the sea. Navy submariner Matthew Hindes is serving on a submarine in the Pacific Ocean, yet he has been ordered to appear in a Michigan courtroom on Monday - or a warrant for his arrest will be issued. Hindes is in a custody battle with his ex-wife Angela involving their daughter, Kaylee. Although he was given permanent custody of Kaylee in 2010, she was removed from his ex-wife's home by child protective services and went to live with her step-mother on the other side of the country. Scroll down for video... Daddy's little girl: A judge has ordered Matthew Hindes to appear in court or face contempt, despite the fact that he's out at sea and there's a federal law meant to help those who are deployed. Navy submariner Matthew Hindes is stationed on a submarine in the Pacific . Me and my dad: Hindes lawyers argue he should be protected by the Service members Civil Relief Act, which states courts in custody cases may grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days to defendants serving their country . Step-mom:  Kaylee has been living with Hindes wife Benita-Lynn her step-mother in Washington state while Hindes is deployed aboard a nuclear submarine in the Pacific Ocean . Serving his country: Military lawyers are now joining the effort to get a delay in the case.  In the meantime Hindes remains deployed serving his country . Kaylee has been living with Hindes new wife Benita-Lynn in Washington state while her father is deployed aboard a nuclear submarine in the Pacific Ocean. Even though there is no way he can physically be present at the custody hearing, a judge has ordered Hindes to appear in court or face contempt. Hindes’ lawyers argue he should be protected by the Service members Civil Relief Act, which states courts in custody cases may 'grant a stay of proceedings for a minimum period of 90 days' to defendants serving their country. The judge hearing the case, circuit court judge Margaret Noe, disagreed, adding, 'If the child is not in the care and custody of the father, the child should be in the care and custody of the mother.' Noe denied the motion for a stay, ruling that he could have arranged for his wife to bring the child to her mother. 'At this point, I don’t think I have any alternative but to enter a bench warrant for his arrest,' Noe said. 'If the child is not in the care and custody of the father, the child should be in the care and custody of the mother,' Noe said. Where will she go? Sailor Hindes was given permanent custody of Kaylee in 2010, after she was reportedly removed from his ex-wife's Angela's home by child protective services . Benita-Lynn Hindes had secured money to pay for a flight to Michigan to hand Kaylee over to her mother but does not have the money needed for a rental car . Deployed dad: The sailor is not allowed to appear by Skype or phone, and in custody cases, being absent in court could have a huge effect on the outcome . Plan: Benita-Lynn (right) says they have no choice. She's going to fly back to Michigan with Kaylee to be in court Monday with the possibility the ex-wife will get temporary custody and the sailor won't be there to say goodbye . She has a point: He's protecting the rights of others, but who's protecting his rights? Benita-Lynn said . Sailor Hindes is not even allowed to appear by Skype or phone. There is even a suggestion that his being absent in court could effect on the outcome. Hindes is not only facing the possibility of losing custody of his daughter, but also the chance to say goodbye, Benita-Lynn Caoile Hindes said to ABC News. 'I’m just trying my best to keep everything together,' she said. 'It’s just hard.' Kaylee is in Washington state with Matthew Hindes¿ current wife, Benita-Lynn Hines, while he is deployed . Benita-Lynn says they have no choice. She's going to fly back to Michigan with Kaylee to be in court Monday with the possibility the ex-wife will get temporary custody and the sailor won't be there to say goodbye .

"A hatmaker whose work graced the heads of three generations of royalty has died at 84. Philip Somerville designed hundreds of creations for the Queen, Diana, Princess of Wales and latterly Kate Middleton before she became the Duchess of Cambridge. Working during the Eighties and Nineties, he was one of the Queen’s favourite milliners and at one stage was making up to 50 hats a year for the monarch, who famously never goes without one. ‘Often I’ve put something on Her Majesty’s head and said, “Oops, I don’t like that, that’s not right”,’ he once said. ‘I don’t think she’s ever been used to that.’ More recently, he designed at least one hat for Kate Middleton before her marriage to Prince William. The black and white design she wore in 2008 when the prince was made a member of the Order of the Garter was auctioned for £3,222 in June 2012. Mr Somerville is also said to have designed 100 or so hats for Diana, Princess of Wales – who first came across his work on a television advert. Philip Somerville designed hundreds of creations for the Queen, Diana, Princess of Wales and Kate Middleton before she became the Duchess of Cambridge . His creations were ‘safety-proofed’ against sartorial disasters caused by heavy wind or rain. It was usually a case of using two hatpins, he once said. In 1987, he designed a striking fur hat for Margaret Thatcher during a crucial state visit to Russia to meet then president Mikhail Gorbachev. The son of a cobbler who grew up in Winchester, he once said of the Queen: ‘People say, “What does she do with all those hats?” Wear them out, I say. They get damaged and they wear out. She’d possibly wear hats at least ten times, and that’s a long time. Most people would only buy a hat and wear it once and then they put it away in a box.’ Diana, Princess of Wales first came across Mr Somerville’s work on a television advert. In this photo she is wearing one of his creations in Dubai during the Royal Tour of the Gulf in March 1989 . He also revealed that the monarch’s head was ‘slightly smaller’ than average, about 22in in circumference – the average head being 22.5in. Royal milliners collaborate closely with the Queen’s dress designers to achieve a closely coordinated look. More recently, Mr Somerville designed at least one hat for Kate Middleton before her marriage . They are sent sketches and fabric swatches of every new outfit before attending the first fitting. Fitting sessions, by Mr Somerville’s account, were relatively informal, partly thanks to his cheerful nature and occasionally disarming frankness. ‘Often I’ve put something on Her Majesty’s head and said, “Oops, I don’t like that, that’s not right”,’ he once said. ‘I don’t think she’s ever been used to that.’ After school, he joined the Merchant Navy before dabbling with a career in acting. By this point, his family had moved to New Zealand and he joined them there. In 1953, he began a career in millinery and was sent to Europe in 1961 by the Star Hat Company of Auckland. Speaking about his work for Diana, Princess of Wales Mr Somerville once said: ‘Pink and red don’t usually go together, so I was surprised when the princess came to see me one day in 1989 asking for a hat to go with a pink and red Catherine Walker outfit she would be wearing in Dubai. When she mentioned the colours she giggled and asked what I thought. “I know it’s a little bit strange,” she told me, “but I love it”.’","During the 80s and 90s, Philip Somerville was one of the Queen’s favourite milliners .

"A 560-pound sex offender who was convicted of rape is livid with the medical center he is staying at free of charge over their food offerings. Kenneth Harvey, 58, lives at the Peninsula Center for Extended Care and Rehabilitation in Queens, New York, and is hoping a lawyer will help him sue over the horrible food and bad bed he has been provided with, among other things. Harvey, who was convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1994, does not pay for his stay at the center, with taxpayers picking up the bill. Scroll down for video . Big pain: Kenneth Harvey (above) is 58, weighs 560 pounds and wants to sure the medical center he stays at for free over poor food options . Making waves: Harvey used to own an escort service he says, and was convicted of first-degree attempted rape in 1994 . He also used to own an escort service. 'My body is literally bending the mattress like an accordion,' Harvey told the New York Post about his private room, which costs Medicaid and Social Security up to $10,000 a month. He then claimed that the facility offered nothing in the way of food, giving him just lettuce, tomato and two pieces of bread for lunch each day. He also says he is being verbally abused and that he is forced to wait hours to receive his medication. Harvey is only responsible for $800 a month to stay at the center, which all comes out of his Social Security check. So far he has been unsuccessful in getting a lawyer to help him sue, but apparently the facility did set up a bigger bed for him last Friday. Harvey, who used to weight 700 pounds, lost his Brooklyn apartment in 2013 after a fire, and was forced to pan handle he claims before getting a bed at the medical center. He says he is suffering from 'depression.' In a recent interview with Nancy Grace, the talk show host asked Harvey, 'Why don't you get a job? Then you could afford more food and a bigger bed.'","Kenneth Harvey, a 560 pound sex offender who was convicted of attempted rape in 1994, wants to sue the medical center where he lives .

"The Obama administration unveiled a new version of HealthCare.gov on Wednesday, with some improvements as well as at least one early mistake and a new challenge. Officials also said that HealthCare.gov won't display premiums for 2015 until the second week of November. Open enrollment season runs Nov. 15 through Feb. 15. Coverage can start as early as Jan. 1. On the plus side, the health insurance website will feature a streamlined application for most of those signing up for the first time. Seventy-six screens in the online application have been reduced to 16, officials said. The site has been also optimized for mobile devices. English-language homepage: The English language homepage of the site is clear and does not display any typos that would deter people from signing up . Spanish-language homepage: The Spanish language homepage has the word 'preparase' which should actually read 'preparese' and such a big typo might deter Hispanics from signing up for coverage . The goof is a mistranslation in large type on the home page of the Spanish-language version of the site. It's the very first word on the page. Trying to translate 'get ready,' someone came up with the wrong word in Spanish. The Spanish-language site had lots of problems last year, ranging from technology issues to clunky translations that left some native speakers puzzled. The administration struggled to sign up Hispanics, the nation's largest minority and more likely to be uninsured than other ethnic groups. This time, the website designers translated 'get ready' as preparase. It should have been preparese — with an 'e'' instead of an 'a.' The same mistake appears three times on the Spanish home page, which is supposed to be a mirror-image of HealthCare.gov. Such a prominent error can unintentionally send a message that the site was not designed to professional standards. HealthCare.gov is the online portal to subsidized private health insurance for consumers who don't have access to a job-based plan. It served 36 states last open enrollment season, while the remaining states ran their own insurance exchanges. The feds as well as some states experienced crippling technical problems, and officials are vowing things will be different this time. 'Where we are focusing in on is a successful consumer experience,' said Andy Slavitt, a tech industry executive brought in by the Health and Human Services department to oversee the relaunch. Insurers say one big challenge for next year will involve millions of returning customers. It's not really a technology issue, but a time crunch that also coincides with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. President's plan@ U.S. President Barack Obama sits next to Bruce Ribner (R) as he participates in a briefing with Emory University doctors and healthcare professionals . Those returning customers will have just one month — until Dec. 15— to go back into their existing accounts and update their financial information. Acting by that date will ensure that they are getting the right amount of financial assistance with their premiums at the very start of the new plan year. It's estimated that more than 6 million of the 7.3 million people who signed up under President Barack Obama's health law are receiving subsidies, which greatly reduce their premiums. After those returning customers update their financial information, insurers say they'll have to enter a 14-character plan identifier number on the website if they want to keep their current insurance policy. The industry says insurers had hoped that number would be automatically provided by HealthCare.gov — but that wasn't possible. Administration spokesman Aaron Albright says there's also a simpler way to do it. Consumers can select their plan from a list of all the plans they are eligible for on the website. Existing customers who do nothing will be automatically re-enrolled in their current plan as of Jan. 1. But they will receive this year's subsidy amount, which could be lower than what they'd be entitled to for 2015. And that could mean sticker shock over their new monthly premiums. Officials downplayed those industry concerns on Wednesday, saying many returning customers will want to shop around to make sure their current plan is still the best deal for them. And those returning customers who miss the Dec. 15 date will still have until the end of open enrollment on Feb. 15 to update their financial information. The change would take effect March 1, and in the meantime they might have to pay more.

"The world’s first baby factory is being built in India to house hundreds of poor women paid to have children for Western couples unable to conceive. Potential parents – including Britons – will be able to send sperm or embryos to the one-stop surrogacy shop, before visiting to pick up their new child. The multi-million-pound clinic will have self-catering apartments for visiting Western couples, a floor for surrogate mothers, offices, delivery rooms, an IVF department and even restaurants and a gift shop. Dr Nayna Patel (front, centre) is building the world's largest surrogate house to provide rooms for hundreds of women to carry babies for western couples . Plans for Dr Patel's new super surrogacy hospital which is expected to house hundreds of Indian women making babies for childless Western couples . The doctor behind the state-of-the-art centre is Nayna Patel, who runs a back-street clinic that accommodates around 100 pregnant women in a single house. She pays each surrogate around £4,950 and receives £17,250 from hopeful parents. Her programme in Anand, a small city in the state of Gujarat where the new clinic is under construction, has already produced almost 600 babies for rich couples. Dr Patel revealed in a BBC Four documentary last night that she had received death threats and faced accusations of exploiting the poor for profit. She said: ‘I have faced criticism and I will in the future. According to many, I am controversial. There have been allegations of baby selling, baby-making factory.’She insisted she was on a feminist mission, saying ‘surrogacy is one woman helping another’. Surrogate mother Papiya, who works at the Surrogate House, is expecting a baby for the second time - this time it is twins for a couple in the U.S. Surrogate mother Vasanti, pictured with her husband Ashok, is able to send their daughter Mansi to an English speaking school because of the money earned from surrogacy . Dr Nayna Patel, who currently runs a back street surrogacy house near Gujarat, leads her pregnant surrogate mothers in prayer and lectures them on how to spend their money . She dismissed suggestions that she was exploiting the surrogates. ‘These woman are doing a job,’ she said. ‘It’s a physical job – they are paid for that job. ‘These women know there is no gain without pain.’ Surrogate mother Papiya, who is expecting twins for a couple in America, said she planned to spend her payment on a new house for her family. ‘Having twins means we get a bigger fee,’ she said. ‘Last time I was a surrogate, I bought white goods, a car and lent some to my sister-in-law.’ Another surrogate, Vasanti, said she had been able to send her daughter to a good English-speaking school with the cash she has earned. She is also using her fees to build a new house for her family. In last night’s documentary, House of Surrogates, Dr Patel was seen praying as she placed embryos in the uterus of a surrogate. In two weeks, a blood test will show if she is pregnant. Building of the controversial surrogacy house has already begun. As well as rooms for each surrogate mother, it will also house a gift shop and hotel rooms . But the film revealed that there could be also non-medical complications for those involved. A Canadian named as Barbara, 54, was stuck in India for four months with her newborn son from surrogate Edan before she got the paperwork she needed to take him home. Barbara, who had tried for 30 years to become a mother, said: ‘Infertility is a medical problem. ‘If people born with bad eyesight get corrective eye glasses, and diabetics get insulin, why can’t we get medical treatment for our problem?’ Two heavily pregnant surrogate mothers undergo a 'blessing' inside the house by a hindu priest before they give birth.

The picture appears to show at least one shady figure stood at the end of the jetty. But if the satellite shot has captured a crime in progress the perpetrator is pretty brazen - it's broad daylight. The shot was posted on Reddit with the caption 'A murder near my house on Google Maps'. It's not the first time that unusual images have been spotted on Google Earth.

Security guard Jason Cook also claimed to have spotted the Loch Ness monster in satellite images. He claimed that the 65ft oblong shape followed by thin strands is actually the highly contested creature which is famously said to inhabit the open stretch of water in the Scottish Highlands.

"A teenager who holds a world record for eating 10 cheeseburgers in under two minutes and trains for his sport by eating 50 Weet-Bix in one sitting is on a mission to be the best competitive eater on the planet. Isaac Harding-Davis, from Ourimbah, on the New South Wales Central Coast, said he has always been a big eater - with the 90kg, 185cm tall boxer and rugby player claiming to be 'always hungry'. But it wasn't until the 18-year-old entered an eating competition at his local Lone Star restaurant just over a year ago that he realised his full potential - as well as just how valuable his extreme appetite is. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Competitive eater: Australian teenager Isaac Harding-Davis can eat ten cheeseburgers in under two minutes and wants to be world champion . Hungry: The 18-year-old says he has always been a big eater, and is pictured here using water to help him get the food down faster . 'I play a lot of sport, so I’m always hungry and try to eat healthy,' he told the Central Coast Express Advocate. 'I always knew I was a big eater but I didn’t realise I had a talent until I entered a competition to eat a two-foot long hot dog at Lone Star restaurant in Tuggerah just over a year ago.' During that competition, he broke the restaurant’s record and has completed the challenge 10 times since. After his hot dog success, he then beat hundreds to make the top ten of a Monster Burger challenge on the Gold Coast. 'I was up against the world record holder. The record was 18 minutes and I did it in nine,” the teenager said. As a result of that win he has amassed hundreds of dollars in prize-winnings from competitions all over the country. Speed eater: Isaac stacks his McDonald's cheeseburgers into a pyramid before starting the challenge . Say ahhhh: After finishing his first burger, Issac opens his mouth wide to show he has swallowed it completely . But, just like his appetite, he isn't satisfied with that - and wants to conquer the world with his talent. 'They say in life you should always pursue something you love and are good at. And for me, that’s eating. I’ve never failed a challenge yet,' Isaac said. Isaac works out between 10 and 15 hours and week and also plays basketball. When training for an event, the high school senior said he can wolf down 50 Weet-Bix in one sitting. The only things he won't put in his mouth are anchovies and olives - but he said taste rarely plays a part in his mind when he is competing. His dream is to head to the US to enter more competitive eating challenges in order to claim the world number one title.","Isaac Harding-Davis, 18, from Ourimbah, Australia, is always hungry .

"She's famous for stepping out in tiny bottom-baring shorts and is a fan of the crop top too but Rihanna's ab-baring antics won't win her many few fans among men. New research has shown that far from being fans of revealing clothes, men prefer women like the Duchess of Cambridge who plump for feminine, demure styles. The survey found that 45 per cent of British men preferred elegant dressers, with just 31 per cent saying they liked revealing styles. Unrepentant: Despite the risk of a risque pap shot, Rihanna and Tulisa are regularly seen in tiny shorts . Classy: Rihanna's shorts are less Daisy Duke and more thong as this candid shot reveals . Another 17 per cent said they didn't mind what a potential date wore - provided she was attractive - and, in a finding guaranteed to raise a few feminine hackles, the vast majority said they were more likely to respect a woman who covered up. More than half claimed they would . respect a woman more if she had a reserved style, while a  quarter said it depended on the woman in question. Just 22 per cent of men said they . would respect a woman if she was sporting a revealing outfit. While demure styles have enjoyed a spike in sales thanks to the Kate effect, Rihanna's debut collection for River Island was a huge success - proof that not everyone is a fan of the royal dress sense. Other celebrity women have also chosen to follow Rihanna's lead, with Miley Cyrus, Cara Delevingne and the entire cast of The Only Way Is Essex among those regularly seen in low cut tops and buttock scraping shorts. Despite their demand for demure dressing, it appears that looks rather than dress sense are the deciding factor in whether a man approaches a woman in a bar or not. Elegant: Rosamund Pike and the Duchess of Cambridge know how to make demure look good . Forgot something? Lady Gaga goes out in her bra . Platforms: Helen Flanagan shows off her assets in high heels . Revealing: Miley Cyrus is frequently seen in crop tops . According to the study, 61 per cent of British men claimed they went out specifically to meet members of the opposite sex, with 67 per cent saying that they would approach an attractive woman if they saw someone they liked in a bar or club. When asked which sort of woman would be more likely get their phone number, 55 per cent said it would be a woman in a dressed in a 'classy' outfit. The poll also revealed that 38 per cent of men admitted to feeling intimidated by women in revealing outfits. George Charles of VoucherCodesPro.co.uk, the website that conducted the survey, said: 'We were interested in discovering whether or not men were more likely to approach women who wore a specific style of clothing and whether this impacted their decisions to give out their number. 'Surprisingly, more men preferred to approach women who were wearing reserved and classy attire rather than a revealing outfit. 'As the results prove, it shows that men do notice women’s clothes, so perhaps keep this in mind when planning your next party outfit. 'Tailoring your look before going out and perhaps toning it down will make you feel more comfortable, which is the most important thing.'","54 % of men say they prefer a 'classy' dresser .

"Writer Ida Pollock was today hailed the world's oldest romantic novelist as it was revealed she is still producing steamy books at the age of 105. Ida has written 123 novels during her prolific career - many of them tales of virgins, chaste kisses and dashing male heroes. Ida has sold millions of books over nine decades with risque titles such as 'White Heat' and 'Interlude for Love'. Ida Pollock, 105, has been hailed as the world's oldest romantic novelist . She has millions of fans but has largely avoided the limelight by writing under ten different pseudonyms. Ida has written 70 books for Mills & Boon under the names Susan Barrie, Pamela Kent, Rose Burghley or Mary Whistler. Despite turning 105 last week Ida is still writing and her latest novel The Runaway is due to be published shortly. She no longer sits at her typewriter but . dictates to daughter Rosemary, 69, at their remote country home in . Lanreath near Looe, Cornwall. Ida said: 'A romance is never just a romance, there's adventure, mystery and movement. 'You . need a grand, dramatic setting - the Swiss Alps were always an personal . favourite of mine - and a chance meeting, on a train, a cruise, or . perhaps the hero and heroine find themselves shipwrecked on a desert . island. Ida has millions of fans but has largely avoided the limelight by writing under ten different pseudonyms . She has written 70 books for Mills & Boon under the names Susan Parrie, Pamela Kent. Rose Burghley and Mary Whistler . 'The men are normally rich, well-to-do - but never vulgar with their money. Young men lack the maturity to take control so an older man is essential to provide the reassurance the heroine's needs. 'There's always a fair amount of turbulence before he sweeps in to save the day. A happy ending is an absolute must.' Born in Lewisham, south London, Ida . began writing thrillers in her teens and finished her first, The Hills . of Raven's Haunt, at 14. After . becoming a full-time writer in the 1930s, Ida turned to romance and . penned a string of hits under the first of her ten pseudonyms, Joan . Allen. At her most prolific . Ida produced 40 books in five years - all based around the timeless . formula of naive young heroines spirited away from danger by rugged, . older men. Ida Pollock now dictates her novels to her daughter Rosemary, who is pictured here reading with her in 1967 . Many of the dashing male characters are said to be based on Ida's late husband, Hugh Pollock (left) who was also married to Enid Blyton. Ida wrote 70 novels for Mills & Boon, and is pictured here with Alan Boon (right) In 1956 alone Ida had eight romances . published under five pen names - each around 70,000 words long and all . finishing with a happy ending. Ida has only released a handful of . books under her own name and still publishes under the last of her . alter-egos, Marguerite Bell. A Distant Drum, her most recent . novel, in which a young Fanny Templeton falls for the Marquis of Ordley . after clashing at the battle of Waterloo, came out in 2005. Ida's . memoirs, Starlight, were published in 2009 and two more Regency . romances, including her latest, The Runaway, are waiting to be . published.

Ida, also a celebrated artist and illustrator, says it takes her about six weeks to write a novel. Many of her swarthy male heroes bear more than a passing resemblance to her late husband Colonel Hugh Pollock, a decorated veteran and publisher. Col Pollock was Winston Churchill's editor and was previously married to Enid Blyton. He died in 1971, aged 82. Ida said: 'I think I was born to write. My mother would put a typewriter on the dining room table and say ""there you go"". ;My first story was published in the Christian Herald and they would pay me five guineas. I wrote my first novel when I was just 14. 'I was into mysteries and thrillers at the time but I eventually I drifted into romance because my mother would always ask me to write 'something pretty'. 'I've never got bored of it because its something I absolutely love. My books are full of hope and romance rather than sex. 'They are a form of escapism - you can escape the parts of the world that you don't like.' Ida Pollock's writing desk in the early 1990s . Unmarried Rosemary, an editor and writer, has followed in her mum's footsteps and written a number of romantic novels herself. She said: 'Pen names are very common in romance writing. Mum's publishers always insisted on them because readers associated different styles with different names. 'I don't think she's ever quite got the recognition she deserves. I've always loved her books and I would read them over and over, especially in my teens. 'I think her passion for writing is what has kept her going so long. She's remarkable - a national treasure'. Nightingale in the Sycamore (1957)'He moved to meet her as she moved to meet him and caught her in his arms, kissing her wildly, like a man who was starving. Her hair, eyes, cheeks, lips - he smothered them with so many kisses that before long he paused to draw breath himself. She was completely breathless, but clung to him as if never willingly would she let him go again, and for the first time for weeks she knew what it was to feel glad that she had been born. . . .'Bay of Moonlight (1968)'Their first kiss was unlike anything Sarah had ever expected of a kiss. It left her feeling as if a thunderbolt had come hurtling out of the sky and passed so close that it scorched her.

It was the very purpose of her life ...'A Distant Drum (2005)'She had been in bed no more than five minutes when she heard the door handle begin to turn. The movement was gentle at first.

"North Dakota often tops the lists when it comes to binge drinking, so it may not be too much of a surprise when told the state also has the most bars per capita in the United States. There's one bar for every 1,621 North Dakotans.The state comes just ahead of neighboring Montana. According to Census Data gathered in 2011, there are 422 bars in North Dakota. The stats: North Dakota leads US in ratio of bars to residents with Virginia bringing up the rear . With a population under 700,000, that gives the state its title. Whilst North Dakota has topped lists . for binge drinking and teen drinking in the past some have suggested . that rural demographics could be one reason why people take to the . bottle. Put simply, there's not really very much to do there. Heading . out for drink after work or on the weekend is a popular thing to do in . virtually every city in the country, but in North Dakota, it's not just a . way to pass time, sit down and have a beer; it is the centre of many . communities. Jason Stein, . Bar Manager of the Supper Club and Lounge in Davenport isn't shocked. 'It's not surprising at all. There's not much else to do here.' 'It's kind of a centerpiece. There really isn't anything else to do in a town of like 200 people,' he tells ABC 6. After considering statistics on binge drinking and drunken driving, Pam Sagness told The Forum that North Dakota’s spot on that list was no surprise. Sagness, . prevention administrator for the Mental Health and Substance Abuse . division of the state health department, said easy access is one of the . driving factors behind North Dakota’s track record of problems with . alcohol abuse. North Dakota: There's room at the bar with one per 1,621 residents of the state . North Dakota: People like to drink here because there's not really much else to do... A pair of . 2010 studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed . that North Dakotans binge drink more often – and in greater quantities – . than almost all Americans. Perhaps . more alarming, Sagness said, is that North Dakotans don’t see much harm . in binge drinking. She guessed that the North Dakotan attitude of 'work . hard, play hard' steadily drove up the ratio of bars to residents. 'It didn’t get to be this way overnight,' Sagness said. Laura Mio grew up in the Midwest, so she wasn’t surprised to hear that North Dakota ranks first in bars per capita in the U.S. 'The joke was, you have to have as many bars as churches – if not more,' said Mio, now general manager at JL Beers in downtown Fargo. Fargo, the state capital, stands out across the country for alcohol hotspots. Across state lines: Things are not much better in Montana, the 2nd booziest state in the nation with one bar for every 1,658 Montanans . Sagness said part of the access problem in North Dakota is that there is no statewide agency regulating alcohol – it’s left up to local governments to dole out liquor licenses. Janet Seaworth, executive director of the North Dakota Beer Wholesalers Association, said she thinks the state’s approach to regulating alcohol has proven effective. Bruce Schauer at the Wild Rice Grill and Bar agrees. He says they serve the community much more than just cold beverages. 'In rural communities, the local bar and grill is really the only place you can go to eat, and the food sales are usually about the same as the liquor sales.' Montana comes in second list of bars to people. With just under a million state residents there is one bar per 1,658 members of the population. At the other end of the pile, Virginia comes in bottom with 125 bars in the entire state, for nearly 8 million people. New Hampshire doesn't fare much better. Although the state is small by comparison, there are just 38 bars split between 1.3 million residents.","North Dakota has one bar per 1,621 residents .

"A wounded war veteran has described the moment security agents treated him like a 'terrorist' on a recent trip to California because he couldn't raise his injured right arm in a full-body scanner and his dress uniform contained 'too much metal.' Cpl. Nathan Kemnitz was awarded a Purple Heart after he almost died in 2004 from an injury incurred from a roadside bomb in Fallujah, Iraq. The brave soldier recently traveled to Sacramento, California to receive another award as his district's veteran of the year. But, what should have been a celebratory experience was tainted when suspicious security workers at both the Sacramento International Airport and the California State Capitol Buildings subjected him to intense screenings and even ordered him to take off his uniform. Scroll down for video . Thorough: Cpl. Nathan Kemnitz's friend Patricia Martin took pictures of the tough security screenings the Purple Heart awarded Marine was subjected to . Because of the injury Kemnitz suffered in the blast, he can't lift his right arm above his head, which has made getting through security lines increasingly difficult. 'At some places I'm treated like royalty and at some like a terrorist. There's got to be something in the middle,' he said. Two recent trips through the secuirty line landed closer to the 'terrorist' side of treatment. When a TSA officer asked him to raise his arms above his head in a full-body scanner, he refused. 'My right arm doesn't work. It's a lot of hassle for me to do that,' Kemnitz told Military Times.

His traveling partner, Patricia Martin, found the whole incident disturbing, and took pictures of the humiliating screening. 'What . does the uniform and heroism represent if our own citizens - in this . case employees of the TSA and security personnel - have no regard for . them?' Martin wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki about . the incident. TSA spokesman Ross Feinstein issued a statement Monday concerning the incident.

He was visiting the capitol as a veteran being honored in his district, but the Senate Sergent-At-Arms screening him didn't cut him any slack when the metal detector went off. The screener asked him to take off his dress blue blouse 'because he was wearing too much metal.' That started an argument between Kemnitz, Martin and the security screener.

"A suspected terrorist plot to drive a toy car loaded with explosives under the gates of a Territorial Army base and blow it up has been smashed by police. Detectives believe the device was to have been detonated in Luton as part of a campaign of terror attacks in Britain. Evidence of the conspiracy was obtained in a huge surveillance operation. The terror suspects leave Westminster Magistrates' Court after today's hearing . At one stage, undercover police looked on as terrorist suspects apparently used the mountains of Snowdonia as a training ground. They are accused of taking their lead . from copies of the Al-Qaeda magazine Inspire which contains blueprints . for home-grown attacks. The alleged complex 16-month plot . emerged as four British Muslim men appeared in court yesterday charged . with a raft of terrorist offences. Zahid Iqbal, 30, is accused of leading a terror network under the instruction of shadowy Al-Qaeda masterminds in Pakistan. He was joined in the dock by close friends Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, 24, Umar Arshad, 23, and Syed Farhan Hussain, 21. The gang are accused of working to recruit others to fight Jihad and raising vital funds. The four suspect appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today on terror-related charges . They were arrested at their homes in Luton last week after a multi-million pound investigation that began last year.

Swoop: Police guard a house in Bishopscote Road in Luton, Bedfordshire, following a dawn raid on April 24 . Prosecutors said two of the men were caught discussing 'building and modifying' improvised explosive devices.

One was overheard saying: 'You don't . want to be expecting something huge and then something little going . off.' Another said: 'I was like driving past the TA centre … if you had a . small toy car, there's a small gap under the gate. You could drive it . under a vehicle that they use.' Ahmed is accused of acting as a . recruiter and making an 'explorative visit' to Pakistan where he may . have undertaken terrorist activities. Hussain is alleged to have been the quartermaster who specialised in the distribution of funds and provisions. Arshad's role was allegedly to provide . practical guidance on activities abroad, what to wear to fit in and to . lead the outdoor training.

"For some, putting up some basic shelving constitutes a major DIY project. DIY for one Californian father, however, is slightly more extreme, as he’s built a 180-foot-long roller coaster in his backyard. Will Pemble, 50, made his son’s dream come true after he was asked to build the roller coaster at their home in San Francisco after a trip to a local theme park – but he very probably made his own dream come true, too. Scroll down for video . On the right track: A Californian father has built a huge roller coaster in his backyard . Life can be up and down: Mr Pemble spent around six months building the roller coaster . DIY project: Mr Pemble spent around $3,500 on materials . The father-of-two threw himself into the project and was so desperate to share his love of physics that he even set up his own website, CoasterDad.com, to showcase his incredible creation. His project was finally complete after spending around $3,500 on building materials and grafting for more than 300 hours. E-commerce management consultant Mr Pemble said: ‘Like most things in life, this project all came about because I got excited by an idea. Mr Pemble was so desperate to share his love of physics that he even set up his own website, CoasterDad.com . Captured on film: Mr Pemble made a series of POV YouTube videos to document his progress . Size matters: The roller coaster stretches around the Pembles' huge backyard . Rigorous: Mr Pemble tested the coaster using a frame on wheels . Testing times: A cart is filmed hurtling around a bend . ‘We were just back from one of many amusement park trips and Lyle asked a simple question, “Why don't we build our own roller coaster, Dad?” ‘I couldn't think of a single good reason to say no so Lyle and I headed off to the lumber yard for a few supplies. ‘Today, our backyard roller coaster is an unending source of excitement, challenge, education, and connection. ‘The coaster is complete and fully operational, although we keep adding onto it and making modifications. Maintenance: Mr Pemble showing damage to the cart . Track day: The Pembles check that everything will run smoothly . ‘I would say it's more of an experiment so it will probably never be finished, as long as there are still things to try and learn. ‘The track as it is today has a complete loop that's about 180 feet around, with the whole thing taking six months to build.’ Mr Pemble said he has had several requests from fans asking him to build them backyard roller coasters. The father-of-two also revealed his son Lyle, 10, and daughter Ellie, 12, were the inspiration behind the gravity-defying project. He added: ‘Coaster Dad is all about sharing information and ideas about backyard roller coasters, but even more, it's here to support science education for kids. ‘People started asking if we did this kind of thing for a living and if could we go and build backyard roller coasters for other families. ‘If I'm honest, I can't think of a single good reason to say no so that could well happen in the future. ‘Our mission is purely to share our love of physics, family, and fun so one thing has just led to another. ‘The whole family has been involved in the project and the neighbours always check in to see how we're doing. ‘It's amazing that all of this came from a kid asking one simple question and a dad saying yes.’ According to Mr Pemble's latest post on CoasterDad.com, there are still a few teething problems to overcome as a new cart he'd built crashed the third time it was sent around the track. Mr Pemble wrote: 'The track was going up fast and beautiful..... and we were in high spirits as we ran the new cart down the new track during our first test. Then, it happened! It was time for us to switch from being super pleased with ourselves into a slightly less comfortable, but ultimately more productive mode: Namely, Learning From Roller Coaster Cart Crash mode!'We ran the new cart down the track three times. The first and second times, things seemed to go well. The third time, as they say, was the charm. But only if you define the word “charm” as metal-on-metal-crash-with-cart-filp-and-disappointment.'","Will Pemble, 50, from San Francisco has built a 180-foot-long roller coaster in his backyard .

"Pregnant women can drink alcohol and coffee and dye their hair – but should avoid gardening, according to an expert who  aims to dispel ‘motherhood myths’. Economist and author Emily Oster contradicts conventional wisdom and advocates a much more relaxed approach to pregnancy. In her book, Expecting Better, she claims a glass of wine a day is fine, plenty of coffee won’t harm the baby and gaining too little weight while pregnant is far more worrying than gaining too much. Safe? According to Emily Oster, a glass of wine a day is fine during the second and third trimesters . The Harvard-educated associate . professor of economics at the University of Chicago used her data skills . to rewrite the rules of pregnancy. Last . night she told the Daily Mail that food restrictions were ‘overblown’ and that alcohol consumption does not affect the IQ or behaviour of the . child. She said her book – . which found the best studies often painted a different picture from . official guidelines – was ‘simply to show women the evidence and let . them decide for themselves’. Miss . Oster said: ‘Actually getting the numbers led me to a more relaxed . place: a glass of wine every now and then, plenty of coffee, exercise . when I wanted it.’ Controversial: Oster's research contradicts received wisdom on drinking during pregnancy . Miss Oster’s quest began when she became pregnant three years ago and was advised to give up her four cups of coffee a day. Unwilling . to do so and frustrated by ‘one long list of rules’, she investigated . and found that research linking coffee consumption to higher rates of . miscarriage was flawed. She . wrote in one article: ‘I ultimately decided that the weight of evidence . didn’t support limiting my consumption very much. I decided to . continue.’ Her next port of . call was alcohol. She looked at a study in the journal Pediatrics, which . had concluded that just one drink a day was enough to put unborn . children at risk of behavioural problems. But . the research did not reflect that 18 per cent of the women studied . didn’t drink at all and 45 per cent of those who enjoyed a daily drink . also took cocaine. She . concluded that women should feel comfortable with one or two drinks a . week during the first three months and up to one a day after that. Her . research found that dyeing hair was fine and there was little evidence . that exercise, while not unsafe, had any benefits. But she found . gardening could raise the risks of exposure to a toxoplasmosis parasite . living in the soil. Toxoplasmosis . is caused by a parasite and is acquired from contact with cats and . their faeces. A woman contracting it just before or while pregnant can . transmit it to her baby. Miss . Oster said: ‘There is some risk to increase birth defects if you do a . lot of outdoor gardening when you are pregnant. That can increase rates . of toxoplasmosis.’ She discovered sushi was fine and sardines and herring were good for a child’s IQ, but advised against raw milk cheese. Sceptics . were less convinced. A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Drinking . during pregnancy can be associated with miscarriage, foetal alcohol . syndrome and low birth weight.’ ‘Our advice remains that women who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant should avoid alcohol.’ Netmums . website founder, Siobhan Freegard, said: ‘Official guidelines may seem . stringent but they are there to err on the side of absolute safety.’ Expecting Better: Why the Conventional Pregnancy Wisdom Is Wrong-and What You Really Need to Know, £10.04, is released next week by Orion.","Economist Emily Oster analysed hundreds of health studies and journals .

On the more bizarre end of the scale, football scarves, Calvin Klein underwear and hats made out of lego were also on show. But while it may be easy to fit in on the Front Row in some of these get-ups, it will be harder to to blend in while doing the weekly shop at Sainsbury's. The easier trends to copy included midi skirts and bright yellow accessories or sheepskin coats - all easy enough to incorporate into a normal wardrobe. Read on to find out what you'll most likely be coveting in a few months time... MIDI SKIRTS: . Midi skirts were everywhere this weekend - paired with ladylike roll-necks and blazers or baggy sweatshirts and chunky boots.

"Call it an improvement in international relations, or simple result of the high levels of emotions and passion at the World Cup, but it seems many of the thousands of fans who have descended on Brazil are interested in scoring off the pitch as well as on. Tinder, the dating app made famous by its ‘swipe’ – right for ‘yes I’m interested’ and left for 'no' - has reported a massive 50 per cent rise in usage in the country since the start of the tournament. Whether fans are looking for comfort after their team loses or to celebrate a victory, they are turning to Tinder in droves in the hope of ‘matching’ with another like minded fan. The thousands of fans in Brazil has resulted in a surge in use of the dating app . Tinder spokesperson Rosette Pambakian told Quartz, who reported the rise in usage: 'The average user spends more than one hour a day on Tinder, approximately 77 minutes, and that number is up by nearly 50 per cent in Brazil since the start of the World Cup.' The location-based app, which only shows you people in your current vicinity, was already popular in Brazil, with usage there falling just below the UK. It uses information from the other social media giant Facebook and allows users to make their decision on each person anonymously, opening a separate window where two user to chat only if they have both swiped right for each other. Unsurprisingly female fans are attracting almost as much attention as the football itself . A German supporter showed support for the host nation by carrying a Brazilian flag but bears her love for her country on her chest by wearing a bikini in the national colours . Two Argentina fans cheer for player Gonzalo Higuan in the World Cup match between Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Maracana stadium, Rio .

Battling the baking heat in Rio, the female fans are enjoying plenty of attention for their skimpy – but very patriotic - outfits, complete with colourful wigs, team scarfs and plenty of face paint. With such hot high jinx going it's no wonder there's a bit more than footie going on in Brazil this summer.","App already popular in Brazil, with only UK and US having higher usage .

"Downing Street was forced to overrule the Foreign Secretary last night after he dismissed the prospect of UK air strikes against Islamic extremists in Syria. Philip Hammond risked opening a rift with Barack Obama after saying Britain would not join US-led strikes against Islamic State fanatics. Asked about plans for an open-ended bombing campaign, Mr Hammond said: ‘Let me be clear – Britain will not be taking part in any air strikes in Syria. We have already had that discussion in our parliament last year and we won’t be revisiting that position.’ But his comments provoked alarm at Number 10, which is anxious to present a united front on the US strategy unveiled by the President on Wednesday. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today appeared to rule out British air strikes against ISIS in Syria, but David Cameron's official spokesman insisted no options were off the table . Hours after Mr Hammond’s appearance in Germany, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman insisted Mr Cameron was ‘not ruling anything out’. He said a decision had not yet been made on whether Britain would join air strikes on IS targets inside Syria, but stressed that the Islamist fanatics had to be tackled both there and in Iraq. He suggested Mr Hammond had been referring to the idea of bombing the forces of Syrian tyrant Bashar al-Assad – an issue that has not been on the agenda for more than 12 months. But it appeared Mr Hammond had accidentally revealed ministers’ deep reservations about joining a hazardous military mission in Syria just months before the General Election. Speaking in the Commons on Wednesday Mr Hammond said there was a ‘qualitative difference’ between air strikes on IS positions in Iraq and Syria. He said Syria’s ‘sophisticated, integrated air defence system (which) protects the whole of the country’s airspace’ greatly increased the risk of operating there. Battle cry: US President Barack Obama threatened renewed airstrikes against ISIS saying that 'in a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality' Mr Hammond’s caution is a blow to hopes of building a united international response to IS. Last night it emerged ten Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Iraq, have pledged support for a US-led strategy to destroy IS ‘wherever it is, including in both Iraq and Syria’. Downing Street said Mr Cameron welcomed and supported Mr Obama’s declaration that air strikes will take place inside Syria for the first time alongside an expansion of strikes in Iraq. Number 10 held open the prospect of the RAF hitting at IS targets in Iraq although officials said that Britain is currently ‘not at the stage’ of joining the military action.

Pictured above are members of the Kurdish Peshmerga, an army that Obama's airstrikes have helped in their fight against ISIS . With UK aid worker David Haines, 44, threatened with execution by IS, there are fears that any British participation in air strikes would lead to his death. During a speech on the eve of the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, Mr Obama promised: ‘We will conduct a systematic campaign of air strikes against these terrorists. I will not hesitate to take action against Isil in Syria, as well as Iraq.’ Military planners are expected to take several weeks to identify targets in Syria and Mr Obama warned of a protracted campaign. US Secretary of State John Kerry was in Saudi Arabia last night to try gauge the level of Middle East support in the fight against IS. Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moallem has told the US that air strikes on its territory without Damascus’ consent would be considered an aggression.","Hammond insists: 'Britain will not be taking part in air strikes in Syria'

"Gordon Brown yesterday called on older Scots to tell their grandchildren how they fought ‘side by side’ with the English in the Second World War. Ahead of tomorrow’s independence referendum, the former Prime Minister said the younger generation needed to know about the achievements of the UK. Defeating the Nazis and creating the NHS and the welfare state all happened because England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had stuck together, he said. Scroll down for video . Mr Brown asked: ‘And when someone was injured, nobody asked are you Scots, English, Welsh or Irish? We all came to each other’s aid because we were in a common fight, struggling and working together’ Polls have shown that the over-65s are less likely than youngsters to support independence and are believed to be vital to the result. Speaking at a No rally in Clydebank, near Glasgow, which suffered more bombing in the war than anywhere outside London and Coventry, Mr Brown said: ‘There are Scots, English, Welsh and Irish who fought side by side during the Second World War. ‘There is not a battlefield in Europe where we did not fight with others. There is not a cemetery where you don’t find Scots, English, Welsh and Irish lying side by side. ‘And when someone was injured, nobody asked are you Scots, English, Welsh or Irish? We all came to each other’s aid because we were in a common fight, struggling and working together.’ The former Labour leader said the common endeavour should be explained to the young. ‘Tell them something: tell them that we had to fight a war together to ensure peace in this country,’ he said. Mr Brown was speaking after a leaked document showed the SNP-led Scottish Government is planning £450million in NHS cuts. Pictured: Yes campaigners out in force yesterday in George Square, Glasgow . Mr Brown was speaking after a leaked document showed the SNP-led Scottish Government is planning £450million in NHS cuts – despite claiming to be the only party that can be trusted with its future. He said the nationalists were ‘perpetrating a lie’ that only secession would allow Scotland to protect the NHS from privatisation. Mr Brown added that he had received support from the surgeon who saved his right eye after a rugby accident as a teenager. And he said an independent Scotland’s army would be like Dad’s Army. He suggested secession would mean ‘we’re all doomed’ – the catchphrase of Private Frazer in the BBC comedy. An independent Scotland would have to send radioactive waste from its two nuclear power stations to England while it builds new space to store or dump it, a leading expert has warned. Britain can already store some waste at Sellafield and is in the process of trying to find a suitable site to dump radioactive material underground for the long term. But nuclear expert Malcolm Grimston of Imperial College warned that Scotland could not add to limited storage at its two sites, Torness and Hunterston, before independence. ‘They can’t have that space in 18 months,’ said Mr Grimston, casting doubt on a nuclear-free Scotland pledge. He added that the cost of long-term building storage facilities could cost ‘in the billions’ and take 25 years to complete.","Former PM said NHS, welfare and defeating Nazis all have Union to thank .

"A grand jury in Tarrant County, Texas has decided not to indict the rookie police officer who shot dead a homeowner while investigating a burglary at the wrong address. Last May, R.A. 'Alex' Hoeppner and his partner Benjamin Hanlon accidentally started searching 72-year-old Jerry Waller's property, confusing it in the dark for a house across the street. Waller was in bed with his wife Kathy at the time, and was stirred by the police officer's flashlights. Fearing a prowler was outside, he grabbed his .35-caliber-pistol and went to investigate. Scroll down for video . No consequences: A grand jury has decided not to indict the rookie police officer who shot dead 72-year-old Jerry Waller (right) on accident last May. Pictured above with wife Kathy . According to a search warrant affidavit released by the Star-Telegram in July, the two officers encountered an armed Waller near the corner of his home, told them they were police and to drop his gun. Waller didn't drop his gun and instead raised it at Hoeppner who proceeded to fatally shoot the senior citizen seven times. According to the autopsy report, Waller suffered three hits to his chest as well as single shots to his abdomen and hand. Two other bullets grazed his wrist and forearm. Radio transmissions after the shooting record Hanlon telling dispatchers 'shots fired' and to send for an ambulance. 'I don't know who the guy is,' Hanlon says. 'The guy came out with a gun. He wouldn't put the gun down. He pointed it at Hoeppner. Hoeppner fired.' Waller was found in his garage and pronounced dead at the scene. A family devastated: Waller was shot by Fort Worth police as they searched his home for burglars in the dark using only flashlights . The jury heard 25 hours of testimony over four days. Hoeppner testified twice and so did his partner Hanlon, who was fired last year from the department for filing a false sworn statement in an unrelated August arrest. But in the end they decided there wasn't enough evidence to bring up criminal charges. Following the decision Wednesday, the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office issued a statement, saying it was standard policy to refer all officer-involved shootings to a grand jury. 'The panel reviewed all of the evidence and called witnesses and made a decision not to indict, which means no criminal charges will be filed,' the statement read. Right home: This is the house that cops should have been searching . Wrong home: Waller's home, pictured here, is across the street from the home police should have searched . Waller's widow and the rest of his family released a statement of their own as well, saying they would not comment on the grand jury's decision until their independent investigation into the shooting finished. So far, the family has not brought up a lawsuit against the city or the police department. Chief Jerry Halstead of the Fort Worth Police says he hopes the grand jury's decision will help start the healing process for both the Waller family and the cop. 'This tragedy has weighed heavily on the hearts of the men and women of the police department. Personally, I have rarely felt so much sadness from a tragedy within our community,' Chief Halstead said. 'The Waller family has been and will continue to be in our thoughts and prayers. I also ask for continued prayers and support for Officer Hoeppner and his family.'","Fort Worth, Texas police officer R.A.

"The study found the more money a person has the happier they are . Whoever said money can't buy happiness was very wrong, new research has found. According to an economic study, the more money a person has, the happier they are. The latest study of 1,014 people contradicts previous research that said the correlation between money and happiness diminishes when the basic needs of a person are met. People were asked to rate their levels of happiness and their income was recorded. Economists Betsey Stevenson and Justin . Wolfers say in their paper the May 2013 American Economic Review, Papers . and Proceedings that there is no evidence of a 'satiation' point in the . link between money and happiness. They . wrote: 'While the idea that there is some critical level of income . beyond which income no longer impacts well-being is intuitively . appealing, it is at odds with the data.' Everyone with an income of £306,250 a year or more classed themselves as 'very happy'. The University of Michigan study found . that all those earning £61,250 a year or more also described themselves . as either very or fairly happy. However, . only 35 per cent of people taking home £6,125 - the equivalent of . $10,000 in the exchange rate used in the study - claimed they were . happy. A total of 21 per cent in that income bracket said they were 'not too happy'. The economists wrote: 'The . income-well-being link that one finds when examining only the poor, is . similar to that found when examining only the rich', according to AFP. They . added: 'We find no evidence of a significant break in either the . happiness-income relationship, nor in the life satisfaction-income . relationship, even at annual incomes up to half a million dollars.' People with the lowest incomes were more likely to describe themselves as 'not too happy' The latest study comes after a separate study found people who splash out on ‘experiences’ such as days out and concert tickets are happier than those who buy possessions. Psychologists asked 9,600 people about their shopping habits, as well as questions to ascertain personality traits, values and life satisfaction. 'Experiential shoppers', who bought treats such as concern tickets or weekends away, rather than clothes or gadgets, reported greater life satisfaction, according to the study led by San Francisco State University Assistant Professor of Psychology Ryan Howell.","University of Michigan study found the richer people are happier .

Rising benefit bill: Miss McVey, pictured in 2002, said one in 17 of the population will receive DLA within five years if the present rate of claiming continues . The number of people who get DLA has tripled to three million in 20 years and McVey says if it carries on rising at the same rate, one in 17 of the population will receive it within five years. She says many who get DLA and are officially classed ‘disabled’ are no such thing: ‘Only three per cent of people are born with a disability, the rest acquire it through accident or illness, but people come out of it. Thanks to medical advances, bodies heal.’ The decision to introduce new tests has produced an extraordinary ‘closing-down sale’ effect, with rocketing claims as people rush to get their hands on unchecked ‘welfare for life’ before McVey’s axe falls on April 8. She says Britain simply cannot carry on doling out so much in State handouts. McVey says Britain’s welfare bill is ‘a fifth higher than the European average, over double what America spends, six times what Japan spends. We have to have a fair and robust system, but we must make sure the billions we are spending go to the right people.’ Before becoming an MP, McVey helped run her father’s firm, got a law degree and was a successful TV presenter. Her first memory of politics is at school. ‘I ran my first campaign when I was 11.’ she says. ‘My slogan was ‘Vote McVey, vote the right way. I’ve never surpassed it!’ Ask her to identify her political heroes and she pointedly declines to name Margaret Thatcher, a nod to her Scouse roots. ‘She wasn’t a big figure growing up in Merseyside if I’m brutally honest,’ she reveals. ‘The people I believed in were people like William Lever, the  great philanthropic industrialist –  self-made men who realised anyone could achieve. My dad started off  in scrap metal, real men doing  men’s jobs. ‘I’m not interested in academic backgrounds or who you are connected to, but your character, personality: are you a laugh to be with? Making herself heard: Mrs McVey pictured with Sandra Howard while campaigning in 2005 . McVey continues: ‘Life is about hard work and getting on with things. That may be Dad’s background in demolition, if you look how a building is constructed – the foundations, the structure – the interior design is relatively simple.’ She is glad she had plenty of experience before entering politics in her late 30s. ‘I have come in later and from a male environment. You can’t get much more male than a demolition site. I’m shyer than people give me credit for,’ she says, smiling, adding more convincingly: ‘But I can also tell people to get lost, maybe some others can’t.’ Revelation: Miss McVey said she never married because: ¿I never met the man, THE man' She gives another fiery flash of her Liverpudlian pride when I point out Knowsley in Merseyside has the highest rate of DLA claimants. Does that suggest swinging the lead is worse in Merseyside than elsewhere? ‘Absolutely not, I totally don’t want that down!’ she flares, pointing angrily at my notebook. True or not, Merseyside is one of the first areas to be targeted in McVey’s DLA crackdown. McVey has had a series of romances. Before becoming an MP she dated Ed Vaizey, now a fellow Tory Minister. Until recently she was dating Shipley Tory MP Philip Davies. ‘We’re still best mates, if that’s what you wanna know,’ she says. Why has she never married? ‘You know what? It was never my key focus. I have had long relationships but I have never got married. I just thought it would happen. I tried and now I think it’s too late.’ What about not having had children? Is it a regret? She replies matter-of-factly: ‘No. And I really like children. I have very good mates who did very well in business and had this ticking clock and really felt they wanted to get married and have children. I was waiting for my clock to tick and it never happened.’ Why? ‘I don’t know. I obviously never met the man.’ Not one of her many boyfriends? ‘No, THE man,’ she says with a husky laugh. Is she seeing anyone at present? ‘No. But I do live with a man. And that’s me dad,’ she says, retreating behind her joky Liver Bird caricature. You sense none of her suitors have lived up to her true hero, demolition man Jim McVey.","Esther McVey, 45, is taking on the role of Minister for the Disabled .

"An Al Qaeda terror suspect was able to defy a court order to travel close to the Olympic Park area five times in one day. The 24-year-old, who is under a control order not to enter the multimillion pound development in Stratford, East London, was arrested leading to fears he could have been carrying out a reconnaissance mission for an attack at the park. The breach has raised concerns about security just weeks before the biggest sporting event in the world is due to start in London, as dangerous suspects are supposed to be monitored by the police. Police fear: The Olympic Park could be a terrorist target . The man, who is of Somali origin and known only as CF, appeared in . court last month charged with five breaches of the order after he . travelled across London on a train line which passes close to the . Olympic development. The terror suspect, who was arrested at Stratford station is believed to have . tried to get to Afghanistan to fight for the Taliban against British troops. He is also suspected of fighting for the Al Qaeda group al-Shabaab, responsible for thousands of deaths, including Western aid workers. Government officials claim CF attended a terrorist camp and fought alongside jihadists from al-Shabaab. The Home Office says he is linked to a group of six British nationals who received terror training from Saleh Nabhan, the Al Qaeda leader killed in a raid by American Navy Seals in 2009. According to court documents, the Home Office warned that CF wanted to ‘re-engage in terrorism-related activities, either in the UK or Somalia’ - and is ‘determined to continue to adhere to his Islamist extremist agenda’. The alleged breaches, which took place in April and May this year, are the most serious security alert to hit the Olympic Park. The disclosure comes after a week in which 14 terror-related arrests were made in Britain, including a white Muslim convert detained over an alleged plan to carry out a major terrorist attack. A massive security operation has been put in place around the Olympic Park for the Games, which begin on July 27. An al-Shabaab jihadist (stock picture) CF is one of nine suspected risks to national security who are subject to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpim) legal orders – which restrict movements, computer use and who they can meet. He is being prosecuted for breaking conditions of the order after he was arrested last month. The man has since been bailed and will be challenging the banning order today in the High Court. His lawyers insist he had been travelling to attend meetings at his solicitor’s office in Stratford. He was discovered using the London overground route in the banned area through the electronic tag he had been ordered to wear to comply with the order. The alleged breaches were disclosed in a court case involving CF and another terror suspect, known as CC. Theresa May, the Home Secretary, has compiled a case against CF which says he attempted to travel to Afghanistan to fight as a jihadist and take part in suicide operations in 2008. He was prosecuted in Britain but absconded during his trial in June 2009 and fled to Somalia. In his absence, he was acquitted of any crime. In 2011 CF served two months in prison after absconding from an earlier court case. He was then placed on a control order and required to live in Norwich. The latest security scare comes after two Muslim converts were arrested last month on suspicion of plotting an attack on the Olympic canoeing venue in Waltham Abbey, Essex. The men, aged 18 and 32, were detained at their homes in East London after being seen acting suspiciously in a dinghy at the sporting location on the River Lea. Last week, two separate anti-terror operations resulted in 14 arrests. Seven men were being questioned last night after firearms were found in a car impounded by police after it was stopped on the M1 in South Yorkshire during a routine check. There was another scare three days ago, when a coach travelling on the M6 was surrounded by bomb disposal experts and police vehicles after a passenger rang police on his mobile to report a smoking package. It later turned out to be a false alarm. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Security breach happened just weeks before the Olympics is due to start .

"The number of women in work is rising faster in the UK than in any of the world’s most advanced economies, official figures show. Female employment grew by 1.79 per cent in the past year – the sharpest growth among the G7 group of leading nations. France and the US saw rises of 1.46 per cent, while employment among women grew by less than one per cent in Germany. In Japan, growth was only 0.34 per cent. The figures were revealed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which said that the number of women in work is more than 750,000 higher than four years ago. Female employment grew by 1.79 per cent in the past year – the sharpest growth among the G7 group of leading nations (file image) More than a third of the jobs created for women in the past year were part-time. Employment minister Esther McVey said the rapid rise was partly because working mothers in the UK were increasingly able to find more flexible work. ‘Women across Britain can be proud of the path they’ve blazed for future generations,’ she said. ‘Women can and should be able to make the choices that are right for them, and our reforms are designed to reflect that and allow women of all ages to pursue their career aspirations whatever their personal circumstances. 'The flexibility of the jobs market in this country means women are able to do just that, and whether it’s self-employment, part time work, or board-level professionals – the opportunities are there. ‘We have also reformed child care, giving more mums the option of moving back into the workplace if that’s what they want.’ The figures were collated using figures from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Employment minister Esther McVey said the rapid rise was partly because working mothers in the UK were increasingly able to find more flexible work . The rise in female employment has gone hand in hand with a boost in the number of the self-employed, which Miss McVey said was a sign of women’s entrepreneurial spirit. The DWP said female self-employment had been rising since the early 2000s and was fairly resilient to the recession. The number of self-employed women is up by 188,000 compared to last year. According to ONS data, the number of women working full-time increased by 223,000 to reach 8.13 million between April 2013 and 2014, while the number of women working part-time increased by 132,000 to reach 6.09 million. But while employment has risen, women’s wages still lag significantly behind men. A recent report from the Chartered Management Institute said a woman would have to work until the age of nearly 80 to earn the same amount of money as a man by the age of 65 for doing the same job.","Female employment grew in the UK by 1.79 per cent in the past year .

"Switzerland is placing a ban on the number of EU citizens - including Britons - who can work in the country as public anger grows over mass immigration. From next week the Alpine state will implement quotas on work permits for jobseekers from the European Union. The limits will be in place for the next 12 months. The Swiss government fears being 'swamped' by economic refugees from Bulgaria and Romania when work rules are eased next year. But it cannot discriminate against only a few countries out of a bloc of 27 with 500million citizens so the restrictions will affect everyone. The Swiss parliament has decided to restrict access to work in the country to people from EU member states . 'In the coming 12 months, workers from EU states will have only restricted access to the Swiss labour market,' the Swiss Federal Council said in a statement. The move by Switzerland comes ahead of a significant change to the rights of Romanians . and Bulgarians to work. Romania and Bulgaria are among the poorest countries in Europe and when they joined the European Union in 2007 work restrictions were imposed amid fears about mass migration. These measures will be dropped on 1 January 2014 giving Bulgarians and Romanians the same rights to work across the union as other EU citizens. From January 1 next year, the 25,000 . cap on the number of low-skilled workers from the two countries who can . get jobs and claim benefits in Britain will expire. The move by Switzerland to limit EU . citizens from working comes ahead of a change to the number of Romanians . and Bulgarians who can come to the UK. EU-wide work restrictions were imposed on the two countries when they joined the union in 2007. There were fears that mass immigration would swamp other EU countries as people left their home countries - among the poorest in Europe - to seek work elsewhere. From January 1 next year, the restrictions are lifted. In the UK, this means the 25,000 . cap on the number of low-skilled workers from the two countries who can . get jobs and claim benefits here will expire. The minimum wage in Bulgaria is only 73p while it stands at 79p in Romania. In Britain the minimum wage is £6.19, rising to £6.31 from October. There are about 130,000 Romanian and Bulgarians living in the UK. Current rules mean they are only . allowed to work here if they are self-employed, investors, or if they . take on short-term contracts for jobs such as fruit picking. Switzerland's move will increase pressure for other nations to follow suit. But local media have called the decision a . 'pulling up the drawbridge' mentality and came after pressure from . right-wing parties, despite pleas by the influential Swiss financial . sector that more immigrants are needed to keep the economy strong. In recent years the subject of immigration has become ever more controversial. Right-wing parties have routinely . played on Swiss fears of 'the other' and issued posters like one which . showed a black sheep being kicked out of a field full of white ones. The far-right Swiss People's Party in particular has spiked in popularity with claims that foreigners take jobs away from Swiss citizens. But in reality it is immigration from only a few states - Portugal, Spain, Greece and now Romania and Bulgaria - that irritates the most. Southern European people have been flocking to Switzerland in recent times as the endless financial crisis continues to sap them of jobs and hope. The clause that Switzerland is invoking is part of a bilateral agreement on migration with the European Union and allows temporary quotas on residency permits for EU residents wishing to work in Switzerland. Switzerland will now apply to the entire EU limits already in place for people from Estonia, Hungary, Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. 'Despite the move the EU is and will remain our most important partner,' said Justice Minister Simonetta Sommaruga. A government spokesman said that the million-plus EU residents who live in the country have 'had a positive impact... in particular in terms of consumer spending and on the construction industry,' but that restrictions are 'needed to make immigration more acceptable to society.' The move drew immediate criticism from Brussels. ''The measures disregard the great benefits that the free movement of persons brings to the citizens of both Switzerland and the EU,' said Baroness Catherine Ashton, EU foreign policy chief. Others worry that the Swiss move is a new manifestation of intolerance in Europe.","Mass immigration has become more controversial in Switzerland .

"Police have arrested and charged Daniel Brady, 38, the father of missing teenagers Jayden Brady, 14, and Joseph, 11.

"A giant donut walkway could soon hover above New York's Grand Central Station in plans to restore the transport hub to its former glory as the glittering gateway into America's commercial heartland.

With more than 21 million visitors every year, Grand Central Station is America's sixth most popular tourist attraction. It was built by and named for the New York Central Railroad in 1871 during the heyday of American long-distance passenger rail travel. It was rebuilt in 1913 and remains the largest train station in the world by number of platforms: 44, with 67 tracks running along them.

But yet, the area over . the years, it has become somewhat disconnected and a little lonely at . times, particularly in the evening.' The blueprints were imagined by architect firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who designed One World Trade Center, the building that has risen from the ashes of Ground Zero and is due for completion next year. 'Throughout the history of New York . City, urban growth has been matched by grand civic gestures,' said Roger . Duffy, Design Partner of SOM. 'This balance between growth and civic . response can be seen in examples such as the Commissioners’ Plan of 1811 . which led to the gridded parceling of land, two zoning resolutions . which recognized the potential for private development to shape the . public realm and the creation of grand public place making such as Grand .

"A 13-year-old girl from a 'troubled family' was abducted by three men and forced into becoming their sex slave. The girl was subjected to a string of assaults over four days after being trafficked from her home in London to Ipswich, prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones told Norwich Crown Court. Suran Uddin, 28, of St Matthew's Row, Bethnal Green, London, Mohammed Sheikh, 31, of Seaton Point in Hackney, London, and Hamza Ali, 38, of Chilford Road, Waltham Forest, London, denied various sex offences during a three week trial. But following three days of jury deliberations, Uddin, Sheikh and Ali were today all found guilty of conspiracy to traffick in the UK and supplying a class B drug to the victim. The girl was subjected to a string of assaults over four days after being trafficked from her home in London to Ipswich, prosecutors told Norwich Crown Court (pictured) Uddin was also convicted of two counts of rape. Sheikh was convicted on a charge of causing a child to engage in sexual activity but was cleared of two counts of rape. Ali was found guilty of a sexual assault but not guilty of rape. The men will be sentenced at a later date. Abdul Hammed, 46, of Wellington Street, Ipswich, was cleared of supplying a class B drug and two counts of rape. The judge had earlier instructed the jury to find him not guilty of trafficking. Opening the case, Miss Karmy-Jones said: 'These men deliberately targeted her. She was an unhappy and deeply troubled child. 'They enticed her to travel with them in order to set her up as a sex slave and to use her for their pleasure. 'In order to do so, they plied her with drugs and alcohol and made promises that they would take care of her and give her anything she wanted. 'Once at the property in Ipswich, she was treated as little more than skivvy and she was raped over the course of four days.' She said that Sheikh in particular took advantage of the girl's 'youth and naivety' and she became so attached to him that at first she found it difficult to accuse him of wrong doing. However, forensic examinations proved he had sexual contact with the victim, Miss Karmy-Jones said. She added that, shortly before her abduction, the girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been removed from her mother's care and was living with her father after concerns were raised for her welfare. The alleged attacks took place in a house in Chevallier Street, Ipswich, which had been rented just days before the girl disappeared.","The girl was subjected to a string of assaults over four days .

Mendez would later plead no contest to attempted murder. 'Zeke's the main one. It was Zeke's idea.' Bent, now 17, faces a trial in June on attempted murder charges that carry a potential 30-year prison sentence because a weapon was used. He has pleaded not guilty. Mendez and a third boy, 17-year-old Denver 'D.C.' Jarvis, have already admitted their roles in setting Brewer ablaze and have been sentenced to 11 years and eight years behind bars, respectively. Accused: Michael Bent, 17, faces trial on attempted murder charges that carry a potential 30-year prison sentence because a weapon was used . Police video and audio recordings made by the seven boys involved and several other witnesses give an account of a chance discovery and a split-second decision that almost killed Brewer. As it was, he spent months in the hospital with second- and third-degree burns over more than two-thirds of his body. The chain of events began at a neighborhood park on October 11, 2009 - Brewer's birthday. Bent approached Brewer and demanded that Brewer buy from him a video game based on the Little Mermaid movie. Brewer refused and walked home, with Bent following. Once they reached the Brewer home, police say Bent tried to steal a bicycle and also stood on the street yelling threats at Brewer family members, even challenging Brewer's father to come outside and fight. 'He came to my house. He tried to take my dad's bike. He threatened me. He threatened my sister. He goes, 'Don't worry, I got something for you and your friends, too,'' Brewer told police. 'It was because he wanted me to buy something from him that I didn't want to buy.' Fearing retaliation, Brewer's parents notified school administrators they were keeping him home the following day. A little after school let out at 2:40pm, Brewer decided to walk over to a friend's house. At the same time, Bent was wheeling around the neighborhood on his bicycle. He hadn't gone to school, either. A group of other boys including Jarvis and Mendez were walking home from school near an older, pink-colored apartment complex called Lime Tree Village when they came upon Bent. One of them, Calvin Kenny, said Bent was saying things like 'who snitched on me, who got me locked up? He was, like, mad.' Other boys said Bent offered them $5 each if they would punch Brewer. Then they made a discovery that changed everything. Guilt: Jesus 'Junior' Mendez, left, and Denver 'D.C.' Jarvis, right, have already admitted their part in the attack and are serving sentences . Sitting atop a low wall along the apartment complex's parking lot was a large, clear plastic jug a little more than half filled with liquid. Jarvis, the boy nicknamed 'D.C.', picked it up, twisted off the top and several of the boys took a whiff. 'D.C. opened it and they're like, ""Oh, this is rubbing alcohol  - you all smell it"",' Kenny said. Just then the group spotted Brewer and another boy walking about half a block away. As Jarvis carried the jug, Bent rode his bike over to confront Brewer, accusing him of being a snitch and causing his arrest the day before. 'Michael was telling him, ""I didn't snitch — that was my dad and I told him to stop"",' Mendez said. Bent also repeated his demand for $40 from Brewer. Several of the boys said Brewer agreed to eventually pay and the two of them shook hands. Brewer and another boy walked away, climbing over the low Lime Tree wall into the parking lot. Jarvis and Bent began discussing what to do with the jug of rubbing alcohol. 'That's when they're like, ""We should pour it on him just to mess with him"",' Kenny told police. 'I thought they would pour it on him, kind of soak him, and then run. Just to mess with him.' Most of the boys climbed the wall to follow Brewer, with Bent riding his bike around through a gate. Sister: Malissa Durkee holds a framed photo of her brother Michael Brewer after he was set alight by bullies . Again they confronted Brewer. Bent was in front on his bike. Jarvis, clutching the jug of rubbing alcohol, was behind Brewer, with Mendez to one side. The other boys formed a sort of half-circle. In Mendez's hand was a black lighter. Several of the boys say Bent motioned for Jarvis to pour the liquid on Brewer, who described how it felt at first. 'Just cold stuff all over my clothes,' he said. Then Mendez stuck out his arm and flicked the lighter. 'It was barely close to him and it just lit. It just sparked and the sparks got him and it just lit,' Mendez said. 'The lighter, like, blew up in my hand, kind of.' At that moment, apartment resident Jennifer Nielsen was watching TV with her boyfriend. 'We were watching a zombie movie so that was already enough screaming. And we heard more screaming. It sounded like painful screaming,' Nielsen said. The two of them rushed outside and saw Brewer on fire and running. They yelled that he should stop, drop and roll, but he was heading for an apartment complex pool. He jumped the fence and plunged into the water. The group of boys scattered in several directions. Jarvis dropped the empty rubbing alcohol jug into a garbage can. Brewer tore off his burning shirt, leaving a scorched area in the grass where it landed. The alcohol also ignited a small fire in some bushes. The hair was singed off one of Mendez's arms. Nielsen ran over to where Brewer was in the pool, dialing 911 on a neighbor's cell phone. She coaxed Brewer out of the water. In the background on the call Brewer can be heard screaming in pain. 'He's 15 years old ... and, and his skin is peeling off,' Nielsen told the dispatcher. 'Somebody poured stuff on him.' 'Please help me!' Brewer yelled over and over. Paramedics arrived and Brewer was airlifted to a Miami hospital. It was far from certain that he would survive. Two of the boys went to check on Brewer at the pool, promising him they'd go tell his mother what happened. 'He had burnt skin everywhere,' Kenny said. Leftover: The burnt clothes belonging to Michael Brewer after he was splashed with a flammable liquid. Jury selection will begin on Monday . Rescue: The pool Michael Brewer jumped in after he was splashed with a flammable liquid and set ablaze at the apartment complex in Deerfield Beach, Florida in October 2009 . Investigators quickly learned from Brewer's sister about the dispute with Bent from the day before. They found Bent, Mendez and several others from the group in the backyard of Mendez's house. Bent was arrested, followed in the coming days by Jarvis and Mendez. Only Bent has opted to go to trial, against the advice of his former lawyer who says Bent is being unduly swayed by family members into hoping for an unrealistic outcome. Bent's new lawyer did not respond to a request for comment for this story. 'Matthew Bent still reasons like a child,' the former attorney, Gordon Weekes Jr, wrote in a court filing. 'Matthew Bent harbors the hopes of a child. Matthew Bent still clings to childlike dreams.' Still, University of Miami law professor Mary Anne Franks said it won't be a slam-dunk case for prosecutors. 'One of the things that's difficult about this case is that you actually have to show that Mr Bent has said something. Everything turns on what he actually said, because he didn't commit any physical acts against the victim,' Franks said. Brewer has largely recovered physically from his lengthy hospitalization and rehabilitation. He and his family now live in Palm Beach County. His family did not respond to requests for comment. Because of the widespread media coverage, potential jurors are being pre-screened. Final jury selection is set to begin Monday. The defense will likely try to shift the blame on Jarvis and Mendez. Jarvis put the case succinctly in a brief statement to investigators. 'Lighting somebody on fire, that's pretty much trying to kill somebody,' he said.","Michael Brewer from Florida suffered burns to two-thirds of his body in horrific attack .

"Reggie Bush is the latest athlete to come to the defense of Adrian Peterson in the wake of his indictment on child abuse charges last week, saying he will discipline his own daughter in the same manner Peterson disciplined his son. Appearing today on the Boomer & Carton show, the 29-year-old Detroit Lions running back said Peterson should never have been suspended from league play after getting in trouble for beating his son with a switch. He then added that if his daughter behaved inappropriately, she too would receive a punishment similar to the one Peterson gave his son. Scroll down for video . Peterson protector: Reggie Bush (above, with daughter Briseis) came to the defense of Adrian Peterson in an interview earlier today . Too much?: Bush said he would be sure not to hit his daughter Briseis (left with mother Lilit Avagyan, right with Bush) so hard that she was left bruised like Peterson's son . Bush's daughter Briseis is just one-year-old. 'I have a one-year-old daughter, and I discipline her,' he said during the interview. 'I definitely will try to — will obviously not leave bruises or anything like that on her. But I definitely will discipline her harshly depending on what the situation is.' According to CBS 2 New York, Bush, who used to date Kim Kardashian, was then asked if he would ever hit his daughter with a switch, to which he responded, 'I would possibly consider it, depending on what she did.' Former lovers: Bush used to date reality star Kim Kardashian (both seen above) Bush chalked up his opinion on the subject to the fact that he was disciplined in the same way as Peterson's son when he was younger. This weekend, former NBA star Charles Barkley also defended Peterson, saying the type of punishment the NFL star doled out is common among 'black parents in the South.' One person who is not coming to Peterson's defense however, is Minnesota Vikings Hall of Fame quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who said earlier today he is 'embarrassed' by his former team's decision to allow Peterson back on the field this weekend. 'These are serious accusations,' he told Fox News. 'And the only way you’re going to get the attention of an NFL player is to take away his paycheck and take him off the field. This is way above winning or losing a football game. I strongly disagree with the notion of playing him this week.' Not fans: Former Minnesota Vikings players Fran Tarkenton (left) and Cris Carter (center) said they do not think Peterson (right) should be allowed to play . Former Viking Cris Carter also said that he felt Peterson should not be playing when he appeared on NFL Sunday this weekend. This all stems from an incident last May when Peterson hit his four-year-old son so hard the child was left with bruises and open wounds. Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a $10,000 fine if found guilty.","In an interview today,  Reggie Bush defended Adrian Peterson, saying he would discipline his one-year-old daughter the same way if she misbehaved .

"A spy plane equipped with a thermal imaging camera has found that more than 6,000 outbuildings in one town could be 'beds in sheds' converted by rogue landlords. Slough Borough Council is the first local authority in the country to pay for the specially-adapted aircraft to fly over streets picking up heat from sheds and garages. It spent £24,000 on flights to build up a precise 3D map of every building in the Berkshire town. The results mean thousands could be living there without planning permission or contributing council tax. Welcome to Slough: This thermogram image shows data recovered after flying over the town, with the red representing high levels of heat escaping. The council said the imaging helps them identify outhouses because the cameras can pick up areas of high heat loss - although few can be seen outside the houses in this snippet . Normally: This satellite view from Google Maps shows the area captured by the 3D thermal imaging software in Slough, Berkshire. A school is seen to the right, while the rest of the area is mostly residential . Illegal: Councils want to crack down on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal and often substandard living accommodation, such as this conversion in nearby Slough . The plane criss-crossed streets, picking . up heat signals from outbuildings which could signify they are being . used as ‘sheds with beds’. Analysis . of the images captured in the two-hour night flight has now revealed a . staggering 6,350 suspicious dwellings in the borough. Although . many of the outbuildings are habitable, some are described as being . unsafe, with little or no heating, or do not comply with building or . fire safety regulations. Landlords . face £200 fines and the prospect of their so called 'beds in sheds' being demolished if caught illegally renting them out. Bottom of garden: Large numbers of homes are believed to have converted outbuildings like this one without permission. Thousands could be living in Slough without planning permission or contributing council tax . Spot the difference: A normal map (left) of a street and a school in Slough, Berkshire, and then how it looks with the thermal camera (right). It cost the council £24,000 to send up an aircraft with equipment to make the map . Thermal imaging: Although many of the outbuildings are habitable, some are described as being unsafe, with little or no heating, or do not comply with building or fire safety regulations . The council commissioned aerial imaging . company Bluesky International to produce a thermal map of the town to . target dodgy landlords and people living under the radar. During . a single flight in March they gathered thermal, 3D and aerial images . which allowed officers to pinpoint warm areas in outbuildings. Initial . analysis of the images from just a small part of the town highlighted . 211 buildings that needed further investigation, but a further 6,139 . have now been identified. A . spokesman for the council said the outbuildings do not have planning . permission to be used as accommodation and further checks will now be . carried out to find out if people are living in them.

The plane criss-crossed streets, picking up heat signals from outbuildings . Growing problem: Slough Council estimates there are up to 3,000 'beds in sheds' in the Berkshire town. It has been granted extra Government funding to help improve the condition of houses in multiple occupancy . 'The raw data we've received from . Bluesky is very useful because for the first time it gives us an . accurate figure of the number of outbuildings we have in the borough . that we need to investigate,' said Ray Haslam, head of environmental . services and resilience at Slough Borough Council. 'This certainly gives us a good starting point and we've already started investigative work' Ray Haslam, Slough Borough Council . 'People may well be using their . outbuildings for legitimate purposes, so we don't want to rush into . assumptions that they're all being used for housing, but this certainly . gives us a good starting point and we've already started investigative . work.' Slough Borough Council has been . granted extra Government funding to help improve the condition of houses . in multiple occupancy and reduce the number of beds in sheds. A project team has been set up who . will liaise with other agencies such as the police, Fire and Rescue . service, Home Office and HMRC as part of the clamp down. Cut backs: People living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them - so town halls use thermal imaging to find them . Out the back: Some of the buildings uncovered in Slough may be allowed to remain a dwelling but others will be demolished. The council spent thousands sending up an aircraft with thermal-imaging equipment . A . spokesman for the authority said those found living in illegal . accommodation will be offered help finding somewhere else to live and . welfare advice.

"A pair of Danish artists have created a magical chandelier that turns a room into a forest using a trick of the light. Vast leafy shadows are thrown onto the . walls as light shines through the mirrored sculpture, while different . types of woodland can be created by turning the dimmer switch up and . down. Thyra Hilden and Pio Diaz are the creative brains behind the Forms in Nature light sculpture, which was inspired by the drawings of German naturalist, Ernst Haeckel. Scroll down for video . Spectacular: Hilden & Diaz' Forms in Nature sculpture creates a virtual forest on the walls of a room . Magical: The artwork creates a network of shadowy roots and gnarled trees using light . Stylish: The designer duo say they expect the chandelier to go on sale in a few months time . 'Using a simple action, such as intensifying the brightness at the centre of the artwork, the light transforms the space and adds character, as the work throws oversized shadows onto walls and ceilings in the space in which it hangs,' say the duo on their website. 'As the intensity of the light source increases, the room changes and the space slowly becomes more and more fascinating and uncanny. 'The shadow engulfs the room and transforms the walls into unruly shadows of branches, bushes and gnarled trees.' The piece is made from specially made hardened plastic powder which can withstand the heat from the LED lamp. Components were then created using the computer and built with a 3D printer. 'When we did Forms In Nature we were very much inspired by the German biologist and artist Ernst Haeckel, who did astonishing work in cataloguing both plants and animals,' Diaz told MailOnline. 'We fell in love with the vastness of nature and how insignificant and consumed man can feel in the face of roaring seas, deep forests and the endless sky. 'The work of the German painter Casper Friedrich and his romantic depiction of man facing the immensity of the wild was also a great source of inspiration to us. 'With Forms In Nature we wanted to create much the same feeling one might have when standing in a magnificent forest surrounded by nature. 'What I like about Forms In Nature is that you are not looking at the art-piece, but rather you are present in it and surrounded by it through the light and the shadows.' Elaborate: The delicate sculpture was inspired by the drawings of German naturalist, Ernst Haeckel . The designers, who have worked in partnership since 2005, say their focus is on transformation and paradoxes - a philosophy that also informs their other works. Among them is City of Fire, a video installation that involved setting famous monuments virtually ablaze, and Bubble - an artistic attempt to preserve a soap bubble forever. 'For many years it has been of our interest to question the cultural structures through destructive forces such as fire,' say the pair. 'Lately, our interest has shifted to its radical pole, that is, how to preserve the most fragile things existing despite all odds.' Although the piece is not available to buy commercially, the pair say the sculpture can be ordered individually via email. To see more of Hilden & Diaz' artworks, go to hildendiaz.dk.

"Donald Sterling has reportedly been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease which may be the reason why control of the LA Clippers has been handed over to his estranged wife Shelly. It was reported today that the contractual agreement that governs the team dictates that, since he and Shelly each own half of the team, their health has to be ruled sufficient to rationally lead the team and Donald has been deemed mentally unfit. The disgraced owner is also suing the NBA for $1bn over the way the aftermath of his race row as been handled. The terms of the deal mandates that in order for one of them to be ruled incompetent, two doctors have to agree on the individual's health and apparently that has happened to Sterling. Company you keep: The scandal began when a love interest of Sterlings taped a racism-filled phone conversation (Sterling seen here with and unidentified woman on Wednesday) Mental health: Two doctors reportedly diagnosed Donald Sterling with Alzheimer's disease which resulted in his wife Shelly being given full control of their previously-jointly-owned team . The 80-year-old is believed to have met with two unidentified 'prominent neurologists' earlier this month and they both concurred that he had Alzheimer's disease. Their diagnosis stipulated that he may have had the degenerative neurological disease for up to five years. There are a number of implications beyond the disgraced team owner's health that come with the diagnosis. TMZ reports that the terms of the trust agreement that controls the team stipulates that if either of the Sterlings shows 'an inability to conduct business affairs in a reasonable and normal manner' then they will have their controlling stake taken away. That may explain how, in spite of his earlier declarations in the immediate aftermath of the release of his racist recording, he handed over his controlling stake to his wife. However, his legal team could use the diagnosis to help him get it back by arguing that the decision to hand over the team should be invalidated because of his illness. Out in public and out of his job: The bylines of the trust that was set up to control the team stipulate that if two doctors deem one of the owner's health puts the team at risk, then they will be forced to hand over their portion (Sterling pictured on May 27) Though the family has not confirmed these reports, it would fit with Shelly Sterling's earlier statements that she was concerned that her husband had dementia since Alzheimer's is a cause of that condition. Earlier this month, she told Barbara Walters that when she asked Donald about the recordings, he said: 'I don't remember saying that. I don't remember ever saying those things.' '(Steve Ballmer) knocked their socks off, they bonded, had a good connection' -an unidentified individual with knowledge about the LA Clippers sale negotiations . 'I said, ""Well, this is the tape."" And he says, ""Hmm. I don't remember it."" That's when I thought he had dementia,' Shelly said during the interview. It is also not the first time that his health has come into question since there were also earlier unconfirmed reports that Sterling has prostate cancer. The news about his Alzheimer's diagnosis comes hours after it was announced that Shelly has signed a deal with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer agreeing that he will buy the team for $2billion. Shelly Sterling said in a statement issued late Thursday that she'd signed a binding contract for a sale of the Clippers by The Sterling Family Trust to Ballmer in what would be a record deal if approved by the NBA. Ballmer 'will be a terrific owner,' Sterling said. 'We have worked for 33 years to build the Clippers into a premier NBA franchise. I am confident that Steve will take the team to new levels of success.' Basketball fan: Steve Ballmer, pictured here in January shaking the hand of basketball icon Bill Russell at a college game, said that he is excited to own the beleaguered franchise . Microsoft money: Ballmer was the CEO of the computer company from January 2000 until February of this year (pictured at the annual shareholder meeting in November) Shelly Sterling's statement noted that she made the deal 'under her authority as the sole trustee of The Sterling Family Trust, which owns the Clippers'. Donald Sterling's attorneys contend that he is a co-owner and therefore must give his assent for the deal to go through. They also say he won't be giving it. 'Sterling is not selling the team,' said his attorney, Bobby Samini. 'That's his position. He's not going to sell.' Ballmer beat out bids by Guggenheim Partners and a group including former NBA All-Star Grant Hill after presenting an 'all-around superior bid,' according to an individual with knowledge of the negotiations. The individual, who wasn't authorized to speak publicly, said Ballmer made more than an hour-long personal visit to Shelly Sterling's Malibu home Sunday and laid out his plan. 'He knocked their socks off, they bonded, had a good connection,' the individual said. The amount was also the largest of the offers, and Ballmer was one potential buyer to deal with rather than numerous members of a group. Woman at the center: Sterling was talking to V. Stiviano (pictured today) when he made the racist remarks . Ballmer said in a statement that he is honored to have his name submitted to the NBA for approval and thanked the league for working collaboratively with him throughout the process. 'I love basketball. And I intend to do everything in my power to ensure that the Clippers continue to win — and win big — in Los Angeles,' Ballmer said. 'LA is one of the world's great cities — a city that embraces inclusiveness, in exactly the same way that the NBA and I embrace inclusiveness.' On Thursday, Magic Johnson lauded the deal on his Twitter account: 'Steve Ballmer owning the Clippers is a big win for the City of LA and all the people who live in the City of Angels!' Though Donald Sterling's attorneys now say he won't agree to sell the team, a May 22 letter obtained by The Associated Press and written by another of Sterling's attorneys that says that 'Donald T. Sterling authorizes Rochelle Sterling to negotiate with the National Basketball Association regarding all issues in connection with a sale of the Los Angeles Clippers team.' It includes the line 'read and approved' and Donald Sterling's signature. Samini said Sterling has had a change of heart primarily because of 'the conduct of the NBA.' He said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's decision to ban Sterling for life and fine him $2.5million as well as to try to oust him as an owner was him acting as 'judge, jury and executioner.' 'They're telling me he should stand back and let them take his team because his opinion on that particular day was not good, was not popular?' Samini said. 'It doesn't make sense. He's going to fight.' She's the boss: Shelly Sterling (pictured in 2008) was put in charge of brokering the deal . It's unclear how the agreement will affect a special hearing of NBA owners planned for Tuesday in New York to consider the charge against Donald Sterling for damaging the league with his comments. A three-quarters vote of the 30 owners to support the charge would have resulted in the termination of both Sterlings' ownership of the franchise. The deal is expected to be presented to the league before Tuesday, according to the individual. Silver has said his preference would be for the franchise to be sold rather than seized — and that means sold in its entirety, with neither Sterling retaining a stake. Though according to the deal's terms Ballmer will own 100 percent of the team, Shelly Sterling may continue to be involved under conditions worked out privately with Ballmer, the individual said. Franchise sale prices have soared since the current collective bargaining agreement was ratified in 2011. The Milwaukee Bucks were just sold to New York investment firm executives Marc Lasry and Wesley Edens for about $550 million, an NBA record. Last year, Vivek Ranadive's group acquired a 65 per cent controlling interest in the Sacramento Kings at a total franchise valuation of more than $534million. This is not Ballmer's first foray into potential NBA ownership. Ballmer and investor Chris Hansen headed a group that agreed to a deal to buy the Kings from the Maloof family in January 2013 with the intention of moving the team to Seattle, where the SuperSonics played until 2008. But Sacramento Mayor Kevin Johnson lobbied the NBA for time to put together a bid to keep the team in California, and though the Ballmer-Hansen group later increased its offer, owners voted to deny the bid for relocation and the Kings were sold to Ranadive. The former Microsoft CEO helped Bill Gates transform the company from a startup with fewer than 40 employees and $12million in annual revenue into the world's most valuable business. The pair met in 1973 while living down the hall from each other in a Harvard dorm. During his tenure at Microsoft, Ballmer was known for his competitive drive and wild displays of emotion and hand-waving. At his farewell address to Microsoft employees, he high-fived and hugged audience members, pumped his fists in the air, and even shed tears as the popular 1987 song '(I've Had) The Time of My Life' played on the sound system. In a video of the event widely viewed on YouTube, he screams: 'You work for the greatest company in the world!'","Terms of the team's ownership trust mandates that two independent doctors had to declare him 'mentally incapacitated'

"A British helicopter pilot who performed one of the most daring rescues of the Afghanistan war is selling his gallantry medal to raise £100,000. Captain Tom O’Malley flew his Apache gunship into a Taliban stronghold with two Royal Marines strapped to the side in an extraordinary bid to save a wounded comrade. He flew the helicopter ship at 60mph then hovered just 20ft above a heavily-defended Taliban fort. Scroll down for video . Heroic: Captain Tom O'Malley, pictured right, flew an Apache attack helicopter into a Taliban stronghold to rescue a wounded comrade in one of the Afghanistan war's most dramatic missions . Hero: Captain O'Malley received a Distinguished Flying Cross for the daring raid under heavy enemy fire . Despite machine gun fire, incoming grenades and blinding dust whipped up by his rotor blades, Captain O’Malley landed in the compound. The two marines leapt from the helicopter and plucked Royal Marine Lance Corporal Mathew Ford from the fortress, allowing Captain O'Malley to fly him out again with minutes to spare. Lance Corporal Ford had been captured after a botched retreat which left him seriously wounded by friendly fire. Despite his comrades' selfless rescue, his wounds were too severe and he later died. However, the bravery of his volunteer rescuers was still commended, as it avoided the need for a ground rescue, which could have led to more casualties. Captain O'Malley was awarded the prestigious Distinguished Flying Cross for the action, which his superiors said was conducted with a ‘calculated disregard for his own safety... in the face of a lethal and determined enemy’. Medal haul: Captain O'Malley's Distinguished Flying Cross, left, is accompanied by a host of long service and campaign medals from his lengthy military career . Service: The medals show a long career involving stints in Yugoslavia, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan . Audacious: The above footage shows Captain O'Malley flying the Apache, into the compound, a marine strapped on each side . A pilot of a second Apache also received the DFC and the marines involved the Military Cross. Until now the identities of those involved in the mission have not been revealed. Captain O’Malley, 47, resigned his commission last year following 27 years army service and is now a civilian flying instructor. He has put his medal set up for auction for a pre-sale estimate of £100,000 pounds. His awards also include long service medals, and campaign awards for serving in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland and the former Yugoslavia. Steven Bosley, of Bosleys Auctioneers in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, said: 'He has decided it is time to sell his medals. 'He has left the army and has a chance to start a new life and I dare say this money will help with that.' Captain O’Malley was sent on his second tour of Afghanistan in November 2006 and flew Apache Attack Helicopters with 656 Squadron Army Air Corps. On January 15, 2007, he was tasked with providing air support to around 200 Royal Marines in an assault on the Jugroom Fort in Garmisr, Southern Helmand. In a desperately confusing situation, Lance Corporal Ford was hit by machine gun fire from one of his allies. Military kit: The medals are pictured above on top of Captain O'Malley's flying suit, which he wore for combat . The fellow solider had mistaken the flash of a hand grenade for enemy gunfire, and shot back, wounding Lance Corporal Ford. The commandos withdrew but in the confusion left the mortally-wounded L/Cpl Ford in the compound and at risk of falling into enemy hands. Another helicopter spotted the marine’s body giving off a heat signal which indicated he was still alive. The four Apache helicopters fired at the Taliban to keep them away from the stricken marine while a rescue plan was worked out. Captain O’Malley came up with the suggestion of landing in the compound with two marines strapped to the helicopter, the first time such a mission had ever been carried out. After touching down inside the fort the two marines disembarked, leaving Capt O’Malley and the Apache exposed to the enemy which bombarded the Apache with fire. Captain O’Malley fired back with his cannon and directed air support cover before the marines returned with Lance Corporal Ford four minutes later. It later emerged that the marine received two bullet wounds to the arm and chest from friendly fire and a ricochet shot to the head from a Taliban bullet. It had been suggested Captain O’Malley might have faced a Court Martial as the mission had only tentatively been approved by his Commanding Officer. But upon their return to base the Royal Marines immediately recommended all the Apache pilots for gallantry medals, which saved their careers. Bernard Pass, from Bosleys, said: 'This was the most famous British helicopter action ever carried out, like something from a Hollywood film.

"An American doctor who survived Ebola recounted the details of his horrifying experience to a congressional committee today on Capitol Hill as part of a bid to raise awareness about the deadly disease. As a medical professional, Dr. Kent Brantly told Senators he 'witnessed the horror that this disease visits upon its victims.' But after contracting the disease himself in late July while treating Ebola in Liberia, Brantly said he came to understand first-hand the suffering of his patients. 'I was isolated and unsure if I would ever see my family again,' he said. 'Even though I knew most of my care givers, I could see nothing but their eyes through their protective goggles when they came to treat me. 'I experienced the humiliation of losing control of my bodily functions, and I faced the horror of vomiting blood, a sign of the internal bleeding that could have led to my death.' Scroll down for video . Ebola survivor Dr. Kent Brantly, the former medical director for Samaritan's Purse Ebola Care Center in Monrovia, Liberia, recalled his near-death experience with the virus to Senators today during a hearing in Washington, D.C. Brantly's recovery from the virus is somewhat of a mystery. Doctors have been unable to determine whether an experimental drug, a blood transfusion from another Ebola survivor, specialized care at a medical facility in Atlanta, Georgia, or a combination of all three saved his life. What is evident from his appearance at a joint meeting of the Senate health and appropriations committees is that that he is fully rehabilitated. Sen. Barbara Mikulski noted Brantly's remarkable recovery during the afternoon hearing, noting how happy the committee was to see him. 'What's so great about seeing you Dr. Brantly is one, that you're well enough to be here. You were well enough to travel here,' Mikulski, a senior Democrat on the committee, said. 'And you're well enough that we're not afraid to have you here. And we can smile, but this is a stunning, stunning, stunning accomplishment!' The bipartisan group of Senators weren't the only U.S. leaders who were brave enough to meet with Brantly during his trip to Washington. President Barack Obama also sat down with the Ebola survivor on Tuesday afternoon in the White House before leaving Washington for a trip to visit a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility in Georgia. The White House did not release details on the meeting but it did share a photo of a smiling Brantly and his wife Amber sitting in the Oval Office with the president. 'I had the privilege and honor of meeting with President Obama this morning and we discussed his commitment of more military and medical resources to fight this epidemic,' Brantly told Senators in his opening statement. 'I thanked him for entering this battle with us in a larger way.' The White House released this photo of President Barack Obama meeting with Dr. Brantly and his wife, Amber, during an Oval Office drop by this morning . Brantly said it was 'imperative' that the president follow through on his plans to send 3,000 troops to Liberia and to establish a military control center for coordination, as well as his proposal to build 17 new treatment centers for Ebola and hold training for medical professionals in the country. Up to this point, the U.S. government's response to the outbreak has 'remained sluggish and unacceptably out of step with with the scope and the size of the problem that is now before us,' Brantly testified. The disease has already infected close to 5,000 West Africans and roughly half of them have died. 'As a survivor, it is not only my privilege, but it is my duty to speak out on behalf of the people of West Africa who continue to face unspeakable devastation because of this horrific disease,' Brantly told the senators. Brantly warned that Liberia would not be able 'to turn the tide on the disease' without the $88 million the president has requested from Congress to fight Ebola, including $58 million that would go toward creating more of the antiviral drug that Brantly received and another drug believed to be a vaccine. 'We cannot wait, however, for a magic bullet to halt the spread of this virus in West Africa,' he said. 'The current epidemic is beyond anything we have seen before, and it's time to think outside the box.' Dr. Brantly said that communities must be educated on how to properly care for someone who contracts Ebola because many patients in West Africa are staying home, where their families either abandon them or care for them in ways that 'almost always results in infection of the caregivers.' 'This is a major contributor to the spread of Ebola and we cannot contain the disease with addressing this problem head on,' he said. Brantly shared the story of one of his patients who contracted the disease from a man whose wife was committed to getting him care regardless of the risk. When no one else would help her, Brantly said his patient, Francis, helped put the man in a taxi. In the process, Francis contracted Ebola and died on the way to the hospital. 'If someone had come alongside Francis and given him a little bit of education and provided him with the personal protective equipment he needed, his family would still have their father, their son, and their brother, and the world might still have this good Samaritan,' Brantly said. Noting that some government officials had described Ebola as a fast-moving forest fire, Brantly told the Senators, 'Indeed it is a fire.' 'It is a fire straight from the pit of hell,' he said, choking up. 'We cannot fool ourselves into thinking that the vast mode of the Atlantic ocean will protect us from the flames of this fire,' he continued. 'Instead, we must move quickly and immediately to deliver the promises that have been made and to be open to practical innovative interventions. This is the only way to keep entire nations from being reduced to ashes.' In remarks of his own on the Ebola epidemic this afternoon President Obama said the United States cannot 'dawdle' in responding to the medical crisis. If the federal government does not act quickly to stop the outbreak, 'we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected, with profound economic and security implications for all of us,' Obama said in a speech outside the CDC center in Atlanta. 'It's not a mystery. We know the science. We know how to prevent it from spreading. We know how to care for those who contract it. We know that if we take the proper steps, we can save lives,' Obama said. 'The world is looking to the United States, and it’s a responsibility we embrace.'","Dr. Kent Brantly contracted the disease in late July while treating Ebola patients in Liberia; he has since recovered .

"Two vets 150 miles apart told of shocking animal abuse cases today which saw one kitten hurled from a car window and two more abandoned in a bush. Ten-week-old Hammond had to have his face stitched together and smashed teeth removed after being thrown from a vehicle near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire. And in South Shields, South Tyneside, Raymond and Wonder may never see again after being abandoned and developing a severe eye infection. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Ten-week-old kitten Hammond was thrown from a moving car last week in one of two horrific cases . Horror: In a separate case also revealed by vets today, siblings Raymond and Wonder could lose their sight . The haunting cases, both revealed today, prompted fresh warnings to animal owners never to abandon their pets - and even to burden charities and kennels with them instead. The two cases were also revealed today alongside that of Matt the Cat, a moggy so neglected he had to be completely shaved and have his rotting teeth removed in Kilburn High Road, north London. In the first case, vets have revealed photos of ten-week-old kitten Hammond after he had to have his face stitched together. The black cat suffered deep cuts to his nose and shattered teeth after being thrown from the window of a moving car on the A46 last week near Market Rasen, Lincolnshire. He underwent painstaking surgery to remove all his broken teeth, including two canines that had been pushed into his jaw. It is thought the people in the car he was thrown from had hoped the vehicle behind would run him over. Injured: It is believed Hammond's owners intended the car behind them to run him over. Instead, the driver swerved in time, picked the cat off the road and rushed with it covered in blood to the nearest vet's surgery . Vet Laura Morrell said: 'His nose was hardly recognisable and many of his teeth had been shattered on impact' Instead the driver collected Hammond from the roadside before taking him to the rescue centre, covered in blood. Laura Morrell, assistant manager at the Ark Animal Rescue Centre in North Somercotes, Lincolnshire, said: 'His face was in a really bad way. 'His nose was hardly recognisable and many of his teeth had been shattered upon impact with the road. 'He’s a very lucky boy though. If the car behind had not swerved he would have gone straight under their wheels. 'Thankfully he has recovered well from both operations. It’s nice to know that, in a world where such devastating animal cruelty exists, there are still so many animal lovers out there.' Hammond's plight was so desperate that he has already been adopted - but the rescue centre still needs more information to bring a prosecution against his attackers. In the second case, meanwhile, three-month-olds Raymond and Wonder may have to have their eyes removed after being abandoned by the seafront in South Shields, South Tyneside. Looking for a home: In a second case revealed today, three-month-old siblings Raymond and Wonder may have to have their eyes removed after being abandoned by the seafront in South Shields, South Tyneside . Vet Suzanne Hickmott said: 'They are beautiful. Wonder is likely to lose both eyes, and Raymond will lose one' The kitten siblings were discovered cowering in a bush by dog walkers and are now looking for a new home, despite having severe eye infections. Suzanne Hickmott, who works at Pets 4 Vets in South Shields, South Tyneside, said: 'The kittens are now being taken care of and are being given eye drops daily. They are eating and drinking and doing quite well. 'They are beautiful little things. Wonder is likely to lose both eyes, and Raymond will lose one, but they are both affectionate, lovely and friendly animals. 'It has been very distressing for both of these animals, and now we are concentrating on getting the cats ready for the operation and then finding them a new home.' She added: 'We are hoping that it will be a happy ending for these two now, but if they hadn’t have been found they could easily have died. 'There is never any reason to just dump an animal, as people who can’t cope can always call the RSPCA or other charities who offer shelter for cats.' Abused: The pair of kittens were found cowering in a bush by a passing dog walker and were rescued . Compassionate: Student vet Emma Brown with Raymond and Wonder.

"Sharon West texted a friend at 5.20am before her cellphone died . Texas rancher found skull in an empty canal close to town where she went missing . The body parts of a missing teenage girl have been found scattered across a field, authorities confirmed. Investigators said the remains found in a field last October belonged to Sharon West, 14, who went missing on July 30. The girl had been staying with a family friend when she went missing in Fannett, Texas, a small town of around 100 people, an hour north of Houston. A rancher called authorities three months . later to report he had found a human skull in an empty canal on his . property close to the town. Tragic outcome: The remains of Sharon West, 14, who was missing for six months, were found in a field in Fannett, Texas, close to where she was staying with a friend . The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office confirmed last Friday that the remains were of Sharon West, who had been identified using dental records. The girl's mother Sandra West confirmed that pyjama shorts and glasses found with the remains belonged to her daughter. An autopsy was underway to determine the teenager's cause of death along with toxicology reports. Missing: Sharon West as a child (left) and a more recent picture of the teenager . The night before she went missing, Miss West's boyfriend, Austin Meaux, said he had last seen her at the home of the family friend whom she had been living with on a short-term basis while her mother looked for work. He told police that he was still at the home after the rest of the family went to bed at 2am. The last contact with Miss West was at 5.20am when she texted a friend to say she was at a soccer field, a few miles from where she was staying. The spot was a popular hang-out for young people. She sent another text 40 minutes later before the signal for her cellphone died. Desperate search: Sharon West had been missing for six months when police confirmed that the remains found scattered in a Texas field belonged to her . Sandra West had set up a Facebook page while her daughter was missing. On October 20, the mother wrote: 'Sharon has been missing since July 30, 2011. She literally just vanished. There are so many stories, rumors, and scenarios about her disappearance. 'None of that matters. The only thing that matters is finding her. She has family and friends that love and miss her terribly.' A memorial service for Sharon West will be held on January 28 in Hamshire, Texas.","Sharon West texted a friend at 5.20am before her cellphone died .

"Many would say it was a health hazard that causes crippling breathing problems not to mention a serious vitamin D deficiency. But China's naval chief has found a rather more positive side to the country's awful pollution. The smog, he says, provides an effective barrier against the emerging threat of laser weaponry. Scroll Down for Video . China¿s 20 years of rapid growth has seen harmful toxins spewed relentlessly from coal burning factories and millions of cars ¿ 1500 new vehicles drive onto Beijing¿s gridlocked roads every day . Cars can barely be seen through the smog as they drive along a road in Beijing after a hazardous blanket enveloped the city . Star Wars weaponry: A high-speed camera captures the first full-energy shots from an electromagnetic launcher which the U.S. Navy plans to deploy on one of its ships this year . PLA Navy Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong, a military expert at the National Defence University, spoke days after it was reported that the US Navy planned to deploy its first laser weapon aboard one of its ships in the Middle East. He said lasers were 'most afraid of smog' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired. 'Under conditions where there is no smog, a laser weapon can fire (at a range of) 10 kilometres,' he told CCTV’s Haixia Liangan (Cross-Straits) current affairs program, according to www.news.com.au. 'When there’s smog, it’s only one kilometre. What's the point of making this kind of weapon?' New threat: A laser weapon aboard the destroyer USS Dewey in San Diego in this picture from 2012 . Chinese Rear Admiral Zhang Zhaozhong said lasers were 'most afraid of smog' because it severely hampers the distance it can be fired . Admiral Zhang explained that smog is made up of tiny metallic particles which make it harder for the lasers to penetrate. The smog in Beijing is now so thick that it is blocking sunlight despite recent announced closures or production cuts at 147 of the city's industrial plants. Yesterday, it was reported that a Chinese man was suing the government for failing to halt air pollution after he was forced to buy a treadmill to exercise indoors. Li Guixin, from Shijiazhuang in Hebei province, claims the authorities have failed to control the increasing smog, which has forced him to spend money on face masks and an air purifier as well as the treadmill. His lawsuit was filed as readings of PM2.5, a key measure of pollution, reached 444 micrograms per cubic meter in the capital of Beijing, nearly 18 times the safe level.

"A doberman has stunned her owners by delivering a litter of 13 puppies despite vets saying she was only pregnant with six. Gina's owners Mark and Olga Holtom compared the huge litter to '101 Dalmatians' but with each pup worth up to £1,000, they have received an unexpected windfall. The couple decided to breed their family pet in January and chose an award-winning dog called Storm to father her pups. Scroll down for video . Proud mother: Gina the Doberman was believed to only be carrying six when she had her scan . Adorable: The 13 five-week-old Doberman puppies left owners Mark and Olga Holtom stunned . Windfall: Mark and Olga Holtom expect to sell each puppy for up to £1,000 but want to keep one in the house . Two-year-old Gina fell pregnant and vets did a scan at six months and told Mr and Mrs Holtom to expect a litter of half a dozen - warning only half were likely to live. The couple left Gina at home last month when they popped out for an hour and returned to find she had already given birth to three puppies. Over the next six hours they helped deliver a total of nine puppies on the floor of their kitchen in Offton, Suffolk. Convinced exhausted Gina had finished giving birth, Mr Holtom popped to his local pub for his weekly Wednesday night drink with friends. But when he returned home two hours later, he was told by his wife that she had helped Gina deliver another four puppies - taking the final total to 13. The puppies have all survived and are now five weeks old and have been named after types of storm and natural phenomena in honour of their father. They are called Tempest, Zephyr, Hale, Alize, Blizzard, Aiolos, Aurora, Kazahana, Auster, Talvi and Storm. Pint sized: The size of the litter of pups has been compared to 101 Dalmatians by their owners . Cute: Two of the sweet puppies cuddle up as they pose in the Wellies . Basket full: Seven of the puppies, born to Gina and Storm, have already been sold . The only two to not have weather-related names are Istas and Amaya-A, which IT businessman Mr Holtom , 57, has named after computer programmes. He said: 'At the time of the scan they were only 2.5cm long so it was difficult to put a definite number on how many we would get. 'We came home and there were two puppies already and one more hanging out. 'Gina looked terrified because she was worried that she had made such a mess and we would be angry. 'Then she kept going pop, pop, pop for the next nine hours. 'After six of the puppies had been delivered we went for a cup of tea and then we looked at Gina and there were seven puppies, then eight, then nine. 'After that there was about an hour with no activity so I went out because Wednesday night is drinking night with the lads. 'I came back two hours later and my wife said ""guess what - there's 13"". Loveable: Mr Holtom said they were worried for Gina but that she has been 'very calm and motherly' Motherly instinct: Gina groomed all the puppies despite being exhausted from the mammoth labour . Midwife: Olga Holtom, pictured left with her husband, help Gina deliver the litter. Experts said it is 'very very rare' for a Doberman to have a litter of that size . 'At the end Gina was absolutely exhausted and was like a skeleton. She struggles to feed them all at the same time. 'It was getting like the 101 Dalmatians.

"Trumped up criminal charges, bad press - it's all part of a scheme to get him out of office, New York Congressman Michael Grimm says. 'There’s no question: I’ve been vilified by the press since the day I got here,' Grimm told Politico in an interview. 'From the very beginning they had to figure out how to get rid of this guy.' Grimm accused the media of focusing on 'ridiculous nonsense,' but the former Marine and Federal Bureau of Investigation agent would not say he was innocent of the charges filed against him by the federal government. 'You know, uh. It depends on what you’re asking me of,' he said. Rep. Michael Grimm, pictured here on Memorial Day meeting with veterans, is under investigation by the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorney's office in New York . The only thing Grimm said he was 'guilty' of was being a good congressman . '[My constituents] are behind me now more than ever, because I get results,' Grimm said in a recent interview . In April Grimm was indicted in Federal Court on 20 counts of criminal charges, including wire fraud, mail fraud, conspiring to defraud the U.S., impeding the IRS, hiring and employing unauthorized aliens and health care fraud. Prosecutors say Grimm underreported more than $1 million in sales and wages for workers at a healthy food restaurant he owned before he was elected to Congress in 2010 and lied about it in a deposition. The restauranteur reportedly paid legal and illegal employees of eatery Healthalicious under the table so he could avoid paying taxes on the restaurant's revenue. At his hearing this month, Grimm pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on $400,000 bond. He has claimed prosecutors were trying to 'assassinate my character' by leaking 'all kinds of innuendos and accusations to support a political witch hunt.' 'I know I'm a moral man, a man of integrity,' he said. 'And I also know I have a lot more service and leadership to provide this country, and that's exactly what I intend to do.' 'I'm going to fight tooth and nail until I am exonerated.' Meanwhile, prosecutors say they have thousands of emails proving Grimm is guilty. 'Rep. Grimm billed himself as a patriot and an American hero,' George Venizelos, head of the FBI's New York office, said. 'But Rep. Grimm was anything but an upstanding citizen. He cheated, evaded and then lied.' The federal charges filed against Grimm last month may not be the last of the Congressman's legal woes. Feds indicated at Grimm's hearing that they may add charges to Grimm's docket. The Staten Island congressman was originally under suspicion of violating campaign fiance laws. The government believed Grimm received illegal, overseas contributions during his first congressional race. An ex-girlfriend of the congressman's, Diana Durand, has been indicted on charges in that investigation. She allegedly used straw donors to funnel the money to Grimm's campaign, the FBI says. Grimm is . also under investigation by the House Ethics committee. That . investigation is currently on hold, however, at the request of the . Department on Justice. Grimm walks into a Brooklyn Federal Court hearing after being indicted on 20 counts of criminal charges . When asked . about the federal investigation by local news reporter Michael Scotto in January, . Grimm told him, 'If you ever do that to me again, I'll throw you off this f****** balcony.' The Congressman admitted to Politico that the media wasn't responsible for the political storm that followed the confrontation. 'My misstep with Michael Scotto, that’s on me,' Grimm said. 'I screwed up.' Grimm said he just felt like the interview was more 'nonsense' and the question was a 'cheap shop.' The two-term Congressman has blamed the media throughout his legal drama for making more hay than necessary out of his troubles. 'Look, I’ll sum it up. What do I think . of the press? I think, right now, and it’s been this way for two years: . If I pass a burning building, and I stop and I run in and I save a baby, . you know what the headline will be? ""Grimm starts the fire,"" ' he . claimed. 'That’s just the reality.' 'Bad boy' of Congress? Not all, Grimm says. He's only aggressive because he tired of his constituents getting 'screwed' Grimm said reports that he's the 'bad . boy' of Congress are ridiculous. He said he's merely trying to make . sure his congressional district gets its fair share. 'I don’t care what the . papers write, ' Grimm told Politico, 'I’m aggressive, quite frankly, because Staten Island gets . screwed all the time.' 'And if I’m not aggressive, then I won’t be . successful,' he said. 'That’s not being a bad boy. That’s doing my job.' Grimm went on to say in the interview that his 'style, granted, is to break eggs, to step on toes.' 'I didn’t take this job to make a political future or career,' he continued. The New York City Congressman . maintains that the government's allegations about his business are a way . to nail him in lieu of the campaign finance violations they've been . unable to make stick legally. He's refused to vacate his Congressional seat and is running for reelection because he is so confident he won't end up doing time. Earlier this week his campaign manager quit, so Grimm decided to run his own political operation. He told Politico he would spend his time meeting with 'friends and family' rather than running a traditional  political campaign. That's all he needs to do get re-elected, he insisted. '[My constituents] are behind me now more than ever, because I get results,' Grimm said. 'And yet the press focuses on the most ridiculous nonsense that I can dream about.' After . hedging on the question of his innocence of criminal wrongdoing, Grimm said there's only one thing he'll admit he's guilty of: being a good Congressman. 'What I’m guilty . of is trying the hardest and giving 100 percent of myself and putting my . heart and soul into representing the people of Staten Island and . Brooklyn.'","Michael Grimm was indicted on 20 counts of criminal charges last month .

"For transgender Cubans, life on the Island of Freedom has long been a struggle - a daily battle against poverty and entrenched discrimination. But as a new book of photographs titled TransCuba shows, there is now a light at the end of the tunnel for the island's fledgling LGBT community. Mariette Pathy Allen, a New York-based artist and photographer, has spent the past 35 years documenting and advocating for transgender people in U.S. In 2012, Allen attended a symposium in Cuba about transgender identify and culture organized by Mariela Castro Espin, head of the Cuba National Center of Sex Education - and the daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro.

Hard living: Amanda, a 36-year-old HIV-positive prostitute, tried twice to get to the U.S., and twice failed. She was taken to Guantanamo Bay, where she begged her captors to return her to Havana . Allen . decided to spend some time in Havana following the conference, and in . her travels she befriended a pair of transgender cabaret performers, . Amanda and Nomi. Allen's . new friends introduced her to the local transgender community, which . she began documenting by taking pictures of the women in the privacy of . their homes, at work and interacting with friends and family. The . veteran photographer said initially she had no plans to turn her . snapshots into a large-scale project, but after she showed some of her . work at Fotofest in  Houston, she was approached by the publishing house . Daylight Books about doing a book shining a spotlight on Cuba's . transgender community. Allen . made two subsequent trips to Cuba, traveling around the capital and . beyond and documenting life from the point of view of transgender . people. Allen's striking images featured in TransCuba show most of her subjects living below the poverty line. Under .

Under . Castro, Cuba's LGBT community has slowly begun coming out of the . shadows, with the president’s own daughter, Castro Espin, emerging as a . leading advocate for the rights of gay and transgender people. It . was Castro Espin who in 2008 persuaded the Cuban government to legalize . gender reassignment surgery, but transgender people still face . discrimination in the workforce, and many turn to prostitution to eke . out a meagre living. ‘I . see transgender Cubans as a metaphor for Cuba itself: people living . between genders in a country moving between doctrines,’ Allen writes. Mariette . Pathy Allen's transgender women are strong and optimistic about the . future, but they continue to face great challenges, from HIV to lack of . work and deep-seated intolerance pervading Cuba’s society.

"Two men, including a member of the KKK, have been arrested after trying to build a portable X-ray machine to allegedly kill President Obama and Muslims. Glendon Scott Crawford, 49, and Eric J. Feight have been charged with conspiracy to provide support to . terrorists after allegedly creating a remote-controlled device that . could emit lethal doses of radiation. The men were caught after a year long undercover FBI operation, which began when members of a synagogue contacted the authorities to say they had been offered a device to kill 'enemies of Israel'. Charges: Glendon Crawford, seen at an Albany court last year, has been indicted for conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction . Lethal: The alleged plot involved remotely firing a death ray that would kill victims with radiation poisoning . According to the FBI Crawford said the potential targets for his device, which he described as 'Hiroshima on a light switch' were a political figure and Muslims. The political figure was identified as President Obama, sources close to the investigation told ABC News. On the day of the Boston marathon bombings, Crawford allegedly sent a text message saying: 'Obama's policies caused this. He directed the [government] to start bringing [Muslims] here without background checks.' He added: 'They don't have to follow any laws, and this administration has done more to enable a government sponsored invasion than the press can cover up.' Crawford allegedly approached Jewish organizations to find people to help him with technology that could be used to surreptitiously deliver damaging doses of radiation. Accomplice: Eric Feight faces charges of helping Crawford develop the device . Prosecutors said the  industrial mechanic from Galway wanted . the device to be used on unwitting victims and that they had scouted potential targets. The laser was designed to be mounted on a truck and controlled remotely, according to the Jewish Press. The FBI said the device would have been fired through the truck's cigarette lighter. The victims would have been hit with a lethal dose of radiation that would kill them about two weeks later. Crawford, who claimed he was part of . the United Northern & Southern Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, . allegedly sought financing from the KKK in North Carolina, and . approached Jewish organizations saying he wanted help targeting . Muslims. As he began his search for a source . of radiation to use, he came into contact with two undercover FBI . agents, who had received a tip off from two synagogues in Albany. The men, who could face up to 15 years in prison, assembled the mobile device, which they said could be controlled remotely from up to half a mile away, but it was inoperable and nobody was hurt. The damaging effects of the radiation would have appeared only days later, authorities said. The investigation by the FBI in . Albany and police agencies began in April 2012 after authorities . received information that Crawford had approached a synagogue. Crawford allegedly planned to turn an industrial-grade X-ray machine into a remote-controlled laser gun. The laser gun would be mounted in a truck and driven to an area near the intended victims. After parking the truck, the driver would leave the scene and activate the laser via a remote control from about half a mile away. Everyone near the truck would receive a lethal dose of radiation and die within two weeks of the attack. Crawford was arrested as he prepared to test the device, which the FBI says would have worked. Rabbi . Matthew Cutler, of Congregation Gates of Heaven in Schenectady, said a . 'strange man' came to the synagogue in April last year and said he had a . device to protect the Jewish people, according to the Albany Times Union. When . staff at the synagogue told the man they were not interested, he asked . for suggestions on what he could do with his creation. 'They had a hard time getting rid of him. He had this device, this plan on what to do,' Mr Cutler said. In . the FBI complaint, Crawford allegedly said: 'Everything with . respiration would be dead by the morning,' adding: 'How much sweeter . could there be than a big stack of smelly bodies?' Feight, . who works for an electronics company in Columbia County, is accused of . agreeing to help Crawford construct the electronic controls for the . device. In December, agents were given permission to monitor Crawford and Feight's cell phones and emails. Although Crawford had not found a radiation supply for the device, it was capable of being operated remotely. Plot: Glendon Crawford, who lived at this Galway house in New York, was arrested by the FBI in June last year . The men were arrested on Tuesday, after having a meeting on June 12, monitored by undercover informants posing as members of the KKK interested in purchasing the device and financing the project, where they discussed testing a fully working version of the device. Crawford has been suspended from his job at General Electrical. A spokesman for the company said: 'We have no reason to believe the act took place on GE property nor is there any information indicating that our employees' safety was ever compromised.' 'This case demonstrates how we must . remain vigilant to detect and stop potential terrorists, who so often . harbor hatred toward people they deem undesirable,' U.S. Attorney . Richard Hartunian told NBC 4. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Undercover agents posing as radiation suppliers tracked pair for a year .

"Choking smog engulfed one of northeastern China's largest cities last week, causing Chinese authorities to shut down the city. The incredible amounts of smog in Harbin - a city of more than 10 million people – meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres. The smog forced schools to suspend classes, caused snarling traffic and closed the airport, in what was the country's first major air pollution crisis of the winter. Scroll down for video . The heavy smog is caused by industrial pollution, coal and agricultural burning, and has been trapped by the mountains to the west and wind patterns. The thick haze of smog is clearly visible as the murky grey colour in this VIIRS image from the Suomi NPP satellite . Now, the latest satellite images from Nasa’s Suomi-NPP satellite show the startling extend of China’s smog problem. Measurements taken on October 20, 2013, scored the air quality index (AQI) in the city at 500, the highest possible reading. Levels above 300 are considered hazardous to human health. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite acquired a natural-colour image of northeastern China on October 21, 2013. The brightest areas in this image are fog, which has a tinge of grey or yellow due to the air pollution. Other cloud-free areas have a pall of grey and brown smog that blots out the city and surrounding towns .

Two-day averages are used to provide an increased amount of data, reducing missing data from gaps between instrument scanning swaths or due to clouds . The brightest areas are fog, which has a tinge of grey or yellow due to the air pollution. Other cloud-free areas have a pall of gray and brown smog that blots out the city and surrounding towns. Some neighborhoods experienced concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) as high as 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter. For comparison, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality standards say PM2.5 should remain below 35 micrograms per cubic meter.

The Yellow Sea is visible at top right. Smoke from the fires is visible as a greyish haze as it accumulates on the central coastal plain . Beijing, Tianjin, and Harbin are located on China's coastal plains, to the east of mountain ranges and land at higher elevations . It is extremely rare for particulate levels to reach that high in the absence of a dust storm or forest fire. A few days after pollution levels started to rise, Harbin hospitals reported a 30 per cent increase in admissions related to respiratory problems, and several Harbin pharmacies were sold out of pollution facemasks, according to media reports. Cold weather and the lack of wind helped fuel the pollution outbreak, but human factors also played an important role. Wheat and corn farmers in the region light fires in the fall to burn off debris following the harvest. A true-colour MODIS-Aqua image of central China, acquired on October 3, 2013, shows the numerous fires adding smoke and soot to the atmosphere over China. Air quality in Chinese cities is of increasing concern to China's stability-obsessed leadership because it plays into popular resentment over political privilege and rising inequality in the world's second-largest economy. Domestic media have run stories describing the expensive air purifiers government officials enjoy in their homes and offices, alongside reports of special organic farms so cadres need not risk suffering from recurring food safety scandals. The government has announced plans over the years to tackle the pollution problem but has made little apparent progress.

"A Michigan soccer player who killed a referee with a single punch to the neck pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter Friday and is now facing up to 15 years in prison. Bassel Saad, 36, acknowledged in a Detroit courtroom that he struck John Bieniewicz during a game last summer at a Livonia park. Bieniewicz, a married father of two, died two days later. Saad initially was charged with second-degree murder and had been scheduled to stand trial beginning Monday. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Bassel Saad, 36, pleaded guilty to an involuntary manslaughter charge Friday after he acknowledged in a Detroit courtroom that he struck referee John Bieniewicz (right) during a game last summer . Father figure: John Bieniewicz, 44, who was attacked June 29 while refereeing an adult-league soccer match in the Detroit-area and died two days later, is pictured here with his two sons . John Bieniewicz is pictured being administered CPR on the turf after being knocked out cold by Bassel Saad . The auto mechanic from Dearborn will be sentenced March 13. Under the plea deal, he could be sentenced from eight to 15 years in prison. He would have faced up to life in prison if convicted of murder. Saad, a native of Lebanon, has lived in the US legally for 15 years but is not a citizen. The father of three now could also face deportation. ‘This was something less than an attempt to kill. ... Mr. Saad, he got up that day, and he determined that he was going to play soccer. He didn't determine that he was going to kill someone on that particular day,’ said defense lawyer Cyril Hall, who added his client is ‘very, very remorseful.’ Kris Bieniewicz, the referee's wife, attended Friday's hearing, but did not speak to reporters afterward. The mother of two, who coaches basketball at a local middle school, told The Associated Press earlier this week that she hoped Saad ‘never sees the light of day.’ ‘But is that realistic? No. I know it's not realistic. But at the same point in time, I think my husband's life is worth more than eight years,’ the widow said. Bieniewicz, a medical assistant at a children's hospital whose wife described him as ‘just an easygoing guy,’ was killed while refereeing an over-30 men's league match at Mies Park. Defendant Bassel Saad sobs during a probable-cause hearing in July in Livonia, Michigan. Saad was initially charged with second-degree murder in the death of John Bieniewicz . Witness Scott Herkes, left, demonstrates with defense attorney Ali Hammoud how he said Bassel Saad punched soccer referee John Bieniewicz, during a court hearing in the summer . A number of players testified in court last year that Saad had been issued a yellow card, or an official warning, following a foul in the first half of the June 29 game, and Bieniewicz was about to issue him a second yellow and eject him from the game for being verbally abusive. That's when the referee was struck, the players said. Saad’s punch landed in the head and neck area, causing the referee to fall and stop breathing. The medical examiner determined the cause of death to be blunt impact to the left side of the man's neck and ruled the killing a homicide. Bieniewicz, 44, left behind his wife and two young sons. Kris Bieniewicz recently testified at Michigan's Capitol in support of proposed legislation that would make it a felony to assault a sports official in the state. Referees ‘are out there on an island with no one to defend them. Something more than a misdemeanor should be in place,’ she said. A soccer referee who was fatally punched by a player during a recreational game in suburban Detroit did not expect the attack, one of the player's teammates testified on Wednesday. Dr. Jamal Saleh testified during a probable-cause hearing in July that Bieniewicz did not see the punch coming. Widow: Basketball coach Kris Bieniewicz, John Bieniewicz's wife, has tried to establish some normalcy for her two sons in the eight months since her husband and their father was killed . Family torn apart: Bieniewicz left behind his wife, Kris (left), and their two boys (right), Kyle and Josh . Two players from the opposing team also testified that Saad knocked Bieniewicz to the turf with one punch after the referee indicated he planned to give Saad a red card and eject him from the game. Saleh said he rushed toward Bieniewicz, who was on his back grasping a yellow card in one hand and a red card in the other. In soccer, a yellow card is held aloft by the referee to caution a player following a foul or other misconduct. A red card is shown by the referee when a player is being thrown out of the game. Two yellow cards given in the same game equal a red card. In this case, the players testified that Saad had been issued a yellow card following a foul in the first half, and Bieniewicz was giving him a second yellow for being verbally abusive. That's when he was struck, the three players said. A skirmish erupted between players following the attack. Saleh said he quickly checked on Bieniewicz and the referee initially was not breathing but had a pulse. Saleh said he performed CPR and told the unconscious Bieniewicz: 'Wake up, buddy. You're going to be OK.' Mrs Bieniewicz, pictured far left with her family, said ahead of the plea deal that she hoped Saad never 'sees the light of day' Player Scott Herkes testified that Saad removed his jersey and left the field with another man as Bieniewicz was being tended to. Herkes said he followed the men into the parking lot and took down the license plate number of the vehicle in which they left. Prosecutors showed a photograph in which Saad appeared to be making an obscene gesture while seated in the vehicle. In 2005, Saad was involved in another assault on a soccer field. Court documents obtained by Detroit Free Press indicate that the auto mechanic repeatedly struck another player in the head. He pleaded not contest in that case and was sentenced to five days' community service and 12 months' probation.","Bassel Saad, 36, pleaded guilty to reduced charge of involuntary manslaughter instead of going on trial on second-degree murder count .

"It’s a pioneering crime-fighting technique that could have come straight from a detective drama – and will soon be hitting the streets of Britain. When officers arrive at a crime scene, they will be able to quickly and easily find out whether the perpetrator has left behind saliva, sweat or other bodily fluids with the help of a fluorescent spray. Until now, finding and analysing these samples – which can help uncover the guilty party’s identity – has been a complicated and time-consuming process. Investigation help: The new technology could help police apprehend criminals more quickly by lighting up bodily fluids . But once the new ‘forensic biosensor’ spray has been applied, it will immediately light up in one of four different bright colours – telling officers whether the sample is blood, sweat, saliva or semen. The item can then be sent for immediate forensic analysis to extract DNA and, if the offender is already known to the police, help them make an immediate arrest. The spray, which uses the latest bio and nano technologies, has been developed by scientists at King’s College London. It has been in progress for almost a decade and the Home Office hopes that it will provide police officers with vital leads in the first critical hours of an investigation. It will be tested by London’s Met Police in a £113,000 pilot scheme, which ministers hope to extend nationwide.

"Add former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney to the chorus of Republicans who seem insistent on making the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi, Libya a black mark against Hillary Rodham Clinton if she decides to run for president. In an interview taped for Fox News Sunday, Cheney told host Chris Wallace that the former Secretary of State will have some explaining to do. 'She was Secretary of State at the time that it happened,' Cheney said in an excerpt broadcast Friday afternoon on Fox. 'She was one of the first in Washington to know about it.' 'I think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the State Department did or didn't do with respect to that – uh, that crisis.' Former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney, shown in a May 12 interview, vented his spleen about Hillary Clinton's role in the Benghazi scandal during a Fox News interview that will air Sunday . Clinton, then secretary of state, angered members of the U.S. Senate in 2013 when she suggested it made no difference whether the 2012 attack that claimed four U.S. lives was premeditated or spontaneous . The U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, LIbya erupted in flames on September 11, 2012 after heavily armed terrorists linked to an al-Qaeda affiliate group launched mortars and grenades and followed up with small-arms fire . 'I do think it's a major issue,' the former vice president and one-time Secretary of Defense added. 'I don't think we've heard the last of it yet.' Clinton, President Barack Obama and other administration officials famously insisted in the days following the September 11, 2012 attack that it was not premeditated but improvised, the product of a spontaneous protest against a crude Internet video that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad. That claim has been proven false, with the only remaining question being who proposed it in the first place. But Clinton's political liabilities also extend to her State Departments failure to protect its diplomatic installation in the eastern Libya port city. Months before Ansar al-Shariah militants stormed the American compound, the group and other al-Qaeda affiliates paraded through central Benghazi, armed to the teeth with heavy artillery and armored vehicles, and threatened future assassinations of U.S. targets. Despite having intelligence about that event and the press conference that followed, the State Department declined repeated requests for added security forces. Clinton, who has insisted for more than a year that she's on the fence about a White House run in 2016, has sounded more and more like a candidate in recent weeks. On Friday she borrowed a book full of pages from populist democrats like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, telling an audience at the left-leaning New America Foundation that President Barack Obama's emphasis on 'income inequality' will continue to be a major focus for her. 'The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach,' she said, 'and many Americans understandably feel frustrated, even angry.' 'As secretary of state,' Clinton assured a friendly crowd, 'I saw the way extreme inequality has corrupted other societies, hobbled growth and left entire generations alienated and unmoored.' But the words 'Benghazi' and 'Libya' never came up. The . Islamist terror attack, which claimed the lives of U.S. Ambassador to . Libya Christopher Stevens and three other U.S. personnel, threatens to . become an albatross around Clinton's neck as the decision point . approaches for the Democratic presidential primary season. She . has publicly said twice this year that the Benghazi episode is her . 'biggest regret' from her years helming the State Department – first . during a January Q-and-A session at the National Automobile Dealers . Association convention in San Francisco, and then in April during a . women's leadership conference at Simmons College . Not talking: Clinton is grooming her softer side for a presidential run with appearances like Friday's farewell broadcast for Barbara Walters on 'The View,' but she's not addressing her State Department's shortcomings before, during and after the terror attack . Chris Wallace, host of Fox News Sunday, interviewed Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne for Sunday's broadcast . On April 23 she discussed 'the attack on our facility in Benghazi, and the loss of, uh, two State Department personnel and two CIA contractors from the terrorist attack and the terrible consequences of that.' 'It's very, very painful and it was certainly the biggest regret that I had as Secretary of State,' Clinton said. Secretary of explaining things: Former President Bill Clinton has rushed to his wife's aid on the Benghazi question, perhaps anticipating at least 4 more years in the White House . 'They weren't the only people that we lost, but we lost them in such a terrible, senseless, terrorist action that – you know, it's just deeply sorrowful and it went on for hours – because the CIA annex was attacked after the State Department facility was attacked.' Her emotional, contrite language stood in stark contrast with an almost flippant anger during a Senate Foreign Affairs Committee hearing 15 months earlier. 'The fact is we had four dead Americans,' she barked in a moment destined to be memorialized in campaign attack ads if she runs in 2016. 'Was it because of a protest, or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they'd they go kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?' she asked then. Clinton's potential Republican presidential adversaries have already staked out their criticisms. On May 9 at the Republican National Committee's spring meeting in Memphis, Tenn., Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul test fired his heavy guns. 'This is about judgment,' he said. 'And we're talking about – should we, should we as a country have a commander-in-chief who didn't provide adequate security in Libya, didn't send reinforcements, and then gave us nothing but spin?' 'My opinion is that Hillary Clinton has precluded herself from ever being considered for that position,' Paul added, to strong applause. Mrs. Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, has begun to defend her in public as it seems clear that she will have to confront the Benghazi issue if she stays in politics. On May 14 the man President Obama once joked about appointing as his 'Secretary of Explaining Things,' said during a fiscal summit that 'In my opinion, Hillary did what she should have done' as the terror attack unfolded. 'Secretaries of state never were involved directly in these security decisions,' he insisted. And, throwing an elbow at George W. Bush, the man who succeeded him in the Oval Office, Clinton said that 'most Americans don’t even know how many American diplomatic personnel were killed while President Bush was president.'","'I think she clearly bears responsibility for whatever the State Department did or didn't do,' the former VP told Fox News .

"Aaron Hernandez texted a friend to 'hurry' before they allegedly murdered semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, the jury in his murder trial heard on Friday. But several other messages the former New England Patriots player exchanged with co-defendant Ernest Wallace were deleted from his phone after the killing, a Massachusetts Superior Court heard.

The semi-pro football player, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, was found shot to death at an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Atteborough later that day. All smiles: Aaron Hernandez is seen grinning during his murder trial in Fall River, Massachusetts on Friday. Behind him, a courtroom monitor displays cell phone records from the night of the murder . Prosecutors have said Hernandez orchestrated the killing while Wallace and a third man, Carlos Ortiz, are also charged in the death. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately. Evidence presented on Friday showed Hernandez texted Wallace several times in the hours before the killing. In the messages, Hernandez pushed Wallace to come and see him. One, at 9.02pm, said: 'Please make it back Cuz Im Def trying to step for a little.' Another, at 10.23pm, told him to 'hurry up' with a couple of expletives. Also that night Hernandez wrote, 'Call her and make sure ur phone is on and charged,' apparently referring to his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. He wrote that Jenkins was 'getting on my nerves' and that he 'ain't trying to b stuck wit her all day an nite'. More than a dozen calls were made to Wallace that night between 9.47pm and about 2.20am from Hernandez's phone, his lawyer's phone or the phone of his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. Among them, he made multiple calls to Wallace from his lawyer's phone after police asked him to go to the station, records show. On the stand: Ricardo Leal, a Record Custodian with Sprint Telecommunications, testified on Friday that several messages sent between Hernandez and his friend had been deleted . Fellow accused: The testimony on Friday revealed that Hernandez had told his fellow defendant, Ernest Wallace (pictured in court in May last year) to 'hurry' ahead of the alleged murder of Odin Lloyd . Wallace also called Lloyd five times before he died - between 1.22am and 2.32am. The last call was made at the exact same minute Lloyd was seen on surveillance footage getting into a car outside his home. Prosecutors say the three men picked him up in a rental car before driving to the industrial park to shoot him. Murdered: Odin Lloyd, who was dating Hernandez's fiancee's sister, was killed on July 17, 2013 . Lloyd sent his last text to his sister at 3.23am and was killed within minutes, prosecutors said. The jury also saw texts Hernandez and Wallace had exchanged in the days leading up to the killing. On June 11, Hernandez asked Wallace if he removed everything from a car, 'clip and cds and everything?' The following day, he tells Wallace he needs 'those keys' and things are 'crazy'. 'U gotta listen yo,' he writes. 'I need them by 6 man please head back now.' A few hours later, early on June 13, he writes: 'I wanted to kill u but u kno I love u hit me tomorrow get some rest and tell the rest I love them.' Ricardo Leal, who works for the phone company Sprint, testified on Friday that several other text messages that appeared in records did not appear on the phone. It's not clear yet whether investigators were able to retrieve them. Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found by a jogger on the evening of June 17. Police soon tied him to Hernandez because Lloyd had a key in his pocket to a Chevrolet Suburban that Hernandez had rented. Investigators also found empty shell casings from a .45-caliber handgun nearby. They found a similar shell casing that had been removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez. That night, police went to Hernandez's home and asked him to go to the police station, which he did. Heartbroken: Odin Lloyd's mother, Ursula Ward, is pictured listening to testimony in court on Friday . By his side: Hernandez's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins is seen at the murder trial on Wednesday . On Thursday, jurors were shown surveillance footage of Hernandez and Ortiz at a gas station before they headed to Lloyd's Boston home. In the footage, Ortiz was wearing a white towel around his neck and a similar towel was found at the crime scene. The trial in Fall River is the first of two murder trials Aaron Hernandez faces this year. Later this year, he will face a second murder trial for allegedly killing two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. He had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team after being charged with Lloyd's murder.","A Sprint employee testified in court in Fall River, Massachusetts on Friday that several texts between Hernandez and Ernest Wallace had been deleted .

"A couple who recently moved into a rented home discovered a cache of 7,500 bullets in a pond in their back garden. Neil Tipping, 33, who lives with his girlfriend Eleanor Mercer, 32, made the shocking discovery while he was clearing weeds from the water feature. He said he saw a flash of metal and thought it was a piece of gold, but upon closer inspection he found that it was actually a bullet. Police officers arrived at the house where they discovered 2.2mm rifle rounds, up to 30 machine gun rounds, shotgun cartridges, and a cache of 9mm and 8mm rounds. Hands-on: A police officer wearing purple gloves lines up a number of the bullets found in the pond at Mr Tipping and Ms Mercer's home . Safe: Despite the thousands of bullets that were found, the police did not feel the need to evacuate the couple . Now the pair are worried there may be more rounds of undiscovered ammunition in their home. Mr Tipping said: 'It’s really unnerved us. I’m terrified that next time I’m mowing the lawn I’ll run over a bullet that hasn’t been found yet. One of us could be seriously hurt. 'We have friends with young children who could have put one of the bullets in their mouth, or one of our cats could have got hold of one - it doesn’t bear thinking about. Shocked: Eleanor Mercer and Neil Tipping stumbled upon a haul of ammunition in their rented home . 'We were planning to be in this house for years - now we want to move out as soon as we can. The couple, who have been together for 10 years, moved into the rented house last September. Mr Tipping made the discovery earlier this month while using a rake to pull up long reeds from one of the two ponds. 'Something fell from the pile of weeds I’d pulled out and it hit the paving stones with a clink. I didn’t think much about it until it happened again with the next pile - and I saw a flash of gold. 'My first thought was ‘Oh my God, I’ve found treasure! I was thrilled. 'But I picked the metal up and realised it was a bullet.' Mr Tipping called alerted his partner Ms Mercer and  headed to a friend’s house - incredibly, with the bullets in his pocket. 'It seems really stupid now but I didn’t realise they could be dangerous, I just wanted to find out what they were. My friend used to live on a farm and told me they were 2.2mm bullets. 'I came home and looked in the pond for more - then we spotted some really big ones.' Ms Mercer added: 'I rang my dad because he used to be in the Navy, and he told us not to touch them because they could be dangerous. Haul: The pond also contained 20 to 30 machine gun rounds, two shotgun cartridges, more than 50 9mm rounds and 30 8mm rounds . Ready to go: A view of police preparing to conduct search for bullets, from inside Mr Tipping and Ms Mercer's home . He said they could have eroded over time and we should call the police straight away. It was at that point that we started to panic.' The couple dialled 101 and two officers arrived, quickly realised the seriousness of the situation, and called in CID officers who alerted the fire brigade to drain the ponds because the underwater search unit was not available. Search: A picture taken from inside the house shows police officers scouring the pond for hidden ammunition in Mr Tipping and Ms Mercer's garden . Before the pair knew what was happening, two fire engines pulled up, followed by two police vans - and their garden was taken over as a full-scale assessment took place. As an examination of the bullets deemed them not to be a risk, the couple were not evacuated, but officers stayed until 1am sifting through the sludge and mud in one of the ponds - where they found around 2,200 bullets - the majority of which were 2.2mm rifle rounds. But shockingly, the pond also contained 20 to 30 machine gun rounds, two shotgun cartridges, more than 50 9mm rounds and 30 8mm rounds. Police assured the Mr Tipping and Ms Mercer they would be back the next day to search the second pond. Ms Mercer said: 'After the second seven-hour day, one of the officers asked me how many I thought they’d found in that pond. 'I thought it would maybe be the same amount as the first pond, and I couldn’t believe it when he said they’d found over 5,600 more.' The next day police brought metal detectors and did a full search of the house and garden to make sure there was no more hidden ammunition, before giving the couple the all-clear. 'It’s just mind-blowing,' Mr Tipping said. 'The police told me that they found more rounds of ammunition in our back garden than at the local arms store.' No stone unturned: A police officer in protective gear looks under the floorboards of the living room in the house . While West Yorkshire Police have launched an investigation into how the ammunition ended up in the ponds, the couple have contacted their letting agent - who in turn, spoke to the landlord who now lives in Turkey. 'He was astonished, and said he had no idea where it had come from,' Ms Mercer said. 'The house was empty for a year before we took it so we don’t know what has happened. 'It’s sad because we love this house and have spent time and effort making it a home. And somebody somewhere has ruined that. I don’t want to stay in a house where that kind of thing has been found in the garden. I’m gutted.' Mr Tipping added: 'Of course for our family and friends this is a great story, but for us, it’s ruined our home.' Concerned: Mr Tipping and Ms Mercer have expressed unease about continuing to live at their home in Leeds after police drained their pond and found thousands of bullets .

"An 8-year-old boy has written a heartfelt letter to Santa Claus asking for help to stop his twin sister from being bullied at school. Mom Karen Suffern said she wept openly when she read the letter written by her son Ryan in which he told Santa he was willing to forgo any Christmas presents this year if the bullies would leave his sister alone. Ryan and twin sister Amber have just started in the third grade at Rocky Mount Preparatory in North Carolina. Mom Karen Suffern said she wept openly when she read the letter her son Ryan had written in which he told Santa he was willing to forgo any Christmas presents this year if the bullies at school would leave his sister Amber alone . At 140 pounds, Amber is almost twice the size of her brother. Her mom says she has attention-deficit (hyperactivity) disorder and other mental and mood disorders - and is an emotional eater. Ryan’s letter to Santa started off normally: ‘Dear Santa… I wanted a (remote control) car and helicopter, but I don’t want that anymore (sic). 'Kid at school are still picking on Amber and its (sic) not fair,’ he wrote. ‘I prayed that they will stop but god is bisy (sic) and needs your help.’ Ryan wrote the touching letter after single mom Suffern had asked her kids to write to Santa so she could get an idea of what presents they wanted for Christmas. Ryan wrote the touching letter after single mom Suffern had asked her kids to write to Santa so she could get an idea of what presents they wanted for Christmas . Dear Santa, . My mom said to send you a Christmas list. I wanted a remote control car and helicopter but I do not want that anymore. Kids at school are still picking on Amber and it is not fair because she does not do anything to them and it makes me mad. I prayed they would stop, but God is busy and I need your help. Is it against the rules to give up gifts early? Can you ask Big Time Rush to come to Amber’s birthday party? It will make her so happy. If you do not get them to come that is fine, just get her everything she asked for. Thanks Santa, . Love Ryan . PS- My mom throws the best birthday parties. You can come if you want. Suffern said she had a vague idea her daughter was being teased, but reading Ryan’s letter she had opened her eyes to what her daughter was dealing with on a daily basis. ‘I try to build up my daughter's self-esteem and tell her she is beautiful, but people say hurtful things to me, because I also have a weight problem, and that hurts me,’ she told CNN. ‘I can't imagine what she goes through.’ Suffern said her daughter has never mentioned being teased, but Ryan has told her that in gym class kids laughed at Amber because she couldn’t do the bear crawl on the floor and that she has been teased in class and told she must be adopted because she is multiracial. ‘Every day when she goes to school, she says, “Mommy, can I just stay at home?” and she just doesn't want to go.’ And now every time I send her to school, I feel like I am not protecting her and I am letting her down,’ Suffern said. She decided to share he son’s letter . online with some friends including Tony Posanski, who blogs about weight . loss after losing more than 200 pounds himself. Posnanski said he was moved by Ryan's letter because it reminded him of his childhood. Now that Ryan's letter has shed new light on Amber's situation, their mom plans to speak to their teachers and the parents of the bullies at school. 'If my kids don't call names and pick on others, I would expect other parents to teach their kids to be respectful, too,' she told CNN. 'There have been times my kids would point at others and say, ""why is her hair so strange"" and things like that, and I would say, ""You know, people are different, and that is just the way they are.'""

"The production of opium in Helmand has tripled since British troops arrived in the Afghan province in 2006, according a devastating report published today by the United Nations. According to the report more than 75,000 hectares of Helmand were given over to opium cultivation last year, up from just 25,500 hectares in 2005. The embarrassing figures show that opium cultivation is at a higher level than during Taliban rule, and production is expected to increase for the third year in a row. A British soldier patrols a poppy field in Helmand: New figures released by the UK show that production of the raw material for heroin has tripled in the years British forces have been fighting in Helmand province . High prices for opium, from which heroin is made, is encouraging farmers to grow poppies, according to the UN's Afghanistan Opium Risk Assessment 2013 report. Afghanistan supplies about 90 per cent of the world's illicit opium and the proceeds are believed to help fuel the war against the U.S.-led forces who ousted the Taliban in 2001. 'The prices are still quite high. That is a very clear economic incentive,' Martin Raithelhuber of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) told Reuters. 'We can't deny the fact that the level of cultivation now is much higher than it has ever been under the Taliban.' The total area used to grow poppies last year was 154,000 hectares, said Mr Raithelhuber. While the area is expanding, it was unclear if it would reach the record of 193,000 hectares set in 2007. The UNODC report, prepared together with Afghanistan's Ministry of Counter Narcotics, said there was a link between insecurity, lack of agricultural aid, and opium farming. Villages with poor security and those which had not received agricultural help were much more likely to grow poppies in 2013 than others, it said. Embarrassing: This map from the UN report shows that Helmand is the only Afghan province where levels of opium cultivation are expected to be 'very high' in 2013 . Twelve provinces were forecast to show a rise in opium cultivation this year, according to the report. They included the southern provinces of Kandahar and Helmand - strongholds insurgency where British forces have fought fierce battles with the Taliban. This would follow a low yield last year caused by poppy disease and bad weather. Although lower than in 2010 and 2011, opium prices are still much higher than in 2005-09 'making opium cultivation financially very attractive for farmers,' the report said. Three provinces - Balkh, Faryab and Takhar - may lose their poppy-free status unless effective eradication took place. Cultivation was forecast to decline in one province, Herat, and no major changes were foreseen in seven, including Kabul. With foreign combat forces leaving in less than two years, and with much of their cash and air power expected to go with them, the Afghan government will need more help fighting poppy cultivation, experts say. The UNODC in 2011 estimated the opium trade may have earned the Taliban $700million (£460million), up from $200million (£130million) a year in the previous decade, with traffickers earning billions more. Since 2001, 441 British soldiers have died in Afghanistan.","Opium cultivation is at a higher level than under Taliban rule, figures show .

"The trial of a man who has admitted to the murder and mutilation of his girlfriend and her two young children looks to have been jeopardized by the way police handled his arrest. Edward Covington, 35, is facing the death penalty for the grisly killings of Lisa Freiberg, 26, and her children, 2-year-old Savannah and 7-year-old Zachary, inside their home in Lutz, a small town in Hillsborough County, Florida. Covington admitted to murdering the three during a crack cocaine and vodka-induced rage on Mothers Day, 2008, according to Tampa Bay. He confessed to doctors that he 'ripped' his girlfriend in half. Covington, who is bipolar, also said that he cut off her son's male organ before killing him. Defense attorneys for alleged triple-murderer Edward Covington are trying to have the confession he gave police tossed out of court because they refused to let him meet with the attorneys in the days following his 2008 arrest . Tragic: The bodies of Lisa Freiberg and her children Zachary, 7, and Savannah, 2, were found inside their trailer in Florida on Mothers Day in 2008 . Scene: Edward Covington is facing the death penalty for the grisly killings of Lisa Freiberg, 26, and her children, 2-year-old Savannah and 7-year-old Zachary, inside their home in Lutz, a small town in Hillsborough County, Florida . However what can now be used as evidence at Covington's murder trial - set for October - is up the air because of the way he was treated after being arrested or 'detained'. Newly released court documents say that defense attorneys were initially barred from seeing Covington. Covington was hiding in a closet, wearing only black underwear, his body covered in scratches and his feet wet with blood, when police arrived at the murder scene. He was taken to University Community Hospital (now Florida Hospital) in Tampa, because he told them he had swallowed a lot of pills. He was where he was listed in the patient registry as 'Allen Doe'. An ambulance officer who checked him out at the scene described him as 'psychotic'. The new court documents show that attorneys from the Hillsborough Public Defender's Office had asserted they had the right to visit Covington at the hospital in the days after his arrest, but that the Sheriff's Office refused. Edward Covington as seen in a previous court appearance. He has been in jail since 2008 . Deceased: Two-year-old Savannah Freiberg was said to have been playing with a toy cell phone when Covington, awaking from a crack cocaine and vodka bender, lashed out at her . After lashing out at her young daughter, Covington is said to have confessed to doctors that he then turned on girlfriend Lisa Freiberg and that he 'ripped her in half' Covington is also alleged to have cut off the male organ of seven-year-old Zachary Freiberg before killing him . Deputies used a variety of legal pretexts to claim they could keep Covington isolated without legal advice. They maintained he had not officially been arrested but had been 'detained', despite being handcuffed to a hospital bed, and that the constitutional guarantee of a defense attorney didn't yet apply. Only after Covington confessed to the crimes - after being moved to an interrogation cell at the Sheriff's Office - did deputies tell him that lawyers from the Public Defender's Office had been trying to see him. Covington's defense team is now arguing that law enforcement's decision to sequester him from attorneys — going so far as to register him under a false name at a hospital — violated his constitutional rights, and that his confession should be tossed. 'You're entitled to an attorney as soon as you're in custody or under arrest,' Public Defender Julianne Holt said. 'To deny that he was in custody is, I think, very foolish on their part. It flies in the face of common sense.' Edward Covington has gained a significant amount of weight in jail and is almost unrecognizable to the way he looked at the time of his arrest . Police shut off the street in Lutz where the crimes occurred in May 2008 . However authorities say that at the time they didn't know what they were dealing with when handling Covington. 'We had two possible things — either an only witness to a crime or a suspect to a crime,' retired homicide detective Donald Custer, lead investigator on the case at the time, testified last month. The suppression of the confession could be a significant blow for prosecutors as they prepare for Covington's trial. Hillsborough Circuit Judge William Fuente will hear additional testimony and arguments on the matter in March. Afterward, he will make a ruling about whether the confession can be presented to a jury.","Edward Covington, 35, was arrested in relation to the murder of girlfriend Lisa Freiberg, 26, and her children, 2-year-old Savannah and 7-year-old Zachary, at their Florida home in 2008 .

"From across the ocean, an English woman inspired an obese American alcoholic to lose 365lb, ditch the alcohol and embrace life in just over a year. To distract himself from the depression that saw him drinking heavily each night and eating to fill the void, Michigan man Brian Flemming played Draw Something, a Pictionary-inspired app, which matched him randomly with opponent Jackie Eastham in London . In the spring of 2012 Flemming was 30, morbidly obese, and an alcoholic, with nagging medical problems that were only getting worse. Drawn together: Brian Flemming from Michigan and Londoner Jackie Eastham met in person for the first time in December 2013 after an eventful year of online friendship . Depressed and obese: In less than two years, Brian Flemming lost 365lb from his six-foot-two frame with the encouragement of Jackie Eastham . Pre-diabetic with recurring bouts of cellulitis, the 625lb Flemming drank a fifth of vodka mixed with a liter of soda each night. He'd dropped out of college, lost his job and played hours of video games at a time. When he wasn't drinking, he was eating. 'My typical fast-food meal was a double cheeseburger with a large pop and large fries,' Flemming writes in his blog. 'That usually wasn't enough, so I would have chicken nuggets with it as well. I also ate Arby's frequently. Large roast beef sandwich, large curly fries and drink, and a side of mozzarella sticks. I ate fast food every day.' Jackie Eastham is 20 years his senior, with myotonic muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes progressive wasting of the muscles and other symptoms. To manage her condition, Eastham follows an extremely healthy lifestyle, and never takes her well-being for granted. On that evening in the spring of 2012, the pair chatted via their game of Draw Something and hit it off. The friendship developed onto other online mediums, including Skype and Facebook. New man: Terrified of losing Jackie Eastman's friendship, Flemming vowed to quit drinking and lose weight . Making changes: Flemming began exercising by walking on the spot in his home, too embarrassed to be seen out exercising in public . Supporter: When Flemming ventured outside to exercise, Eastham accompanied him on Skype, encouraging him to go the extra mile . Gradually, Flemming began to confide in Eastham about his weight problems, and about his drinking, a secret he'd kept even from his parents. Expecting sympathy, Flemming was thrown by Eastham's response. 'I just thought bloody hell, you're a guy who's 30... and you're wasting your life,' she said told CNN. 'My future is a lot gloomier. I'm trying to make the brightest future I can, and... you're dragging yourself down.' The reaction hit a nerve with Flemming, who realized that he'd been wasting his life feeling self-pity, anger and shame. 'She said . there were people struggling for their lives and then there's you - you . have all these opportunities and you're throwing it all away,' said . Flemming, now 32. Flemming . had grown attached to Eastham, treasuring their daily conversations. He . was afraid she'd lose patience with him, and terrified of losing her. 'I decided to quit drinking. I quit cold-turkey,' he writes in his blog. Flemming made the decision on October 13, 2012, and it was the first step in a journey that has seen him transform his life. Withdrawal symptoms aside, quitting drinking saw Flemming lose 100lbs in a month without changing any other aspect of his life. The . change inspired him to change his diet, a menu drawn mostly from . fast-food restaurants and coming in at an incredible 7,000 calories a . day. Now, . he eats cereal and Greek yoghurt for breakfast, washed down with a . glass of low-sodium vegetable juice. Lunch and dinner are lean protein, . vegetables and rice. His weekly treat is a scoop of ice-cream on . Fridays. New addiction: Flemming is now an avid runner planning to run his first full marathon in the coming weeks . Healthy living: Eastham confessed that when she first saw Flemming she was shocked at his weight, but in person last December she says he was 'taller, slimmer and more handsome' than she expected him to be . Driven: Flemming still uses this driving license as ID, which he says often raises questions . The next step was exercise. At first Flemming could only manage walking on the spot. When his fitness increased, he took a daily constitutional around his neighborhood, cloaked under the cover of darkness so that no one would poke fun at his weight. Sometimes Eastham accompanied Flemming on his walks on Skype, encouraging him to go the extra mile. From walking, Flemming upgraded to cycling. Around this time he landed a job as a business relations representative and a part-time music teacher. He began going to weekly therapy sessions and as the fog of depression lifted, hope began to take hold. Flemming plans to return to college to study psychotherapy, specializing in depression, weight loss and anxiety. The six-foot-two-inch 32-year-old was once so heavy that a hospital had had to bring in special scales to weigh him. He now weighs 234lbs and is training for his first marathon. In December 2013, just over a year after their meeting on Draw Something, Flemming and Jackie Eastham met in person. After a year of firsts, Flemming added a few more to his list when he flew to Europe to meet his champion, and the pair climbed the stairs to the top of the Eiffel Tower together. 'Jackie is the best thing that's ever happened to me. I feel that she saved my life, even though she would never take credit,' Flemming wrote in a blog post. Eastham and Flemming continue to talk daily - they're also still avid Draw Something competitors. Flemming is planning a return trip to London to visit Eastham later this year. 'I also plan to return to Cedar Point [amusement park] this year. I haven't been able to fit on the rides in 14 years!'","Brian Flemming from Michigan was obese, depressed and addicted to alcohol .

"A mother who was repeatedly raped from the age of ten by her father and gave birth to his baby has won a £160,000 payout after a council admitted a breach of duty. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said social services failed to protect her from her father during a seven year period of abuse. Now Bradford Council in West Yorkshire have admitted a breach of duty after failing to remove her from the family home and awarded her compensation. A young woman, who was repeatedly raped by her father from the age of 10 and gave birth to his baby, has been awarded a £160,000 pay out from Bradford Council (file pic posed by model) The case came to light after the father was jailed for 19 years at Bradford Crown Court in 2012 when he was convicted by a jury of eight sample charges of rape and two of child cruelty relating to his two daughters. The court heard how he fathered three children by them, and would hit them with a leather belt, a slipper and a cricket bat - offering them the choice of being hurt or having sex with him. The judge described him as a 'cruel, violent, controlling and manipulative' sexual offender, who had shown little, if any, remorse for the harm he had caused. His daughter, who is now 25 and won damages from the local authority explained: ' I love my son, but it's so hard to bond with him properly. 'Every time I look at him I see my dad. It makes parenting harder. 'I wouldn't change his being here, but I am totally torn by my feelings. I just wish he had another father.' The abuse began in 1999, when the woman was ten and within days she was being assaulted three times a week while her mother was out at work. After three years she told her mother, but she did not believe her. The following year she stopped a police community support officer on the street and told them about the abuse. Bradford Council in West Yorkshire, pictured, have admitted a breach of duty after failing to remove her from the family home and awarded her compensation . She was placed under a protection order, and went to live at a children’s home. Her father was charged with rape, but he was found not guilty and she returned to the family home. Within weeks she was allowed to move back there and her father made her apologise in front of the family. 'He made me say I had made up wicked lies. I did it because I was scared,' she added. She then became pregnant by her father and had an abortion, but 12 days later she was taken off the child protection register. Five weeks later she told a social worker her father was abusing her again, but the worker reported no further investigation could take place because he had been found not guilty. In five months, social workers visited the family home eight times, but failed to take the girl out of the house. Her case was then closed. The woman's father was jailed for 19 years at Bradford Crown Court, pictured, in 2012 after being convicted by a jury of eight sample charges of rape and two of child cruelty relating to his two daughters . The woman, whose identity is protected by law, said: 'I couldn’t believe they’d closed my case. I felt let down again and totally trapped.' She fell pregnant by her father a year later but convinced herself the baby was her boyfriend’s. But DNA  revealed the real father four years later after police began investigating.

"Not content with world domination, California-based Google is ramping up its efforts to expand its business into the cosmos. After purchasing satellite maker Skybox earlier this week for £300 million ($500 million), the tech giant is now said to be preparing to buy a stake in Sir Richard Branson’s space tourism company Virgin Galactic. The £18 million ($30 million) deal would give Google access to Galactic’s LauncherOne, capable of launching satellites into space within a few years. Google is apparently in advanced talks with Virgin Galactic to buy a 1.5 per cent stake in the company at £18 million ($30 million). This would value the firm at £1.2 billion ($2 billion). The deal would give Google access to Galactic's cargo spacecraft LauncherOne, the sibling to the passenger-carrying SpaceShipTwo (pictured) The deal would give Google a 1.5 per cent stake in New Mexico-based Virgin Galactic, and value the company at £1.2 billion ($2 billion), reports Sky News. In June 2013 Google announced Project Loon, an endeavour to send balloons high into the atmosphere that would provide internet coverage to remote areas. Then in April this year, Google acquired Titan Aerospace, a drone startup company that makes high-flying robots. This was followed in June by the £300 million ($500 million) acquisition of Californian satellite maker Skybox, which will boost the quality of images in Google Maps. And now the merger with Virgin Galactic will allow Google to start launching its own satellites into space, with the goal of expanding its influence around the world. This would allow them to begin launching a fleet of satellites - an apparent goal for the company needed to expand their influence around the world. The talks are also expected to have a second outcome, in which Google will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Virgin Galactic, with a view to building the world’s first space tourism business. LauncherOne is perhaps lesser known than the main ship of Galactic’s business, SpaceShipTwo. The latter is a passenger-carrying spaceplane that, beginning later this year or early next, will take six paying customers on brief six-minute forays into space. To reach beyond the official ‘line’ of space (known the Karman line, 62 miles or 100 kilometres up) SpaceShipTwo is carried to an altitude of 50,000 feet (15,500 metres) by the WhiteKnightTwo mothership before detaching and using its rocket to reach space. In the past year Google (headquarters in California pictured) has begun to take giant leaps towards space. It began last year with the announcement of a high-altitude balloon project called Project Loon. In the last two months the tech giant bought a drone company, acquired a satellite firm and is now investing in Virgin Galactic . Virgin Galactic is expected to begin commercial flights of its SpaceShipTwo vehicle later this year or early next, with flights of its cargo-carrying LauncherOne vehicle to begin at a later date. Pictured is a powered test flight of SpaceShipTwo over the Mojave Desert in California on 29 April 2013 . Tickets to ride into space are now valued at £150,000 ($250,000) with celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Justin Bieber apparently already stumping up the money for a ticket. Crew: 2 . Capacity: 6 passengers . Length: 60 feet (18.3 metres) Wingspan: 27 feet (8.3 metres) Height: 18 feet (5.5 metres) with rudders down . Loaded weight: 9,740 kilograms (21,428 pounds) Alongside SpaceShipTwo Branson is developing LauncherOne, an unmanned payload-carrying rocket that would be sent into space from the same WhiteKnightTwo plane. On board it will be capable of carrying experiments paid for by various companies around the world. The rocket, after detatching from WhiteKnightTwo, will then accelerate to speeds that will enable it to enter low-Earth orbit, where it can then release the satellites it is carrying. And Google has clearly seen the potential of this technology to launch satellites into orbit for a relatively low cost with its latest moves. Earlier this week it bought satellite firm Skybox as . the first step in its project to improve its maps and bring the internet . to developing countries. The acquisition will initially be . used to boost the quality of Google's maps images as it battles Apple. Skybox . has previously hit the headlines for capturing the first HD video footage . of Earth from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as . being 'like live Google maps.' Google is buying Skybox Imaging in a deal that could serve as a launching pad for the company to send its own fleet of satellites in to space. These satellites would take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world. This photo of Kiev, Ukraine was taken by Skybox on 18 February 2014 . SkySat-1, which was launched in November, captured up to 90-second video clips at 30 frames per second. Satellites . today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution, . but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than . traditional satellites. The circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100-watt light bulb. The . US group, Skybox Imaging, is now planning a constellation of 24 . satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of Earth. SkySat-2, an identical version of SkySat-1, is scheduled to launch later in 2014. Google . plans to use Skybox's satellite already in orbit to supplement the . material it licenses from more than 1,000 sources, including other . satellite companies such as DigitalGlobe and Astrium. Eventually, . though, Skybox could turn into another Google 'moonshot' - a term that chief executive Larry Page has embraced for describing ambitious projects that could . take several years to materialise. Google hopes to build more satellites that could be used to beam internet access to points around the world. 'Skybox’s satellites will help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery,' the firm said. 'Over . time, we also hope that Skybox’s team and technology will be able to . help improve Internet access and disaster relief - areas Google has long . been interested in.' Satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites. Shown here is a view of Abu Dhabi . Google . has made around 250 acquisitions during the past decade, using many of them . to expand into new markets including maps and mobile devices. To . the frustration of some investors, Google also has been spending . billions of dollars exploring new frontiers of technology, including . driverless cars, internet-connected headwear, robots and a startup . called Calico striving to find ways to slow the aging process. Other . investors have applauded Google for having the vision and audacity to . make big bets on bold ideas that analysts say could hatch lucrative . products in the rapidly changing technology industry.","California tech giant is planning to invest in Sir Richard Branson's Galactic .

"He has made a career out of helping people spend huge sums of money on building their dream houses. But Kevin McCloud has now said renting is the way forward and urged more Britons to consider being tenants rather than home-owners. And the Grand Designs presenter, 55, has also admitted he ‘can’t stand’ some of the people who appear on the show and that many of the projects featured in the programme seem like the ‘dreams of psychopaths’. Scroll down for video . Kevin McCloud has now said renting is the way forward and urged more Britons to consider being tenants rather than home-owners . The father-of-two – who lives in an Elizabethan farmhouse near Burton with his wife Suzanna, 52 – said the shortage of housing in Britain means it is not affordable for everyone to buy houses and that renting provides a solution. He said: ‘The prices have peaks and then drop, but essentially property in the UK will always be of a premium because there’s not enough of it. ‘So that doesn’t work for a country that is one of the most populated in Europe. There is a tradition of social housing in other countries but we don’t have it . ‘We are going to have to reconsider how we choose to live in terms of renting. There seems to be an allergy to that here and yet renting is a perfectly good idea. ‘I rented for years and I loved it — no responsibilities, no clearing of gutters. It left me free to actually enjoy my life.’ However, the presenter, who has fronted the Channel 4 programme since its launch in 1999, also said the Government’s plan to build 250,000 new homes a year will fail, claiming the properties will be too poor quality to attract buyers. The presenter, who has fronted the Channel 4 programme since its launch in 1999, also said the Government’s plan to build 250,000 new homes a year will fail . He told The Times: ‘It’s not to do with the amount, it’s to do with the quality. We have to build houses that people want to live in within communities that work for them and we have to ask the existing community what they think will work because they have more local knowledge than just about anyone else. ‘Until in this country we get the spaces between the buildings right, then every single housing scheme will fail. ‘The home is the heart of people’s lives. It is the launch pad of our lives and the sense of ownership goes beyond that. It stretches out into the park, the allotment, the car club.’ McCloud is no stranger to such construction projects himself. He has his own business, Happiness Architecture Beauty, which builds sustainable properties and last year completed a 42 home project in Swindon – including 50 percent social housing. The presenter also revealed that while to viewers he may seem like a source of unwavering – if sometimes stern – support for the people appearing on Grand Designs, he has to work hard to hide his distaste for some of the couples and their planned homes.

They almost seem as if they are dreams of psychopaths but they are not. ‘We all have our particular tastes. I will say that I admire them all.

"A marine biologist has killed off claims that a giant crab is living on the Kent coast - insisting the image is probably a well-doctored hoax. Residents of Whitstable were left shocked when a photo emerged appearing to show a huge crustacean just yards from the coastal town's harbour. But sea-life expert Dr Verity Nye, who has worked on logging new species of crab, says it is impossible one of the creatures could grow so big. This image of Whistable harbour from above led to claims that a 'Crabzilla' could be living off the Kent coast . The image (left) appears to show a crustacean the length of five or six boats lurking in the Thames Estuary, but marine biologist Dr Verity Nye (right) says the picture is  a hoax . Dr Nye, an Ocean and Earth Science researcher at the University of Southampton, said: 'The idea of a giant ""crabzilla"" would very exciting. Unfortunately, I think this is a hoax. 'I don't know what the currents are like around that harbour or what sort of shapes they might produce in the sand, but I think it's more conceivable that someone is playing about with the photo.' She added: 'The UK does have large crabs. The biggest is the spider crab which can grow up to 1.2 metres in size, but they tend to stay in much deeper water, about 1,000-metres deep, and are a different shape from the image in this photo. 'Crabs with a ""pie crust edge"", like the one in the crabzilla image, are known as edible crabs, or Cancer pagarus, but tend only to grow to about 20 to 30 centimetres.' Mocked-up photos poking fun at the idea of a Crabzilla were posted on Twitter after the image emerged . The largest crabs in British waters are spider crabs,  which live in waters between 10 and 1,000 metres deep . Edible crabs, shaped like the one in the aerial photo of Whitstable, grow to only 30 centimetres long . Dr Nye added: 'The largest crabs in the world are Japanese Spider Crabs, which can grow to about 3.7 metres in size, about as big as a small car, but again, they tend to stay in deep water and don't come ashore. 'Crabs are amazing because they are so diverse, we have about 60 species around the UK, and it is not inconceivable that new species could be found, but I laughed when I saw this picture.' The photograph of the apparent 50ft crustacean was originally posted on a blog called Weird Whistable, a collection of strange and unusual sightings in the town. The image has sparked a rash of less believable online images, with Twitter users mocking up their own pictures of giant claws emerging from the water.","Picture emerges appearing to show giant crustacean off Kent coast .

"A passenger on a flight bound for New York has been heard screaming about CIA secrets and NSA leaker  Edward Snowden after an audio tape of the terrifying ordeal was revealed today. Daniel Perry was physically restrained by other passengers after he stood up and began frantically shouting ten hours into the 16-hour United Airlines flight from Hong Kong. Another passenger filmed the disturbance with a cell phone on which Perry can be heard ranting: 'My name is Daniel Morgan Perry... they take my stuff away, then I become an unperson.' Scroll down for video . Flight ordeal: A passenger filmed the moment that passengers had to restrain Perry when he started ranting about the CIA and NSA, ten hours into a 16-hour flight from Hong Kong to the U.S. The audio tape, which shows several male passengers standing in a darkened cabin, was posted on newsflare.com. In a hoarse voice, Perry reportedly shouts: 'They are trying to kill me, they are trying to kill me. Please, my parents do not know I am on this flight.' He then gives his mother and father's phone numbers along with his own social security number and Hong Kong ID and address. He gave his wife's phone number and said that she was in danger because she is a Chinese national. He also cries out: 'China is a better country... I know this now because I saw something wrong and I went to my consulate and instead of helping my country they didn't see it that way, they want to silence me.' Perry also claimed that he is an . employee of a U.S. embassy in the Middle East. His Facebook profile reveals that Perry is from Binghamton, New York but currently lives in Hong Kong. In custody: A passenger on a flight from Hong Kong is arrested at the Newark airport on Monday . The suspect is seen in blue being led out of the airplane by law enforcement authorities . The passenger stood up and made the statement several hours into the trip and the flight crew decided to continue on to Newark . Jacques Roizen, one of a handful of people who were forced to restrain the man, told ABC News that the man was frightened and believed he had been poisoned. Mr Roizen told the local TV station that Perry had been shouting that he had secrets from the CIA and repeatedly mentioned the name of NSA leaker Edward Snowden. He pleaded for the flight to be . diverted to Canada. Roizen and four or five other passengers, including a . flight attendant, jumped on him when he began reaching for his pockets. They were able to restrain him with zip . ties and they tried to calm him down for the remainder of the flight by . talking about their families and Father's Day, he added. Perry was met at Newark Liberty International Airport around 2pm by more than . a dozen federal law enforcement officials. The passenger referred to NSA leaker Edward Snowden several times, according to one of the passengers who restrained him . The passenger is pictured with his hands zip-tied behind his back heading toward an ambulance . His hands were zip-tied behind his back as he was led out of United Airlines flight . 116 and onto the tarmac, where several police vehicles and an ambulance . were waiting. He was wearing a dark hooded jacket, a blue shirt and . khaki pants. Officials say the man appeared to be . mentally disturbed and was taken to nearby University Hospital for a . psychiatric evaluation. Initial reports said he had claimed on board the plane that other . passengers had been poisoned but two witnesses said they never heard . him make that statement. It's not known at this point whether he . has any ties to Edward Snowden, the 29-year-old former security . contractor who leaked classified information to the media regarding two . government surveillance programs. Snowden fled to Hong Kong on May 20 . and he is believed to still be hiding out there. He claims he worked for . the CIA between 2007 and 2009, before he started work as a security contractor for Booz Allen Hamilton. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control . cleared the plane at the airport and determined there was no evidence of poison on . board. None of the 238 passengers have reported feeling sick. Witnesses were allowed to leave the airport after being interviewed by the FBI and Port Authority Police detectives.

Courage: Danielle carries Taylor up the stairs and gives the decorated hero a hug . The homecoming on August 30 saw the residents of Cedar Falls line the streets with American flags to welcome the injured hero home. After attending the wedding of friends and visiting family, the couple then returned to Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington D.C. to carry on with Taylor's rehabilitation. They plan to return home to attend a fundraiser on October 19 which is being organized via the Taylor Morris Community Support on Facebook. On May 3, Taylor was leading a team of U.S. Army Special Forces to a classified location . near Kandahar province when he stepped on an Improvised Explosive . Device, which went off directly underneath him. A hero's welcome: The couple walk past the marque at the Oster Regent Theatre in their hometown of Cedar Falls, Iowa where it reads: 'Taylor Morris, Hero, Welcome home' Remarkable recovery: Taylor was fitted with prosthetic arms and legs in May and is well ahead of schedule with his progress . Since his story was featured on The Chive in May, readers have raised more than $250,000 for the young man to help him buy his dream home and plan for his future. ‘As soon as I stepped on it, I knew,’ he told John Resig, the co-owner of the website . which first told the story. ‘There was a moment, then I heard the . blast. I felt the heat. I knew I had lost my legs. As I somersaulted . through the air, I watched my legs fly off.’ Lean on me: The young couple have achieved their goal of owning a log cabin thanks to more than $250,000 of donations from those who were touched by Taylor's bravery and sacrifice . Honored: Taylor and Danielle attend an event at the White House for veterans during the summer . Romance: Taylor and Danielle hold hands as he continues to make progress after being injured in Afghanistan earlier this year . Taylor landed back in the blast . crater, but despite the horrific injuries he had sustained, he remained . conscious and did not go into shock. Even though the 23-year-old was bleeding . profusely from all four severed limbs, he called to the oncoming medics . to stay away from the site of the blast so as not to put them in danger . in case there were other mines around. The . area around the injured man was finally cleared by the second EOD . specialist, and the medic finally administered combat casualty care. Morris remained alert throughout the whole ordeal. Combat: Taylor Morris with a colleague during his tour of duty in Afghanistan . Brave: Taylor Morris has been recovering at Walter Reed Army Medical Center from his injuries . Survivor: Morris was told that he was only the fifth patient at Walter Reed to have survived a four-limb amputation . ‘They asked me how much it hurts on a scale of one to ten.  I said, ‘Definitely a ten. It freaking hurts,’’ he recalled. Medical crews and comrades were under . fire as they came to his aid. They got him on a stretcher and he was . evacuated by helicopter to a hospital in Kandahar and then to Germany. Somewhere between those final two stops, Morris finally lost . consciousness after a doctor administered a strong sedative. Three . days later, on May 6, the 23-year-old arrived back in the U.S. and was . transported to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, DC, to . begin the long and painful rehabilitation process. Morris became only the fifth patient at the hospital to . ever survive a four-limb amputation. So far, his progress has been ahead . of schedule. Phantom pains: Morris said he still has sensations in his arms and legs . Hero: Following the explosion, Morris told his comrades who rushed to his aid to stay away in case there were other mines around . Loved ones: Morris' girlfriend, Danielle Kelly (right), his mother, Julie (center), and his father, Dan (left), have been by his side at the hospital . ‘My body is responding well,’ Morris said. ‘I'm already sitting up. I'm very fortunate.’ On May 30, the stitches in his arms were removed and he was fitted for prosthetics. The stitches in his legs were removed several days later. Adventurer: Danielle Kelly (right) said he and Morris have always loved water sports and nature . Morris’ sisters, Molly and Claire, have been organizing fundraisers at home. His brother, Riley, is serving in the Iowa National Guard, and his father, Dan, has been at the hospital with his son as often as work permits. Morris has had visits from other wounded warriors; top military personnel, including the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps; Congressman  Bruce Braley and actor Joe Mantegna, an advocate for returning veterans. While he said that his medical bills are covered, the 23-year-old man with a love of the great outdoors said that he has always dreamed of building a log cabin in the woods on a lake where he could live with his girlfriend, Danielle Kelly. ‘Taylor and I are both savers, and we had been working our butts off to ensure we'd have a cabin, close to water to do water sports, and places we can hike,’ Kelly said. ‘After what happened, we will not abandon that dream if it takes years of saving.’ The Chive invited viewers to make contributions toward Morris’ dream cabin, setting the goal at $30,000, but just 12 hours later, $143,000 had been raised through online donations at TaylorMorris.org. Donations have now exceeded $250,000 and the family's website was experiencing technical problems today because so many people were reading his remarkable story. Cheques also may be made out to the .

"Animal protection activists are planning to become 'human shields' for a wild boar population which they say is facing the biggest government cull in its history. Campaigners in Forest of Dean claim the Forestry Commission wants to kill up to 500 of the animals using four trained marksmen, after numbers allegedly leaped from 535 to 819 in just one year. But they insist no one knows exactly how many boar live in the wild - and other government figures estimate there are fewer than 1,000 in the whole of England. Cull: Government marksmen will descend in the next few weeks on the Forest of Dean, where a population of wild boar (pictured) has been living for several years. Activists are planning to sabotage the cull . Idyllic: . But campaigner Drew Pratten, who plans to sabotage the cull, admitted . boar were 'a Marmite animal'. He added: 'People either love them or hate . them - and when they hate them, they really hate them' (file photo) That means the Gloucestershire forest could lose its entire population or the remaining boar could become inbred and diseased, the activists claim. Wild boar were extinct in England for around 300 years, but reappeared in the Forest of Dean in the 1990s after a herd escaped. More were later released into the wild and there are also herds in Kent, Sussex, Dorset and Devon. They divide residents, some of whom welcome their return while others raise safety fears and complain their gardens have been turned upside down. Marksmen will descend on the historic forest in the next few weeks and could remain until the breeding season begins next spring. The culls have happened most years since boar were reintroduced into the forest, but campaigners say this year's actions are going further than ever before. Spread: There are established wild boar populations in four locations in the south, according to Natural England . A Forestry Commission 'census' claims the boar population in the Forest of Dean has soared to 819, a huge increase from the 535 recorded last year. But 46-year-old Drew Pratten, one of 30 activists living in the forest who are preparing to sabotage the marksmen, said there was huge doubt over the figures. Mr Pratten has been to district council meetings where he claims the number of boar to be culled has been put as high as 500. That is despite figures by Natural England, another government agency, suggesting there are 'probably' no more than 500 boar in the three main established populations in England and certainly fewer than 1,000. He said: 'It sounds incredibly heroic, standing between them and the guns, but these guys are trained marksmen and they can't shoot us. We just stand there and they can't do anything. 'There are only four marksmen and we know what they look like, so we don't need fancy tracking devices. We've got a lot of supporters in the forest who ring us and tell us where they are. 'And in a . stroke of absolute genius they've picked September which is the same . time as the badger cull. That means there are likely to be more . activists around who support our cause.' Beauty spot: Boar became a common sight in the Gloucestershire forest in the 1990s after a long absence . Wild boar are the ancestors of modern-day farming pigs, which began being domesticated thousands of years ago. Feasting on roots, fruits and nuts along with small animals, they can grow up to 7ft long from head to tail tip and weigh up to 200kg. Females and youngsters form herds of up to 50 which stay safe in the wild with thick bristly bodies and large tusks, while males often roam solo looking for a mate. The animals reach sexual maturity at around 18 months and live for 15 to 20 years, sleeping in dens in the forest. Although they shy away from human contact, they often wallow for hours in mud baths to remove parasites and are most active at dawn and dusk when they forage for food. Source: Young People's Trust for the Environment . The pledge puts the activists on the warpath with forest officials, despite them insisting they will only use legal means. Deputy Surveyor Kevin Stannard recently claimed some activists had launched 'psychological intimidation' against his staff with a 'threat of physical attacks'. It is believed hostile comments began gathering online under a photograph which had been circulated of one of the marksmen cradling a gun. Mr Pratten said the photograph was deleted when the comments emerged. The boar, meanwhile, have come into conflict with dogs, with council bosses saying a number of pets have been 'seriously injured' and advising owners to keep dogs on a short lead. Residents are also told not to leave out food for the boar and to avoid walking through dense undergrowth where they might encounter them at close quarters. Mr Pratten dismissed many safety concerns about the animals, saying neighbours who objected to them were mostly worried about their gardens being dug up. 'They're a Marmite animal', he said. 'People either love them or hate them - and when they hate them, they really hate them. 'I've never heard of anyone saying ""they're going to attack a child in the end"" - it's always ""have you seen what they did to the verges, they dug up so-and-so's garden or field"". 'At the end of the day this is a forest. If people want to live in a garden they should go to suburbia.' Forest of Dean resident Scott Passmore, 36, who runs the campaign group A Wild Life with Animals, added forestry bosses should be using non-lethal methods like contraception. 'There are claims that we have 800 or 900 boar but if you speak to anybody who walks in the forest they're seeing fewer and fewer,' he said. Majesty: The animals were extinct in England for around 300 years but have been reintroduced in forest areas. They also thrive in parts of Europe including the Bavarian Forest National Park in Germany (pictured) 'There are a couple of years where they've had to suspend the cull because they over-culled the year before, which shows the danger we're looking at. 'A couple of the boar have got into people's gardens - yeah, it's not nice, but I'm not sure that it warrants a mass slaughter. 'If you live in a forest you should expect wildlife and you've had ten years to put up a fence.' There are three well-established feral boar populations in the country, according to the government body Natural England. The largest, in the woodlands of Kent and Sussex, was estimated in 2004 at having around 200 animals. The Forest of Dean and Ross on Wye area was the second-largest while west Dorset had fewer than 50. There are also thought to be around 50 on the fringes of Dartmoor, Devon, after escapes and releases between 2005 and 2007. Despite the resurgence Natural England says there are 'probably no more than around 500 in the established populations, and almost certainly fewer than 1000 in total'. The cull is supported by the Forest of Dean District Council. A spokesman said: 'As a Council we acknowledge that this is an issue of much community interest. 'At a Full Council meeting in February, the democratically elected members debated and agreed for the Council to support the Forestry Commission in adopting effective management methods.' Adorable: Wild boar piglets in the Forest of Dean - but the adult animals can come into conflict with dogs . But Mr Passmore said: 'Boars are very good for the forest because they constantly turn the earth which allows wildflowers to grow. 'I think it's brilliant that they're back. They're the truest wild boars you'll find anywhere in Europe and people come from all around the UK and pay a lot of money to try and spot one.' A Forestry Commission spokesman told MailOnline figures for the 2014/15 cull have not yet been confirmed, but 135 were culled last season. On the alleged 'threats', she said: 'Gloucestershire Police are aware of the . threats made to Forestry Commission staff and we will not be commenting . further on this.' She added: 'Wildlife rangers will work around individuals, always ensuring safety considerations are the highest priority.'","Campaigners claim Forestry Commission wants to cull 'up to 500' wild boar .

"Police are investigating the desecration of more than 60 historic gravestones at Bathurst Cemetery, after an act of vandalism locals have labelled 'atrocious' and 'disgusting'. The headstones belonging to the early residents of the regional NSW town were found smashed into pieces on Wednesday. Local volunteer groups said they were disappointed by the destruction as they were almost finished restoring the old graves, which date back as far as 1846, in time for the Bathurst bicentenary celebrations next year. Barry Konemann from the Bathurst Family History Group discovered 67 damaged graves at Bathurst Cemetary on Wednesday morning . Bathurst Family History Group member secretary Barry Konemann discovered the damaged graves at 8.45am yesterday. Mr Konemann said the vandals targeted historic graves in Christian sections of the cemetery, with 42 Catholic headstones and 25 Church of England headstones damaged. 'It's significant that they're only in the older part of the cemetery,' Mr Konemann told MailOnline. Bathurst District Historical Society president Alan McRae said he was sickened by the 'wanton destruction'. Bathurst District Historical Society president Alan McRae (left), pictured with Mr Konemann, said he thought the attack was deliberate and was carried out by two or more people . 'It's not just a walk through and push a couple of things over there's too much damage for that,' Mr McRae said. 'Some of the headstones are in three and four and five and six pieces.' Mr McRae said he thought the attack was deliberate and was carried out by two or more people. 'I just don't see any point, there's one grave there I noticed that was a three-year-old boy's grave,' he said. 'They didn't read they just smashed. The vandals targeted historic graves in Christian sections of the cemetery, with 42 Catholic headstones and 25 Church of England headstones damaged . 'They're not just the history there the resting places of early residents and any grave site should be respected no matter what religion or whatever it is.' Mr Konemann said he didn't think any of the graves destroyed belonged to historical figures, but he said the headstones dated back to the 1800s. 'It just seems to me that they've taken all the old ones but for what reason I've got no idea,' he said. He added that the vandalised spots were well spread out and on diagonally opposite parts of the cemetery. Local volunteer groups said they were disappointed by the destruction as they were almost finished restoring the old graves, which date back as far as 1846 . 'From where the damage occurred in the Catholic section to where damage started in the Church of England section would be 100 yards,' he said. Mr Konemann said it looked like the headstones were pushed over, which caused them to shatter. He added people with family members in the cemetery had called him since hearing about the vandalism, but so far he hasn't spoken to anyone whose family members' graves had been affected. Mr Konemann, along with other members of Bathurst Family History Group, had been working for the past two and a half years to restore the old graves in time for the Bathurst bicentenary celebrations in 2015. One of the graves desecrated belonged to a three-year-old boy . 'We've restored very many headstones over that time and we were getting towards the end of it but not anymore,' he said. Mr Konemann said the damage occurred sometime between 3pm on Friday when he last visited the cemetery and 8.45am Wednesday morning. Locals have expressed their outrage on Facebook, labelling the crime disrespectful. Mr Konemann said the damage occurred sometime between 3pm on Friday when he last visited the cemetery and 8.45am Wednesday morning . 'So hard to believe anyone could such a disgusting thing.

"Move over Cronuts, here comes the pizzaburger. Created by Boston’s Restaurant and Sports Bar, the pepperoni pizza-wrapped bacon cheeseburger packs a walloping 1,360 calories and 2,000 milligrams of sodium. Available now in the chain’s 40 US restaurants, it was initially launched at a Canadian subsidiary. The frankenburgers were conceived by company brass who wanted to have a little fun with the celebrity baby craze, a spokesperson told MailOnline. Like a calzone: The burger is baked inside thee pizza and comes out like a calzone . Baked in the same pizza pans used to make personal pizzas, the frankenburgers and have no illusions of being healthy. ‘We're not pretending that it's a healthy product,’ Brad Bevill, vice president of marketing for the chain, told USA Today. ‘You're talking about a hamburger and pizza wrapped together.’ A YouTube video shows cooks placing the burger, with all the fixins, in a pizza pan complete with an uncooked pizza. The burger is then wrapped in the pizza and tossed in the oven. People are soon shown enjoying the creation. The heart bombs are garnished with lettuce, pickle and tomato, but no one in the video seemed to have any need for them. They retail for $10.29 at one Connecticut location. Meet the pizzaburger: A bacon cheeseburger wrapped in pepperoni pizza . Initially launched during the Spring in Canada, at the ubiquitous Boston’s Pizza, the calzone-like creation bumped burger sales up 250 per cent, said the spokesperson. The burger is now available at the chain's US-based Boston's Restaurant and Sports Bar. ‘Canada’s been huge, and so far, so good, it’s been taking off pretty well,’ the spokesperson said. The idea for the burger came when corporate decided to capitalize on the country’s fascination with celebrity babies – an obsession hilariously mocked in Conan O’Brien’s ‘If They Mated’ skits for years. ‘They wanted to do something fun and creative,’ said the spokesperson, asking ‘what if the pizza and the burger had a baby?’ They have, and the result of their unholy union is the pizzaburger. The record holder: The Heart Attack Grill serves 10,000 calorie burgers, fries deep-fried in lard and butterfat shakes . Though unhealthy, this burger doesn't come close to the record-holding calorie bombs served at the Heart Attack Grill, in Las Vegas, NV. The notorious restaurant serves bypass burgers, flatline fries deep-fried in pure lard and gives free food to anyone over 350 pounds - provided they climb onto a scale and prove it. The shameless fast-food temple's quadruple bypass burger hold the Guinness World Record for 'most calorific burger,' with almost 10,000 calories. Thrown in a butterfat milkshake and fries for a staggering 12,410 calorie meal - the equivalent of over a week's worth of food. At least one customer is known to have had an actual heart attack while eating in the restaurant.","The burger packs 1,360 calories and 2,000 milligrams of sodium .

"Jeremy Forrest, 32, (above) from East Sussex, was jailed for five-and-a-half years in June last year for abducting the schoolgirl and having sex with a minor . Paedophile Jeremy Forrest is said to be facing an emotional ‘reunion’ with the schoolgirl he was jailed for running off to France with. Forrest, 32, from Ringmer near Lewes, East Sussex, has not seen the girl, now 17, since he was jailed for five-and-a-half years in June last year for abducting her and having sex with a minor. The maths teacher, who has previously insisted he is not a paedophile but simply fell in love with his pupil, triggered an international manhunt when he fled with the youngster across the English Channel. Despite being tracked down by police and convicted of abducting the teenager, Forrest - who taught at Bishop Bell School in East Sussex - is now said to be keen to meet his former pupil and victim face-to-face. Senior socials workers are said to be considering a ‘consultation period’ to decide whether the pair can meet at HMP Channings Wood in Devon, where Forrest is currently serving his sentence. Officials have written to the Prison Service to enquire as to whether the pair can meet and to outline a plan should they be given the go ahead, The Mirror reported. While it is unclear who initially suggested the meeting, both Forrest and the schoolgirl – who cannot be named for legal reasons – are aware of the proposal. A source told the newspaper: ‘It is thought that such a meeting could give a lot of closure over the things that happened to them both. ‘It would only happen if both sides agreed and the girl was completely happy with it. There is absolutely no pressure from either side.’ It comes after Forrest was moved from Lewes Prison, East Sussex over 200 miles away to Channings Wood last August after the girl allegedly tried to contact him and obtain visitor rights. It was reported at the time that the teenager managed to get a letter to Forrest and bombarded the governor with calls demanding to see him. The schoolgirl was just 15 when she fled the country with Forrest, who left behind his wife and career, to start a new life together. Forrest had groomed her from when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils, and after taking her virginity one week after her 15th birthday in his marital home, the pair left for France using the fake names of Jack Dean and Gemma Grant. At first, the girl’s devastated family feared she had been kidnapped but soon after they fled the country, CCTV footage showed her with her arms around the teacher on board a ferry from Dover to Calais. They were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux where he was arrested in front of her. He was convicted at Lewes Crown Court in June last year for child abduction and five counts of sexual activity with a child and jailed for five-and-a-half years. It means the former teacher, who was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life, could be out on parole as early as next year. Forrest and the schoolgirl have previously spoken of their plans to marry following his release. After Forrest’s sentencing, the schoolgirl said: ‘I love Jeremy so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with him and maybe once he’s out, we can marry and have children.’ Scroll down for video . Forrest and the girl, then 15, (above) were on the run for eight days before being found in Bordeaux, France . However, it is not known whether their plans were scuppered when news broke earlier this year that the teenager had started a relationship with a boy her own age. In March it was reported that she had fallen for a 20-year-old PE teaching assistant and part-time security guard. Because the girl is now 16 and the new teacher does not work at her current school, their relationship is not illegal. Maths teacher Forrest (pictured) groomed the teenager from when she was one of his 14-year-old pupils and took her virginity a week after her 15th birthday at the home he shared with his wife near Lewes, East Sussex . While it is not known what Forrest made of the news, he is still said to have feelings for the schoolgirl. In a recent letter he wrote to explain his feelings, he reportedly said: ‘The reason why contact is so vital to us is because of the support and stability our relationship gives our lives.’ Both Forrest and the schoolgirl and her family are said to have been informed of the proposal for them to meet, and a source close to his family said the request to do so had been ongoing for the last eight months. Senior social workers are said to have written to HMP Channings Wood in Devon (above) to outline plans for a potential meeting between Forrest and the schoolgirl. Both parties are said to be aware of the proposed meet . ‘If it is for the girl’s benefit and well-being, the Jeremy would like this meeting to happen,’ the source told The Mirror. The teenager’s family refused to comment on the matter. It is thought a case meeting between social workers and East Sussex Council will now be held in the coming weeks to make a final decision on whether the meeting can go ahead.

Fears were raised after a video was caught on webcam showing Tangmere passing through Dawlish in Devon on Sunday in flames . The steam train is operated by The Railway Touring Company who say that there was no fire . Tangmere is one of the Battle of Britain class locomotives. It was completed in 1947 at Brighton Works and named after a military airfield in Sussex and was for use across the entire Southern Railway. The Battle of Britain class were built post war, in a tight financial climate, and as a result of this were amongst the first to be fitted with steel fire boxes instead of copper. Tangmere is one of the Battle of Britain class locomotives. It was completed in 1947 at Brighton Works and named after a military airfield in Sussex . Tangmere was used on both freight and passenger trains until withdrawal in November 1963 after covering almost 700,000 miles. Rescued from Barry Scrapyard in 1980, from which 213 steam locomotives were saved for preservation, Tangmere moved through various bases during its restorations until finally returning to mainline steam in 2003.

"Australian spies will soon get unprecedented powers to help fight terrorism, including giving ASIO operatives the ability to monitor phones, iPads, laptops and any other devices at and address with just one search warrant. And anyone who outs a member of the security services faces ten years behind bars - a tenfold increase in the penalty. The government's first tranche of tougher anti-terrorism laws, which beef up the domestic spy agency's powers, passed the Senate on Thursday with bipartisan support. Attorney-General George Brandis said in a 'newly dangerous age' it was vital that those protecting Australia were equipped with the powers and capabilities they needed. Attorney-General George Brandis, seen her speaking earlier this week, has said the new terror laws will give ASIO stronger powers . The bill will now be sent to the House of Representatives, where passage is all but guaranteed. The legislation addresses a number of recommendations of a bipartisan joint parliamentary inquiry into Australia's national security laws. It allows ASIO to access third party computers and apply one warrant to multiple devices. After concerns were raised by Labor and Liberal Democratic Senator David Leyonhjelm, the government agreed to amend the legislation to specifically rule out ASIO using torture. 'ASIO cannot, does not and has never engaged in torture,' Senator Brandis said. The Palmer United Party was successful in amending the law so anyone who exposes an undercover ASIO operative could face up to 10 years behind bars instead of one. This included 'reckless' journalists, whistleblowers and bloggers who disclose sensitive information, Fairfax Media report. The new laws as the largest terror raids in Australia took place last week across Sydney and Melbourne . The Australian Greens voted against the bill, slamming the new measures as extreme and a 'relentless expansion of powers' of the surveillance state. Senator Leyonhjelm and Independent Senator Nick Xenophon - who moved a number of unsuccessful amendments - also opposed the legislation. Others have also criticised the laws saying they would put a lid on any national security reporting, crippling what would be allowed to be reported. The legal changes come amid growing concern over Islamic State (IS) extremists in the Middle East and terror threats at home. The legislation will also help stamp out home-grown terrorists, such as terror suspect Numan Haider who was shot dead on Tuesday after stabbing two police officers . IS has ordered followers to directly target civilian Australians. In less than a week, police in two states launched the biggest terror raids in Australia's history, and shot dead a known terror suspect after he stabbed two officers in Melbourne. A second suite of anti-terror laws targeting foreign fighters was introduced on Wednesday and will be debated next month. These changes have opposition support and would make it a criminal office to travel to a terrorist hot-spot without a reasonable excuse. The government is aware of about 60 Australians fighting in Syria and Iraq. A third bill enabling the collection of metadata will be introduced later this year.","ASIO will have stronger powers under the new terror laws .

"A 45-year-old mother-of-five, who has had two of her children as a result of IVF, and two via surrogacy, was stunned to find herself pregnant by natural means in April, following a 20-year battle with fertility. 'After two decades without a spontaneous conception; after countless ovarian stimulation cycles, multiple intrauterine insemination and more than five IVF attempts...

Miracle baby: Mrs Savage is astonished to be having a healthy pregnancy, after 'two decades without a spontaneous conception... countless ovarian stimulation cycles, multiple intrauterine insemination and more than five IVF attempts' Mrs Savage, who is now almost 15 weeks pregnant, and husband Sean, 44, have been having unprotected sex for the duration of their 21-year marriage, and have only conceived naturally once, 20 years ago; so Mrs Savage could hardly believe it when she saw the results of her home pregnancy test a few months ago. She 'immediately' raced to her computer to Google 'pregnant at 45,' and was met with a wash of gloomy statistics. 'Some of the sites reported miscarriage rates as high as 90per cent for a woman my age,' she writes. 'I told Sean later that night and followed the news up with the sobering statistics and the warning, ""This probably won’t last.""' As the couple anxiously 'waited' to lose their baby, time progressed and Mrs Savages' routine examinations flew by without a hitch. Agonizing road: Mrs Savage and her husband Sean, 44, (left) had eldest son Drew, 19, (center left) naturally, followed by Ryan, 17, (center right) and Mary Kate, six, (center) by IVF, and twins Isabella and Regan, three (in red) via a surrogate . 'Finally, at 15 weeks, we received the results of our cell free DNA study: Our baby was chromosomally typical, and he is a boy,' she reveals. 'I’ve left the morbid state of waiting to miscarry and moved onto a happier, more confident - but not cocky - place.' Already a mother-of-five, Mrs Savage's first son Drew, 19, was her only naturally conceived child, followed by a heart-breaking series of miscarriages and complicated pregnancies over the years. Twin joy: Three years ago, the couple had daughters Isabella and Regan (pictured) via a surrogate, after being told by doctors that Mrs Savage couldn't carry any more children due to her HELLP syndrome . Her next eldest son Ryan, 17, was a result of IVF, as was her daughter Mary Kate, six. Her following IVF pregnancy was in 2009, this time when her fertility clinic mistakenly implanted her with the embryo of another couple, Shannon and Paul Morrell. Knowing how much this baby was wanted, Mrs Savage made the life-altering decision to carry the child, Logan, now six, to full term and reunite him with his parents. She writes that she loved Logan as her own and still 'thinks and prays for him' every day. Baby Logan: Mr and Mrs Savage in 2009 with the child she birthed for another couple (center), pictured with their children, Mary Kate, then three (left), Ryan, then 14 (right) and Drew, then 16 (top right) Because Mrs Savage suffers from a pregnancy-related condition called HELLP syndrome, which can cause life-threatening pre-eclampsia, she was told while carrying Logan that her uterus was simply unable to carry any more children. 'I’ve left the morbid state of waiting to miscarry and moved onto a happier, more confident place' So in 2011, Mrs Savage and her husband used a surrogate, nurse Jennifer O'Nash, to birth their twin girls, Isabella and Regan, now three, and settled happily with their 'happy ending' - a brood of five. Now, in an unexpected twist, the thrilled couple looks set to have their sixth child in the same manner as their first, completely naturally, closing a two-decade long loop with a discovery that Mrs Savage aptly describes as: 'The stuff of fairy tales.'","Carolyn Savage, an Ohio mother-of-five, made headlines in 2009 when a clinic implanted her with the wrong embryo, and she gave birth to another couple's baby for them .

"The Queen came face-to-face with millions of portraits of herself today, as she visited a stamp factory in Wolverhampton. During the visit to International Security Printers, she was shown printing machines, as well as a stamp archive. But Her Majesty, who was making her first visit to Wolverhampton since 1994, certainly didn't appear to mind and beamed as she was shown around the plant in the Midlands city's i54 business park. Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh for the visit, the Queen, who was resplendent in a colourful turquoise ensemble, looked delighted by her welcome, smiling as she spotted a large crowd of well-wishers outside. Scroll down for video . Is that one of me? The Queen comes face-to-face with thousands of portraits of herself during a visit to a stamp factory . Make sure you do it properly! The finer points of stamp making are explained to the Queen during the visit . Don't I look lovely! The Queen's profile adorns every stamp produced in the UK - and British currency as well . Not her again! The Duke of Edinburgh is shown a large roll of stamps, all of which bear his wife's portrait . Delighted: Despite the lengthy hiatus between visits, both the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh looked delighted to be in Wolverhampton . As they toured the business, the Queen was shown the printing machines at work before being taken to view a display of archived stamps and unveiling a plaque to commemorate the visit. But the royal couple couldn't stay long and were whisked off for their second engagement of the day at the city's brand new Jaguar Land Rover factory which was recently completed at a cost of £500m and will create up to 1,400 jobs in the area. The Queen, who formally opened the plant, toured the factory and was introduced to an excited group of local school children before being treated to a private lunch with the directors and the Duke of Edinburgh. How very kind: The Queen looked thrilled as she was handed a bouquet on her way out of the stamp factory . Big arrival: The Queen's first stop was at International Security Printers at Wolverhampton's i54 business centre . Nice to be back: Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were on cheerful form as they arrived in Wolverhampton . Thrilled: International Security Printers managing director Paul White looks utterly delighted as he's introduced to the Queen . Wonderful day: Fellow managing director Ian Brignam looks delighted as the monarch beams at him while shaking his hand . Paying attention: The Queen looks on intently along with Paul White as the finer points of quality control are explained . So that's how it's done: The Queen comes face-to-face with thousands of her portraits as she watches a stamp cutting machine at work . Although declared officially open today, the Jaguar Land Rover plant will not start full production until early 2015 - but has caused much excitement among locals and is the first new factory that the company has built from the ground up. The facility will manufacture a new family of engines called Ingenium - the first engines to be entirely designed and built in-house by Jaguar Land Rover for exclusive use in the company’s future vehicles. The Queen is herself a fan of Jaguar Land Rover's vehicles and has often been photographed driving around the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire in a Land Rover. Inner workings: The Queen looks on, clearly enjoying the visit, as she is shown a stamp cutting and finishing machine . Impressive stuff: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are given a closer look at some of the enormous stamp printing machines . Important: The Queen opened the new Jaguar Land Rover factory which is expected to bring up to 1,400 new jobs to the area . Interested: Prince Philip has long had an interest in science and technology and, like the Queen, is regularly seen in his Land Rover . Wonderful: The Queen beamed broadly as she was met by flag-waving school children at the Jaguar Land Rover plant . Did you do that? The Duke of Edinburgh looks impressed as he chats to an excited group of school children at the Jaguar plant . Top form: The Duke of Edinburgh certainly appeared to enjoy his visit to Wolverhampton - his first since 1994 . Technology: The new factory will produce innovative new engines that will be used exclusively in Jaguar Land Rover cars . Clever: The Queen has the new engine parts explained to her by Jaguar Land Rover chief executive Dr Ralf Speth . But she has had little time for peaceful drives in recent weeks, thanks to a heavy schedule that included a reception for Victoria and George Cross holders at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday and a meeting with the Emir of Qatar yesterday. The visit to Wolverhampton also marks the first time she has ventured outside London since returning from her annual summer holiday at Balmoral in September and her first visit to the Midlands for two years - the last being during the Diamond Jubilee tour. It is not the first time the Midlands city has enjoyed a royal visit from a reigning queen, however. In 1866, Queen Victoria visited the city and was driven through the city in an open landau to Market Square (now called Queen Square), where she unveiled a statue of Prince Albert. So impressed was the monarch with the event and the enthusiasm of the crowds, she stopped to knight the mayor, a man named John Morris, once the unveiling ceremony was complete. Interest: Prince Philip, who has long had an interest in technology, is shown engine parts by director of manufacturing Wolfgang Stadler . Impressive: The brand new factory will begin production early next year, creating up to 1,400 jobs in Wolverhampton . Interested: The royal couple listened to company executives speak about the positive impact the factory is expected to have . Big opening: After officially opening the new factory, the Queen signed the visitor's book as the Duke of Edinburgh looked on . It has been named the fifth worst city in the world and was dubbed the least happy place to live in the Midlands, so why on Earth would the Queen want to pay a visit to Wolverhampton? The answer is because it's brilliant. Today, for instance, the monarch is set to open a new Jaguar plant. Not only has her visit gotten locals talking, it’s set to create 1,400 jobs. Those who hail from Wolverhampton like myself will know this is the best news we’ve had since Wolves got promoted to the Championship and local lad Liam Payne (the one from the Midlands who isn’t Harry Styles) landed a spot in One Direction. And Wolverhampton has plenty to offer the Queen too. My advice? Stop by the Civic Hall to hear the dulcet tones of Beverley Knight, pop in at Katie Price’s hairdresser Royston Blythe for a perm and round off the day with a curry at The Bilash (the only Michelin rated restaurant we have to offer). It might look grey from the outside but those of us who live there and love it know that Wolverhampton really is one of the best cities in the world. Bianca London .

"The federal government has fast-tracked new laws forcing telecommunication companies to retain metadata for police and intelligence agency investigations. Police and spy agencies will have a better chance of catching terrorists and other criminals under the new mandatory data retention scheme, according to the federal government.

Law enforcement agencies have been critical of telcos erasing their metadata - background information about phone calls and text and internet messages - saying this has deterred major investigations into terrorism and child exploitation. The laws were expected to be introduced in 2015 after further consultation but were instead rushed into parliament on Thursday after a brief coalition party room meeting. Metadata is believed to have played a central role in most counter-terrorism, espionage and organised crime investigations. ASIO boss Duncan Lewis said 'we have had four major mass casualty plans in this country, all of these were thwarted by access to metadata' Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull stressed access to the metadata content would require a warrant . Metadata can be used by spy agencies to check whether Australian radicals are communicating with militants in the Middle East . 'We have used the metadata for over half a century .. and seek to have continuing access to metadata stores,' said ASIO director general Duncan Lewis. 'We have had four major mass casualty plans in this country, all of these were thwarted by access to metadata. 'The seriousness of the crimes that are resolved through the access to metadata is critical.' Although it is unclear exactly what constitutes metadata, it will not include web browsing history, website addresses (URLs) or the content of calls and emails, reports the Brisbane Times. Mr Turnbull stressed that any official access to the content would require a warrant. 'No responsible government can sit by while those who protect our community lose access to the tools they need to do their job,' he said. 'In the current threat environment we cannot let this problem become worse.' There will be independent oversight of the laws and the Attorney-General's department must report each year on the scheme's operation. A draft dataset and the bill will be referred to the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. Doubts surface. The new legislation comes after Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed he's had second thoughts about an earlier tranche of the government's national security laws . The new legislation comes after Opposition Leader Bill Shorten revealed he's had second thoughts about an earlier tranche of the government's national security laws. Mr Shorten has written to Prime Minister Tony Abbott to raise concerns over legislation passed by parliament last month that could see journalists jailed for up to ten years. But Senator Brandis said that a national security legislation monitor will soon be put in place and part of that role is to allay fears that journalists may be prosecuted for doing their job.

"A Chinese car salesman started a fire in a busy exhibition hall after he used a phone charger to try and restart a car with a dead battery. The incident happened at an exhibition in Wuhan city, in central China's Hubei province, while the vehicles were being put in position and as the public queued up outside. Some of the cars needed to be started for the show, including a Cadillac Escalade, but it wouldn't turn over because its battery was flat. The Cadillac Escalade billows smoke from under its bonnet at an exhibition in China, as a man with a fire extinguisher stands near by; a salesman suggested using a phone charger to kick-start its flat battery . Instead of charging the battery, the car went up in smoke, as exhibitors stood around watching . A salesman then offered his phone charger, suggesting that might do the job. But instead of firing up the ignition, the charger caused the truck to catch fire, sparking a major alert as dozens of fire engines rushed to the congress centre. Things got even worse for the salesman when the fire spread to a second car which had a leaky fuel pipe which then ignited. Those involved with the exhibition tried to put the fire out, before fire fighters arrived and extinguished the blaze . As salespeople fled, fireman stepped in and extinguished the blaze. The car manufacturers said that the fire had started because rats had nibbled through a petrol cable and denied that anything was wrong with the vehicles.","Several cars needed to be started before an exhibition in central China .

"People play down the amount they consume . It could be the struggling slimmer's best friend - or an irritating nightmare. Clothing fitted with multiple 3D cameras that track everything you put in your mouth is being hailed as the future of dieting . The tiny cameras, embedded in clothes, could help abolish one of the main reasons for failed diets: underestimating the amount of calories we consume . People frequently calculate calories inaccurately when dieting, most likely playing down the amount they consume. And there's no doubt that this 'guestimation' has a detrimental effect to dieters' waistlines. Now though scientists have developed special cameras that can be worn throughout the day - and will document exactly how much the wearer is eating. The 3D cameras keep track of food intake by taking multiple images of the food and calculating how many calories it contains. It works by taking information on the volume of food, using the plate as a scale reference, and by looking at the shape of the food to ascertain what it is. It runs the information through a database to provide an accurate assessment of the number of calories in the dish. The researchers tested the 'eButton' camera device on 17 foods, including burgers, broccoli, fish, ketchup and peanut butter. Ketchup, haddock and ice cream gave researchers problems. Their geometric properties resulted in the largest estimation errors. In the case of the ketchup, it was too small, whereas the ice cream and haddock had concave surfaces, which led to an overestimation of their volumes. The University of Pittsburgh scientists including Hsin-Chen Chen et al, who devised the gadget, say that better understanding of intake - thanks to more accurate information - could lead to better overall health and help tackle chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. a) The eButton contains an (b) electronic circuit board and takes automatic photos of food while (c) attached to the wearer's shirt .

The fascinating gadget is still in primitive stages of development. Femail emailed the team at Pittsburgh with queries about how the cameras would compute salad dressings and sandwich fillings, and how they would calculate the calories, but they had not got back to us at the time of publishing.

"Hunted: An artist's impression shows a primitive Yeti emerging from a cave . They have long been thought to be merely the stuff of legend. But Russian officials say they have found ‘indisputable evidence’ that yetis exist – and are living in Siberia. The bold claim follows an international conference and expedition to track down the Abominable Snowman in the Mount Shoria area. However, doubt has already been cast on the ‘find’ – as the team has no convincing photographic or DNA evidence. Their claim appears to be based on bent branches, a single unclear footprint and a small sample of grey ‘hair’, found in a cave. The administration of the Kemerovo region, where the cave is situated, yesterday announced that ‘indisputable evidence’ had been found. But critics said the expedition was more about making the area a tourist destination than true science. Researchers who led the search said that they are closer than ever to catching one the creatures. 'During the expedition to the Azasskaya cave, conference participants gathered indisputable proof that the Shoria mountains are inhabited by the Snow Man,' the Kemerovo region administration announced yesterday. 'They found his footprints, his supposed bed, and various markers with which the Yeti uses to denote his territory.' The markers appeared to be mainly broken trees and some Russian media reports have treated the Yeti claims with considerable scepticism. Despite this, the local government officials professed themselves either certain or 95 per cent certain of the existence of Yeti in a highland area known as Mount Shoria. Hiding place? The Shoria mountains in the Kemerovo region of Russia where the cave supposedly belonging to the Yeti was found . On the trail: A strange footprint found in the snow which the expedition believe belongs to a neanderthal creature . The researchers themselves were less . keen than the officials to claim the Yeti is definitely real. They . stressed that the hair sample should be analysed for DNA - a process now . underway - before any claims were made. A bed of sticks they claimed that the Yeti had slept on is not thought to have contained hair samples. Despite this, Dr Igor Burtsev, leader of the international event - the first of its kind for half a century, claimed it would not be long before people everywhere would appreciate the Yeti's existence. 'We are close to finally finding the Abominable Snowman,' he said. He claims around 30 Yetis live in the Kemerovo region, adding that they are Neandethal men who have survived to this day. It is clear that since the fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago there have been increased 'sightings' of Yeti, and it is claimed more than a dozen villagers and hunters in this vast mountainous region close to the town of Tashtagol have given written accounts of either seeing the beasts themselves or finding their tracks. There are also reports of the Yeti - claimed to be around 7ft-tall - stealing livestock from remote farms. The hair thought to be from a Yeti was found in the Kemerovo region 2,600 miles east of Moscow . The . first accounts of Yetis emerged before the 19th century from Buddhists . who believed that the creature inhabited the Himalayas. They . depicted the mysterious beast as having similarities to an ape and . carrying a large stone as a weapon while making a whistling sound. The . term Abominable Snowman was developed in 1921 following a book by . Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Howard-Bury called Mount Everest The . Reconnaissance. Popular . interest in creature gathered pace in early 20th century as tourists . began making their own trips to the region to try and capture the Yeti. They reported seeing strange markings in the snow. The . Daily Mail led a trip called the the Snowman Expedition in 1954 to . Everest. During the trip mountaineering leader John Angelo Jackson . photographed ancient paintings of Yetis and large footprints in the . snow. A number of hair . samples were also found that were believed to have come from a Yeti . scalp. British . mountaineer Don Whillans claimed to have witnessed a creature when . scaling Annapurna in 1970. He said that while searching for a campsite . he heard some odd cries which his guide attributed to a Yeti's call. That night, he saw a dark shape moving near his camp. It is understood none of these local eye-witnesses gave evidence directly to the session, though participants heard other accounts from around the globe. 'We were shown some twisted willow branches that are referred to as markers - they were convincing evidence of this hominoid,' said Canadian Yeti researcher, John Binderangel, who has spent three decades hunting for conclusive proof of the Yeti. 'There were also some tracks, but we're not quite sure what to make of them.' An American housewife told the conference she regularly feeds Yeti in her back garden in Michegan but was unable to produce a single photograph of an elusive creature rumoured to exist for thousands of years. One cynical Russian media report summed up the mission as 'we haven't actually found anything, but we very, very much wanted to have found something'. Shortly before the 'experts' arrived, another hunt to the same cave to find the Yeti was led by the 'Beast of the East' - former Russian heavyweight boxing champion Nikolai Valuyev. It ended in failure, though locals saw it as a key plank in the region's bid to boost tourism. 'Valuyev did not manage to meet the Yeti itself but on the way he discovered 'traces' such as broken tree branches,' said a spokesman. 'I saw lots of journalists but no Yetis,' admitted the boxer. Dmitry Islamov, Vice Governor of Kemerovo Region on Economics and Regional Development said: 'It doesn't matter that the Kuzbass might not have Yetis. The main thing is that when people come to the Shoria Mountains, they truly enjoy its unique nature.'","Villagers say 7ft-tall beast has been stealing livestock .

"A block on Chicago’s South Side that first lady Michelle Obama once called home is now regarded as the most dangerous stretch of road in one of the country’s most dangerous cities. The 6400 block of South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive, which includes the sprawling Parkway Gardens low-income apartment complex, has been christened O Block in recent years by the gang members who regularly fight for control of its streets and courtyards. The O stands for 20-year-old Odee Perry, a member of the Chicago Black Disciples gang, who was shot dead in 2011 - just one of 19 people shot on O Block between June 2011 and June 2014. The sprawling Parkway Gardens low-income apartment complex on Chicago's South Side has been the battleground for a vicious war between the rival Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples gangs in recent years . Michelle Obama, left, pictured as a young child with her older brother Craig Robinson: The family moved out of the Parkway Gardens  apartment complex in 1965 . That statistic makes it the most dangerous block in Chicago in terms of shootings over that three-year period, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. Parkway Gardens has become a haven for gangs and nowadays it is the Black Disciples and the Gangster Disciples who battle it out for supremacy. Another name that the gangs have given the area is ‘Wiiic City’ which stands for Wild, Insane, Crazy and their battles are glorified in the lyrics of local rappers such as Chief Keef. Yet it was once a very different story as one older residents who has lived in the area for over 25 years recalls. The 6400 block of South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive has been christened O Block in recent years by the gang members who regularly fight for control of its streets . The O in O Block stands for Odee Perry, left, a member of the Chicago Black Disciples gang who was shot dead in 2011. Rapper Chief Keef, right, has glorified the troubles of O Block in his lyrics . ‘It was nicer back then, flowers planted in the beds, the grass kept up, less violence in and around the complex. You have to watch yourself more these days,’ the unnamed woman told the Sun-Times. In the early 1960s, Parkway Gardens had been home to the family of Michelle Obama - then Michelle Robinson - and she spent the first two years of her life living there before her family moved in 1965. In a 2009 interview with Time magazine, she recalled her childhood memories of the complex as ‘a wonderful, small apartment building… but now when I pass it, it’s - I was, like, God, I never saw that apartment in the way that I’m seeing it now.’ The difference between the mid-1960s and today is drastic according to Rev. Corey Brooks of the New Beginnings Church of Chicago. ‘The environment was family-focused,’ he told the Sun-Times. ‘People were working. When you eliminate all those things from a community - men not in the household and education failing - it will be a drastic difference than what the first lady of the United States and her family experienced.’ The first lady recalls how the apartment complex was ‘a wonderful, small apartment building' but said when she passed the area in recent years if felt very different to how it was in the mid-1960s as rival gangs have taken over the once thriving area . Fortunately statics show that a change in policing in the area, suggested by a Yale sociologist who’s studied crime in Chicago, may be having an impact and the number of shootings is down. Since 2012, the number of shootings in Beat 312, which includes O Block, is down by 59 percent through September, the police say. In an effort to curb the violence, the police drew an 'impact zone' of five square blocks around O Block in February 2013 and more officers were assigned to patrol the area on foot. Strategies were also put in place to help identify potential troublemakers, while special attention was also paid to monitoring social media for threats between gang members. In the 20 months prior to the 'impact zone' strategy there were 32 shootings, while in the first 20 months since then there have only been 10 shootings. A clear sign of progress according to Alderman Willie Cochran (20th), a former police sergeant whose ward includes O Block. 'The presence and quick response of officers has deterred crime recently,' he said. 'We have not solved it 100 percent. But there has been a host of actions that have been taken.'","As a young child, the first lady lived on Parkway Gardens on the 6400 block of South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Chicago .

Nicholson, the most influential manager in the club's history, was honoured with a minute's applause, while Tottenham's players wore specially-made t-shirts and a host of former stars also paid their respect on the touchline. Darren Anderton, Martin Chivers, Ray Clemence and Pat Jennings were among those paying tributes ahead of the 1.30pm kick-off with the family of Nicholson also pitchside. Tottenham Hotspur legends paid tribute to former manager Bill Nicholson, who died 10 years ago this week . Former players waited on the White Hart Lane pitch before the game against Newcastle United on Sunday afternoon . Tottenham's players wore special t-shirts during their warm-up with Nicholson's famous 'Echo of Glory' phrase . T-shirts worn by the Tottenham players during their warm up had 'Echo of Glory' written on the front. The phrase was made famous when Nicholson said: 'It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.' Tottenham also produced a special souvenir match-day programme, which reportedly included never-before-seen photographs of his time at the club, as well as a free commemorative pin badge. The club also took the decision in the summer to pay tribute to Nicholson with their new kits. Tottenham's home kit for the season features the 'Echo of Glory' quote, while the away kit features 11 golden stripes representing the 11 trophies he won during his time at the club. Nicholson made more than 300 appearances for Tottenham before a spell as manager from 1958 to 1974 . During his 16 years at the club, Tottenham became the first British club  to win a major European trophy after clinching the 1963 Cup Winners Cup and the first club to win a League and Cup double in 1961.

"Britain could face a series of ‘brownouts’ this winter that would dim household lights, National Grid admits. Britain faces its greatest risk of power shortages in almost a decade, following the closure of coal-fired power stations to meet EU carbon targets. The gap between winter supply and demand for electricity will be 4.1 per cent – the lowest level in eight years. However, this safety margin would be wiped out for some periods in December and January in the event of an extreme cold snap. Scroll down for video . Pinch point: This chart shows how Britain's energy supply could fail to provide basic reserves this winter if the country has a one-in-20 cold snap. This is, however, before counting backup supplies or increased imports . Keeping the lights on: A one-in-20-years cold snap would see Britain fail to meet basic reserves, a report warns today. It blamed recent shutdowns including after a fire at Ferrybridge Power Station, West Yorkshire (pictured) The Grid has already made emergency plans to keep lights on – including paying factories to turn off machines during peak times. Energy firms could also be bribed to switch on back-up power stations, under measures that will also be funded by their customers through higher bills. Nevertheless, the organisation warns it may occasionally be necessary to ‘reduce voltage’ – causing so-called brownouts. Energy experts say this would not only dim the lights but could also interfere with electronic equipment, computers and electric clocks. Fossil fuels: National Grid has contingency plans to restart mothballed oil and gas power stations (file photo) Knocked out: Didcot B power station in Oxfordshire is due to come back online after a fire last week . The problems were detailed in National Grid’s Winter Outlook report, which states: ‘In the unlikely event that the amount of generation does not meet the amount of demand for a period of time, there are a number of enduring mitigating actions that National Grid can take.’ These could include ‘voltage reduction’, it adds. Jeremy Nicholson of the Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents major manufacturers, said: ‘There was an obsession early on with being the greenest government ever. ‘We all want to see cleaner energy – who wouldn’t? – but it is becoming increasingly obvious that we want clean energy at a price we can afford. ‘We urgently need to be building new gas fired power stations and get cracking on the nuclear programme.’ Britain’s energy crisis has been exacerbated by a series of fires at power stations this year. Four nuclear reactors were also shut down in August after investigators identified defects. National Grid and politicians insist there is no chance of homes losing power altogether, with Energy Secretary Ed Davey guaranteeing: ‘There will be no blackouts. Period.’ Nuclear reactors including at Heysham, Lancashire, will only return to 75 per cent capacity, the report said . However, energy analyst Peter Atherton, of Liberum Capital, warned: ‘The calculations that National Grid has done are nothing like the worst-case scenario. There may be false comfort from this.’ He said the Grid’s calculations assume that both nuclear reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool, currently offline for maintenance, are brought back into service before Christmas – and that there are no calm days on which wind turbines fail to generate electricity. He added: ‘If we see brownouts, what you will notice is the lights going dimmer. But it plays havoc with electronic equipment such as computers and electronic clocks.’","Gap between capacity and peak demand 4.1%, narrowest since 2006/07 .

"A three-year-old girl declared clinically dead by doctors who woke up at her own funeral has died. The tiny child from Zamboanga del Sur in southern Philippines 'died' on Friday and her family quickly arranged a funeral. During the Mass a relative heard movement and lifted the lid of the coffin and saw the youngster's head move. One of the mourners spots the girl move her head while inside the coffin before the funeral service . Her father . immediately grabbed his daughter from the coffin and gave her a cuddle. However, the story does not have a happy ending and the child has now . been pronounced dead again. Dr . Mary Silyne Asor-Cabahug, the Municipal Health Officer of Aurora, used a . cardiac monitor to assess the condition of the girl today but found no . signs of life and confirmed that the child is dead. Dr Cabahug advised the child's parents to bury her as soon as possible to prevent diseases. Footage of the amazing moment was captured by a mourner on a camera phone and uploaded onto the internet. Police senior inspector Heidil Teelan said the girl had been suffering a severe fever for several days and was taken to a medical clinic. He said: 'During that time, the attending clinic personnel and physician confirmed that the young patient had no more pulse and was clinically dead last Saturday morning about 9am. A mourner films the amazing scenes on a smartphone before uploading the footage on the internet . According to the Philippine Star the hospital told the family to take the girl home and prepare for a funeral service. Inspector Teelan said that while they were not the proper authority to confirm the medical case, but based on the accounts of the child’s parents, he could reveal that the girl experienced severe fever for days and was taken to the clinic in the town for medical attention last Friday. He said one of the mourners spotted the girl move her head while they were inspecting the coffin. He said: 'This prompted them to check and confirmed the girl had pulse and was alive. 'We really can not make confirmation on the status of the girl but based on the observation of the police personnel I deployed it appear the girl remained in a state of comatose in their house.'

"A single charger will have to be compatible with all mobile phones after a vote in the European Parliament. MEPs want to ban the plethora of chargers for sale to cut down on electronic ‘clutter’. It would end the hassle of having to buy a separate charger when swapping phones or having to hunt for the right charger when a phone battery goes flat and you are nowhere near home. MEPs want to ban the plethora of chargers for sale to cut down on electronic ¿clutter¿. File picture . But the move could also create headaches for manufacturers, as the rule could be enforced as early as 2017. The European Union voted for it yesterday as part of a radio equipment directive, which was pushed by German MEP and socialist, Barbara Weiler. The Social Democrat, who is part of the socialist grouping in Brussels, said that it would also prevent interference between different radio equipment devices. The move, which could be enforced as early as 2017, may create headaches for manufacturers. File pictures . She added, ‘I am especially pleased that . we agreed on the introduction of a common charger. This serves the . interests both of consumers and the environment. It will put an end to . charger clutter and 51,000 tonnes of electronic waste annually.’ But critics warned the single charger rule would lead to red tape for business and could trigger higher charges for consumers. Paul Nuttall, Ukip’s deputy leader, said: ‘This is a backwards step because imposing a single charger stifles innovation, curbs research, and may impose extra costs on the consumer. The alternative and better action is to encourage diversity, competition and greater development. Paul Nuttall, Ukip¿s deputy leader, called the move a 'backwards step' that will stifle innovation . ‘The EU is hamstrung by the ideology of one-size-fits-all, be it economic policy, currency, fisheries policy and now even phone chargers.

It will still have to be formally approved by the Council of Europe made up of ministers from across the EU. Member states will have two years to put the rules into their national laws and manufacturers will have an additional year to comply. There are at least half a billion mobile phones in the EU. Most of them use different chargers, even if they are the same brand but a slightly different model. Experts estimate that there are some 30 different types of charger currently on the market.

"England manager Roy Hodgson can count himself very fortunate that the FA have moved on from the World Cup debacle in Brazil with him still in charge of the national team. The last word on England’s dismal showing comes from Greg Dyke in his chairman’s statement, contained in the annual FA accounts, to be published shortly after being lodged with Companies House. Dyke, in copies circulated to FA staff, writes: ‘Sadly our involvement in the competition did disappoint. Despite the excellent preparation and planning by Roy Hodgson and all his team, we were once again left reflecting on an early exit and underachievement.’ Roy Hodgson is fortunate to still be England manager after the debacle of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Sir Trevor Brooking (left) and Greg Dyke backed Hodgson to remain in the post after the World Cup . Dyke wrote: 'We were once again left reflecting on an early exit and underachievement’in his annual account . Tellingly, though, Club England officials Adrian Bevington, Alex Horne and Sir Trevor Brooking — who, along with Dyke, backed the manager after England failed to get out of their group —are no longer at the FA. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has emerged as the best-paid boss of a national sports governing body in the UK. The latest RFU annual accounts reveal Ritchie took home a hefty annual package of £600,000. This is more than the £550,000-a-year the FA were paying departed general secretary Alex Horne. Ritchie has restored order at Twickenham after the 2011 World Cup debacle and has put his long-term faith in England coach Stuart Lancaster. Everything for Ritchie now depends on how the hosts fare in the World Cup on home soil. RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie (left) has emerged as highest paid boss of a national sports governing body, above departed FA general secretary Alex Horne on £550,000 . The FA remained remarkably relaxed on Tuesday about the clinical director of St George’s Park healthcare partners Perform being held partially to blame in a £7million damages judgment on a Spurs apprentice suffering cardiac arrest and brain damage. Specialist sports physician Dr Charlotte Cowie, who also worked for Team GB at three Olympics, was found to have made a serious error of judgment while head of Spurs’ medical services when she concluded teenager Radwan Hamed bore no risk of an adverse cardiac attack. Hamed collapsed in his first game for Spurs — a youth match in Belgium. Spurs said the club ‘wholeheartedly regrets a former employee… was remiss in their duties to Radwan’. The FA said: ‘This is a private action and third-party matter. We are confident all of the medical staff operating at St George’s Park for our partners are of the highest calibre.’ Judo turned down a £250,000 sponsorship of their European Championship from Ultimate Fight Championship because it challenged their teaching of the art . Judo, a sport that only really registers every four years at the Olympics, nevertheless felt able to turn down a £250,000 sponsorship of their European Championships in Glasgow from mixed martial arts Ultimate Fight Championship — and abort the competition — because it challenged their teaching of the art.

If Clare Balding hadn’t been on holiday, allowing her to swerve the Crabbie’s Grand National weights lunch on Tuesday, she would have been made aware of the upset at her decision to host the first televised women’s Boat Race rather than the National on April 11. The consensus was that Balding owes horseracing for her stellar broadcasting career, which she has repaid by snubbing their flagship event. Meanwhile, Crabbie’s have not only ensured a £1m prize fund for the National, but their classy weights event at the Royal Opera House even included a rendering of Nessun Dorma from the in-house singing talent — taking the usual humdrum sports lunch to a whole different level.

"In a gutsy move, Newsweek has released the cover of their next issue, on the cover of which they depict President Obama with a rainbow halo and the title of 'The First Gay President'. The news-magazine, which hits stands today, is using the shock factor of labeling the straight, married, father-of-two President to draw attention to itself. Tina Brown, who edits the magazine and its sister website The Daily Beast, is known for her love of controversial covers to help boost public interest and sales. Newsweek released their cover early, likely hoping to drum up attention for their next issue and their same-sex marriage coverage . After Time magazine went with a cover shot of a young blonde mother breastfeeding her 3-year-old boy, Ms Brown is said to have taken it in stride, saying 'let the games begin!' The article accompanying the cover was written by the news magazine's regular blogger, Andrew Sullivan, who is an openly gay self-titled conservative political pundit. 'When you step back a little and assess the record of Obama on gay rights, you see, in fact, that this was not an aberration. It was an inevitable culmination of three years of work,' Mr Sullivan said in a statement about the article. 'He had to discover his black identity and then reconcile it with his white family, just as gays discover their homosexual identity and then have to reconcile it with their heterosexual family,' he wrote, describing the similarities between Mr Obama and the gay community. Historic: President Obama made his announcement in a taped interview with Good Morning America's Robin Roberts on Wednesday . Made up: Mr Biden (left) and Mr Obama (right), appearing at an event on Saturday, have since moved past Mr Biden's rushed statement in support of same-sex marriage . There was little doubt that Newsweek would be covering the President's historic announcement that he supports same-sex marriage after he had a sit-down television interview confirming what many already believed to be the case. This was, however, the first time that a sitting President had done so, and the magazine asserts that such a move was a calculated one that had been thoroughly planned. 'It’s easy to write off President Obama’s announcement of his support for gay marriage as a political ploy during an election year. But don’t believe the cynics,' representatives from the news magazine told Politico in a statement about the article. President Obama's announcement came several days after Vice President Joe Biden said that he was 'absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women and men and women marrying are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties.' Making a splash: Newsweek's Tina Brown, left, and Andrew Sullivan, right, are not afraid to court controversy with the magazine's latest cover image . Gay marriage: Despite Mr Obama's support of the issue, there are no plans to legalise it in federal law . The move, thought to be a misstep as he made his opinion known before Mr Obama publicly declared his, was criticized by many within the administration and outside of the White House. 'Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without I think, there being a lot of notice to everybody? Sure,' Mr Obama said in the ABC interview. 'But all's well that ends well.' On the day of the President's interview, Mr Biden is said to have had a private meeting in the Oval Office in which he apologised for his overstep. Republicans, the majority of whom are against gay marriage, said that Mr Obama simply made his historic announcement in an effort to gain support among liberal voters in the lead up to the general election. 'While President Obama has played politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt Romney have been clear,' Republican national committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement. 'We support maintaining marriage between one man and one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that.' Mr Romney re-affirmed his opposition to gay marriage in a speech to graduates of evangelical Liberty University in Virginia last week. He described marriage as an 'enduring institution' and said that it should be 'a relationship between one man and one woman'. Mocking: Rand Paul said President Obama's views on marriage 'couldn't get any gayer' while addressing a conservative audience in Iowa . Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, son of Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, on Friday mocked Barack Obama's recent statements on gay marriage. Senator Paul was speaking at the 12th annual meeting of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, a Christian conservative non-profit that opposes same-sex marriage, in Iowa. 'The president recently weighed in on marriage and you know he said his views were evolving on marriage,' Senator Paul said. 'Call me cynical, but I wasn’t sure his views on marriage could get any gayer.' His comments came just two days after President Barack Obama announced his support for same-sex marriage, which he had previously opposed. Senator Paul's 'joke' received more than a few chuckles from his chosen audience so he continued on his course of blasting the president. 'He said the biblical golden rule caused him to be for gay marriage,' Paul said. 'I'm like, what version of the Bible is he reading?' Senator Paul repeatedly used the word 'sin' in reference to the topic. 'We understand sin and we understand that people sin,' he said. He argued that it one doesn't have to resort to 'hateful dogma' to preserve 'traditions.' 'Beyond religion, there's stability in the family unit,' he said. 'We shouldn't just give up on it.' He used the opportunity to claim that the country was in the midst of a 'spiritual crisis' and that the nation required 'leaders beyond your political leaders'.","Magazine attempts to trump rival Time in battle for eye-catching image .

"An employee at a local TV station is suing amid claims that drug taking, sexual encounters and 'rampant' drinking were rife at the company. Kevin Flanigan, a sales worker at 19 Action News, wants $35,000 in damages from 19 Action News in Cleveland, Ohio. Station executives allegedly bought cocaine at work and had sex with clients in what has been described as a ‘Gomorrah-like’ office environment, according to Mr Flanigan's lawsuit filed last week. Advertising staff at the station are said to have done whatever it took to ‘foster new business relationships’ - including giving clients oral sex. Debra Pando of 19 Action News allegedly lost $300,000 worth of business due to her 'unprofessional' conduct . Managers are said to to have turned a . blind eye to ‘rampant’ drinking and drug taking at office parties which . included a bikini cruise. One sales manager is even said to have bragged of sleeping with her ‘designated d***’ in front of a horrified client who cancelled his account. Flanigan is suing for sexual harassment and retaliation and wants $35,000 in damages. The lawsuit has sparked a scandal in Cleveland with Clevescene.com describing WOIO, a broadcaster which won plaudits for its coverage of the Ariel Castro case, as ‘Gomorrah-like work environments’. The legal documents state that Mr Flanigan was hired by WOIO in 2010 and that executive Debra Pando preferred the company of women so began to discriminate against him. He says there was pressure to ‘engage in inappropriate sexual practices including sexual contact with other employees and clients and rampant use of illegal drugs at corporate events, many times involving clients’. Miss Pando and other employees ‘provided sexual favors’ to get new business or cement already existing relationships, Mr Flanigan claims. The lawsuit alleges that in one instance at a party ‘after smoking marijuana with a client, Miss Pando performed oral sex on a client in order to convince the client to remain the sponsor of the event’. Staff parties included an event on a boat owned by a major client in which female staff were ‘cavorting’ in bathing suits. The headquarters of 19 Action News in Cleveland, Ohio, where a sales employee is suing amid claims of drug-taking and sex in the working environment . Miss Pando is said to have passed out drunk on a sofa in front of one client and his 20-year-old son, and became so inebriated at another event that she took off her top and flashed passers-by, Mr Flanigan alleges in his lawsuit. The sales employee claims that his boss lost $300,000 worth of business due to her ‘unprofessional’ conduct. On one occasion she turned up to meet a client wearing a red miniskirt and heavy makeup and bragged about having had sex with her ‘designated d***’, as alleged in Mr. Flanagan’s complaint. The client cancelled his account. The lawsuit states that everything that went on was ‘widely known and condoned by management’ and that it amounted a ‘hostile environment’ in which Mr Flanigan feared he would be fired if he complained. When he finally snapped and raised his concerns with Miss Pando last December she did indeed sack him, although this decision was reversed. Since then Mr Flanigan has allegedly been ‘ostracized’ at work and lost advertising commissions. William Applegate, vice president and general manager at WOIO, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that the lawsuit was inaccurate. He said that the ‘numerous offensive and erroneous allegations contained in this suit compels us to strongly deny them on behalf of the station and particularly our employees, viewers and clients’. He said: ‘We certainly do intend to defend ourselves vigorously’. Flanigan’s lawyer Andrew Kabat declined to comment.","Kevin Flanigan is suing 19 Action News in Cleveland, Ohio for $35,000 .

"The fiancee of Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber has admitted that she violated the law when she married an immigrant seeking to retain residency in the United States. Cylvia Hayes says she was paid around $5,000 for the 1997 marriage to Ethiopian immigrant Abraham Abraham. She also says she was 'associating with the wrong people and struggling to put herself through college and regrets her actions' at the time. Scroll down for video . Bad news:  Cylvia Hayes (above) the fiancee of Oregon governor John Kitzhaber, revealed today in a teraful press conference that she was paid $5,000 to marry an illegal immigrant in 1997 . Dry your eyes: Hayes wiped away tears as she spoke.  She  says she was 'associating with the wrong people and struggling to put herself through college and regrets her actions' at the time . Hayes, 47, also admitted she did never told the Governor about the marriage. The marriage, her third, was uncovered when Willamette Week newspaper began asking questions this week. Talking it out : Hayes, 47, (pictured with her husband) also admitted she did never told the Governor about the marriage . She had previously claimed to have only been married twice. The marriage took place on July 19, 1997 in Washington when Hayes was 29-years-old and the couple filed for divorce in 2001. Gov. Kitzhaber, a Democrat and political friend of President Barack Obama, is seeking a fourth term as governor next month, this as he completes his unprecedented third term in the state's highest office. It is still not certain how this news may effect his run for reelection. Bad timing: Gov. Kitzhaber (above with President Barack Obama) was unaware of the marriage according to Hayes, and hit with the news as he is seeks reelection for his fourth term . 'If the polls come out a week from now or 10 days from now and show nothing has happened, that tells me this was water off a duck's back for voters. They didn't care,' said FOX 12 political analyst Tim Hibbitts. 'On the other hand, 10 days from now if we see a 12 or 14 point lead down to a 5 point race, clearly it's been damaging.' Gov. Kitzhaber met Hayes in 2002, and the two became engaged earlier this year. Seventeen years ago I made a serious mistake by committing an illegal act when I married a person so that he could retain residency in the United States. It was a marriage of convenience. He needed help and I needed financial support. We were both living in Washington. I was attending Evergreen State College, and we were introduced by mutual acquaintances. This was a difficult and unstable period in my life. I want to be clear today - I was associating with the wrong people. I was struggling to put myself through college and was offered money in exchange for marrying a young person who had a chance to get a college degree himself if he were able to remain in the United States. We met only a handful of times. We never lived together. I have not had any contact with him since the divorce finalized in 2002. It was wrong then and it is wrong now and I am here today to accept the consequences, some of which will be life changing. And I cannot predict what direction this will go. In the few years after this bad decision I completed my degree, got my feet underneath me and established my home and career in Oregon. I became an active and engaged civic volunteer, community member and I became active politically. My decision to marry illegally felt very, very distant and far removed from the life I was building. I was ashamed and embarrassed. Therefore I did not share this information even with John once we met and started dating. This is the most painful part for me. John Kitzhaber deserved to know the history of the person he was forming a relationship with. The fact that I did not disclose this to him meant that he has learned about this in the most public and unpleasant way. This is my greatest sorrow in this difficult situation. I apologize deeply for my actions and omissions, first and foremost to John, the person I love and respect above all others. I also apologize to my friends, family and colleagues who have trusted and supported me. And to Oregonians, I deeply regret not being right up front about the fact that I had made a serious mistake. I owe you all an apology. The work that I do on behalf of our environment and trying to make people's lives better is incredibly important to me -- it's the focal point of my life. I will continue to do my best in that arena going forward. But for the time being, there are more important issues. I need to take some personal time to reflect and address this difficult situation and to focus on my relationship with John.

I make a large salad lasts me through the rest of the day. ‘Typically, I use four heads of kale, two avocados, one cucumber, some quinoa, sliced onions, grated garlic, and chopped nuts. Miss Sudo insists that she is too busy for a boyfriend, but enjoys eating and competing against male professional eaters.

"Mystery surrounds how America's most sophisticated spy plane was captured by Iran after it was paraded on Iranian state television yesterday in near mint condition. The Islamic Republic claims the lost RQ-170 Sentinel was on a surveillance mission last week when it was detected by Iranians over Kashmar and was downed by their armed forces. But the drone appears to be in good shape, contradicting Iran's claim it was shot down - and backing up U.S. claims that Tehran did not bring it down through electronic, cyber or any other means. Scroll down for video . Drone: Iran claims the RQ-170 Sentinel was on a surveillance mission last week when it was detected by Iranians over Kashmar and downed by their armed forces . Worries: U.S. officials are concerned about the Iranians potentially sharing or selling what they could have recovered of the aircraft to China or Russia . A senior U.S. official confirmed it was the drone earlier today. 'Yep, that's it - it's intact,' a source told Fox News. 'This is a big prize in terms of technology.' Meanwhile the official added that . President Obama decided not to retrieve or destroy the drone because . that could have been seen as an act of war. U.S. officials have admitted the drone was lost on a mission last week, but say it was probably because of a malfunction on board. They also pointed out it would have probably been badly damaged - and therefore less sensitive - if it had fallen from a height of up to 50,000ft. However the video shows the drone pretty much intact. The tour of the drone on Press TV is clearly political maneuvering by Iran as the U.S. tries to find out more about the country's nuclear programme. Military officials: These images give more credence to Iran's claims of having the highly-sensitive drone . Unhappy: Iran claims the drones are a violation of its sovereignty and feel they are an aggressive act against them by the U.S. Iran claims the drones are a violation . of its sovereignty and feels they are an aggressive act against them, . reported Yahoo News. But the U.S. said earlier this week the drone was only supposed to fly over Afghanistan looking for insurgents then flew off course. U.S. officials are concerned about the Iranians potentially sharing or selling what they could have recovered of the aircraft to China or Russia. These fears will be heightened following the broadcast, as it shows the cream-coloured drone seemingly intact despite its crash. Press TV also reported that Iran will now ‘carry out reverse engineering’ on the drone, which was manufactured by Lockheed Martin. Graphic: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him . The RQ-170 was used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him, reported ABC News. Meanwhile a senior U.S. official claimed any capture shines a light on the U.S. spying mission, but will not tell Iran much it did not already know. Experts and officials acknowledge that there is no self-destruct mechanism on the Sentinels, which are used both by the military and the CIA. This is bound to raise questions about why an aircraft would be developed that stays intact when it crashes and could get into anybody's hands. Iranian state radio reported on Wednesday that the country would soon broadcast video footage of the downed drone. It was shown on Thursday.

"Struggled to cope: Arlene Phillips is haunted by regret over how she treated her father . She spent years caring for her father as he battled Alzheimer’s disease. But Arlene Phillips is haunted by regret over how she treated him, as she struggled to understand the nature of his illness. Abraham Phillips died in 2000 aged 89. His daughter told how she found it hard to keep her temper as he asked her the same questions over and over. Speaking in detail about her father’s condition for the first time yesterday, the 71-year-old choreographer said she knew she should have been more understanding, but that she found it difficult to deal with his decline. ‘I can’t tell you how much I regret [the way I treated my father] and how many times I relive moments in my head, wishing I’d thought about it more,’ said the former Strictly Come Dancing judge. ‘[He] would go on and on about how someone had stolen money from his flat. “Did you take my money?” he’d ask, and I’d say, “Of course not Daddy”, but it would grow and escalate until I’d be at the end of my tether and shouting, “Of course I didn’t steal your money – why would I touch it?” ‘What I should have said was, “I hear what you’re saying, let’s look for it”, even if the whole pattern repeated day after day after day.’ The mother of two – who lost her own mother to cancer aged 15 – did her best to care for her father, first at his London flat and later with the help of professionals in a nursing home. But she admitted her lack of knowledge about Alzheimer’s compromised the level of support she was able to give him. ‘Instead of me being angry and feeling that he was being aggressive and attacking me, I now know that that’s not the way it works,’ she said. ‘I could have created a calmer environment. It’s so hard to live with your mistakes when they’ve personally affected someone you love. ‘I don’t know how much he would have remembered – I’m sure he would have quickly forgotten our rows and gone on to something else – but at the time, when we were in it, it was a terrible thing to do to someone. ‘I’m so sad to admit that I did not know how to care for him. I’m not the most patient person in the world, but we had so many unnecessary rows over my lack of understanding, and there are other people like me.’ The Alzheimer’s Society predicts that by next year there will be 850,000 dementia sufferers in the UK, costing the country as much as £26billion a year. By 2025, more than one million people are likely to be affected. In light of this, Miss Phillips said she wants to see more done to change society’s attitudes towards dementia and relieve the ‘overwhelming’ burden placed on families left to care for loved ones. Dementia battle: Arlene said that she struggled with her father Abraham Phillips' condition. He died in 2000 . ‘We need to be taught to allow people with dementia to live in the world that they see and not dismiss it all the time by constantly telling them they’re wrong. That does nothing to help,’ she said. ‘We have to find help and we have to provide money because there are armies of carers out there, daughters, brothers, sisters. ‘We all need to be friends to people with dementia, help people who seem lost, help people who are struggling in the street.’ Miss Phillips, currently working on new show Brazouka, which is at London’s New Wimbledon Theatre until Saturday, also voiced worries about one day developing Alzheimer’s herself. Desperate: The former Strictly judge  claimed she would take her own life if diagnosed with the condition . She has previously claimed she would take her own life if diagnosed with the condition, and said yesterday: ‘I’m so often forgetting people’s names and I go home panicking and say to my daughters, “Oh my goodness I think I’m losing it”, and they’ll say, “But Mummy, you’ve never been able to remember anyone’s names, you even call us by the wrong names”. ‘They laugh, but have promised to tell me if they think I’m losing it.’ Miss Phillips lives in London with her partner, Angus Ion, 60. She has two daughters, Alana, 34, whose father she has never publicly revealed, and Abi, born to her and Mr Ion when she was 47.","Arlene spent years caring for her father as he battled Alzheimer's disease .

"It was supposed to be a day about celebrating the Jersey Shore coming back together after the devastating impact of Superstorm Sandy. However, while the buildings and boardwalk of Seaside Heights can be repaired, it seems the relationship between New Jersey's governor and the area's most famous celebrities - the cast of MTV's The Jersey Shore - cannot. The smallest member of the reality cast Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi went head to head with Governor Chris Christie on Friday at the reopening of the Seaside Heights' boardwalk, which featured heavily in the reality series. Not friends: Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi went head to head with Governor Chris Christie on Friday at the reopening of the Seaside Heights' boardwalk following Superstorm Sandy . Stand off: Nicole tweeted that the politician told her the cast were bad for New Jersey's reputation . The pair had just filmed separate . segments on the Today show when backstage the 25-year-old stopped the . Governor to address why he has been critical about the show's influence . on the area in the past. The incident was caught on tape by Asbury Park Press and it was clear things were frosty between the pair. While not heard on the video, according to Snooki the politician had made his feelings clear. 'Getting told why we are bad for jersey. Amazing,' the star tweeted. In the video, Nicole can be heard asking the much larger man to step back from her as they talk. 'Why are you standing so close to me,' the mother of one asks. Move! The pair had just filmed separate segments on the Today show when backstage the 25-year-old stopped the Governor to address why he has been critical in the past and can be heard in the video asking why he is standing so close to her . Leaning comically even closer to Nicole, Christie says: 'You asked for my opinion.' Trying to subdue the situation cast mate Deena Cortese, flanked by Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley, tells the politician she is from Jersey. 'I know you are, I was talking about her,' the governor curtly replies. Still trying to calm things down Denna said: 'And guess what? I thought you did a good job with the hurricane.' With the situation not getting any better, Snooki explains: 'I just wanted to meet you, and just, hope you start to like us.' His response isn't audible, but as he shakes the girls' hands as he . walks away it is clear neither party is a big fan of the other. Not helping: Trying to subdue the situation cast mate Deena Cortese, flanked by Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley, tells the politician she is from New Jersey and thought he did well addressing the hurricane . Face pulling: After their discussion the Governor shakes the girls' hands but as he walks way it is clear neither party are each other's biggest fans . 'He doesn't just like us,' Nicole then tells the cameraman. Earlier the New Jersey Governor had appeared on Today to celebrate the reopening of the boardwalk after the devastation of Hurricane . Sandy in October 2012. He told Today's Matt Lauer that 'things are going well' and he is 'feeling great' after undergoing lap-band surgery on February 16. Looking noticeably less large than he used to, the Governor has already shed an estimated 40lbs . since the procedure. He told Lauer that he realizes his weight will . be a 'life-long struggle ... I don't plan on taking any victory laps.' Lauer probed about the publicity over . Christie's surgery and the Governor said he has been surprised by how . much attention it has received. 'It's much more than I imagined,' he said of the curiosity about his weight. Feeling good: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told Matt Lauer on Friday that he is feeling good 3 months after his weight loss surgery . Back in business: The Republican politician welcomed the Today show to the Boardwalk in Seaside Heights to celebrate the progress after Hurricane Sandy . 'I mis-evaluated that part of it but in the end, it’s really nice,' the questions are 'borne out of concern for me and . that's great,' he added. Initially the morning show had . publicized that Christie would serve as a guest co-host for the program . but he had to surrender the morning show title due to FCC rules. Since Christie is running for a second term as New Jersey Governor, . his opponent in the Republican primary, New Jersey lawyer Seth . Grossman, could have asserted his right for equal on-air time, an FCC . spokesman told PolitickerNJ. The FCC rules require broadcasters to provide equal airtime for legally qualified candidates. The . cast joined Governor Christie and a host of volunteers to carry out a . 5.5 mile long ceremonial ribbon that broke the Guinness World record for . longest ribbon cutting. Before and after: Chris Christie, pictured left . with his wife Mary Pat in July 2011, has shed an estimated 40 lbs in the . three months since his weight loss surgery, pictured right on May 20 .

Instead of being a co-host, Christie simply had an 'extended interview' that focused on the state's recovery after Sandy. Despite the focus on the reconstruction after the storm, Lauer did inquire after the buzz over Christie's trimmer figure. His . decision to manage his weight was seen as a clear signal that the . popular Republican had his eye on the national stage, likely a . presidential bid, but Christie downplayed any political motivation. 'That's . not why I'm doing this,' he said, insisting his family - wife Mary Pat, . whom he married in 1986, and their four children - was the main . inspiration. 'I hope . there’s a Christie effect for Christie, and if there’s other stuff that . happens for folks, that’s great. But that’s not why I’m doing it. I’m . doing it for (wife) Mary Pat, for my kids, and for myself, to be better . and to be healthier.' Gov. Christie was upbeat about the resilience of Jersey residents after the . storm. He will welcome President Obama to the Garden State next Tuesday . to tour the progress. The big moment: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, center, is helped by first lady Mary Pat Christie, right, as they cut a ribbon at the Seaside Heights boardwalk . Happy day: Clearly emotional for the reality stars, all were seen hugging and kissing . He . has been criticized by some GOPers who say he has developed a 'special . relationship' with the Democrat and his chummy rapport after Hurricane . Sandy gave a boost to Obama during the presidential election. But the outspoken New Jerseyan said in times of emergency, the nation needs to come together regardless of political parties. 'If . the President of the United States wants to come and see the people of . New Jersey, I'm the Governor and I'll be here to welcome him here.' Despite the incident with Gov. Christie, the cast spent the rest of the day with big smiles on their . faces, as while they long ago said goodbye to MTV's Jersey Shore, this . was another chance to see the town that had put them on the map. Clearly emotional for the reality stars, all were seen hugging and kissing as they joined the happy celebrations. Almost all of the final season's cast . - Deena, Vinny Guadagnino, Sam Giancola, Paul 'Pauly D' Del Vecchio, . Snooki, Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, and JWoww - helped set a ribbon cutting . record. Mike 'The Situation' Sorrentino was not with his cast mates on Friday. Looking good: Pauly D pointed out the improvements to the boardwalk to best friend Vinny Guadagnino . The hit show had previously been . credited with helping tourism grow at the seaside city. AP reported that . Pauly D said he and his cast mates wanted the Shore to be the happy . place they remember. 'This is known as a happy place. Right after the storm, it was the exact opposite: dead, silent,' he . said. 'To see this place being rebuilt makes me happy.' Snooki called on tourists to come back and enjoy the area. 'You just come here to have a good time,' she said. 'It's a great place. You come here with your friends. Everybody's here, it's getting rebuilt - it's just amazing.'

"An abandoned dog that was tied up, put in a rubbish bag and dumped in a bin was rescued after its terrified cries were heard by a passer-by. Emilia Lucchese was walking through the streets of Messina in Sicily, southern Italy, with her friend, Enrica Bianchi, when she noticed the animal's whimpers.

After lifting the animal out of the bin, they quickly found it was severely dehydrated and so weak it could barely lift its head. But after feeding it water and taking it to the vets, the dog has made a full recovery - and has even been adopted by its devoted rescuers.

'I thought maybe the dog had got trapped inside after looking for scraps or something, and somebody had shut the lid,' she said.

"The man posted a video on social media site Keek which allegedly shows him renouncing his faith, ripping up the Koran and hitting it with his shoe . An Islamic court in Saudi Arabia has sentenced a man to death for renouncing his Muslim faith and posting a video on a social media site which shows him ripping up the Koran before hitting it with his shoe. The unnamed man in his 20s, from Hafr-Al-Batin, posted a video on social media site Keek which allegedly shows him ripping up Islam's holy book and hitting it with a shoe. He has now been sentenced to death for denouncing his Muslim faith and 'various other acts of blasphemy.' A source who was in the General Court during his hearing said: 'In the video he cursed God, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and his daughter Fatimah and ripped a copy of the Holy Qur'an and hit it with a shoe. 'The death sentence was issued after his apostasy was proven,'  the English-language daily Saudi Gazette reported today. The Hafr Al-Batin branch of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice arrested the man last year and his case was forwarded to the Bureau of Investigation and Public Prosecution. Saudi Arabia follows a strict school of Islam and gives the clergy control over its justice system. Under its interpretation of Sharia, apostasy demands the death penalty - as does other religious offences like sorcery - while blasphemy and criticism of senior Muslim clerics have incurred jail terms and corporal punishment. Executions in Saudi Arabia are usually carried out by public beheading. International rights groups say the Saudi justice system suffers from a lack of transparency and due process, that defendants are often denied basic rights such as legal representation and that sentencing can be arbitrary. The Saudi government has taken some steps to reform its judicial system but has also defended it as 'fair'. Last year a court in Jeddah sentenced Saudi liberal Raif Badawi to 1,000 lashes and 10 years in prison for publishing criticism of the kingdom's ruling religious and political elite and calling for reforms in Islam. The first of 50 of those lashes were carried out in January, but subsequent rounds of flogging have not occurred. Officials have not publicly commented on the case, but insiders say the lashing appears to have been quietly dropped.

"President Barack Obama bragged to his aides that he's 'really good at killing people,' according to explosive claims in a new book about the 2012 presidential campaign. The revelation comes at a time when Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, has faced increasing criticism for his use of drones to target insurgents and terrorist suspects, particularly in Pakistan and Yemen. The London-based Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates that Obama has authorized 326 drone strikes. Since 2004, CIA unmanned aerial vehicles have killed 2,500 to 3,600 people - including up to 950 civilians. President Obama, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, had ordered an estimated 325 drone strikes against suspected terrorists and insurgents . Obama was given the Peace Prize in 2009, less than a year into his presidency, for his aspirations of nuclear disarmament . Double Down: Game Change 2012, will be released on Tuesday, but at least one early review points out the shocking detail included by authors Mark Halperin and John Heilemann. A Washington Post report makes passing reference to the anecdote, saying that while speaking with his aides about the drone program Obama bragged that he was 'really good at killing people.' The Obama Administration has not responded specifically to reports of the alleged boast from the President. However, Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer told ABC's 'This Week' today that 'the president is always frustrated about leaks. 'I haven't talked to him about this book. I haven't read it. He hasn't read it. But he hates leaks.' Deadly strikes with the MQ-1 Predator drone and other unmanned aerial vehicles have grown considerably under the Obama Administration - and the President has defended the use of the tactic . The Obama administration also disputes drone casualty figures - though it has not released any numbers of its own to counter the independent studies. Obama has defended his use of drones as being necessary for stopping terrorists in remote places before they can attack civilians. 'Let us remember that the terrorists we are after target civilians, and the death toll from their acts of terrorism against Muslims dwarfs any estimate of civilian casualties from drone strikes,' he said in a speech at the National Defense University in May. In October 2009, the Norwegian Nobel Committee - appointed by the Norwegian Parliament - gave Obama the Peace Prize for his 'extraordinary efforts' to strengthen democracy, specifically citing his goals of nuclear disarmament.","Claim comes from new book 'Double Down: Game Change 2012' about Obama's re-election campaign .

"The Ideal Home Show has been running since 1908 and the International Motor Show began in 1903 so it was only a matter of time before someone came up with a similar show and earlier this month the Beeches in Bournville, Birmingham played host to the first Ideal Death Show. The event billed itself as a 'weekend gathering of entrepreneurs, pioneers and progressives from the funeral industry'. Open to members of the public, the show allowed discussions about death, planning a funeral and some of the more eccentric ways people select to mark their own passing. Robert Dyer, 65, with the Anubis statuette he was awarded with after being crowned Britain's 'Embalmer of the Year' this year at The Good Funeral Awards . The show featured Death Cafés where people can speak honestly about their experiences of death and loss. Among the odder stands was one that featured a model of a hearse as a motorbike sidecar, caskets made of wicker and also a Viking funeral where the coffin is placed in a Viking boat. It also had a deathly version of the Great British Bake-Off, where cooks competed to make the most ghoulish cakes they could. Ideal Death Show organiser Brian Jenner said: 'It's a great way to respond creatively to feelings of grief and sadness. 'It's also about restarting a tradition. In Yorkshire, funeral cakes tied with black crêpe were delivered to homes as invitations to funerals. 'Another Northern tradition is to bake a cake or biscuit specially to be eaten at funerals. The biscuits were traditionally decorated with a heart symbol to represent the soul of the deceased.' Held from Friday to Sunday, on the second day the third annual Good Funeral Awards were held and an undertaker called Dyer was named Embalmer of the Year. Robert Dyer, 65, beat off stiff competition and was presented with the funeral industry's equivalent of an Oscar, a statue in the shape of Anubis – the Egyptian god of embalming. In addition to Best Embalmer, other categories included Best Alternative Hearse, Gravedigger of the Year and Crematorium Attendant of the Year. Yesterday, Mr Dyer – who runs the family business A. Dyer – in Studley, Warks, said: 'I'm dead chuffed, to coin a phrase. Robert Dyer, 65, Britain's 'Embalmer of the Year', stands outside the family firm . 'I'm still on cloud nine even if it's come a bit late in life and we did open a bottle of champagne. 'It's a progressive business. It can be quite complex, requiring a knowledge of anatomy and diseases. 'Families always want the best, the clothing, hair and maybe make-up. 'I can't go into the nitty-gritty, but it can take two to four hours, sometimes longer.' Father-of-one Mr Dyer beat off four finalists at the ceremony at The Beeches Hotel in Bournville, Birmingham. His wife Christine, 56, said: 'We went to the dinner on the Sunday night because we were told he had made the shortlist. 'But we have no idea who nominated him and how he won. We cannot find out what the judging process was, it is very secretive. 'I think it must have gone on reputation but he is over the moon with the award.' A Dyer and Sons was founded by Mr Dyer's father Alec and Robert (above) joined from school 50 years ago . The firm was founded by Mr Dyer's father Alec and Robert joined straight from school 50 years ago. He became a qualified embalmer in 1990 and now runs the firm with his brother Jim, 63, while Christine Dyer works as the office manager. The couple's only son Tim, 31, is also a qualified embalmer after being taught by his father. Mrs Dyer admitted that the family's surname was often met with laughter in the funeral industry.

"Before I had children, I always imagined myself having boys rather than girls. Actually, that's a tactful lie; every fibre of my being yearned for boys. I'm not religious but I prayed hard for sons, promising my maker all sorts of good future behaviour in return for a little fella. Given my feminine working environment and almost all-women group of friends and family (no sons for three generations), I thought a female-free domestic scene would be refreshing. Anyway, God didn't care. She had much better things to do, and today my girl offspring outnumber their 'beloved brother', as they call him, three to one. Easily pleased: Even choosing ice creams was less stressful for Lorraine when she was with her son and his friend rather than her daughters (posed by models) Obviously, I'm grateful for four healthy, relatively stable children - but I still illogically think I'd be a better mum to all boys than girls, though I don't know why. I had a huge list of boys' names for my first child and hardly any girl alternatives. Then when I had our second 16 months later, I was desperate to break my family's genetic predisposition for girl after girl. But out popped wonderful tomboy Gracie. The third pregnancy was different. For medical reasons I was wrongly advised by my GP early on to abort the baby. Luckily we chose to risk ignoring this advice. I noticed that during the many scans needed, my gynaecologist became increasingly eager to tell me what the sex of our baby was. I didn't ask, but his excitement could only be down to one thing. And so the child who spent his pre-school life calling himself 'Miss Argentina', wearing dresses and sleeping in a nightie was born: my baby boy - who every night tells me he 'loves me more than a thousand kisses'. Then, of course, we had another girl. My relationship with my son is the easiest of my four maternal love-fests (crikey, I said that out loud). Which has no doubt influenced my continuing daydreams of being 'a mum of boys'. True assessment? Boys seem a less complex parenting conundrum (at least until the teenage years) according to Lorraine . Last week I got to test this 'boys only' fantasy briefly on holiday in Cornwall. Due to arrangements for beach activities, I ended up looking after just my son, nearly eight, and a friend's little boy, aged ten. Blimey, it was brilliant, easily one of my top ten best parenting days ever. 'Do you want to play crazy golf?' I asked them. 'Yes,' they replied in unison. The version of this conversation with my girls (aged ten and nearly 12) would have gone something like this. Me: 'Do you want to play crazy golf?' Them: 'When? Where? Who with? Can we have an ice cream, too? Do we have to walk there? What will we do afterwards? Can I go first? I'm not playing if she goes first.' After a swift, enjoyable game of golf (I came last), I asked the boys if they wanted to go on the trampolines. They bounced around, then wanted to go for a run on the beach. We had an ice cream and, miracle of miracles, they knew exactly what they wanted and weren't even bothered when the lady gave them tubs instead of cones by accident: had this been my girls there would have been much grumbling, out of earshot, about the tubs-not-cones 'debacle', as they would have dramatically called it. When we got home they played Mousetrap noisily while I cooked chicken nuggets, without them negotiating what they wanted  for tea. It was strangely relaxing - a day with my three fearsome females is always fun but nowhere near as simple. My day was probably a fluke, I hear you cry, and not related to 'boydom' at all. 'Stop the stereotyping,' I hear you yell. You could be right - but later, discussing the pros and cons of boys vs girls (or 'dogs vs cats' as a friend once controversially commented) with other mums, I came to the unscientific conclusion that boys seem a less complex parenting conundrum (at least until the teenage years). But it also dawned on me that maybe the responsibility of raising men is a bigger one for mums. As a female you can hopefully easily instil the virtues of a good woman in smart girls, ever-observant little sponges that they are. But tell me, how do you make a future man?

"A suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a string of random highway shootings that left three people wounded in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. The male suspect has yet to be named as no charges have been filed, police chief Darryl Forte told a press conference on Thursday evening. Police said last week that they had connected 12 shootings since early March that have targeted vehicles on Kansas City-area roads. Scroll down for video . An unnamed suspect has been taken into custody in connection with a string of random highway shootings that left three people wounded in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. Investigators have looked into as many as 20 reported highway shootings as part of their investigation. Three people have been hit with bullets, and their injuries were not life-threatening. No new shooting incidents have taken place since April 6. More details are expected at a press conference on Friday. One woman said she was driving down the road with her three-year-old child when a figure in a ski-mask driving beside her opened fire, narrowly missing the youngster. Witness Tom McFarlane told KMBC-TV: 'I . was just driving down the highway and heard a loud noise. Something hit . the car, didn't know what it was, so I pulled over at my first . opportunity to kind of see if there was any damage and that's when I saw . the bullet hole.' One witness claimed the shooter was wearing a ski-mask and just missed her three-year-old child who also in the car . Kansas City Police and the FBI had been offering a $7,000 reward for information leading to the capture of the unidentified suspect . Most of the shootings were reported in an area in the southern part of Kansas City known as the Grandview Triangle where three interstate highways and U.S. 50 intersect. Local police called in help from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. A $7,000 reward had been offered for information leading to the capture of the attacker. The first incident was reported to police on March 8. Luckily, no one was killed but two victims have been hit in the legs and a third received a gunshot wound to the arm. Jenny Baugher said: 'It's really scary to think that somebody is just out here with no regard to what could happen.' Another victim, Ginny Bauer said she was driving a friend home when she was hit by a bullet. 'There wasn't another car in sight and we were in the right lane and hit on the right side,"" she said .

"Jodi Arias told the courtroom at her murder trial on Wednesday that she enjoyed- even instigated- raunchy sex acts with her ex boyfriend before killing him, contradicting her previous accounts where she testified that he coerced her into performing for him. At times during the trial, she said he made her feel like a prostitute, but that was not the case today. Under aggressive questioning by prosecutor Juan Martinez on Wednesday, Arias said she was blossoming sexually and the couple's antics were helping her grow. Martinez has been working to poke holes in her stories and has noted the duplicity of her portrayal of Travis Alexander, trying to show jurors she is lying, as he works for a first-degree murder conviction and the death penalty. Scroll down for video . Scrutiny: The prosecution fired question after question at Jodi Arias as she appeared on the stand on Wednesday in Phoenix, Arizona over the contents of her graphic phone sex recording . Arias has said throughout the trial that Alexander coerced her into performing raunchy sex acts that at various points involved personal lubricant, the aid of Pop Rocks and Tootsie Pops, children's underwear and rope to tie her up with. The image of her as an unwilling participant, however, was shattered today when phone recordings of the couple's conversations were played for jurors and text messages shown in court seem to indicate that she enjoyed participating. 'So when you tell us you felt like a prostitute it seems to be contradictory?' Martinez noted. Arias said he is misunderstanding the context of the text messages and calls, during which one segment played for jurors has Arias telling Alexander: 'You are amazing. Seriously, you made me feel like a goddess.' Refreshing her memory: Arias's lapses in memory dating back to crucial times around the murder of her boyfriend have been serious points of inquiry for prosecutor Juan Martinez . Martinez noted the call, which Arias . recorded, came shortly after one of the encounters Arias claimed made . her feel like Alexander was using her for sex. 'You were actually into it as much as he was, right?' Martinez asked. 'Yes,' Arias said. Taking the stand: Wednesday was the 12th day in a row that Arias has testified . Martinez then read for jurors . salacious text messages between Arias and Alexander, one of which has . Arias describing how she wanted to be treated 'like a dirty little . schoolgirl'. She previously testified that was just one of Alexander's 'deviant' sexual fantasies that made her uncomfortable. 'You did enjoy dressing up though, right?' Martinez asked. 'Um, yes,' Arias replied. 'It was a consensual mutual relationship sexually speaking, wasn't it?' Martinez prodded. 'Yes, always,' Arias said. 'No indication that you were offended?' the prosecutor continued. 'Correct,' Arias replied. Much of the afternoon session was dedicated to unraveling her decisions during the 48-hours leading up to Alexander's death. One decision that she remains unable to fully explain is why she bought two 5-gallon cartons and one 2-gallon carton of gas while in California as she prepared to drive to Alexander's house in Arizona. Ignoring the fact that she had 12 gallons in her trunk that remained untouched on her way to the house, she went on to stop at two other gas stations in Arizona to fill up her tank. Using estimates of 2008 gas prices, those moves would have left her with only a small portion of her estimated $200 that she thought she brought on the trip with her. She offered no explanation as to why she left the gas in her trunk, though the prosecution is undoubtedly trying to use it as an example of how she premeditated the murder. Logistics of the scene: Arias explained- using a picture of Alexander's bedroom- where and how she was tied up to the bed during sex and how she was a willing participant . Not adding up: Arias said that she bought 12 gallons of gas in California allegedly to save money, but then went on to refuel two other times- with one receipt shown in court above- during her drive to Alexander's house without touching the gas she brought with her . Her own words: because she gave a number of media interviews while in jail, those stories are being played back for the courtroom. Now she admits that much of what she said during those interviews were lies . Their other example of premeditation . is the idea that Alexander did not have a gun in his house- as Arias . claimed he did- but that she stole the .25 caliber gun from her . grandparents house a week before the killing. It is the same make as the . gun that was used to kill Travis, but neither gun has ever been found. Another weapon that was used to kill Alexander was his kitchen knife, with which Arias stabbed him 27 times. In previous testimony, she alleged . that it was in the bedroom before their supposed altercation because . they had used it to cut the rope that they used to tie her up during . sex. Today she said they only used the . knife in the bathroom to initially cut the rope to the size they needed . for their sexual activity, but in earlier versions she said that . Alexander brought it into the bedroom to cut the rope off her when she . was tied to the bed. Martinez . also questioned Arias over her repeated lies to authorities, friends . and family in the days after she killed Alexander. She . first claimed to know nothing about the killing, then later blamed it . on intruders, providing descriptions of the attack by two masked people . in several media interviews. She eventually settled on self-defense. She . was too ashamed and frightened of the consequences to be truthful, she . told jurors. The beginning: Arias looked like an entirely different person back in 2006 when she and Alexander met . Martinez noted that even her lies were changing as she spoke to various media organizations. 'I couldn't keep my stories straight,' Arias said. The . prosecutor also noted how Arias has alternately described Alexander as a . cheating womanizer, an angry man with a violent temper who once choked . her into unconsciousness, while simultaneously a caring, loving . boyfriend. Today marked the 12th day where Arias . took the stand in her own defense, as she is facing the death penalty . for killing Alexander by shooting him and stabbing him 27 times inside . his Mesa, Arizona home in June 2008. Throughout . the trial, she has claimed that she killed Alexander in self defense as . he was attacking her after she dropped his camera during a salacious . nude photo shoot in his shower. This is not the first version of events that she has used to describe what happened to Alexander on the night of his death. First she told investigators that she was not in the state, let alone his house on the night of the murder. Later, she described an elaborate story where there was a pair of masked intruders who broke into his house and attacked them, eventually killing Alexander. After months of repeating this story and telling it during filmed television interviews, she now says that hew as abusive to her and she killed him in self defense.","Arias told Phoenix court that she enjoyed sex after previously testifying that she had been coerced by on-off lover Travis Alexander .

"Despite the non-draconian premise of the guide, the plan promises to 'transform your physique' If you have tried cutting carbs, banishing sugar or spending hours on the treadmill in the quest for the perfect figure, you will be pleased to hear that a new food and fitness guide says shedding the pounds needn't be such hard work. The Four-Week Fitness and Food Effect, a collaboration between qualified medical doctor and nutritionist Dr Michelle Storfer and fitnessontoast.com exercise blogger Faya Nilsson, takes the faddiness out of the equation and instead recommends eating carbs, feeling full, drinking caffeine, enjoying hot chocolates and not over-exercising. Despite the non-draconian premise of the guide, the plan promises to 'transform your physique' in just four weeks, helping you to lose weight, lower your body fat percentage, tone up and feel infused with energy. And all this without a gym membership or hours on the treadmill. 'Countless hours of fruitless training can often often drain you of the very energy you're looking to capture,' explains Faya, who has 30,000 followers on her FitnessOnToast Instagram account.  Instagram account. Instead Faya recommends body weight training, which uses your own body weight for strength exercises. 'Body-weight training is fantastic for strengthening and sculpting the body,' she says and all you need to start is an exercise resistance band, which retails from £2. The 28-day programme also includes 'brutally focused cardio' as well as stretch days and rest days. In any one week, the  plan recommends three  30-minute body-weight training days, two rest days, one stretch day and one 'hit' day of high-intensity cardiovascular exercise. A 'hit' involves sprinting for one minute followed by a minute rest for 20-30 minutes. The body-weight circuit consists of five different exercise to be done for one minute each with a two-minute rest at the end, repeated six times. As well as creating a toned physique, Faya explains, 'an increase in muscle mass will speed up the metabolism even whilst at rest'. 'The thermogenic effect [increased body heat] that happens after a solid workout will compound this metabolic boost,' she adds. Nutritionist Dr Michelle Storfer believes in eating carbs at every meal: 'The elimination of entire food groups, calorie counting and complicated instructions result in eating becoming a chore rather than a pleasure' The programme also includes a daily meal plan of breakfast, lunch and supper as well as two daily snacks, but Dr Storfer (founder of thefoodeffect.co.uk) has a holistic food philosophy. She believes in enjoying food and making sure you're never too hungry are essential elements of a healthy eating plan. 'The focus of a diet should not only focus on what to exclude, but more importantly what to include,' she says. 'The elimination of entire food groups, calorie counting and complicated instructions result in eating becoming a chore rather than a pleasure. The end result is inevitable, ""When can I come off the diet and eat all the things I miss?""' She also believes we should eat slowly to enjoy the experience. 'Focus on the food you're eating and don't just wolf it down,' she says. Dr  Storfer says drinking coffee and even enjoying a mug of hot chocolate are good for you . 'Don't eat dinner in front of the TV or lunch in front of the computer. Take time out to enjoy your meal and actually pay attention to what you're eating.' Taking down the pace also helps to prevent over-eating. 'Eating slowly will also ensure your brain registers you've eaten enough food ...before it's too late!' she says. Carbs at every meal, drinking coffee and even enjoying a mug of hot chocolate arealso on teh meal-plan agenda. 'Don't shun carbs but instead stick to wholegrain, unrefined carbs such as oats, whole-grain bread, brown rice, sweet potato and quinoa,' she advises. Dr Michelle Storfer, founder of thefoodeffect.co.uk (left) and fitnessontoast.com exercise blogger Faya Nilsson (right) who wrote the guide . 'Slow release carbs will give you the get-up-and-go you need to stay active and keep your metabolism burning strong and steady. 'Whilst excess caffeine is obviously no good, caffeine from good quality coffee is packed full of antioxidants and has been shown to have tremendous health benefits,' says Michelle. 'It has also been shown to boost performance when exercising if drunk before a work-out.' Dark chocolate (with fruit) or a hot chocolate make a regular appearance as an evening snack in the meal plan. 'Stretching, sleeping well and keeping hydrated are also all essential,' she adds. So what are you waiting for? The perfect body is only four weeks away.

"This heartbreaking series of images show the final days of a cancer sufferer as he slowly succumbs to his deadly disease. Malaysian photojournalist Ahmad Yusni documented his younger brother Mohammad Sani's final 39 days after he was diagnosed with terminal 'germ cell' cancer. The collection of images reveal in vivid detail 33-year-old Mohammad's pain and suffering as the rare condition ravages his body right up until the moment he died. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Heartbreaking: Mohammad Sani, 33, pictured sitting in a wheelchair in a hospital toilet in Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia, on December 12, 2013, after being diagnosed with a 'germ cell tumour' Final days: Mohammad pictured trying to ease his constant back pain from a cancerous tumour in a hospital a hospital in Malaysia on December 14, 2013. He died just 39 days after being diagnosed . In agony: Even morphine failed to ease Mohammad's constant pain in his back which made it impossible for him to sleep. He is pictured here on December 14, 2013, smoking a cigarette in a hospital lavatory . Ahmad said: 'It was very heart-wrenching for me to see him struggle and not be able to help him. Two long nights watching him at the hospital made me cry.' Ahmad reveals he had already lost a father and another sibling when his younger brother Mohammad was diagnosed with a 'germ cell tumour'. He said: 'We lost two loved ones in two consecutive years (2011 and 2012), my dear father and brother. It was really painful for our family. 'Then, in 2013, we found out that my younger brother had a critical stage cancer called ""germ cell tumour"". From our conversation with the doctor, we learned that the cancer was considerable, blocking his kidneys and frontal stomach.' Ahmad told how his brother was in constant pain because of his condition, which is clearly visible in the photos he took of him. Terminal: Mohammad, pictured on December 14, 2013, underwent surgery to remove the tumour but was left in even more pain . Picture of health: Mohammad Sani pictured in 2010. By the time he found out he had a 'germ cell tumour' in November 2013, it was already a considerable size, blocking both his kidneys and his frontal stomach . Mohammad Sani, pictured at his home in Georgetown, Penang, Malaysia, on December 11, 2013, shortly after his diagnosis with cancer . 'It caused him constant pain even though the doctor had provided him with the strongest morphine,' Ahmad recalls. 'He was unable to lie on a bed to sleep even for a few minutes. Due to complications he could neither eat nor drink. 'A surgery to remove an infection left him in even more agony.' Germ cell tumours mainly develop in the ovary or testicle but it can, on rare occasions, be found in other parts of the body. They tend to grow faster than other types of tumours and have a lower five year survival rate. In the UK germ cell tumours generally respond very well to chemotherapy and most people are cured. Ahmad had started the photo diary in the hope that it would end with his brother smiling and well on his motorbike, but he said it soon became clear he was not going to survive the disease.

But he said his brother remained strong right up until the moment he died despite his awful suffering. 'Even through this long and painful battle, he said thank you to me and told me that he loved me,' Ahamd said. 'Deep in my heart, I felt he would leave us soon when he told me that our father and brother had called upon him for three consecutive nights to join the, in his dreams. 'Then, on an early Saturday morning, he left us forever. His heartbeat dropped dramatically. Although sad, the expression on his face showed that he had found a peaceful, deep sleep.'

"A Nigerian actor has sparked outrage after posting an image of himself wearing an Ebola mask while sitting in a first class airport lounge as he flees Liberia. 'Nollywood' star Jim Iyke posted a message on his Instagram page saying he had cut short a business trip to Monrovia in Liberia -  where at least 600 people have already died from the disease. The image of Iyke sitting on green leather-clad seats in the airport's luxury first class lounge while wearing an expensive designer watch and sunglasses was accompanied with the caption: 'Not ashamed to admit this scares the Jesus outta me #Ebola.' Scroll down for video . Anger: Nigerian actor Jim Iyke shared this image of himself wearing an Ebola mask while sitting in a luxury airport lounge in Liberia. At least 600 people have already died from the disease in the country . Fear: Much of the anger on social media stems from fear among Nigerian citizens that Iyke (pictured left and right) appeared to be travelling back to the country from Liberia without having had tests to see if he is infected . The contrast between Iyke's image of first class luxury is in stark contrast to the thousands of terrified Liberians who are living in fear of contracting the deadly disease. However, much of the anger about his image stemmed from fear among Nigerian citizens that Iyke appeared to be travelling back to the country without having been tested to see if he was infected. Twitter user @Avariberry posted a message reading: 'Jim Iyke or Not... he gotta be screened. #TestJimIyke.' Meanwhile @IcallDibbz_ said: 'Please ooo, James Ikechukwu, aka Jim Iyke, should be quarantined.' Others picked up on the fact Iyke had an expensive face mask to protect himself, but was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt. Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals, and in many parts of West Africa people are being told to cover as much of their body as possible to ensure the infection doesn't enter their bloodstream through a small cut. Iyke has appeared in more than 150 films, including Last Flight to Abuja, and is the founder of the Jim Iyke Foundation for Children with Special Disabilites. He began acting in 2001 and is one of the highest paid actors in Nollywood - Nigeria's answer to Hollywood. Deadly: Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. Symptoms include high fever, bleeding and damage to the nervous system, with 90 per cent of those infected dying . Concern: Ebola (above) has already killed 672 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and infected more than 1,200 since it was first diagnosed in February. Symptoms include sudden fever, vomiting and headaches . Earlier today a woman was quarantined at a hospital in Hong Kong after falling ill with . Ebola-like symptoms when she returned from a trip to Africa. The . patient, who is said to be exhibiting symptoms similar to the deadly . virus, is undergoing tests to verify the cause of her illness, local . media reported. It . comes as British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond today declared the disease a . 'very serious threat' as he prepares to chair an emergency . meeting on how to bolster the country's defences. Airlines around the world are on alert for cases of the deadly virus, after tests . revealed a man died in Nigeria from the disease, having been allowed to . board an international flight from Liberia - the same route Iyke was travelling. In Nigeria health . officials said today, they are in the process of tracing 30,000 people . at risk of contracting the disease after coming into contact with the . Liberian man. Outbreak: There is no vaccine or cure for Ebola, which is spread by contact with infected blood or bodily fluids . The latest outbreak of Ebola is the most severe since the disease was discovered in 1976. So far the disease has spread from a village in Guinea to Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria . Fears over the ability to contain the spread of Ebola were augmented last night as it emerged the body of a young stowaway was found hidden in on a U.S. military plane. The Pentagon said the young boy, believed to be of African origin, was found near the wheel of a cargo plane which landed in Germany. The plane was on a routine mission in Africa, and had made stops in Senegal, Mali, Chad, Tunisia and the Naval Air Station Sigonella in Sicily before arriving at Ramstein. It is thought the boy climbed aboard in Mali, which borders Guinea - where the current Ebola outbreak originated at the end of last year.

Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees.How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. The Ebola virus is fatal in 90 per cent of cases and there is no vaccine and no known cure . Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness,  muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately.What is the treatment? Severely ill patients require intensive supportive care. They need intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. But there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. Some patients will recover with the appropriate care.Can Ebola be prevented? Currently there is no licensed vaccine for Ebola. Several are being tested but are not available for clinical use. Is it safe to travel to affected areas? The World Health Organisation reviews the public health situation regularly, and recommends travel or trade restrictions if necessary. The risk of infection for travellers is very low since person-to-person transmission results from direct contact with bodily fluids of victims.Source: World Health Organisation .","Jim Iyke shared picture of himself wearing Ebola mask on Instagram page .

"An animal charity has slammed a cruel owner who dumped a puppy in a hedge on a freezing night with a note around its neck which read: 'Please look after me as my owner doesn't want me'. The 14-month-old spaniel-pointer cross was locked in a cage and left in a bush by the roadside near Downham Market, Norfolk. Luckily, a passer-by found the abandoned pet before he starved or froze to death, after hearing his yelps for help from the undergrowth. Dumped: Snoopi, a 14-week-old spaniel-pointer, was discovered in a hedgerow next to a road with a sign around his neck, begging: 'Please look after me' Attached around his neck was the note, . written in a childish scrawl, which continued: 'I'll try to do my . best to keep you happy. My name is Snoopi.' His previous owners had left a selection of brand-new equipment needed to look after . a new pup, including a bed, dog food, dog training paraphernalia and a . teddy bear. The unwanted animal is now being looked after by the RSPCA which blasted his former owners. The charity's inspectors believe the dog was an unwanted Christmas present which was dumped when the novelty wore off. Enlarge . Unwanted: A note left beside the unloved dog found in Downham Market, Norfolk, and written in a childish scrawl, read: 'My owner doesn't want me anymore. I'll try to do my best to keep you happy' RSPCA inspector Jon Knight said: 'I have no doubt in my mind that this was an unwanted Christmas present. 'It is a perfect example of why we urge people to think very carefully before buying pets as presents. 'Every year animals are abandoned when the novelty of having a dog or cat wears off. 'Pets are a lifelong commitment and . anyone taking one on needs to be very sure there is a long-term . commitment to properly care for the animal - and that he or she will be . loved for life.' Insp Knight said it was strange that a brand new rehoming pack had been left with Snoopi. 'I can't quite get my head around how someone could dump this really incredibly cute dog in this way. 'On . the one hand, they seemed to care due to the note and the careful way . all the dog-related goodies had also been left,' he said. 'On the other, it's just so callous. Cruel: An RSPCA inspector thinks Snoopi was an unwanted Christmas gift because he was dumped along with new equipment, pictured - including a bed, dog food, dog training paraphernalia and a teddy bear . 'He was left hidden by a residential street where he could easily have been ignored or missed and on a very cold night. 'Temperatures being what they were he would have been really ill if left there overnight. 'Lucky for him I think he must have been spotted quite quickly as his toys were still really clean and had obviously not been rained on.' Friendly Snoopi was taken into RSPCA care after being thoroughly checked over and found to be in good health. He will have his initial inoculations before being put up for rehoming after being found on Monday. Anyone with any information about how and why poor Snoopi was so heartlessly dumped should call the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999.","Dog was discovered inside a cage in a hedge in Downham Market, Norfolk .

"A young Chinese woman has overcome the tricky problem of providing care for her elderly grandmother - by taking her to work with her every day. Huang Lihua, 24, from south-western China’s Chongqing municipality said that when she was a young child both of her parents needed to go to work. As a result they had sent her to stay with her grandmother Wan Zongsiu, 88, in the countryside. She said: 'Some people say to me that it must have been very difficult leaving the city and my parents and going to live in the countryside where nothing happened and I didn't know anybody.' Gratitude: Huang Lihua, 24, from Chongqing in China, carries Wan Zongsiu, 88, to work. The youngster takes her beloved grandmother to her restaurant every day . The 24-year-old is repaying her grandmother's kindness towards her when she was growing up . She added: 'But actually the time there with my grandmother was one of the happiest of my life. I was very young actually when I went there first, I was just two, but I remember that my grandmother was very kind taking me with her everywhere. 'She never left me locked up in the house, if she was going to the market or visiting friends or working in the fields, she took me along. And I never wanted anything more, there was always good food to eat and lots of love.' Shortly after she started going to school she returned to the city and her parents but never forgot her time with her grandmother. Care: Wan Zangsiu, 88, enjoys sitting at the restaurant and watching the world go by . Generations: Shortly after Huang Lihua started going to school she returned to the city and her parents but never forgot her time with her grandmother . Entrepreneur: Huang Lihua owns a successful restaurant in Chongqing . After leaving school she first went to work in south-eastern China’s Guangdong province where she earned enough money to return to her parent's home and start her own business, a fast food restaurant in the city. She said: 'I have everything I want in my life now - a boyfriend who I love very much and a business that is doing well. 'Therefore it was natural to me that I should think of my grandmother who gave me so much and started me off so well in life.' When Huang Lihua was a young child both of her parents needed to go to work and sent her to stay with her grandmother in the countryside . Although her grandmother doesn't always feel well enough for the journey, she still makes the daily trip even if Huang has to carry her over the distance of just under a mile . 'So I agreed to look after her but because she was used the countryside and this is the city she had difficulty fitting in, and then I came up with the idea of taking her with me to work. 'There is always something going on and plenty of people to talk to, and now she is happy in the city. 'She sits outside the front and watches life go by and I can see that she is content.' Although her grandmother doesn't always feel well enough for the journey, she still makes the daily trip even if Huang has to carry her the mile between work and home. On good days that she can walk using a stick and said: 'I wouldn't miss my visits there for anything.'","Huang Lihua, 24, has never forgotten her grandmother's kindness .

"A man on the run who is wanted for a string of thefts worth £500,000 has evaded arrest by allegedly ramming police vehicles in two motorway attacks. Luke Wall, 23, has been on the run since breaching crown court bail conditions and is believed to be with his partner Teresa Connors, 20, who has also breached her bail conditions for burglary. The pair have given police the slip across East Anglia, where the two attacks on police vehicles happened in June. Scroll down for video . Luke Wall, left, and Teresa Connors, right, who are wanted by police and have evaded arrest by ramming police vehicles in two separate motorway attacks . The first ramming incident came when Wall was pulled over on the M11 in Cambridgeshire on June 9 by a police motorcyclist . Wall is believed to have rammed his car into the police motorcyclist , knocking him off his bike on the motorway hard shoulder . The incident was captured on a body cam worn by the officer who was injured, but able to get up and call for back-up . Now the Crown Prosecution Service has taken the unusual step of releasing CCTV footage showing the attacks in a bid to apprehend the pair. The first ramming incident came when Wall was pulled over on the M11 in Cambridgeshire on June 9 by a police motorcyclist. Before he got off his bike the driver reversed into him then made off. The incident was captured on a body cam worn by the officer who was injured, but able to get up and call for back-up. Then three days later a vehicle stopped by officers on the M25 in Hertfordshire reversed into their patrol car . The vehicle reversed backwards as the officer went to approach the car, thought to be driven by Wall . The police officer is forced to jump over a barrier to safety after the car attempts to ram his vehicle . Members of the public can then be seen stopping on the hard shoulder to assist him. Then three days later a vehicle stopped by officers on the M25 in Hertfordshire reversed into their patrol car, forcing one officer to jump over a barrier to avoid being hit. DCI Paul Maleary of Essex Police said: 'We need to trace these two people urgently as they are suspected of continuing to commit burglary crimes after breaching court bail conditions. 'Extensive enquiries have been carried out across the UK but Wall and Connors appear to be always on the move. However, we believe they are currently somewhere in East Anglia. 'The CPS have taken an unusual step and agreed that we can release some of the CCTV footage of police vehicles being rammed to show how important it is that we find those responsible as quickly as possible.' Anyone who sees Wall, from Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, and Connors should call 999 immediately or if they know of their whereabouts should contact Essex Police on 101.","Luke Wall, 23, is wanted by police for a string of thefts worth £500,000 .

"Nearly 70 years after the Holocaust, there is no more sensitive an issue in German life as the role of Jews. With fewer than 200,000 Jews among Germany's 82 million people, few Germans born after World War II know any Jews or much about them. To help educate postwar generations, an exhibit at the Jewish Museum in Berlin features a Jewish man or woman seated inside a glass box for two hours a day through August to answer visitors' questions about Jews and Jewish life. The base of the box asks: 'Are there still Jews in Germany?' Mixed reaction: Visitors surround Israeli Ido Porat, the first person to act as the 'Jew in a box' at the exhibition 'The Whole Truth - everything you always wanted to know about Jews' at the Jewish Museum . 'A lot of our visitors don't know any Jews and have questions they want to ask,' museum official Tina Luedecke said. 'With this exhibition we offer an opportunity for those people to know more about Jews and Jewish life.' But not everybody thinks putting a Jew on display is the best way to build understanding and mutual respect. Since the exhibit The Whole Truth, everything you wanted to know about Jews opened this month, the 'Jew in the Box,' as it is popularly known, has drawn sharp criticism within the Jewish community - especially in the city where the Nazis orchestrated the slaughter of 6 million Jews until Adolf Hitler's defeat in 1945. 'Why don't they give him a banana and a glass of water, turn up the heat and make the Jew feel really cosy in his glass box,' prominent Berlin Jewish community figure Stephan Kramer told The Associated Press. 'They actually asked me if I wanted to participate. But I told them I'm not available.' Challenging stereotypes: A visitor voting on what people think about Jews at the museum in Berlin . The exhibit is reminiscent of Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann sitting in a glass booth at the 1961 trial in Israel which led to his execution. And it's certainly more provocative than British actress Tilda Swinton sleeping in a glass box at a recent performance at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Eran Levy, an Israeli who has lived in Berlin for years, was horrified by the idea of presenting a Jew as a museum piece, even if to answer Germans' questions about Jewish life. 'It's a horrible thing to do - completely degrading and not helpful,' he said. 'The Jewish Museum absolutely missed the point if they wanted to do anything to improve the relations between Germans and Jews.' But several of the volunteers, including both German Jews and Israelis living in Berlin, said the experience in the box is little different from what they go through as Jews living in the country that produced the Nazis. Controversial: Hats are displayed under the question 'How you can recognize a Jew?'. The exhibition will run until September . 'With so few of us, you almost inevitably feel like an exhibition piece,' volunteer Leeor Englander said. 'Once you've been 'outed' as a Jew, you always have to be the expert and answer all questions regarding anything related to religion, Israel, the Holocaust and so on.' Museum curator Miriam Goldmann, who is Jewish, believes the exhibit's provocative 'in your face' approach is the best way to overcome the emotional barriers and deal with a subject that remains painful for both Jews and non-Jews. 'We wanted to provoke, that's true, and some people may find the show outrageous or objectionable,' Goldmann said. 'But that's fine by us.' The provocative style is evident in other parts of the special exhibition, including some that openly raise many stereotypes of Jews widespread not only in Germany but elsewhere in Europe. Learning about Jewishness: Ido Porat, the first person acting as the 'Jew in a glass box', will be followed daily by a Jewish man or woman who will sit inside a glass box for two hours a day to answer questions . One includes a placard that asks 'how you recognize a Jew?' It's next to an assortment of yarmulkes, black hats and women's hair covers hanging from the ceiling on thin threads. Another asks if Jews consider themselves the chosen people. It includes a poem by Jewish author Leonard Fein: 'How odd of God to choose the Jews. But how on earth could we refuse?' Yet another invites visitors to express their opinion to such questions as 'are Jews particularly good looking, influential, intelligent, animal loving or business savvy?' Despite the criticisms, the 'Jew in the Box' has proven a big hit among visitors. Troubled history: Part of the Jewish Museum's role is to educate the public about the Holocaust. Here two survivors Margot Murzyn, left, and Esther Brunstein are being shown around. 'I asked him about the feelings he has for his country and what he thinks about the conflict with Palestine, if he ever visited Palestine,' visitor Panka Chirer-Geyer said. 'I have Jewish roots and I've been to Palestine and realized how difficult it was there. I could not even mention that I have Jewish roots.' On a recent day this week, several visitors kept returning to ask questions of Ido Porat, a 33-year-old Israeli seated on a white bench with a pink cushion. One woman wanted to know what to bring her hosts for a Shabbat dinner in Israel. Another asked why only Jewish men and not women wear yarmulkes. A third inquired about Judaism and homosexuality. 'I guess I should ask you about the relationship between Germans and Jews,' visitor Diemut Poppen said to Porat. 'We Germans have so many insecurities when it comes to Jews.' Viola Mohaupt-Zitfin, 53, asked if Porat felt welcome as a Jew living among Germans 'considering our past and all that.' Heritage: The Jewish Museum in Berlin is intended to promote understanding of the German Jewish community . Yes, Porat said, Germany is a good place to live, even as a Jew. But the country could do even more to come to terms with its Nazi past, he added. He advised the would-be traveler that anything is permissible to bring to a Shabbat dinner as long as it's not pork. 'I feel a bit like an animal in the zoo, but in reality that's what it's like being a Jew in Germany,' Porat said. 'You are a very interesting object to most people here.' Dekel Peretz, one of the volunteers in the glass box, said many Germans have an image of Jews that is far removed from the reality of contemporary Jewish life. 'They associate Jews with the Holocaust and the Nazi era,' he said. 'Jews don't have a history before or after. 'In Germany, Jews have been stereotyped as victims. It is important that people here get to know Jews to see that Jews are alive and that we have individual histories. I hope that this exhibit can help.' Still, not everyone believes this is the best way to promote understanding. Rabbi Yehuda Teichtal from the Jewish Chabad community in Berlin said Germans who are really interested in Jews and Judaism should visit the community's educational center. 'Here Jews will be happy to answer questions without sitting in a glass box,' he said.","'Everything you always wanted to know about Jews' exhibition causes a stir .

"There was a New York Christmas miracle at 125th Street Station on Tuesday when a blind man and his guide dog survived being runover by a subway train after they both fell onto the tracks - but now the two friends face being separated because his owner can't afford to care for him. Cecil Williams, 61, was making his way to the dentist at 9.30 am with his 10-year-old black Labrador Orlando when he suddenly felt faint and began to wobble perilously close to the edge of the platform. His longtime buddy desperately tried to hold him back from falling by pulling at his leash. They both tumbled onto the tracks where Orlando managed to wake Cecil by licking his face just in time for them both to duck into the middle trench between the tracks. Man and his friend: Cecil Williams pets his guide dog Orlando in his hospital bed following a fall onto subway tracks from the platform, Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2013, in New York . Thanks buddy: Williams, of Brooklyn, has been blind since 1995, and Orlando is his second dog. The lab will be 11 on Jan. 5, and will be retiring soon . 'The dog saved my life,' said Williams from his St. Luke’s Hospital bed, 'He tried to hold me up.' Now he is also coming to terms with the fact that his health insurance will not cover the cost of keeping Orlando when he retires next year as a non-working dog. But in the hours since his plight was made public, members of the public have set up a fund-raising campaign in his name giving him some hope of staying with Orlando. Witnesses said the dog was barking frantically and tried to stop Williams from falling, but they both fell to the tracks when Williams fainted. 'The dog was trying to pull him away from the southbound edge of the platform, but his feet were on the edge, he was wobbling, and the dog was barking,' said Ana Quinones, 53, to the New York Post. Slight injury: Williams, 61 and blind, says he fainted while holding onto his black Labrador who tried to save him from falling . Tough day: Cecil Williams, 61, told The Associated Press from his hospital bed that he was on his way to the dentist during the morning rush hour when he felt faint on the 125th Street platform . Despite Orlando's best efforts, he and his owner toppled onto the tracks - just as an uptown A train was approaching the station. 'But there was nothing he could do once he was down there. He just sat there with the man. He just licked the man’s face trying to get him to move,' said Quinones. As horrified commuters watched an employee of the MTA shouted down to Cecil who by now was sitting upright on the tracks not to move and to lie down in the trench between the tracks. The train, whose driver had seen the two slammed its breaks on and then rolled two carts over Orlando and Cecil. The train's motorman slowed the subway cars while witness called for help. Cecil and Orlando were not struck by the train and only Cecil suffered a gash to his head - presumably from the fall. Cecil said he was astonished by the help from emergency crews and bystanders on the platform. 'Everyone was screaming, everyone was shaking in horror. We heard someone on the other side scream he’s fine, he’s alive!' said student Ashley Prenza to the New York Post. 'It was a big relief for everyone.' FDNY Capt. Danny O’Sullivan, a 17-year FDNY veteran told the New York Daily News someone must have been watching out for Williams and Orlando. 'We checked out under the train and found that he was not trapped; he was just in between the rails' 'It must have been a lucky day for him. This definitely is a miracle.' Emotional: Cecil Williams wipes tears from his face during an interview as he rests in his hospital bed following a fall onto subway tracks from the platform at 125th Street, Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2013, in New York . Relaxing: Cecil Williams rests in his hospital bed as his guide dog Orlando rests in the corner following a fall onto subway tracks from the platform, Tuesday, Dec. 17, 2013, in New York . Thankful: 'The dog saved my life,' Williams said, his voice breaking at times . As Williams regained consciousness, he heard someone telling him to be still. Emergency workers put him on a stretcher and pulled him from the subway, and made sure the dog was not badly injured. 'I'm feeling amazed,' Williams said. 'I feel that God, the powers that be, have something in store from me. They didn't take me away this time. I'm here for a reason.' Police said both Williams and the dog were taken to a hospital where they were expected to recover. Williams says he is not sure why he lost consciousness, but he is on insulin and other medications. Police said both Williams and the dog were taken to a hospital where they were expected to recover.

Orlando, a seriously laid-back dog, was at the hospital making new friends — and he will be rewarded with some type of special treat, Williams said, and will be given plenty of affection and scratches behind the ears. Williams, of Brooklyn, has been blind since 1995, and Orlando is his second dog. The lab will be 11 on Jan. 5, and will be retiring soon, Williams said. His health insurance will not cover the cost of a non-working dog, so he will be looking for a good home for him. If he had the money, Williams said, 'I would definitely keep him.'

"A computer game called 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary School' has caused fury and deep upset to families of the victims and survivors of the massacre. The simulation game allows players to re-enact the terrible day of the shooting on December 14 last year where 20 children and six teaching staff were killed by a gunman in Newtown, Connecticut. The game, which has already been taken down by one website where it was posted, allows users to 'shoot mother', collect ammunition and move through the school firing weapons. A video game called 'The Slaying of Sandy Hook Elementary School' has caused pain and outrage among families of victims and survivors . Family of teacher Victoria Soto, who was shot dead protecting her students, tweeted at the creator of the game and questioned his motives for creating it, according to courant.com. An official Twitter account linked to Miss Soto's memorial page reached out to game creator Ryan Jake Lambourn on Monday. 'Please tell us how playing a game that recreates how Vicki died would be beneficial? Please tell us,' the family's tweet read. Lambourn, who claims to be based in Sydney, Australia, replied: 'sure, but you'd learn more by ""playing it"".' The Soto family later released this statement: 'The constant barrage of negative backlash we face as a family is unimaginable. We constantly have to battle people who still to this day, think Sandy Hook is a hoax. For those people I can only say I hope you never have to go through what we do as a family. 'On top of all that, today as we are trying to summon up the courage and composure to face the 1 year anniversary, we learned about a video game that was made called ""The Slaying of Sandy Hook', the title alone, was painful. Through conversation with the maker of the game on twitter, we have learned he intended it to be a video game addressing the gun control debate. But why? We do not understand why anyone would do this? Perhaps someone else knows the answer. 'We do not encourage this game, nor do we condone it. We only bring attention to it so that we can perhaps reach the maker and make him understand why his message was delivered in the most inappropriate way. We cannot understand why anyone would think what happened at Sandy Hook is something that can or should be made into a ""game"". This is real life to us. Every day.' Lambourn defended the game on Twitter saying he created it to highlight the importance of gun control. Gone but not forgotten: An aerial photo showing demolition work near completion at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut last week. The decision was taken to raze the building after the shooting massacre last December .","Family of teacher Victoria Soto, who was killed protecting her students, reached out to the game's creator to ask him why he would do such a thing ."
"Two unknown New Zealand jewellery designers are set to be thrust onto the international stage after Kate picked four of their designs to wear on tour. Tory & Ko, run by young mothers Victoria Taylor and Kirstin O’Brien, have been asked to supply three pairs of earrings and a necklace. They were recommended by Miss Taylor’s sister, New York based fashion designer Rebecca Taylor, who has previously dressed the Duchess. Apparently Kensington Palace ‘liked what they saw’. Scroll down for video . Pretty: The pearl and diamond Tory & Ko earrings chosen by the Duchess of Cambridge for the royal tour . Glamorous: The Duchess of Cambridge is famous for selling out every item she wears . ‘We’ve been emailing back and forth with her staff. They were very specific in their choices,’ Wellington-based Miss O’Brien said. In the end Kate chose two pairs of earring from the ‘Pretty Collection’ – one in citrine featuring a bow costing £360 and another in blue topaz. The stylish royal also chose a pair of pearl and diamond white gold earrings costing £1,500 and a matching pearl necklace costing £770. It is likely that Kensington Palace would have paid full price for the gems as they refuse to accept unsolicited gifts from companies. But the publicity for the fledgling brand should Kate chose to wear them is worth many times more – most items worn by her become an instant sell-out. One Zealand fashionista also revealed yesterday that palace stylists discreetly visited some of the country’s best known labels to add to the Duchess’s travelling wardrobe on their recce of the country earlier this year. Elegant: The Duchess also plumped for a pair of citrine drops, topped with a 9ct gold and silver bow . Stylish: Pieces by Emilia Wickstead (left) and Karen Walker (right) on the catwalk in London . Murray Bevan said clothes by designers Karen Walker, Trelise Cooper and World have all been considered for the trip. World’s chief executive said tellingly when contacted: ‘I can’t say anything, not a word.’ One designer certain to feature in the Duchess’s wardrobe is London-based Emilia Wickstead, already one of Kate’s favourite designers who is happily a Kiwi by birth.

"Residents in a Cornish village fear their cars may have been ‘possessed’ after vehicles started mysteriously locking and unlocking themselves. People living in Summercourt, near Newquay, have reported door locks bizarrely activating on their own – on one occasion trapping a frightened child inside. Baffled motorists claim dozens of cars in the village have been 'possessed' and have dubbed the area the 'Summercourt Triangle' - named after the famous Bermuda Triangle where a number of aircraft and ships are said to have disappeared under strange circumstances. People living in Summercourt, pictured, in Cornwall, say their cars locked and unlocked by themselves and some would not start . Lin Howard, who has been affected, said residents have changed key fob batteries but the problem, which started six months ago, has remained. She said: ‘Another driver has not been able to start their car. ‘They have to go home, get back to school, get someone to look at the car, then after a period of time it starts again.’ Resident Wendy Malham said: ‘I got in the car to drive to school and the locks were going on-off, on-off, like it was possessed. ‘I can’t actually lock my car anymore because the alarms go off.’ Eerie: Residents are been left baffled after their cars started locking and unlocking themselves and have dubbed their village the 'Summercourt Triangle' Kelvin Malham added: ‘We went to Andover where we didn’t have a problem, but when we returned it started again.’ Expert Mike Parris from car technology consultancy firm SBD said the most likely cause was accidental radio interference adding that it was ‘not unheard of’. He said it could be caused by “almost anything that is wireless”, such as alarm systems, temperature gauges, weather stations or walkie-talkies. ‘Residents could try and keep a log of when they have difficulties, the locations which are worse and anything which helps to pinpoint it. ‘These things are notoriously difficult to pin down,’ he added.","Cars have been locking and unlocking themselves in Summercourt, Cornwall .

"When a strange 'highway' was spotted in the skies in China, few people knew what had caused the unusual astronomical phenomenon. After investigating, meteorological experts think the bizarre pathway was created by a combination of sunbeams 'cast from over the horizon,' clouds high in the sky and shadows. The striking photos of the unusual astronomical phenomena were spotted in the sky above Boao Town of Qionghai City in Hainan Province, South China. An unusual astronomical phenomena above the sky in Boao Town of Qionghai City, Hainan Province in South China. Few people knew what had caused the unusual astronomical phenomenon . Mark . Selzer, forecaster at the Met Office, told MailOnline: 'It’s hard to be completely . sure from a picture, but it’s likely this [sight] is due to a phenomenon known . as crepuscular rays  - or sunbeams - being cast from over the horizon. 'The sun is dim but still shining on parts of the cirrus cloud high up, but the dark blue section is due to shadows being cast. 'The shadows are most likely caused by clouds which can't be seen from the observer's point of view due to the curvature of the earth,' he explained. Cirrus clouds are a type of atmospheric . cloud generally characterised by thin, wispy strands, giving the clouds . their Latin name, meaning a ringlet or curling lock of hair. The cloud strands sometimes appear in tufts of a distinctive form and are referred to by the common name of 'mares' tails'. Meteorological experts from the MET Office think the bizarre pathway was created by a combination of sunbeams 'cast from over the horizon,' clouds high in the sky and shadows . However, a spokesman for the Met Office said the type of cloud 'isn't too important' but it is the height of the clouds that really matters. He said: 'Cirrus is a high level cloud - normally with a cloud base at around 18,000to 40,000ft - and that’s reflecting the light from the sun.' The meteorological experts believe that lower level cloud -  perhaps a cumulonimbus, which has a cloud base of about 1,200 to 6,500ft - is possibly causing a shadow, which is seen as the darker band or 'highway'. Crespular rays play a key role in this strange sight and occur when the sun is behind irregular cloud which cast shadows. The Met Office's spokesman explained: 'Where there are no shadows, you get the effect of well defined sunbeams. Mark Selzer of the Met Office, said: 'It¿s likely this [sight] is due to a phenomenon known as crepuscular rays being cast from over the horizon.The sun is dim but still shining on parts of the cirrus cloud high up, but the dark blue section is due to shadows being cast.' 'In the case of the picture, there is only one shadow, which creates the dark patch across the sky.' However, the experts could not rule out the unlikely possibility that high mountains could have cast the shadow instead of a cloud without an in-depth knowledge of the region's geography. Gavin Pretor-Pinney, founder of the Cloud Appreciation Society, agreed with the Met Office's explanation and added that the optical effects caused by the shadow cast by convection clouds are coming from behind the photographer, as is the light from the sun. He said: 'The shadows that these tall clouds are . casting onto the layer of cloud ahead appear to converge towards a point . on the horizon due to the effect of perspective. It is similar to the . way that train tracks appear to converge off in the distance.' Mr Pretor-Pinner that the effect could actually be described as 'anti-crespular rays' as they converge as they recede into the distance. 'Anti-crepuscular rays are not common, especially rare and dramatic examples like these,' he added.","The strange sight was photographed above Boao Town of Qionghai City in Hainan Province, South China .

"A man accused of murdering three women and hiding their bodies in plastic bags across East Cleveland, Ohio, told police he was inspired by a notorious serial killer who plagued the area two years ago, officers claim. Registered sex offender Michael Madison, 35, was arrested in connection with the murders on Friday after a foul odor coming from his house led police to the bodies of the three women. A woman's body was found on Friday in a garage and two other bodies were found on Saturday - one in a nearby backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The search is continuing for further bodies today as police believe there may be more victims among the neighborhoods many vacant houses.East Cleveland Police Chief Ralph Spotts told searchers he believes there could be one or two more victims, according to the Associated Press. Scroll down for video . Is this the face of a killer?: Registered sex offender Michael Madison, 35, has been arrested in connection with the discovery of three bodies in East Cleveland, OH . Spotts told volunteers searching the neighborhood's vacant homes to be alert for the smell of rotting, the AP reported. Police said the three bodies found were female, but they do not yet know the identities of any . of the victims or the cause of death. All of the women were black and . each body was wrapped in four or five plastic bags. The bodies have been . sent to the coroner's office. All . three women are believed to have been killed in the last six to 10 . days but are decomposed to the point that the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner told media Sunday that determining 'identification and final cause of death may take several days' and will be made available as soon as possible. Madison was arrested after a two-and-a-half hour standoff with police on Friday. East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton said that Madison said during police questioning that Sowell might have inspired the killings and told investigators there may be more bodies. 'He said some things that led us to believe that in some way, shape, or form, Sowell might be an influence,' Norton told the AP.

Madison was charged with possession of, preparation for sale and trafficking of cocaine after a 2000 arrest, according to court records. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, but it is unclear how much time he actually served  on this charge. The sentence ran concurrent with the six month sentence he received for a 1999 drug possession arrest. He was then arrested again in 2001 for attempted drug possession and sentenced to another 12 months in prison before being arrested only three months later for attempted rape, records show. The first woman to be found was described as 5'3 and 110 pounds, according to Cleveland.com. A . second victim was discovered 150 feet from the carport where the first . victim as found.

The neighborhood is reeling from the discovery. 'Something like this is very upsetting to me, to my kids and to my grandchildren,' Bernadette Bass told WOIO. Another woman knew the suspect after having to keep him away from both her daughter and cousin. 'It's very scary, especially when he used to be talking to my daughter,"" Nathenia Crosby, 48, told the AP. 'But I told him he was too old to be talking to my daughter because she was only 19. When I found out how old he was, I said, 'You need to move on, she's too young.' Known as the 'Cleveland Strangler,' Anthony Sowell was discovered by police after a woman escaped his house during an attempted rape. During trial, it was revealed that Sowell raped and strangled 11 women June 2007 to July 2009 and then hid their remains around his Cleveland home. Sowell's victims were all recovering or . current drug addicts aged 24 to 52, the killings were so brutal that . prosecutors called him 'the worst offender in the history of Cuyahoga . County and arguably the State of Ohio. He was sentenced to death and is currently in prison. This is the third high-profile case in Cleveland, Ohio, involving the disappearance of women off the streets of the city. The charges against sex offender Michael Madison comes just two months after a  woman missing for a decade escaped from a run-down Cleveland home, . saying she and two other women had been held captive there for years. Former school bus driver Ariel Castro was later charged with nearly . 1,000 counts of kidnapping, rape and other crimes. The three women . disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and . 20 years old. Each said she had accepted a ride from Castro, who . fathered a daughter, now 6, with one of the women. He has pleaded not . guilty and is jailed on $8 million bond. Anthony Sowell was arrested October 31, 2009, after police investigating a woman's report that she had been raped at his house began finding bodies. Eventually, the remains of 11 troubled women were discovered. Prosecutors say that the victims began disappearing in 2007 and that Sowell lured them to his home with the promise of alcohol or drugs. The victims were disposed of in garbage bags and plastic sheets, then dumped in various parts of the house and yard. Sowell was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to death in the women's murders. He now sits on death row. Sentenced: Anthony Sowell is sentenced to death in 2011 for the rape and murder of 11 women in Cleveland, he may have inspired Madison . Police, the FBI, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department went through yards and abandoned houses in the area where all three bodies were found. They used dogs trained to find cadavers. The search ended around 11 p.m. This weekend's discovery is just the latest in a series of horrific acts uncovered by local police in recent years. Ariel Castro, a retired school bus driver in the Cleveland area, was found in May to have been keeping prisoner three women who vanished more than a decade ago. Officials have levied almost 1,000 counts of rape, kidnap and torture against him after alleging that he routinely chained and raped them, even fathering a child with one of the victims. Castro was also charged with two counts of aggravated murder after he allegedly punched one of the women, causing the unlawful termination of a pregnancy. Dishwasher Charles Ramsey famously freed the women after seeing victim Amanda Berry trying to pry open a door in a home across the street from his, making him an instant celebrity. No charges have yet been filed against Madison, police declined to provide a further update when contacted by MailOnline.","A woman's body was found on Friday in a garage in the East Cleveland suburb of Cleveland .

"Instead of dinner and drinks, your next first date could be tokes and munchies. With niche dating sites targeting everyone from farmers to singles with food allergies, smokers have carved out their own dating portals aimed at pot smokers and medicinal marijuana users. Those looking for a special someone to pass to the left to visit 420singles.net. The 28-year-old founder from California told the Marin Independent Journal he created the site to find his ideal partner. Scroll down for video . Smoking: 420singles.net lets users find singles anywhere in the world that share their passion for pot, and boasts over 22,000 users . 'I smoked marijuana, and I was single,' said Ryan Moxon, 'and I was like, I really want to find a girl who also smokes marijuana, and one thing led to another.' In recent years, 420singles.net saw membership grow thanks to state efforts to legalize weed. 'It’s suddenly much cooler to come out as a toker,' he added. But just because pot sales are now legal in Colorado and Washington and the use of medical marijuana allowed in 23 states and Washington, D.C., doesn't mean finding love is easy. Michigan auto worker and Vietnam vet Lawrence Ward, 59, smokes to counter the side effects of chemotherapy, and got a second date with a woman nearby with similar medical needs. 'It's not hard finding a partner who smokes,' Ward said. 'But what I was looking for was somebody with a similar situation as I had going on with the medical marijuana and being licensed.' Though the 22,000 users are scattered throughout the U.S., Moxon said that 420singles.net has found investors for an expansion in Colorado. Mobile: Pot-friendly singles can use iOS and Android apps for my420mate. 420singles.net so far only has a supported app for Android. 'I shouted out on Twitter. I said I was seeking a $10,000 investment to kick me off and they responded,' Moxon said. 'We're going to do a large-scale, targeted ad campaign in Colorado.' Another site competing for the title of the 'Cupid of cannabis' is my420mate.com, which boasts both iOS and Android mobile apps, but has still struggled breaking into the mainstream dating scene. 420 is a reference to April 20, an important date in cannabis culture. The Daily Caller reported that Comcast's Denver offices refused to air a commercial for the company, telling cofounder Jay Lindberg that it wouldn't run ads for the marijuana industry. 'We’re not taking any biz from the new industry,' said Ariana Dobson, a national account executive with Comcast. And while these sites continue to help chill singles find their match online, Moxon has his own decidedly less chill story of trying to find love. 'She met someone else on my site that went to her college and they started dating.'","Pot-friendly singles visit sites like 420singles.net and my420mate.com to connect with interested parties .

"A grandfather battling cancer claims he managed to cure himself of the disease using cannabis oil. Mike Cutler, 63, was diagnosed in 2009 after blacking out at work - and was given a transplant in November that year. He was given the all-clear but says the disease came back in late 2012 - attacking the new organ he had been given. Scroll down for video . Mike Cutler claims the cancerous cells in his liver disappeared after he began taking home-made cannabis oil . Desperate to survive, he began to look online - and found a YouTube video which described the use of cannabis oil as a cure. He claims that just three days after taking the class B drug, his excruciating pain disappeared. In May this year, the grandfather-of-nine went for a biopsy at the Royal Free Hospital in London. Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK’s science communications manager, told MailOnline: 'We know that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'These stories can help researchers build a picture of whether these treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with cannabis extract and a synthetic cannabinoid In order to gather solid data on how best these drugs can be used to benefit people with cancer.' To his relief, doctors told him the new cancerous cells had vanished. A spokeswoman for the Royal Free Hospital confirmed Mr Cutler had not . received any cancer treatment since his transplant in November 2009. Mr Cutler, a retired builder from Hastings, East Sussex, said: 'Finding out I could die was terrible. 'All I had in those dark days was my laptop, and that's when I began searching for something else that could help me - I couldn't accept I was going to die. 'When I found out I was cured I was just completely shocked. I'm a normal family man, not a druggie. I had a serious illness and this helped.' He started taking cannabis after watching a video online about how it could help cure the disease. After purchasing the drug through a dealer, he began to cultivate his own tablets from the oil, taking one capsule a day. When his symptoms disappeared after three days, he began growing his own cannabis plant to keep up a steady supply of the medication. Mr Cutler was one of the speakers at an event last week about the medical use of cannabis - along with Professor David Nutt and MP Caroline Lucas at Brighton Community Centre. He is now campaigning for changes in the . law to allow the oil and other forms of cannabis to be legally used . medicinally to treat other people. When his symptoms disappeared after three days, Mr Cutler began growing his own cannabis plant to keep up a steady supply of the medication . Research published last week by scientists at the University of East Anglia found the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis - Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC - has been shown to help combat the growth of cancerous cells. Dr Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK’s science communications manager, said: 'These experiments were done using cancer cells grown in the lab or in mice and the results help to unpick the details of how cannabinoids affect cancer cells at a molecular level. 'This could potentially lead to more effective treatments for cancer in the future, but there’s still no good data from clinical trials to show that cannabis or cannabinoids can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients at the moment.' Cannabinoids help to control brain and nerve activity, energy metabolism, heart function, the immune system and even reproduction. As a result, a number of charities have intensified their research into the use of cannabis as a medical drug.

"A husband who saved his 60-year-old wife from the jaws of a cougar by spearing it to death has been praised by others who believe the same animal tried to attack them. Reacting swiftly to his wife's screams, the unidentified man grabbed a boar spear and stabbed the animal several times until it fled. It was later found dead nearby. The woman's skull was reportedly crushed by the animal and part of her scalp was missing, according to one of the rescue team. Unprecedented: A 60-year-old man has attacked and killed a cougar with a spear after it mauled his wife while she was gardening at their home in British Columbia, Canada . Now other residents in the western Canadian island have come forward saying they believe the same aggressive animal tried to attack them. Troy Haddock, maritime coordinator with the Joint Rescue Co-ordination Centre, in Victoria, told the Vancouver Sun the wife suffered several puncture wounds, including on her head and scalp. 'It’s our understanding that she has undergone surgery and is in post-operative care. [She] is in stable condition and is expected to recover,' said conservation officer Sergeant Ben York in interview with the Globe and Mail. The attack happened late Sunday afternoon when the couple were in the back yard of their home on Flores Island in Clayoquot Sound, on the west coast of Vancouver Island. Lucky: According to the Vancouver Sun, the woman suffered severe head injuries from the attack, which happened Sunday late afternoon . The 60-year-old was gardening when the big cat launched at her, mauling her. Her husband immediately grabbed the spear and repeatedly hurled it into the animal until it ran away. Conservation officers later found the cougar, dead, about 20metres from the attack. It is thought it died from it's multiple wounds, but a necropsy is also scheduled to be carried out. Mr York, speaking the the Globe and Mail, praised the man's bravery and said this was an unprecedented case of a cougar having being killed. 'I’m pretty sure that this is the first time in B.C., if not Canada and maybe even North America, where someone has stopped an attack by a cougar with a spear and killed it with a spear,' he said. 'I understand why he did it, but it still takes a lot of bravery to do what he did and I’m glad he was there to rescue her. You know it could have turned out a lot differently if he hadn’t been around, he added. The woman was taken by a coast guard ship to nearby Tofino before being airlifted to hospital in Victoria. Other residents no Flores Island have also praised the man's bravery and claim they believe the same aggressive animal has made several opportunist attacks nearby. Island resident Bill Dennis told the Vancouver Sun a cougar leapt out of the channel and chased him and a friend in June. British Columbia, pictured, is a region rich in biodiversity including big predators like cougars and bears . He said it went for his friend but missed, then it came for him up a ramp. After sprinting away, the big cat then went for his friend again. Mr Dennis told the newspaper a schoolteacher had also been stalked by a cougar and so had a tourist on a Wildside Trail.","Cougar mauled the woman on Sunday afternoon as she was gardening .

"Seth Rogen showed up to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to give an emotional address about Alzheimer's disease, but his sadness soon turned to ire as he watched Congress members leave the already nearly empty hearing. 'All those empty seats are senators who are not prioritizing Alzheimer's,' the normally jovial Rogen tweeted following the hearing. He followed up his speech with an appearance on Hardball in which he again called out the 16 Senators who ducked out early or failed to even show up to his speech. Scroll down for video... Disappointed: Actor Seth Rogen was non-too-happy with the showing at his Senate Committee on Appropriations after only 2 of the Senator members deigned to sit through his emotional speech on the disease . Empty house: Only two senators--Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin and Kansas Republican Jerry Moran--stayed to listen to Rogen. He even watched some of them leave . 'It's indicative of a mentality that we find so frustrating. It seems like these people don't care,' he told host Chris Matthews. Making the poor showing by the all the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies members more offensive was how one of his central issues was of the ignorance and even shame surrounding the disease. Rogen said he even watched as many of the committee members stood and left before he addressed them. In a particularly confounding move, Senator Mark Kirk even tweeted at Rogen thanking him for his speech. 'Thanks to @Sethrogen for speaking out about efforts to #ENDALZ. RT if you know someone affected by #Alzheimers,' wrote the Illinois Republican. Oops: Senator Mark Kirk had the nerve to thank Rogen for his speech and even tweeted out a photo of himself with the actor, but didn't stay for the speech . Lashing out: Rogen was a charmer while he addressed the mere two Senators who stuck around to hear him, but afterwards he made his true feelings known . Only he didn't see it. At least not in person. 'Pleasure meeting you. Why did you leave before my speech? Just curious,' Rogen shot back. if the actor seems touchy, it's because the issue hits very close to home for him. Rogen’s mother-in-law Adele Miller was diagnosed with the disease very early and the 31-year-old actor told the Senate Appropriation Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services how his view of the devastating illness changed as he watched her slowly lose the ability to care for herself. The Pineapple Express star spoke in support of legislation that would increase federal funding for Alzheimer's disease while his emotional wife Lauren Miller sat watching from the  gallery.

The jolly actor broke the ice with a few off-color jokes, the likes of which such dry committee hearings rarely see . Above it all: 'This has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana,' he joked. 'In fact, if you can believe it, this concerns something that I find even more important' Despite the poor attendance, Rogen deftly broke the ice in what would ordinarily have been a typically dry subcommittee hearing. ‘This has nothing to do with the legalization of marijuana,’ he joked. ‘In fact, if you can believe it, this concerns something that I find even more important.’ Laughs rippled through the room. The actor was making weed jokes to senators. Rogen also poked fun at Committee Chairman Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). 'You told me you never saw Knocked Up, chairman,' he said, after lamenting that the committee members had no clue who he was. ‘I will wager this is the first time in any congressional hearing in history that the words ""knocked up"" have been used,' Harkin shot back. Rogen soon got serious about why he was there. Close to home: Rogen's mother-in-law Adele Miller was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's in her mid-50s. She'd forgotten who she was and how to care for herself by 60. Here, Rogen sits with his wife Lauren Miller at the Capitol Hill hearing . ‘I started dating my wife Lauren nine years ago when her mother was almost 54 years old. It was during this trip, the first time I met my now mother-in-law, that Lauren first admitted to herself and then to me that something was off with her mother,’ he said. ‘Soon after this trip at 55 years old Lauren's mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.’ Rogen said Adele Miller’s Alzheimer’s did not only begin early in life, but also progressed quickly. ‘After forgetting who she and her loved one were,’ Rogen told the panel. ‘She forgot how to speak, feed herself, dress herself, all by age of 60.’ Rogen is one of the Alzheimer's Association’s celebrity champions. He’s also started his own charity with his wife. ‘The situation is so dire, that it caused me, a lazy, self-involved, generally self-medicated man-child, to start an entire charity organization,’ he said. The 'Knocked Up' star praised his father-in-law for making Adele comfortable as her disease progresses and opened up about his decision to start his own fund, 'Hilarity for Charity,' to support other families and research on the illness. He added: ’I came here today for few reasons. One I'm a huge “House of Cards” fan. ... Two, people need more help. I've personally witnessed the massive amount of financial strain this disease causes. ...Three, to show people they are not alone, so few people share their personal stories.’ The attendees were moved by Rogen's words but the actor was disappointed in the attendance .","The 31-year-old actor's mother-in-law suffers from early onset Alzheimer's .

"This spurned husband would have been served up a nasty shock along with his pint after his soon to be ex-wife announced she was divorcing him via a sign outside a bar . The angry woman persuaded staff at nightspot Noah's Yard in Swansea's Uplands district to put up the sign reading ‘Paul...I am divorcing you’ above the door. Her statement was then followed up with a further message proclaiming: ‘BTW I am keeping the dog’. Shock: An angry wife persuaded staff at nightspot Noah's Yard in Swansea's Uplands district to put up the sign reading 'Paul... I am divorcing you' above the door . Anger: The sign expressing her wife for a divorce was followed up with a statement revealing she was keeping the couple's dog . The wife, who wished to remain . anonymous, went into Noah’s Yard — which has a history of changing the . words on its sign — on Tuesday to ask for the sign to be put up at the . weekend. She said the reason behind her doing it was to name and shame her husband after finding out he allegedly had an affair. 'I was angry and upset so wanted a sign to go up for everyone to see,' she told the  South Wales Evening Post. 'When I found out I went through a mixture of emotions but felt angry and wanted him to pay. 'I had a drink in the bar on Tuesday and decided to get my own back. 'We have been married for years and it is so sad it has come to this. Telling the world: The woman said she was angry and upset so wanted a sign to go up for everyone to see . 'I am absolutely devastated and going through a really tough time at the moment. 'A lot of my friends and family have seen it and have been supporting me. 'I did feel a bit better once the sign went up. I wanted to name and shame him.' The wife said she had messaged Paul to tell him to go read the sign and he was furious when he saw it. However, neighbours have backed the woman's efforts to get her own back. Linda . Davies, who lives close to the bar, said: 'Good on her. If my husband . ever cheated on me then I would string him up by his privates. 'Maybe he thought he could get away with sleeping around but I bet he is regretting it now.' Passerby Ron Williams said it would keep a lot of men in the area on their toes. He said: 'I would be mortified if that ever happened to me. New beginnings: Bar owner Noah Redfern said the drinking spot has had a lot of unusual messages displayed on the building before, but this statement was definitely a first . 'This could give a lot of wives in the city an idea - I'm guessing there will be a few nervous husbands walking down the street today.' Noah’s Yard changes the words on its sign on a regular basis, often displaying statements such as 'Go Wales' for rugby matches. The bar once had a romantic proposal emblazoned above the entrance, coincidentally reading 'Marry Me Paul', although it was no known if the same woman was behind the sign. It also supported the city of culture campaign by . emblazoning the campaign logo on its premises. Noah Redfern, owner of Noah’s Yard, said they have had a lot of unusual messages displayed on their building before — but this was definitely a first.

"A window shatters. The sound of footsteps is followed by sharp cracks of gunshots, a teenager's groans and a fall. Minutes later, there are more bangs and screams from another teen before she, too, was silenced by a central Minnesota homeowner who was convicted of plotting the whole thing. A day after Byron Smith was found guilty of premeditated murder, jurors said the audio of the Thanksgiving Day 2012 killings of two unarmed teens - a recording that the 65-year-old switched on before the break-in occurred - was key in his conviction. The . recording captured the sounds of Smith shooting Brady as he came down . the stairs. Brady groans after the first and second shots, but is silent . after a third shot, and Smith can be heard saying, 'You're dead.' Scroll Down to Listen: WARNING GRAPHIC AND DISTURBING CONTENT . Guilty: Byron Smith on Tuesday in Little Falls, Minnesota on the day the jury took only about three hours to reject his claim of self-defense. He was immediately sentenced to life without parole . Prosecutors say Smith put Brady's body on a tarp and dragged it into another room, then sat down and reloaded his weapon. Rejected defense: Byron Smith walks into the courtroom to hear the verdict in his murder trial . Kifer . whispers, 'Nick?' A shot is fired, and Kifer screams 'oh my God'. Smith apologizes . as his gun jams, then fires at Kifer four more times and says: 'You're . dying, b***h'. A sixth and final shot - Smith described it as a 'finishing . shot' to investigators - was heard soon after. 'That was the most damning piece of evidence in my mind,' Wes Hatlestad, one of 12 jurors, said Wednesday. 'That audio recording of the actual killings and the audio recording of Mr. Smith's interview immediately after his arrest ... pretty much convinced me that we were dealing with a deranged individual.' Smith shot 17-year-old Nick Brady and 18-year-old Haile Kifer as they descended the stairs into his basement, where prosecutors say Smith was waiting. Jurors convicted Byron Smith, 65, and a judge sentenced him to life in prison without the possibility of parole for killing at his home in rural Little Falls, Minnesota, on Thanksgiving Day in November 2012. Listen Here: . Shot: In this undated photo released by Morrison County Attorney's Office, the basement of Minnesota homeowner Byron Smith where Smith shot and killed two teenagers during a break-in is seen . On a day most Americans spend gathering with family and friends, Smith had turned on an audio recorder and sat down with a novel alone in a basement chair wedged between bookcases with a rifle at his side and a handgun on his hip . The case helped fuel a national debate about how far a person can go to protect himself from bodily harm and his home. It also divided Little Falls, a town of about 8,300 located 100 miles north of Minneapolis. Smith never denied shooting the teens, but told police he had feared for his life. Prosecutors say Smith had moved his truck to make it look like no one was home, then sat in a chair at the bottom of his stairs with a book, energy bars, a bottle of water and two guns. He also set up a hand-held recorder on a bookshelf. Kifer's aunt, Laurie Skipper, read a statement from her niece's parents: 'Byron Smith made a conscious choice to shoot and kill our beautiful daughter Haile. The feelings of helplessness are overwhelming.' Prosecutors said Smith's . plan was set in motion on the morning of the killings, after Smith saw a . neighbor whom he believed responsible for prior burglaries.

Lost life: Cousins Haile Kifer, 18 (left), and . Nick Brady, 17 (right), were shot dead on Thanksgiving Day 2012 after . breaking into Smith's home in Little Falls, Minnesota . Hunted: Smith claimed he killed the teens in self-defense, but prosecutors proved that he staked out in the basement of his home - waiting for burglars . On a day most Americans spend gathering with family and friends, Smith had turned on an audio recorder and sat down with a novel alone in a basement chair wedged between bookcases with a rifle at his side and a handgun on his hip. Smith also set up a hand-held recorder on a bookshelf, which . captured audio of the shootings, and had installed a surveillance system . that recorded images of Brady trying to enter the house. Defense attorneys said Smith was afraid after prior break-ins and was hiding from intruders, whom he feared were armed. Smith had previously installed video surveillance, and defense attorney Steve Meshbesher said Wednesday that Smith set up the audio recording as another means of protection. 'He was afraid that he might be killed,' Meshbesher said. 'He did it in case he was shot and killed in his house, and the police would have some evidence to use, and the family would be able to find the perpetrators.' Meshbesher said jurors should have heard the whole recording, not just the portion selected by prosecutors. He said Smith plans to appeal. Ted Sampsell-Jones, a criminal law professor at William Mitchell College of Law, said the audio recording was devastating to the defense, noting that Smith's taunts to the victims don't show a man in a panic. 'It was very powerful, and it makes it very clear that ... he didn't do this because he had to. He did it because he wanted to. And that is not what self-defense is about,' Sampsell-Jones said. Vermin: Audio recordings played in the trial revealed Smith calling the teens 'vermin' after shooting them dead in his basement. Pictured above leaving court on Tuesday .

Fighting: Smith's lawyer said they would be appealing the case. pictured above on Tuesday . Hatlestad said he felt early on in the trial that the killings were planned. He said the fact that Smith moved his truck from his home was significant, and he was struck that Smith positioned himself at the bottom of the stairs in 'a little hidey hole,' with a tarp ready. He said jurors went through each charge point by point, 'and reasonably quickly came to the conclusion that we thought it was in fact premeditated,' Hatlestad said. He said jurors talked about the 'deer stand' that Smith set up to wait for the teens, and he also compared the set up to a 'shooting gallery' - a carnival game where a shooter waits for an object to march into view. The two cousins were active in athletics at two . local high schools. They were also linked to a burglary the day before . they were shot and killed, though the judge excluded evidence about . their histories from the trial as irrelevant . The teens' killings stirred debate around the state and in Little Falls - a Mississippi River city of 8,000 about 100 miles northwest of Minneapolis - about how far a homeowner can go in responding to a threat. Minnesota law allows deadly force to prevent a felony from taking place in one's home or dwelling, but one's actions must be considered reasonable under the circumstances. Hatlestad said jurors gave careful consideration to the self-defense and defense-of-dwelling claims. He said the jurors supported Minnesota's laws, but found that Smith's actions didn't meet the requirements to justify the teens' killings. 'I do think he had some fear,' Hatlestad said. 'But his reaction to it was very unreasonable.'","Minnesota court releases tapes recorded by killer Byron Smith, 65, of the moments he killed the two teens who tried to rob him on Thanksgiving 2012 .

"Sean Dyche is feeling the love from fans of other clubs as he attempts to defy the odds and keep Burnley in the Premier League. The Clarets have the smallest budget of any team in the top flight but go into the final 12 games of the season separated from safety only by goal difference. Burnley have covered more miles than any other team this season and matched the global superstars of Manchester City and Chelsea away from home with a squad consisting predominantly of British and Irish players. Burnley manager joins his squad in applauding their travelling fans after the 1-1 draw at Chelsea . If Dyche was in any way concerned Ashley Barnes' controversial clash with Nemanja Matic at Stamford Bridge last weekend might harm Burnley's appeal, he would have been reassured by a trip to the Etihad on Tuesday. He said: 'I was at Manchester City the other night and there were loads of City fans coming up saying, ''I hope you do it."" 'There's a story behind the story. Written off at the beginning of the season, written off after game 10, and I think there is a stiff-upper-lip mentality to that with British fans. Danny Ings celebrates Ben Mee's (right) equaliser against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last Saturday . 'That underdog spirit and bulldog spirit, back in the day. I think it's still there, it just needs igniting once in a while, and maybe people deem us to be part of that.' Burnley are back at Turf Moor this weekend, with Swansea the visitors fresh from their victory over Manchester United. The Clarets gave United a scare at Old Trafford earlier this month before slipping to a 3-1 loss and then fought back from a goal down to draw 1-1 at Stamford Bridge. Dyche admitted it has been hard to take that Burnley's performances have not been rewarded with more points. Sean Dyche expects Ashley Barnes to react well to the furore caused by his clash with Nemanja Matic . Barnes goes in for a two-footed challenge on Chelsea midfielder Matic during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge . He said: 'Particularly the last few weeks, I think we've been operating at a very high level. And yet, we've got a couple of points out of three games. 'I'm surprised but that's the nature of the Premier League. It's very tough to win. The next one comes and we'll be ready for it for sure. We're in good shape mentally and physically. 'I think we've got complete freedom to go hard for the next 12 games and see where it takes us.' Because of Burnley's size relative to their rivals, Dyche has been able to instil belief and expectation into his side while playing the underdog card to dismiss any talk of pressure. Winger Michael Kightly said: 'Everyone ruled us out last year and said we had no chance of getting promotion and we did that. Dyche, animated on the touchline at Stamford Bridge, is determined to keep the Clarets in the Premier League . 'This year before we even started everyone was saying we were going to get relegated, we were going to be way off the mark, and we've proved we're still in the mix, and that's after not winning in the first 10 games. 'We've definitely shown people we're a decent side but we might as well keep that underdog tag and build on it.' Swansea was Burnley's first away trip of the season, with Nathan Dyer's first-half goal clinching a 1-0 win for the hosts. 'From that day, we believed we were Premier League players,' said Kightly. Swansea are next up for Burnley, who defeated Manchester United 2-1 in the Premier League last Saturday . 'We took our time getting our first win, but once we got that we've really built on the confidence around the place and feel that we're growing. We just need to start turning those performances into wins.' Kightly has had to bide his time, with Dyche's fondness for a consistent side limiting him to only eight starts this season, but he looks set for a run in the team after Dean Marney's campaign was ended by a cruciate ligament injury. Kightly replaced Marney in the 2-2 draw against West Brom two weeks ago and kept his place for the games against United and Chelsea. He said: 'I've been pleased with my last two performances. Obviously it's been a bit frustrating, I haven't played as much as I'd like. 'It is tough. It's taken Dean Marney getting injured for me to play, which is not nice, but I've got to take that opportunity and hopefully I can stay in the team until the end of the season.'","Burnley are currently 18th, inside the Premier League relegation zone .

"The PanicMe app can send red, amber or green alerts to let up to 30 contacts know you are in danger . Smartphone users can now set off a personal panic button to alert family and friends that they are in danger. PanicMe fires off alerts of differing levels of importance to a chosen network of contacts if the user feels threatened or vulnerable. The sender's location is then pinpointed using GPRS and potential responders can see how close they are so they can put a plan of action in place. Offering a traffic light of options, a red alert tells contacts the sender is in imminent danger of being attacked or hurt, amber suggests you will need help soon, while green means you are in a low risk situation, such as being lost or breaking down. The alerts can be sent to up to 30 contacts and can be accessed by police, who are able to login when notified at their control room. Contacts are notified by pop-messages on their smartphones at regular intervals, with the space between the alerts depending on the panic button option. The alerts only stop once the alarm is deactivated by the sender. The app, which launches this week, was developed by experts at DataMe, who worked alongside local police forces to come up with a program to help people feel safer in their daily lives. Former Deputy Chief Constable David Lindley, who who acted as a consultant on the project, says: 'There may be any number of reasons and circumstances why people feel afraid or vulnerable. 'With so many people these days having a . mobile phone, apps such as PanicMe cannot only help to make those in . need feel much safer but can also give peace of mind to those who care . for them.' The alerts are delivered to your contacts' smartphones, using GPRS to pinpoint your location and showing them how close they are to you . Smartphone users can download a limited option of the PanicMe button for free, but it only offers a green panic alert. The complete version costs £14.99 and is available for the year on Apple, Android and Windows Smartphones. The app's release comes months after a survey by Ipsos Mori and Kings College London found that two thirds of adults did not believe that crime rates were falling, suggesting the public is more wary than ever about their personal safety. It's the latest smartphone add-on which can warn us of potentially dangerous situations - the recently unveiled MyWitness records video and audio to gather evidence during unexpected confrontations.","PanicMe sends out red, amber or green alerts to up to 30 contacts if user feels at risk .

"Gus Poyet has reassured Emanuele Giaccherini that he has a future at Sunderland after a nightmare two seasons at the Stadium of Light.

"Hull winger Robbie Brady has revealed his part in the crucial winning goal against QPR provided a sweet end to a worrying week. Brady missed several days of training ahead of last weekend's crunch relegation clash after his one-year-old daughter Halle was taken to hospital in Dublin with a virus. Tigers boss Steve Bruce was happy to give the Irishman the time he needed to support his family, but was also delighted when Brady declared himself ready to return to the club on Friday and face Rangers 24 hours later. Robbie Brady was in hospital with his ill daughter ahead of facing QPR but returned to set up a late winner . The Hull winger was in Dublin but with daughter Halle's health improving he returned to play for the Tigers . It was hardly ideal preparation - physically or emotionally - for Brady, but it was his fine cross that set up Dame N'Doye for a last-gasp winner at the KC Stadium. 'We had a little bump in the road, my daughter wasn't well and was in hospital for a few days,' he said. 'I felt I needed to be with her for a few days and I was. 'The manager phoned me to make sure everything was okay and she was picking up, so I flew back in and trained Friday to prepare for the game. Manager Steve Bruce called Brady on Friday ahead of the game and he flew back with 24 hours to spare . Brady's cross created the decisive moment against 10-man QPR, setting up the winning goal in stoppage time . 'My heart was set on playing, especially having just got back in the team recently, and thankfully everything was okay.' Brady's issues were not widely known when he took the field last weekend, but he believes it is important that footballers are not seen as immune from problems such as his. 'We're just normal people. It's still as real for us when something like that happens,' he said. 'That's what comes first for us, just like for anyone else.

"Hull may be looking to stretch their unbeaten run to four matches against Stoke, but manager Steve Bruce has warned his players they remain in a 'horrible dogfight' The Tigers took just three points from a possible 12 in January and their prospects were looking bleak after successive defeats to West Brom, West Ham and Newcastle. But a battling draw at Manchester City raised spirits and victories over fellow strugglers Aston Villa and QPR see Bruce's boys head into Saturday's match in 15th place. Hull manager Steve Bruce has warned his players that they are still in a 'horrible dogfight' to beat the drop . The Tigers are currently unbeaten in three Premier League games and beat QPR 2-1 last time out . Hull have won two and drawn one of their last three games and are currently 15th in the league table . There is no sense of complacency, though, with Bruce well aware of how quickly the picture could change again between now and May. 'The result against Manchester City gave everyone a lift at the right time and back-to-back wins against teams around us...how good that feels,' he said. 'Two weeks ago we were in the bottom three and now we're four points clear, but we've got to maintain it. 'We're not out of the woods yet. We're in a horrible dogfight and there's eight or nine teams in with us who are all feeling it. 'If you can put another couple of results together at this particular stage of the season it will really help. 'They're all really big games - how often have we said that? - but within a week we're nearly down to single figures in terms of games to play.' Dame N'Doyle (right) and Nikica Jelavic (left) celebrate Hull's second goal in the 2-1 win over QPR . Should Hull emerge from their trip to Stoke and Tuesday night's home clash with Sunderland with two positive results, they would surely be a long way towards guaranteeing a third straight season in the top flight. Bruce is aiming for a regular seat at the top table and sees Stoke as a perfect example of what is possible. 'It's a really healthy club,' he said. 'That's something we aim to achieve here. Stoke and West Brom are two types of club we can take an example from. 'They're well run, they built their training grounds up and the infrastructure to go with it, and over the years they've steadily become established Premier League teams. 'That's something we can aspire to. The longer we're here, the better the squad becomes and the better facilities become.' Stoke City defender Erik Pieters (left) jumps for the ball ahead of Aston Villa's Andreas Weimann (right) Steve Bruce has hailed Stoke as a 'really healthy club' for their stability in the Premier League .

The Senegal midfielder was a revelation in the weeks following his summer switch from West Ham, scoring four times in his first five matches, but he has not been seen since a knee injury on December 3. A new setback last week scuppered his planned return and he is not yet back in training. 'He won't make this weekend and I don't think he'll make Tuesday,' said Bruce. 'I'm hoping after this weekend he can join in but he certainly needs another 10 days to two weeks, I'd have thought.' Bruce said that Hull midfielder Mohamed Diame is still a couple of weeks away from returning from injury .","Hull are unbeaten in three Premier League games and 15th in the table .

"Authorities are investigating whether Jesse Matthew was involved in up to 10 crimes against women in Virginia, after the 31-year-old was arrested under suspicion of kidnapping still-missing college student Hannah Graham. Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police tried to question him in the disappearance of the 19-year-old University of Virginia student. The UVA nurses's assistant was the last person seen with Graham the night she went missing from downtown Charlottesville. Now investigators are looking into Matthew's movements over the last 12 years, focusing in on the more than six months he attended Christopher Newport University when two other young women disappeared without a trace. Scroll down for video . Serial offender? Jesse Matthew has been charged in the disappearance of University of Virginia college student Hannah Graham (right). Authorities are tracing his whereabouts for the last 12 years, believing he may have been involved in more crimes against women in the state . Arrested: Jesse Matthew was arrested in Texas last week after fleeing Virginia when police asked to question him about Graham. Seen exiting a private plane under federal guard . Matthew transferred to the Newport News school after being kicked out of Liberty University in Lynchburg in 2002 following allegations of rape. He attended CNU from January 2003 before dropping out the following October. During that time, two local women went missing and were never found again. Autumn Wind Day, 24, was last seen shopping at the Food Lion grocery store two miles from campus when she disappeared on July 24, 2003. Less than two months later, 31-year-old Sophie May Rivera went missing after leaving her home located seven miles from CNU. Matthew left the CNU football team five days after Rivera vanished, and dropped out of school a month later. Two more victims? Sophie May Rivera (left) and Autumn Wind Day (right) both went missing from Newport News, Virginia when Matthew was attending local college Christopher Newport University in 2003. Authorities there say they are reopening both cold cases. Neither woman was ever found . Local police are now reopening the two cold cases to see if Matthew may have been involved. 'While there are no indications that Jesse Matthew is connected to these two cases, both will be reviewed,' Newport News police spokesman Lou Thurston told WAVY. It's uncertain what Matthew did for the next several years. However, new forensic evidence connects him to the high-profile abduction, rape and murder of 20-year-old Morgan Harrington. Filling in the blanks: Matthew used to work as a taxi driver and a source told MailOnline that he used to give girls free rides. It's uncertain what he did between dropping out of CNU in 2003, and picking up his career as a cabbie in 2010 . Big break: Police said on Monday that there is a forensic link between the rape and murder of Morgan Harrington, 20 (left), in 2009 and the disappearance of Hannah Graham, 18 on September 13. Police are also looking into whether Matthew may have played a role in the murder of 23-year-old Cassandra Morton (right), who went missing around the same time as Morgan Harrington . Morgan disappeared in 2009 and her body was found three months later, hidden at a remote farm. DNA evidence of her killer, found on her remains, has since been linked to a 2005 rape case of a Fairfax woman who survived the attack. Eight years after dropping out of CNU, Matthew reappears in 2010 working as a taxi driver in Charlottesville. Two years later he got a position as a nurse's assistant at UVA Medical Cenewhere he was just recently fired following Graham's disappearance. In that time, he may have played a role in the death of Morgan, and also another local woman who went missing around the same time - 23-year-old Lynchburg resident Cassandra Morton. Morton's decomposing body was found in November 2009 and the homicide remains unsolved. Missing on Route 29: Five women have gone missing in and around Charlottesville, Virginia, just a few minutes' drive from the same highway in the last five years. Morgan Harrington's body was the only one every found . Authorities in Montgomery County Virginia are also reopening the double homicide of couple Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were found shot dead in a campground near the Virginia Tech campus in August 2009. 'Our investigators will certainly follow up and look at the facts surrounding the Hannah Graham case to see if there is a connection. However, at this time we have nothing to lead us to believe that there is a connection,' Capt. Brian Wright told ABC News. Double murder: Police in Montgomery County, Virginia are looking into whether Matthew could have played a role in the murders of couple Heidi Childs and David Metzler, who were found shot dead in a campground near Virginia Tech in August 2009 .

"Germany’s express delivery company, Deutsche Post (DHL), is testing a drone that could be used to deliver urgently needed goods such as medicine to remote locations in the future. The debut of the yellow remote-controlled helicopter follows the debut of Amazon's octocopter, which could be used to deliver packages to its customers in the future, replacing postmen and cutting the delivery times of its goods. The German firm’s small quadcopter flew a package of medicine from a pharmacy in the city of Bonn to the company’s headquarters on the other side of the Rhine river. DHL said its yellow drone would be used to delivery urgently needed goods such as medicine to remote locations. The aircraft can carry approximately six-and-a-half pounds and has four propellers . The aircraft can carry approximately six-and-a-half pounds (three kilograms) and has four propellers, while Amazon’s robot has eight. DHL’s yellow drone is known as the ‘Paketkopter’ and flew at a height of 50 metres for one kilometre, taking just two minutes to complete its journey, The Local reported. Two men controlled the vehicle using a remote control, but the company said technology is available to send the drones to a specified location using GPS alone. DHL’s spokesman, Thomas Kutsch, said the . flights all this week are strictly a research project to see if the . technology works and there are no plans yet to start actual drone . deliveries. The German firm’s small pilot-less quadcopter flew a package of medicine from a pharmacy in the city of . Bonn to the company’s headquarters on the other side of the Rhine river (pictured right) It was controlled remotely by technicians (pictured left) The test flights required permission from local aviation authorities. Amazon plans to deliver goods to customers by drone within five years, despite legal obstacles in the U.S. Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, said that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes. Customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber. The company's yellow drone is known as the 'Paketkopter' and flew at a height of 50 metres for one kilometre, taking just two minutes to complete its journey . Speaking to US TV network CBS, Bezos said: ‘I know this looks like science fiction. It’s not.’ Bezos’ claims raise the prospect of a future where drones travel across the sky all the time ferrying post around - and perhaps one day even letters, too. In the interview Bezos said that the drones would be able to carry goods up to 5lb in weight, which covers 86 per cent of the items that the company delivers. Bezos said that he wants to launch the ‘Amazon Prime Air’ service within four to five years, though that will almost certainly be in the US before anywhere else. This ruling paves the way for companies, including Amazon, to use drones to deliver goods commercially across the United States, pictured. However, companies may still come up against regulations that prohibit any aircraft to fly autonomously, without anyone at the controls .","Deutsche Post's drone flew a box of medicine from a pharmacy in the city of Bonn to the company's headquarters on the other side of the Rhine river .
