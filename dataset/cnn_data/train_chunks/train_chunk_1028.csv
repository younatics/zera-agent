"Roy Keane has insisted Robbie Keane still has a significant role to play for the Republic of Ireland despite being dropped for the first time in 13 years. The 34-year-old LA Galaxy striker headed back to the United States on Saturday after being released from the squad a day after being used only as a substitute in Ireland's 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier defeat in Scotland. It was the first time the Dubliner, who will begin preparations for next Sunday's MLS play-offs showdown with Seattle Sounders on his return, has been left out of the team for a competitive match when fit since a clash with Estonia in 2001. Robbie Keane (left) watches on from the bench in Glasgow alongside Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill . Republic of Ireland assistant coach Roy Keane (right) shouts some orders during the tense Group D tie . Robbie Keane was brought off the bench with 12 minutes remaining but the veteran striker could not equalise . However, assistant manager Keane, a former Ireland team-mate, was adamant that the nation's record cap-holder and goalscorer remains a key member of Martin O'Neill's squad. He said: 'Robbie Keane is massive for this team, absolutely massive. 'Everyone keeps saying he was disappointed - of course he was. Tell me any player who is going to be left out of a big game who is not going to be disappointed. That's what you expect from Robbie. Roy Keane has backed the veteran LA Galaxy striker to bounce back from his recent disappointment . 'But Robbie is brilliant for the group and brilliant for the team. He's a top, top player, he's been doing it for years and hopefully he will score goals for the next number of years. 'But you just pick a team for a certain game, and the way Robbie reacted to the disappointment to our training session yesterday was fantastic, absolutely different class. 'Robbie Keane is as good a professional as I have come across and he will be disappointed, of course. But there are other players who were left out."" The frontman, who took his tally for his country to 65 goals with a hat-trick against Gibraltar last month, had only 12 minutes in which to try to make an impression as he won his 138th cap at Celtic Park, and his frustration was clear afterwards. He told reporters he needed to play as part of an attacking partnership and that he was not suited to a lone striking role, admitting he was 'no Niall Quinn', the towering striker whose previous Irish record of 21 goals he passed a decade ago. Robbie Keane shakes hands with Scotland manager Gordon Strachan at the final whistle . Asked about that statement, Roy Keane, who also played alongside Quinn and later accepted his offer of employment as Sunderland manager, said simply: 'He's a lot better than Niall Quinn.' As the younger man headed back across the Atlantic, the rest of the squad - barring midfielder Darron Gibson, who has returned to club Everton for treatment on a minor knee injury - were licking their wounds and starting to turn their attention to Tuesday night's friendly against the United States in Dublin. Ireland were ultimately undone by a fine Shaun Maloney finish in Glasgow, which condemned them to their first Group D defeat and left them locked in a three-way battle with the Scots and world champions Germany for second place behind leaders Poland. They have been criticised for their direct approach against Gordon Strachan's men, which failed to yield the number of opportunities for which they might have hoped in front of goal. But while there was disappointment within the camp, O'Neill's number two was adopting a bullish approach to the recovery process. Roy Keane said: 'I didn't expect us to go through the whole campaign unbeaten, there were always going to be some points dropped. But we have to take our medicine, we have to take the criticism that's coming our way and bounce back. The 34-year-old striker, who has scored 65 goals for his country, won his 138th cap at Celtic Park . 'It's very, very tight, absolutely. There's not much between a lot of the teams. On paper Germany, you would still think, would be the favourites, but between Poland, ourselves and Scotland, I think it's going to be very, very tight.' Four of the Republic's next five qualifiers will take place at the Aviva Stadium and their form there is likely to go a long way towards deciding where they finish in the group. But as he and O'Neill prepared to bring an end to their 2014 fixtures less than a fortnight after celebrating a year in post, the assistant boss was happy enough with his lot. He said: 'There have been no real surprises. You are always learning about the group, even the other night, lots round about the group. But no real shocks or surprises. 'We have good teams coming to the Aviva, but with the home support and the lads will be licking their wounds for the next month or two, we will look to bounce back. That is what sport is all about, bouncing back, and we have got some good lads. 'They were hurting pretty badly the other night, we know they were. If you think for one minute they are not hurt by the other night, then you don't know the group.'","It was the first time Robbie Keane had been left out of the Irish team for a competitive match when fit since a clash with Estonia in 2001 .

"Derek Jeter does not seem to be a big fan of taking time off. Just days after the New York Yankees shortstop retired from baseball after a storied 20 season career, he has announced a new venture that will deliver athletes' 'unfiltered' views to fans via a new website. The Players' Tribune is being billed as a digital company that will offer unique access to top athletes in every sport - from videos to photos to podcasts and more - without having to deal with reporters to do it. Scroll down for video . Saying goodbye: Derek Jeter (above) has announced he is launching a new website just days after retiring from baseball . Direct line: The Players' Tribune (above) will let athletes speak directly with fans rather than through reporters or the media . In a statement on the site that posted today, Jeter said he wants the site to 'transform how athletes and newsmakers share information, and bring fans closer than ever to the games they love.' Jeter - who has long been vague and guarded with reporters - attributed his success in what he called 'the toughest media market' to being careful about what he said. 'Those simple answers have always stemmed from a genuine concern that any statement, or opinion or detail, might be distorted,' he wrote  on the site. But he said fans deserve to hear more from their fans than 'no comments,' and his site will allow a direct connection to the athlete. 'We just need to be sure our thoughts will come across the way we intend,' he wrote. The site's next big reveal will happen on October 2 Jeter announced. Settling down: Jeter, who was spotted out running errands the day after he retired (left) may also be getting ready to settle down with model girlfriend Hannah Davis (right) Future Hall of Famer: Jeter played for the New York Yankees for 20 seasons, becoming one of the all-time greats along the way . There have also been whispers that perennial bachelor Jeter may be getting ready to settle down and start a family with model girlfriend Hannah Davis now that he has retired from the game. Davis was in Boston over the weekend to cheer Jeter on during his final series against the Red Sox, and has been living with him in his West Village townhouse in New York City. Jeter, as per usual, has not commented on these rumors.","Derek Jeter has announced he is launching a new website to connect athletes directly with fans .

"Bob Geldof has blamed Britain’s family courts for the emotional pain suffered by his daughters Peaches and Fifi. Mother-of-two Peaches, 25, died from a heroin overdose in April, while 31-year-old Fifi revealed a lifelong struggle with depression, drugs and alcohol in August. Now, Boomtown Rats singer Geldof, 63, has claimed the courts made it impossible for him to take care of his daughters following his separation from their mother, Paula Yates, in 1995. Scroll down for video . Family: Bob Geldof with his then-wife Paula Yates with their daughters Fifi (left) and Peaches (centre) in 1989 . Family man: (From left) Fifi, adopted daughter Tiger Lily, Pixie and Peaches with their father Bob in London in October 2005 . Judges ruled that their mother should take the children with her, leaving Geldof only permitted to see them once a fortnight at the start. He said he was ‘ruined’ when he was left by Yates. Geldof told Saga Magazine: ‘I blame the entire family court system for so much of their subsequent pain. All I wanted was to see my kids 50 per cent of the time. ‘I wouldn’t have had children if I didn’t want the privilege of bringing them up, and I wanted to keep my kids away from this decadent world Paula had fallen into. ‘The courts, of course, prevented that as much as possible and I got them every two weeks, having been with them every day since they were born.’ New couple: Paula Yates and her partner, singer Michael Hutchence, in Sydney in 1996 with their baby Tiger Lily . He claimed that if he had left Yates with the children he would have been arrested for kidnapping. Geldof later won shared custody before securing primary custody in 1998. At that time Yates had suffered a breakdown caused by the death of her new partner, INXS singer Michael Hutchence. By then Fifi was 15, Peaches was nine and Pixie was eight. Geldof then also adopted Tiger Lily, Yates’s daughter with Hutchence, reported The Times journalist Rosemary Bennett. Last week Geldof said he blames himself for the death of Peaches, adding that he ‘goes over and over and over’ what he could have done to help her after she started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death. He described the journalist, model and television presenter as ‘super bright’ but ‘frantic’. Peaches was found dead by her husband Tom Cohen at their home in Wrotham, Kent, on April 7.

Father and daughter: Sir Bob Geldof and Peaches Geldof at London Fashion Week in February 2009 . Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was ‘sudden’ and ‘unexplained’. But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet. He found her body when he returned from a weekend away with the couple’s two-year-old son, Astala. Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother. In August, Fifi spoke publicly for the first time to reveal her struggle with depression, how it started when she was just 11 during her parents’ divorce and how she never discussed it with her father. She lost her mother to a heroin overdose as a vulnerable teenager, her sister Peaches to the same tragedy, and has fought her own battles with alcohol and drugs. Now she is engaged, with a devoted pet dog and a steady job in PR. But she told the Mail on Sunday of a time when she was a child that she thought she was losing her mind. Fifi said: ‘I woke up crying about everything and nothing. I remember thinking what the f*** is going on in my head. Why do I feel like this. 'I felt very confused as to what was going on in my mind. I thought I was going crazy. I was a generally happy child and all of a sudden I wasn’t and I didn’t know why. It’s confusing and it makes you feel quite lost within yourself.’","After 1995 split from Yates judges ruled she should take children with her .

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Wigan Athletic have lost their back-of-shirt sponsor Premier Range following the controversial appointment of manager Malky Mackay. The local kitchen firm, which carries a logo on the back of the Championship club side's kit, said that it had been left in an 'untenable position'. And, on Thursday night, another sponsor iPro Sport also severed their ties with the Championship club. Despite an ongoing FA investigation into a series of racist, sexist and homophobic texts exposed by Sportsmail, Mackay has been handed another chance in management 11 months after leaving Cardiff City. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Malky Mackay take his first Wigan training session . Wigan have lost their back of shirt sponsor Premier Range after the appointment of Malky Mackay . Mackay, pictured with chairman Dave Whelan, was appointed the Wigan manager on Wednesday . Kitchen company Premier Range were the first back of shirt sponsors in Wigan's history . The Scotsman took charge of his first training session on Thursday morning . 'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing. 'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' Premier Range only started their sponsorship deal with the Latics in July, after formerly being associated with Burnley. The partnership was the first time that Wigan have carried a back of shirt sponsor in their history - with the Lancashire based firm's website appearing above players' names. At the time, Martin Mensforth, Director at Premier Range said: 'We think it’s very important for local businesses to support local teams as it can only add to the fabulous sense of community already surrounding a great side.' Mackay, who was confirmed as the new manager of Wigan on Wednesday, will be hoping his side can bounce back from two consecutive defeats on Saturday. A statement from iPro Sport released on Thursday said: 'iPro Sport  is passionate about supporting professional football and in particular Championship football. In fact, iPro Sport is the stadium sponsor to Derby County Football Club and hydration partner to over half the clubs in the Football League supplying all natural isotonic sports performance drinks to a large number of teams. 'The company has been a supporter of the team and fan base at Wigan FC and had looked forward to a long and fruitful relationship with the club as its hydration partner. However, the recent decision to appoint Malky Mackay as the club's new manager in the light of the Football Association's investigation into racist, sexist and homophobic text messages that he apparently sent while manager at Cardiff City, is at odds with the company's business ethics and commitment to best practice. 'iPro Sport actively encourages positive working relationships that are not based on colour, race, nationality, religious belief, sexual orientation or age and cannot condone racism, sexism or homophobia. As a result, it is with deep regret that iPro Sport will be severing its relationship with Wigan Athletic Football Club.' Wigan chairman Dave Whelan revealed Mackay’s rolling contract includes a clause that protects the club in case the FA end up punishing their new manager. The FA investigation is still two or three weeks away from completion and while disciplinary officials have to decide whether to differentiate between public and private communication, the most senior officials at Wembley want to see action taken. At the same time, a Cardiff investigation into eight transfers completed during Mackay’s tenure is also ongoing. Mackay keeps a close eye on training as he takes charge of first session since his appointment . At the unveiling Whelan said: ‘We have spoken to the FA. I don’t think there is anything in the pipeline with the investigation but it’s in the contract (with Mackay), we are protecting the club. ‘I did ask Malky questions about the problems he’s had on the racist thing. He admits what he did and apologised for what he said. I accept that totally. ‘I think Malky has been so unlucky. He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. It’s not like we are all saints.’ In one of the texts, Mackay, 42, described his former Cardiff owner Vincent Tan as ‘a chink’ and others referred to women, Jews and ethnic minorities in extremely derogatory terms. 'Fkn chinkys. Fk it. There's enough dogs in Cardiff for us all to go around.' On the arrival of South Korean international Kim Bo-Kyung . 'Go on, fat Phil. Nothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers' On football agent Phil Smith . 'He's a snake, a gay snake. Not to be trusted' On an official of another club . 'Not many white faces amongst that lot but worth considering.' On a list of potential signings . 'I hope she's looking after your needs. I bet you'd love a bounce on her falsies.' On a player's female agent . A picture entitled Black Monopoly (where every square was a ""Go to Jail"" square) Sent to members of Cardiff's staff . As Mackay was being unveiled in the North West, anti-racism organisation Kick It Out criticised Wigan’s appointment, saying: ‘Wigan have disregarded the ongoing investigation being undertaken by the FA, and any potential punishment Mackay may face, by taking the decision to appoint him. ‘We need to see leadership and a respect for the processes in place shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion, prejudice and discrimination.’ Coincidentally, Kick It Out staged an equality and diversity session for Wigan’s apprentices yesterday. Local MP Lisa Nandy had previously written to Whelan asking him not to consider Mackay as a replacement for Uwe Rosler, who was sacked a week ago. We wish to make it clear The FA investigation into the conduct of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody remains ongoing and no assurances have been given by The FA as to the outcome of this case. In the particular and exceptional circumstances of this case, The FA would like to provide some clarification as to the status of the investigation. The FA did not come into possession of the relevant evidence relating to the messages until mid-October. This came out of many thousands of emails and texts and we are still in the process of obtaining additional information. The FA is still investigating whether these messages indicate a culture in which other acts of a discriminatory nature may have taken place. This process inevitably takes time. Both Mr Mackay and Mr Moody are fully co-operating with the ongoing process. We fully appreciate the need to act expeditiously on this matter. However, it remains a complex investigation and The FA will make no further comment at this time.","Wigan Athletic have appointed Malky Mackay as manager .

"Police are investigating a break in at the home of Texans linebackers coach Mike Vrabel, who says that someone took his three Super Bowl rings he won as a player. Vrabel tweeted Saturday about the break in at his home in the Houston enclave of Bellaire. 'To all the Houston area pawn shops: 3 super bowl rings are headed your way. Courtesy of the (expletive) who smashed our back door in,' Vrabel tweeted . Good sport: Mike Vrabel is a former New England Patriots linebacker and is currently a linebackers coach for the Houston Texans. Vrabel won three Super Bowl titles with the Patriots during their dominance of the NFL . Stolen: The former linebacker allowed his words to show just how upset he was after his home was broken into and his possessions were taken . According to a tweet sent out by Vrabel,  burglars smashed in the back door of his Houston home and made out with the rings. He doesn't mention if anything else was taken. While Vrabel's anger is certainly justified, the good news is it doesn't appear as if anyone was harmed during the incident. Vrabel's wife also took to Twitter to express her anger. Vrabel, in his first season as a coach with the Texans, won the rings when he played for the New England Patriots in the 2001-02, 2003-04 and 2004-05 seasons. Bellaire police said the break in occurred at around 11 a.m. Saturday. No arrests have been made in the case. Upset: Vrabel tweeted out on Saturday that those prized possessions of his were taken from his Houston home . The incident took place less than a week after the Patriots honored the 22 members of all three of the team’s Super Bowl championship teams, from the 2001, 2003, and 2004 seasons, although Vrabel did not attend the ceremony at halftime of last Sunday’s Patriots-Broncos game in Foxborough. A third-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1997, the linebacker played 14 seasons in the NFL for the Steelers, Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs. He is currently in his first season as a linebackers coach with the Houston Texans after spending three years as an assistant at his alma mater Ohio State.

"Constantly worrying won’t just give you sleepless nights – it could also raise your risk of Alzheimer’s. Women who are anxious, jealous and moody in middle-age were twice as likely to suffer from the brain disease in old age as their more calm and level-headed counterparts. They found that as the number of people with dementia is expected to increase ‘dramatically’ as the population ages, it is important to have ways of identifying those most at risk. Scroll down for video . Neurotic women who display personality traits such as jealousy and anxiety may be twice as likely to suffer from Alzheimer's than their more calm and level-headed counterparts . Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050. The Prime Minister David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’. Some 800 women in their late 30s, 40s and early 50s underwent a battery of personality tests. This included questions on neuroticism – characterised by being anxious, jealous, moody and easily upset and plagued by feelings of guilt. They were also asked if they had been under stress at work, at home or due to their health – and this question was repeated every five years. When the study ended after 38 years, some 153 women had developed dementia. Those who scored highest on tests for neuroticism in middle-age – were particularly prone to the disease – but only if they had been under long-term stress. Neurotics who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk, the journal Neurology reports. The researchers said those who are neurotic may feel stress more keenly and this could take its toll on the brain. It is also possible that they have a less healthy lifestyle. Neurotics who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk of dementia, researchers found . Study author Lena Johannsson said: ‘Most Alzheimer’s research has been devoted to factors such as education, heart and blood risk factors, head trauma, family history and genetics. ‘Personality may influence the individual’s risk for dementia through its effect on behaviour, lifestyle or reactions to stress. ‘The number of people with dementia is expected to rise dramatically. It is therefore important to identify risk and protective factors.’ Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘We all have moments when we feel stressed or worried, but stressed women reading this shouldn’t take this research to mean they’re necessarily at higher risk of dementia. ‘This research doesn’t show that neuroticism in women alone could increase risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, but what it does suggest is that personality traits like neuroticism are linked to the experience of long term stress. ‘While we can’t control all the sources of everyday stress, we can develop coping strategies to deal with them and we’re funding research to help explore how this could help with reducing risk of dementia.’ Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Understanding the factors that affect our risk of Alzheimer’s could provide new clues for preventing the disease, which is why investment in research is crucial.’ Previous research has found that conscientious men and women, who ‘always get the job done’ are half as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as their less dependable friends and colleagues.","This was compared to their more calm and level-headed counterparts .

"A friendly tiger shark that is a favorite among tourists at a popular Bahamas diving spot appears to have survived a bullet to a head, with photos showing noticeable entry and exit wounds. The shark is known in the area around Tiger Beach - a diving section in West End on Grand Bahama Island, off the coast of Florida - as 'Hook' because she was once caught by a fisherman and suffered a broken jaw, which 'slightly hangs down on the right side of her mouth'. According to Eli Martinez, an editor at Shark Diver Magazine, Hook is the oldest shark in the area, having been seen in the surrounding waters since 2007. However she turned up recently with what appeared to be a 'horrific' bullet wound in her head. Shocking: New photos of a female shark known as 'Hook' show her with a bullet wound to her head. Divers in Tiger Beach on Grand Bahama Island say there are noticeable entry and exit wounds . Shark Diver Magazine posted the news to Facebook with pictures taken during a diving expedition last month. The magazine said they had not seen Hook since December, and where shocked when they saw what happened to her. ' Someone tried to kill her,' the magazine posted to their Facebook. 'It looks like a bang stick was used, my guess is a spear fisherman? 'Or possibly she came up to a boat to steal a fish off their line and they tried to shoot her? 'The bullet went in on one side and out on the other.' Friendly: Hook, who is currently pregnant, is one of the main attractions among divers in Tiger Beach. Tour operators use bait to lure the sharks, who are typically friendly because they have been fed . Luckily, the magazine reported that Hook appeared to be fine. 'She looks like she is going to be ok. But the scar was horrific.,' they posted. 'She is pregnant right now and will be pupping in the next few months. '(It) made me sad to see my old friend like this.' According to Grind TV, the tour operators that organize dives in Tiger Beach use bait to lure sharks.

"First, Alan Hruby shot his mother. Tinker Hruby fell to the floor, her 19-year-old son towering over her in their Oklahoma home, waiting for her to die. But she didn't — so he shot the 48-year-old mother-of-two a second time with the 9mm pistol he found in his father's truck. Then came his sister's turn. Seventeen-year-old Katherine was outside washing her car. When she walked in, Hruby fired once again, killing her immediately. Hruby waited. Ten minutes, 20, 30 — his mother and sister dead in the Duncan home  — until his dad walked through the front door about an hour later. He opened fired. 'Ouch,' said John Hruby, 50, feeling the sting of the first bullet enter his body. Hruby watched his father fall the ground. Then he fired one final time, delivering the killing blow that sealed the tragic fate of his parents and sister. Those were the grisly final moments of the Oklahoma family that died on Oct. 9 because Hruby needed $3,000 to pay a loan shark — and he thought he would inherit enough money to pay up after killing his parents and sister, court documents obtained by People magazine show. Killer: Alan Hruby (center, with two friends) confessed to murdering his dad John, 50, mother Tinker, 48, and sister Katherine, 17 . The college freshman (seen above at his prom) wanted to inherit enough money to pay a $3,000 debt, he told prosecutors . No remorse: It is also said the young man, seen just days before the killing at University of Oklahoma, cried 'crocodile tears' when informed his family was dead . 'He felt like if he murdered his mother, his father and his sister, he would be the only one, the only heir, to their estate,' District Attorney Jason Hicks, of Stephens County, told KFOR. He at first appeared 'distressed' when police told him about his family's murder on Tuesday, a day after their bodies were found by a housekeeper. But investigators quickly caught on to the fake tears. 'The only remorse we’ve seen is because he got caught,' Hicks told KFOR. 'Any tears that he shed, they were crocodile tears,' the prosecutor added. 'It wasn't remorse because ""I've lost my mom, my dad and my sister,"" —  it's remorse because he knows that his life is basically over. Prosecutors have described Hruby as a money-obsessed teen who, by his own admission, 'had been cut off financially … due to an abundance of spending in recent times,' People reported. The University of Oklahoma freshman has been charged with the sickening murders after he confessed to the killings, prosecutors say. Hicks describes Hruby as an 'evil' young man who cared little about what he did. 'It was completely planned out,' Hicks said after filing the murder case. 'This kid is an evil person.' Hruby's 17-year-old sister Katherine (above) was only a junior in high school . Booked: Prosecutors are having the teen held without bail and may consider the death penalty . Parents John and Tinker, above with daughter Katherine, had recently cut off Hruby financially after he repeatedly stole from them and other family members . An eyewitness says that, after the murders, Hruby checked into a room at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas while the University of Oklahoma played the University of Texas in a football match nearby — and it looked as thought nothing had happened. 'I did not travel with him. I just met him in Dallas. He was not acting weird at all,' Andrew Bormann toldThe Oklahoman. 'Nothing that he said or did ever raised any suspicion from me. Every time I saw him on the weekend, he was happy and laughing and having a good time. Even early Monday morning, 1am, he was laughing and joking with me as we were studying.' Hruby even posted to Instagram a photo of him with pals in his hotel room on Sunday, the day before his family was discovered and three days after they were killed. He made a point a point of saying he was at his dorm at The University of Oklahoma on Thursday night on his social media accounts. Alibi: The young man shared a photo from his dorm room window on Thursday, the night his parents were killed, perhaps as an alibi . Hruby posted this message to Twitter, presumably as an alibi . Hruby said he owed a loan shark $3,000 and was hoping to  pay this person by inheriting money. His parents had recently cut him off financially, and a search of his dorm room on Wednesday turned up multiple stolen checks. Hruby told investigators that after shooting his parents he threw the gun he used, along with a DVD from the home's security system, in a nearby lake. Getaway: The weekend after he killed his parents he stayed at The Ritz-Carlton in Dallas (pictured) Eyewitnesses who saw him in Dallas say Hruby (pictured above at his high school graduation) acted 'normal' as he partied with friends . Hruby shared this photo of his friends hanging out at The Ritz-Carlton while his parents and sister laid dead and undiscovered in their home . Appearing in court, Hruby was described as 'soft spoken' and 'unsteady on his feet,' crying when he was denied bail by the judge. Prosecutors have said they will be considering the death penalty in this case. His next court hearing is scheduled for December 17 and he has been told to have a lawyer by December 2. Court records also show Duncan police had been investigating Hruby since August because of evidence he had forged checks totaling $17,500. It is also being reported he assaulted his mother two years ago after a disagreement over money. Father John, pictured with with wife Tinker, was a well known local newspaper publisher . Tinker Hruby was described as a 'great neighbor' while 17-year-old Katherine (right) was said to always have a smile on her face . Crime scene: Hruby confessed to shooting his parents and sister in their family home (pictured) In a police affidavit filed in August 2013, officers met with John after he suspected his son was using a credit card not belonging to him. Authorities say the parents found several charges to the card from Europe, during the time Hruby took a trip to Paris. He had previously ran afoul of the law earlier this year when he pleaded guilty to a charge of credit card theft. The credit card he stole belonged to his grandmother, Janice Hruby, according to a family friend. His father phoned the police and Hruby pleaded guilty in January of this year. He was entered into a delayed sentencing program and was due to appear in court this November. As part of his punishment, the court ordered him to pay restitution, undergo a substance abuse evaluation, attend drug and alcohol counseling and complete a cognitive behavior program.

Hruby lifted a credit card belonging to his grandmother without he consent while on a trip to Paris . The boy liked to document his extravagant lifestyle, posting photos of his trips to Rome, Paris, London and New York City on his Instagram account. He is never with friends or family members on these trips.

"Scroll down for video . A fashion model has filed a $1 million lawsuit against a New York restaurant, claiming a stone that was in a salad she ate three years ago continues to affect her career. Carolina Rommel claims to have bitten into a rock that somehow got in her meal at popular Manhattan eatery Public while dining there in October 2011. It caused two of her teeth to crack and 'abnormal swelling' to her face, according to The New York Daily News. Rommel - who has appeared in campaigns for Abercrombie and Fitch, Macy's and Levi's - claims to have missed out on modeling work as a result and has had to have numerous painful procedures. Damage to her career: Carolina Rommel, who lists her age as 27 but public records say is 34, claims that a rock in her salad at Manhattan restaurant Public caused her two cracked teeth and abnormal swelling to her face . Scene: Public restaurant is a trendy modern American eatery located in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood . Rommel's lawyer, James McCarney, said the stone was in a warm lentil salad. 'As a high fashion model, plaintiff's physical appearance is essential to her ability to work,' the Manhattan Supreme Court says. However Rommel's Instagram account shows numerous snaps of her modeling shoots. McCarney said that waiters apologized to Rommel and offered compensation. However they never followed through. The suit has asked for unspecified damages. On the job: Rommel claims the incident caused her work. Her Instagram and Facebook are full of model shoots . Unspecified damages: The lawsuit has not listed how much compensation Rommel is seeking . However McCarney said 'this could run into seven figures'. Public is located on Elizabeth St in Nolita. According to AOL, the restaurant's owner questions the 2011 incident, saying it's unclear whether Rommel bit into a rock or a really hard lentil. In December, a customer at sandwich chain Pret A Manger, also in Manhattan, came across a dead frog in her salad.

"‘Y’all’ is the Southern American way of saying ‘you all’ or ‘you guys’ and is a much-loved word. It’s charming, useful and down to earth and therefore very American, but controversy has been welling up over a number of decades over its use in the singular. One language expert has described this debate as ‘the Loch Ness Monster of dialect studies’, because examples of it being used in this way are so few and far between. ‘Y’all’ is the Southern American way of saying ‘you all’ or ‘you guys’ and is a much-loved word . Arkia Okrent, author of In The Land Of Invented Language, writing in The Week, argues that most Southerners will firmly deny that they ever use y’all to mean the singular ‘you’. She said: ‘The whole idea of singular ""y'all"" strikes them as, at best, the fanciful invention of confused and clueless Northerners, and, at worst, an outrageous insult.’ To underline this point she quotes linguist E. Bagby Atwood, who in his 1962 study of Texas English, wrote: ‘If anything is likely to lead to another Civil War, it is the Northerner's accusation that Southerners use you all to refer to only one person.’ Some wrongly think that when Southerners ask a shop keeper, for example, whether ‘y’all got some eggs?’ they are using the word in the singular, when actually they mean ‘do you or any of your colleagues have any eggs?’, Okrent writes. Sensitive: One writer declared that ‘if anything is likely to lead to another Civil War, it is the Northerner's accusation that Southerners use you all to refer to only one person'. Pictured is a steam boat on the  Mississippi, in the heart of Southern America . However, she said that there are instances of y’all been used as a form of singular address by Southerners, for example a waitress asking a lone customer ‘how are y'all's grits?’. The explanation may be rooted in social pressures, though – as it may be deployed in the above circumstance as a mark of deference, Okrent said, to establish an atmosphere of gentle decorum where simply saying ‘your’ might seem a little abrupt. It is also used by Southerners to reinforce their identity, she claims. So sometimes they use it in the singular when they’re travelling in other parts of the country or feel themselves outnumbered by Northerners in their own community. A study by Jan Tillery and Guy Bailey found that many Southerners exaggerate their use of the phrase, and use it in ways that might not be strictly correct, to turn it into a ‘badge of identity’. Okrent said: ‘Northerners… have been hearing singular ""y'all"" all along. They just didn't realize it was not part of Southern English, but a different dialect, Exaggerated Southern English.’","‘Y’all’ is the Southern American way of saying ‘you all’ or ‘you guys’

"A 12-year-old girl has broken a world record after reeling in a 616-pound bluefin tuna. Jenna Gavin, from Nova Scotia spent two hours battling the giant fish while on a fishing charter with her parents John and Chandra. The school girl was fishing on a boat in the Northumberland Straight, off the coast of Nova Scotia when she hooked the giant fish. Scroll down for video . Young Jenna Gavin landed the 616-pound bluefin tuna after a two-hour battle on a charter boat on the Northumberland Straight, Nova Scotia where she was congratulated by record-holder Ken Fraser . Jenna Gavin was fishing with her parents in the Northumberland Straight, Nova Scotia . Now, her success is likely to get her into the record books for the biggest fish ever landed by a girl aged between 11 and 16. Details of the massive fish have been sent to the International Game Fishing Association for verification. For the record to stand, Jenna's parents had to leave her alone to battle and land the tuna. The youngster's mother Chandra said: 'Jenna was thrilled when she finished the fight and was really excited when we pulled it out of the water to put it on the deck. 1,496 The weight in pounds which an adult bluefin tuna can reach . 1.05 The amount in millions a tuna sold at auction in Japan in January . 43 The speed in miles per hour they can travel . 4,000 The distance in miles a bluefin tuna will migrate from the Gulf of Mexico to Iceland . 3,500 The price per pound a fresh bluefin tuna in perfect condition can reach . 1,000 The depth in metres a bluefin tuna can dive . 90 The percentage decline in bluefin tuna numbers in the Atlantic due to over-fishing . 21 The maximum length in feet of adult fish . 30 The maximum age of an adult fish . 8 The age at which they reach sexual maturity . 'The biggest fish she had caught before this was a mackerel which we use for bait, they weigh roughly around one pound. 'The fish was caught just below the surface, maybe 10ft down, our mate saw the silver flash as the fish swam through the water. 'The last 40 minutes of the fight were difficult because the fish was straight down behind the boat and she had 30-35 pounds of drag on her the whole time.' The holder of the record for the largest bluefin tuna ever caught, Ken Fraser, was fishing nearby when Jenna hooked her own monster. Fraser landed a 1496 fish off the coast of Nova Scotia in October 1979. Mrs Gavin said: 'Ken Fraser was chartering another boat out of the same dock as us, it was purely coincidence that he was there at the same time. 'I believed she could do it and I knew she had the ability and the strength but I was also aware it was a huge challenge. 'Jenna would agree that it was a difficult fish to catch, the last part of the fight was very hard, her legs were starting to shake and she was getting a bit teary. 'I encouraged her through the whole fight, I promised her an iPad mini if she didn't give up and I told her to get mad and drag him up and she did.'

"Research suggests that some Arctic lakes store more greenhouse gases than they emit into the atmosphere. This counters a widely-held scientific view that thawing permafrost accelerates atmospheric warming. The study shows that permafrost rich in organic material will see the growth of mosses and other plants flourish, leading to greater amounts of carbon absorption. Scroll down for video . A study says ice-rich lakes in Alaska and Siberia are cooling the atmosphere. The research challenges the widely-held view that thawing lakes cause warming. Found in the Arctic and cold mountain regions, thermokarst lakes (shown) occur when permafrost thaws and creates surface depressions that fill with water . Rising levels of water vapour high above the Earth are likely to intensify the effects of global warming in coming decades, say scientists. The increasing amounts of water in the upper troposphere are a direct result of human activity, research suggests. Computer simulations predict that as burning fossil fuels warms the climate, concentrations of water vapour will rise. The moistening of the atmosphere in turn absorbs more heat and raises the Earth’s temperature further. To investigate these effects scientists measured levels of water vapour in the upper troposphere, a region three to seven miles above the Earth’s surface. Their findings were compared with climate model predictions of water circulation between the ocean and atmosphere. The results showed that increasing levels of atmospheric water vapour could not be explained by natural forces such as volcanoes or changes in solar activity. But they did appear to be linked to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Lead scientist Professor Brian Soden, from the University of Miami, US, said: 'The study is the first to confirm that human activities have increased water vapour in the upper troposphere.' Supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the study was published this week in the journal Nature and focused on thermokarst lakes. These occur when permafrost thaws and create surface depressions that fill with melted fresh water, converting what was previously frozen land into lakes. The research suggests that Arctic thermokarst lakes are 'net climate coolers' when observed over longer time scales, namely several thousand years, although they initially warm the climate. 'Until now, we've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming,' said lead researcher Dr Katey Walter Anthony, associate research professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Northern Engineering. 'It is true that they do warm climate by strong methane emissions when they first form, but on a longer-term scale, they switch to become climate coolers because they ultimately soak up more carbon from the atmosphere than they ever release.' The researchers observed that roughly 5,000 years ago, thermokarst lakes in ice-rich regions of North Siberia and Alaska began cooling, instead of warming the atmosphere. 'While methane and carbon dioxide emissions following thaw lead to immediate radiative warming, carbon uptake in peat-rich sediments occurs over millennial time scales,' the authors write. They found that high rates of carbon absorption in lake sediments were stimulated by several factors including erosion and nutrient release from thawing permafrost. 'Until now, we've only thought of thermokarst lakes as positive contributors to climate warming,' said lead researcher Dr Katey Walter Anthony (shown), associate research professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks Institute of Northern Engineering . 'These lakes are being fertilised by thawing yedoma permafrost,' explained co-author Dr Miriam Jones, a research geologist for the US Geological Survey. Yedoma is a type of permafrost that is rich in organic material, which means mosses and other plants flourish in the lakes. This leads to increased carbon uptake rates that are among the highest in the world. The study also revealed another major factor of this process: when the lakes drain, previously thawed organic-rich lake sediments re-freeze. The new permafrost formation then stores a large amount of carbon processed in and under thermokarst lakes, as well as the peat that formed after lake drainage. Researchers note that the new carbon storage is not forever, since future warming will likely start re-thawing some of the permafrost and release some of the carbon in it via microbial decomposition. As roughly 30 per cent of global permafrost carbon is concentrated within 7 per cent of the permafrost region in Alaska, Canada and Siberia, this study's findings also renew scientific interest in how carbon uptake by thermokarst lakes offsets greenhouse gas emissions.","Study says ice-rich lakes in Alaska and Siberia are cooling the atmosphere .

"Cool again? A fashion model poses with an e-cigarette, which have now been banned from a string of pubs, restaurants, coffee chains and hotels . E-cigarette users face widespread bans on the devices in pubs, restaurants and coffee chains. Starbucks, Caffe Nero, All Bar One, Nicholson's pubs and KFC have joined public transport companies and airlines in banning the use of e-cigarettes in their branches. It comes after a widely criticised World Health Organisation report this summer which bans on indoor use, advertising and sales to minors. Uptake of e-cigarettes, which use battery-powered cartridges to produce a nicotine-laced vapour, has rocketed in the past two years, but there is fierce debate about their potential risks and benefits. Because they are new, there's little scientific evidence on their safety. Some experts fear they could be a gateway to tobacco smoking, while others say they have potential to help millions of smokers kick the habit. But there's little patience for solid scientific findings. the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the Royal Opera House and the Natural History Museum have all banned e-cigarettes, The Sunday Times reports. 'The bans are shortsighted,' said Michael Clapper, chairman of the Electronic Cigarette Industry Trade Association and co-founder of e-cigarette company Vapestick. 'The vapour release from electronic cigarettes is not harmful to bystanders... This will alienate customers who use electronic cigarettes.' While regular cigarettes release deadly carcinogens and toxins along with their nicotine payload, and kill more than 6million people a year, e-cigarettes are said to be significantly less harmful. But in August the WHO, the United Nations health body, commissioned a review of e-cigarettes calling for stiff regulation on their use similar to that applied to normal tobacco products. A group of tobacco addiction experts who critiqued the report said the WHO's findings were riddled with errors, misinterpretations and misrepresentations, meaning policymakers may miss their potential health benefits. Risks: Because e-cigs are new, there's little scientific evidence on their safety. Some experts fear they could be a gateway to tobacco smoking, while others say they have potential to help millions kick the habit . Ann McNeill, a researcher at the national addiction centre at King's College London, said: 'I was shocked and surprised when I read it. I felt it was an inaccurate portrayal of the evidence on e-cigarettes.' McNeill said that while e-cigarettes are relatively new and 'we certainly don't yet have all the answers as to their long-term health impact', it is clear they are far safer than cigarettes. Her co-author Peter Hajek of the tobacco dependence research unit at Queen Mary, University of London, said it was vital that e-cigarettes should be assessed in relation to the known harms of tobacco cigarettes. 'There are currently two products competing for smokers' custom,' he said. 'One - the conventional cigarette - endangers users and bystanders and recruits new customers from among non-smoking children who try it. 'The other - the e-cigarette - is orders of magnitude safer, poses no risk to bystanders, and generates negligible rates of regular use among non-smoking children who try it.' But the British Medical Association said it supported bans, in line with its no-smoking policy. Sheila Hollins, chairman of the BMA's board of science, told The Sunday Times: 'Stronger controls are needed on where e-cigarettes can be used to protect others from exposure, to ensure their use does not undermine existing restrictions on smoke-free public places ... and to guarantee the use of e-cigarettes does not reinforce the normalcy of smoking behaviour.'","Bans come after UN health body advised curbs on indoor use and ads .

Prince Charles, who was in Navy dress uniform, was happy to step out into the showers to help his wife on to the Type 23 frigate, where they were greeted by naval officers. But despite the thundery showers, the couple looked relaxed as they chatted to guests, who included Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the warship's officers. The evening ended with the lowering of the Royal Navy Ensign. It brought to a close their official tour of the country, which is emerging from five decades of civil violence. The trip highlighted some of the issues Colombia is working to address from protecting its unique environment, to healing divisions caused by the internal war involving guerrilla forces. It was also marked by some personal moments for the couple. Earlier this week the Prince spoke of his anguish following the death of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, while the Duchess made a passionate intervention on the subject of sexual violence.

A huge crowd of people, many of whom carried Union flags, had gathered outside the museum to see the couple arrive, with Prince Charles taking the opportunity to share a joke with some of the locals during a walkabout. He also tried his hand at playing the drum and appeared to be enjoying himself, even if those listening were less than enamoured with his musical talents. Following the visit to the museum, the couple continued on to the Naval Academy, where they saw a haul of submarines confiscated from drug gangs and now displayed outside the school.

"Projected sales of whiskey are set to surpass vodka sales for the first time this year since 2007. That means whiskey will take the reigns as America's biggest selling liquor over gin, rum, tequila and all the rest. Vodka still beats the rest big time in terms of volume sold, but the more refined dark liquor will pull in more sales in dollars by year's end. Battle of the booze: Projected sales of whiskey are set to surpass vodka sales for the first time this year since 2007 . Quartz reports that the shift comes as vodka simply runs out of ways to interest consumers. In 2013, Euromonitor analyst Jared Koerten tells Quartz, vodka growth grew by just 1 percent. In the five years prior, that number was closer to five times that. After growth from the top shelf brands like Grey Goose topped out, vodka makers moved on to market flavored products. Now a seemingly unending variety from smoked salmon to cotton candy are available, but interest has slowed. Experts also blame the 'Mad Men effect,' as popular culture has shifted toward an appreciation for more complex booze and as the trend in drinking establishments moves toward craft cocktails. Overall, vodka is facing slower growth in the United States as consumers' liquor preferences change. Sales increased just 1.4 percent to $17.3 billion in 2013, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, marking the slowest pace since at least 2000. That is because newer generations of drinkers are increasingly shifting toward brown liquors such as bourbon and whiskey in what analysts call the ""Mad Men effect"" - a reference to the Prohibition-era drinks consumed on the popular television show. According to the Distilled Spirits Council, an industry trade group, sales volumes of whiskey in 2013 were up 6 percent, outpacing vodka's 1 percent growth. ""Vodka's appeal to a lot of people has been that it doesn’t taste like anything,"" said Drew Dupuy, a 35-year-old communications manager in Washington, D.C. He used to drink Bloody Marys with vodka at brunch with his friends but now orders the drink with tequila or gin. ""There's a wide range of liquors with interesting profiles that you can make really flavorful cocktails with."" Why the shift? Experts point toward the 'Mad Men effect,' as popular culture has shifted toward an appreciation for more complex booze and as the trend in drinking establishments moves toward craft cocktails .",Vodka still leads in volume sold - but Americans are now spending more money on whiskey .

"Owners of Nobby beach holiday resort, on the Gold Coast, Queensland, are about to hit the jackpot after finally agreeing to sell the ageing properties as one. For nearly 30 years property developers have been unsuccessful in their approach to purchase Nobby Outlook. Now, almost 50 unit owners have decided to sell the iconic beachside resort built in 1966 due to ageing of the property and expenses needed to renovate. Owners of Nobby beach holiday resort, on the Gold Coast, Queensland, are about to hit the jackpot after finally agreeing to sell the ageing properties as one . For nearly 30 years property developers has been unsuccessful in their approach to the unit owners of Nobby Outlook . Bronwyn Bartal, the Melbourne-based chairperson of the body corporate, said she has many childhood memories at Nobbys Outlook unit and although she is sad to let it go, Ms Bartal understands it is time. 'Although we were reluctant we see it needs major renovation and it just can't go on into disrepair,' Ms Bartal told Daily Mail Australia. 'If you haven't been here it is very hard to appreciate what an icon it is.' Ms Bartal recalls developers in 1988 approaching the unit owners separately in an attempt to force them to sell. She said developers were calling the owners 'horrible', insisting they were trying to stop positive development. The 7284 square-metre property features 46 apartments . 'I have always been pro-active about Nobbys Outlook because my mother always said ""I am not leaving Nobbys - I don't care how much money they will get us for"", so I always wanted it to remain in the family. 'She has now passed away and I thought she wouldn't like to see Nobbys in the state it is in now - it will take a lot of money to just repair the outside.' 'So we decided we would rather be involved  in the sale, rather than just letting it fall down.' Ms Bartal said the owners could not afford to renovate the property and it into  four or five star class. Watching the units fall apart prompted owners of Nobbys Outlook to seek a joint venture partner to redevelop the site or find someone to acquire the site outright. 'We will wait and see what is proposed to us but we know this place has such a history so if it is a good offer we will take it,' Ms Bartal said. According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, in 2011 developers valued the site at more than $30 million but Ms Bartal said all the figures so far was purely speculation. Watching the units fall apart prompted owners of Nobbys Outlook to seek a joint venture partner to redevelop the site or find someone to acquire the site outright .

Bronwyn Bartal, the Melbourne-based chairperson of the body corporate said the owners could not afford to renovate the property and it into four or five star class . She said in 2007-08 there was an 'evaluation of around $19 million but that was far too low.' 'Recently a beachfront unit block of 17 near Nobbys Outlook  sold for $12 million,' Ms Bartal said. Along from Ms Bartal's family, a number of others have had strong family ties to the property for generations. The 7284 square-metre property features 46 apartments that were purchased for as little as $50,000 by unit owners. Jayde Pezet, of KM Sales and Marketing, is taking care of the sales and marketing process of Nobbys Outlook and said owners know it is time for this fantastic site to be redeveloped. 'The owners as a group are prepared to be flexible in negotiations and are keen to consider a variety of options, including: participating in a redevelopment, ‘cashing’ out their investment or, an outright sale,' Mr Pezet told Daily Mail Australia.

"Sleepy or exhausted drivers are in twenty-one percent of deadly car crashes - more so than previously reported, a November study discovered. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety said in a study released this month that researchers looked at 14,268 car crashes that took place for 2009 to 2013 that involved a car being towed. It said 'Results showed that an estimated 6% of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene, 7% of crashes in which a person received treatment for injuries sustained in the crash, 13% of crashes in which a person was hospitalized, and 21% of crashes in which a person was killed involved a drowsy driver. Danger: The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety says sleepy or exhausted drivers are in twenty-one percent of deadly car crashes . 'If these proportions are applied to all reported crashes nationwide, results suggest that an average of 328,000 crashes annually, including 109,000 crashes that result in injuries and 6,400 fatal crashes, involve a drowsy driver.' The foundation points out 'A previous study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that 7% of all crashes in which a vehicle was towed from the scene, 13% of crashes in which a person was hospitalized, and 17% of fatal crashes involved a drowsy driver in years 1999 – 2008.' AAA Foundation President and CEO Peter Kissinger said in a Monday release 'This new research further confirms that drowsy driving is a serious traffic safety problem. Unfortunately, drivers often underestimate this risk and overestimate their ability to combat drowsiness behind the wheel.' Fatal: The study also projected sleepy drivers are in 6,400 deadly car crashes across the country each year . 'Despite the fact that 95 percent of Americans deem it ""unacceptable"" to drive when they are so tired that they have a hard time keeping their eyes open, more than 28 percent admit to doing so in the last month,' he added. 'Like other impairments, driving while drowsy is not without risk.' The Monday release highlighted older findings 'that young adult drivers, ages 19-24, are the most likely to admit to driving while drowsy, with 33 percent reporting doing so in the last month. In contrast, the oldest drivers (ages 75+) and the youngest (ages 16-18) were the least likely to report the same offense.' The foundation said in the release it 'is highlighting the risks of drowsy driving in support of the National Sleep Foundation’s Drowsy Driving Prevention Week®, which runs November 2-9.'","Sleepy or exhausted drivers are in twenty-one percent of deadly car crashes, a AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety study said .

"Gang members who are more likely to commit violent crimes can now be identified by police using Minority Report-style software. London's Metropolitan Police have tested a system that analyses a person's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime. The 20-week pilot study, which is the first of its kind in the UK, combined data from different crime reporting and crime intelligence systems used by the Met. London's Metropolitan Police has tested a system that analyses a person's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime . 'You've got limited police resources and you need to target them efficiently,' Muz Janoowalla, head of public safety analytics at Accenture told the BBC. 'What this does is tell you who are the highest risk individuals that you should target your limited resources against.' The technology echoes the system used in the film Minority Report which predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before the crime takes place. Developed by global consulting group, Accenture, the latest software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across London's 32 boroughs across a four year period. The software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across London's 32 boroughs across a four year period. It was able to analyse social media posts, such as the image above, posted by a London gang who stole a fleet of expensive, high-performance cars last year . Police then compared the software's results to known acts of violence that took place in the fifth year to find out its accuracy. Mr Janoowalla said the Met were hoping to identify groups of gang members that were at the highest risk of reoffending rather than focusing on specific individuals. However, he was would not disclose the exact criteria on which the gang members were scored. Privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch has asked for more information to be made public about how the data will be used. 'The police need to be very careful about how they use this kind of technology,' said research director Daniel Nesbitt. When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes , it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054 . When police in Minority Report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it, it was considered so futuristic, the film was set in 2054. But last year, law enforcers in two American states used crime-prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder, and supervised them accordingly. Instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records, the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them. The Minority Report-style software is already being used in Baltimore and Philadelphia to predict future murderers. It has been developed by Professor Richard Berk, a criminologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes. Professor Berk says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future. It could also be modified to predict lesser crimes. 'Big data solutions such as this can run the risk of unfairly targeting certain groups of people and potentially making them feel stigmatised as a result.' Accenture has carried out other crime-prevention analysis elsewhere. For example, in Santa Cruz, California, police have applied the group's predictive analytics to their theft data. This, it claims, has helped them identify the streets at greatest risk resulting in a 19 per cent drop in property theft without the need for more officers. In Singapore, authorities are undertaking a 'Safe City' program that combines electronic vision technologies and predictive analytics into CCTV video feeds to detect street incidents.

"Pestered: Charlotte Green said the man would touch her inappropriately . A former Radio 4 newsreader has revealed how she was harassed by the ‘wandering hands’ of a BBC colleague she worked with in the 1970s. Charlotte Green said the man, a studio manager, would touch her inappropriately, and when she complained was told he was simply ‘being friendly’. The 58-year-old told the Henley Literary Festival – supported by the Daily Mail – that she tried at all costs to avoid being in the same room as the ‘pest’. She said she found herself repeatedly having to ‘make a fuss’ about his unwanted attention until he was finally kept away from her. Miss Green, who is promoting her memoir – The News Is Read By Charlotte Green – joined the BBC in 1978 as a studio manager and retired in 2013. Her Radio 4 newsreading career spanned 27 years. The incidents she spoke about happened in her twenties. She said: ‘Unfortunately, it was my least favourite studio manager who was putting the programme out. He had wandering hands, so I kept well away from him. ‘Fortunately you could say to him – and I won’t say his name – “oh for goodness sake, stop being silly and just get off me” and he would. ‘But I’m afraid this was the 1970s and as we’re hearing so much about lately, with far worse examples, he was a nuisance and he was a pest. I did have to complain about him because it would happen quite frequently.’ Miss Green, who is now a presenter on Classic FM but in the past has also been involved with the Shipping Forecast and The News Quiz programmes on Radio 4, said when she complained her objections were dismissed by senior colleagues. She said: ‘I went to my line manager and said “this isn’t good enough, I’m not putting up with this”. ‘And he just looked at me and said “well he’s just being friendly”, which looking back now is astonishing, but that was the attitude. Dismissed: Miss Green said when she complained her objections were dismissed by senior colleagues. She had to 'make a real fuss' and eventually said she wouldn't work with him. ‘I had to make a real fuss and in the end. I said “I won’t work with him, I’m not going to put up with that”. And eventually he was kept well away from me and I didn’t have to work with him but I shouldn’t have had to make a fuss. But that was how things were in the late 70s, sadly.’ Miss Green’s comments come as the BBC finds itself embroiled in a series of investigations, accusations and scandals relating to sexual abuse committed by employees. High profile figures include Jimmy Savile, Stuart Hall, Dave Lee Travis and Rolf Harris. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Behaviour like this is not tolerated in the BBC of today and we would encourage anyone with information on such issues to speak to the police.’","Charlotte Green, 58, said she tried to avoid being in the same room as 'pest'

"The Blessed St Martin professed never even to have seen the inside of the away dressing room at Celtic Park before. While the venerable Robbie Keane gushed with emotion over the glorious six months he’d spent in his beloved green-and-white Hoops. Without wishing to spoil the mood of this love-in, it’s safe to assume that Republic of Ireland manager Martin O’Neill and captain Keane won’t be made to feel too much at home as they attempt to get one over on their gracious hosts on Friday night. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Ireland striker Robbie Keane has 65 international goals and 137 caps to his name . Still, Keane - the remarkable 34-year-old who just keeps on scoring goals - is already dreaming of getting just one more at the ground he briefly graced following his ecstatically-received deadline-day loan move to Celtic in the winter of 2010. ‘I certainly hope it’s the case,’ said the man who has regularly hit the back of the net at some of the biggest and best grounds in Europe. ‘Scoring goals when you are a striker, no matter where you are, you get that exciting feeling. ‘But certainly, growing up and watching Celtic and having the privilege to play here, and managing to score a few goals while I was here was extra special. So of course it would be nice if that was the case. ‘It would certainly be up there with my best moments. It’s very hard to predict that now. But if that were the case then I’d obviously be delighted. ‘Honestly, the whole experience of being a player here was fantastic. Coming from London and coming to Celtic Park late at night to find 5,000 people there waiting for me was one of the best feelings you can ever get as a player. ‘Just walking out on to Celtic Park and putting on that green and white jersey, well, from start to finish the experience for me was great. I enjoyed every minute of it.’ Keane spent six months on loan at Celtic in 2010 and scored 12 goals in 16 appearances . Fully prepared for an entirely different sort of reception tonight, not least from former team-mate Scott Brown, Keane views boos and jeers as a badge of honour – and believes that Scots-born former Celtic star Aiden McGeady is very much of the same mind. ‘Certainly from my experience, anyway, it’s something that you quite enjoy,’ said LA Galaxy star Keane, who has 65 international goals and an incredible 137 caps to his name ‘Knowing Aiden as I do, I don’t think it will affect him too much. ‘I’m sure he’ll rise to the occasion like he has done for the last few games. He’s been here for a few years with Celtic and was a great player for them. I know he’s excited about coming back. ‘I don’t think what people say or whether the crowd are going to boo him will affect him too much. I’m sure they will boo him - but I’m also sure he’ll enjoy it. ‘Scott, when I was here, was brilliant. He wears his heart on the sleeve and he gives everything for Celtic and his country. It’s clear to see when you see him playing. I’m sure it will be no different tomorrow. ‘He will be the same Scott that I know, going around kicking people. But he doesn’t get the credit he deserves. He’s a good football player. He doesn’t mind a tackle, too. It will be interesting to play against him.’ O’Neill, doing his best to shrug aside the unwanted distraction surrounding Roy Keane – who really should buy himself a Mario Balotelli-style *Why Always Me?* T-Shirt – and an alleged altercation at the team hotel, beamed with delight at just taking his place in a rather flimsy marquee erected outside Celtic Park. Keane talks to Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane (right) at Celtic Park on Thursday . ‘I must admit, it will be really strange to walk into the club and turn right, to the away dressing room, instead of left,’ he said. ‘I said it jokingly but I might be serious when I say I’m not too sure I’ve ever set foot in the away dressing room here. It will be strange, I must admit. After the press conference, I fancy a little walk around.’ What he really fancies, of course, is another big result to go with wins over Georgia away and Gibraltar at home, not to mention a dramatic last-gasp draw against Germany in Gelsenkirchen. O’Neill said: ‘We are away from home. But we think we can get a result in the game – I think we can win the match. I’m quite sure Gordon (Strachan) thinks so as well – and Scotland will be favourites to win. ‘But Germany were very strong favourites to beat us and we managed to get something from that game. So we’re going in with confidence. ‘This is not a 38-game season. Every single game is of some significance. Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill (left) and captain Robbie Keane at Thursday's press conference . ‘When we’ve finished tomorrow, we will have played three pretty difficult away games and will still be in the hunt, regardless of the result. ‘Scotland have been on a good run. Gordon has momentum behind him, the team and the country. They played exceptionally well against Germany in the second half and might have been unlucky not to take something from that game. They followed that with a must-win against Georgia and a great result in Poland.’ The man who paid £12million to take Steven Fletcher from Wolves to Sunderland obviously sees the Scotland striker as a threat, crediting him with at least 50 per cent of the responsibility for keeping the Black Cats in the Barclays Premier League after his arrival. In fact, it’s impossible to escape the feeling that familiarity will play a crucial rule in this international ‘derby match’, with the lack of surprise elements on either side possibly leading to a less open game than usual. One thing of which O’Neill is certain, however, is that discipline and cool heads will be key. ‘This type of match will test the most experienced of players. They will still have a nervousness about them,’ he said. ‘In games like these, ironically and remarkably, sometimes the young players are the ones who shine and sail through, dismissing the nerves as they play. ‘The players are ready for the game, they have been for some time. It’s very much the case of having some discipline about ourselves, because it’s better if we keep players on the field.’","Robbie Keane spent six months in his beloved green-and-white Hoops .

"French first lady Valerie Trierweiler should stop co-habiting and become a ‘legitimate wife’, her predecessor Carla Bruni said today. Ms Trierweiler has become one of the most unpopular women in the country since moving into the Elysee Palace with her boyfriend, President Francois Hollande, in May. One of the reasons the French dislike the 47-year-old so much is that they object to a live-in-lover being their Premiere Dame. Couple: Valerie Trierweiler (right) has become one of the most unpopular women in the country since moving into the Elysee Palace with her boyfriend, President Francois Hollande (left), in May . Ms Bruni, the 45-year-old former supermodel turned pop singer, famously became the third wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy following a whirlwind romance lasting just 80 days. She made it clear at the time that her wild days as the lover of a host of celebrities including English rock stars Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton were over, and that she wanted to be a respectable first lady. Now, almost six months since leaving the Elysee, Ms Bruni tells the new edition of French Elle magazine that Mr Hollande, who has never been married, should finally wed Ms Treirweiler, who has been divorced twice. ‘I think it is simpler to be the legitimate wife of the head of state rather than being his partner,’ said Ms Bruni. She added: ‘Maybe I’m wrong and their choice is a modern one. But for my part I felt a real easing of the general worry about me when I married Nicolas.’ Comments: The French first lady should stop co-habiting and become a 'legitimate wife', Carla Bruni said . Just a year before her marriage to Mr Sarkozy, Ms Bruni had told Madame Figaro magazine that ‘monogamy bores me’, with many believing that she was solely going out with the president to boost her own profile. 'I think it is simpler to be the legitimate wife of the head of state rather than being his partner' Carla Bruni . Italian-born heiress Ms Bruni has been in the spotlight all her adult life, and is currently publicising her fourth album, which comes out in the spring. The Paris home she shares with Mr Sarkozy was raided by anti-corruption police after Mr Sarkozy lost his presidential immunity from prosecution. He is facing a string of serious criminal allegations, including claims that he accepted illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the L’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman. In the interview with Elle, Ms Bruni suggested that Mr Sarkozy’s days as a high-profile conservative politician were probably over. Famous faces: Carla Bruni (right), the 45-year-old former supermodel turned pop singer, became the third wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy (left) following a whirlwind romance lasting just 80 days . ‘His return seems improbable, although I am no expert on movements in politics,’ said Ms Bruni, who was once a self-styled champagne Socialist, before transforming herself into a firm supporter of Mr Sarkozy’s right-wing policies. 'I felt a real easing of the general worry about me when I married Nicolas' Carla Bruni . Mr Sarkozy has denied any wrong-doing, while Ms Bruni has yet to comment on any of them. Ms Trierweiler became particularly unpopular in June when she posted a tweet supporting a political rival of Segolene Royal, the ex-girlfriend of Mr Hollande and mother of his four children. This infuriated both Mr Hollande and Ms Royal, and ensured that their three sons and daughter stopped speaking to Ms Trierweiler. It later emerged that Ms Trierweiler had at one stage been the shared lover of both Mr Hollande and a married conservative minister. This was while Mr Trieweiler was also still married, and Mr Hollande was living with Ms Royal. Ms Trierweiler is pursuing a civil action against Christophe Jakubyszyn and Alix Bouilhaguet, who exposed her alleged double-dating of Hollande and Patrick Devedjian. Both Ms Trierweiler and Mr Devedijian are suing for defamation and breach of privacy.","First lady Valerie Trierweiler is one of the most unpopular woman in France .

"A brain-damaged 17-month-old boy has died days after a High Court judge ruled that he should be taken off a life support machine against his family's wishes. The little boy had been born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in 'poor condition' and was cared for at a hospital run by King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London. He also suffered a cardiac arrest lasting for about 20 minutes and needed resuscitation. A  17-month-old boy with brain damage (not shown) has died days after a High Court judge ruled that he should be taken off a life support machine . Ms Justice Russell ruled last week that it was in his best interests for 'life-sustaining intensive care' to be withdrawn as he was suffering from 'profound irreversible brain damage'. A lawyer who represents the little boy's mother and father said his death had left them devastated. Yogi Amin, who works for law firm Irwin Mitchell, said: 'The family are of course devastated to have lost a precious life in their family and have asked for privacy at this incredibly difficult time to grieve for their son.' Ms Justice Russell had said there had been 'multiple failures' at one stage of the little boy's care, during the hearing at the Family Division of the High Court in London. The little boy had been born prematurely by emergency Caesarean section in 'poor condition' and was cared for at a hospital run by King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust in London . Claire Watson, representing the trust, said in late 2013 he had suffered an 'acute cardio-respiratory deterioration' which required him to be 'mechanically ventilated once again'. She had also indicated that something had 'gone wrong' - but had not given detail. The NHS Trust had asked the judge to rule that life-support treatment could be withdrawn . Michael Marrinan, the trust's executive medical director, today said he was sorry that an agreement about the 'best course of action' had not been reached. 'Decisions about what is best for patients in circumstances such as this are always difficult,' he said. 'This baby spent his whole life in our intensive care unit and after a long period of assessment by our doctors and independent experts, we determined that he did not have hope of improving. Ms Justice Russell ruled last week at the Family Division of the High Court in London that it was in his best interests for 'life-sustaining intensive care' to be withdrawn as he was suffering from brain damage . 'We are sorry that we could not reach an agreement with his parents about the best course of action to take. 'We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to his parents for the loss of their son.' Ms Watson had told the court that an investigation had been carried out and said the 'trust have endeavoured to be entirely transparent about what has gone wrong'. The judge accepted that the trust had been 'transparent' and 'has not tried to cover anything up'. But she said what had happened had 'affected the way his parents feel about his treatment - as it would'. The boy cannot be named for legal reasons.","A 17-month-old boy has died after his life support machine was turned off .

"Real Sociedad captain Xabi Prieto has revealed he went straight to Mikel Arteta when he learned that David Moyes would be the club's new manager.

'He spent eleven years at Everton and signed with a very big club like (Manchester) United, although it didn't go so well. 'I talked with Arteta who played under him for many years at Everton, and all he had to say was good things about him. 'He (Mikel) told me that he is very demanding and committed to making good relationships with his players. We will try to make him feel comfortable as soon as we can here and hopefully that will allow him to help the team grow.

"The Duchess of Cornwall told her son she regretted sending him to boarding school, he has revealed. Describing his prep school as a ‘hotbed of all sorts of things that are coming out now’, Tom Parker Bowles told how one master at his prep school would join the boys in the shower. Mr Parker Bowles, 39, revealed that when his daughter turned seven this month, he reminded his mother: ‘You sent me away eight months after this.’ Scroll down for video . Revelations: Tom Parker Bowles says his mother, the Duchess of Cornwall (pictured together in 1996) told him she regrets sending him to boarding school at the age of seven, but 'it was the thing you did' In an interview with The Times, he claims that she was ‘slightly appalled, saying she’d never do it again’, adding: ‘But it was the thing you did.’ Mr Parker Bowles, a food critic, says his children, Lola and Freddie, go to day schools in London, although he intends to send his son to board at Eton College when he is 13. He refers to his school days at Summer Fields prep school in Oxford as ‘a hotbed of all the sorts of things that are coming out now’, including one master who take a shower in the morning with the pupils. Mr Parker Bowles said his father had urged him to speak up if anything untoward happened at Summer Fields. He said: ‘It was just certain things that weren’t right and I’d say to my dad and he’d say “Well, you tell me if anything happens”. And it never did.’ Food critic to be: A young Tom Parker Bowles enjoys a hot dog during a day out in May 1980 . Concern: Mr Parker Bowles, pictured with his family in 1980, said his father, Lt Col Andrew Parker Bowles (left) had urged him to speak up if anything untoward happened at school . He went on to Eton, which he says he enjoyed, but his grades were so poor that his father used to threaten to send him to a comprehensive school if he did not work harder. Mr Parker Bowles said: ‘He meant it, [saying] “I’m not going to spend all this money on you if you’re not going to pull your f****** finger out”. ‘He drove me past Corsham comprehensive and I just remember thinking how many pretty girls there were, but there were also tough-looking boys, not like the sort of boys at Eton.’ Mr Parker Bowles, who calls himself ‘a good old pleb’, says that he was not a high-flyer at school, although he still got into Oxford. He said: ‘I was rubbish at everything. I was good at smoking. We knew where a couple of pubs were where you could drink underage, but, apart from a couple of English prizes, I moved like a ghost through that school.’ Choices: Mr Parker Bowles, 39, revealed that when his daughter turned seven this month, he reminded his mother: 'You sent me away eight months after this' Joining families: Mr Parker Bowles's mother married Prince Charles in 2005. He had been been at Oxford when news of their relationship became public . He also revealed the pain of finding out about his mother’s affair with Prince Charles – to the extent of avoiding reading newspapers when the relationship became public. His mother and Prince Charles married in 2005. He was at Oxford in 1993 when Camilla-gate broke and the nation read a transcript of a very intimate telephone conversation between the pair. He recalled: ‘I sort of remember not looking at the paper. Because, you know, Jesus, the things that we’ve all said to people that we love … that you wouldn’t want the world reading. ‘I just felt pissed off. I wasn’t going to read that sort of stuff about my mother, just as much as she wouldn’t want to read it about me or my kids certainly wouldn’t want to read it about me.' Parent: Describing his mother, he said: 'She is a brilliant grandmother. I mean, she works incredibly hard' Describing his mother, he added: ‘She is a brilliant grandmother. I mean, she works incredibly hard. 'She’d be the first to say that she didn’t really have a job apart from being our mother, which she was very good at, and suddenly age 55 she is working.’ Mr Parker Bowles told BBC Five Live yesterday that he ignored criticism of his mother and Prince Charles and was unaffected by Twitter trolls. He said: 'There's absolutely nothing anyone can say about my mother or myself or my step-father that we haven't heard before. You'd have to be a Dickens or a Nabakov to come up with something really offensive. 'It's just words, stick and stones and all that. It's not real fear or real danger. People moan about Twitter, about trolling, you just turn it off.' Mr Parker Bowles has written a series of travel books about food as well as a number of recipe books. He was named as one of the most followed restaurant critics on Twitter earlier this year.

"Sepp Blatter has hit back at attacks from FA chairman Greg Dyke and other European officials, claiming they were the 'most disrespectful' thing he had ever experienced. Dyke had told Blatter at a meeting of UEFA countries on Tuesday his claim that racism was behind World Cup corruption allegations in the British media was 'offensive and totally unacceptable'. Dutch FA president Michael van Praag also told Blatter in blunt terms that he should step down from FIFA next year and not stand for a fifth term. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sepp Blatter entertaining with his awkward dance moves . All smiles: FIFA President Sepp Blatter at the 64th FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo, Brazil . Blatter told a news conference after the FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo: 'I have had to accept a number of blows but what I saw and heard at the UEFA meeting was the most disrespectful thing I have experienced in my entire life, on the football pitch and in my home.' Blatter's position has been hugely strengthened however after FIFA delegates dealt a crushing blow to moves to bring in term limits and age limits for officials. It effectively giving the green light to Blatter to stand for re-election next year. UEFA and a number of European federations, including the FA, had proposed bringing in limits but that was defeated in a vote at FIFA's Congress in Sao Paulo. The decision leaves the way open for 78-year-old Blatter to stay in office next year - and for many years beyond - and he made it clear to FIFA's 209 member nations that he intends to stand again. He told delegates: 'The candidature period is not yet open so no one can be a candidate. I know that my mandate will finish next year on June 29 in Zurich - but my mission is not finished. 'And I tell you together we will build the new FIFA together. We have the foundations today. Congress will decide who will take this great institution forward. Ready: Blatter has indicated he is ready to seek a fifth successive term . 'It's a tough decision but I can tell you I am ready to accompany you for the game, for the world - but it is your decision.' The vote on limits came towards the end of a lengthy meeting where Blatter made the light-hearted suggestion that football could one day be played on other planets. He also told delegates that the governing body was still involved in governance reforms. 'We are still in our reform process but we are at the end,' he said. 'Our basic values of football of discipline, respect and fair play could be brought in everywhere in the world then we would have realised our objective, but our objective never finishes. 'From north to west to east and south ... and we shall wonder if one day our game is played on other planets and then one day we won't have the World Cup, we will have interplanetary contests.' Meanwhile former FA chairman Lord Triesman used a speech in the House of Lords to liken FIFA to 'a mafia family' and Blatter to Don Corleone. Blatter refused to respond to Triesman, the initial chairman of England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup who has previously claimed four FIFA members sought bribes in return for votes. Triesman said: 'FIFA, I'm afraid, behaves like a mafia family. It has a decades-long tradition of bribes, bungs and corruption. 'About half of its executive committee who voted on the last World Cup have had to go. Vote: FIFA's 209 member associations at the 64th FIFA Congress in Sao Paulo, Brazil . 'Even its past president Joao Havelange has been removed from his honorary life presidency in his 90s. 'Systematic corruption underpinned by non-existent investigations where most of the accused are exempt from the investigation make it impossible to proceed. 'Foreign construction workers dying in their dozens in Qatar stadium construction sites are essentially ignored.' Speaking during debate on the Queen's Speech, he applauded the stand taken by current FA chairman Greg Dyke against the 'grotesque' accusation by Blatter that criticism was racist. He told peers: 'Don Corleone, I believe, would have recognised the tactics and he probably would have admired them.' FIFA's 209 member associations rejected proposals to introduce term mandates and age limits for its elected executives at the world soccer governing body's annual Congress on Wednesday. Members were asked to approve or reject the ideas in principle and, although majorities voted against both proposals, FIFA did not give an exact vote count. Associations voted by holding aloft green or red cards because the electronic voting system in Sao Paulo's conference centre was not working. European soccer's governing body UEFA was the only one of the six regional confederations to support the proposals but several delegates called the ideas unfair and restrictive. 'We are completely against these changes,' Yves Jean Bart, president of the Haitian FA, said to loud applause. 'We are working in a democratic system and that is the system that needs to prevail.' FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who had originally said his current mandate which ends next year would be his last, has since indicated he is ready to seek a fifth successive term. The 78-year old Swiss has been FIFA boss since 1998 .","Associations voted by holding aloft green or red cards because the electronic voting system was not working .

"Woolworths has pulled a controversial singlet which featured the slogan 'If you don't love it, leave' from the shelves of two stores, after the supermarket giant was accused of racism. The company came under sustained attack on social media on Monday afternoon after an image of the men's singlet on sale at a Cairns store went viral. The company's Facebook page was deluged with negative comments, with some shoppers announcing they would boycott the store. But Woolworths told Daily Mail Australia the singlet had been ordered in error. Rage: The singlet, pictured on sale at a Cairns supermarket . 'Selling racist singlets for everyday low prices' 'It has come to our attention that two Woolworths stores were inadvertantly stocking a singlet that we consider totally unacceptable,' a company spokesman told Daily Mail Australia. 'The singlet was not one we ordered. It was delivered to us in error and should never been allowed on our shelves. We will review our processes to ensure this sort of error cannot happen again.' 'As soon as we were made aware we immediately withdrew the product from our shelves.' The Woolworths spokesman said the singlet's sentiments did not reflect the company's views. But many customers had already made their anger clear. On the Woolworths Facebook page, Zoh Dowling wrote: 'There's no way on earth I'm spending my weekly shopping budget at a supermarket who thinks it's fine to sell racism themed apparel.' Kym Watling said: 'Get rid of the racist shirts and sack whoever thought it was a good idea.'Shopper Carl Redfern, who said his family usually shopped at Woolworths in Marrickville, quipped: 'Hey Woolworths I DON'T LOVE the racist singlets you're selling, so guess what I'm going to LEAVE.' The image went viral after it was shared on the Facebook page of Greens MP Adam Bandt. 'Divisive and ridiculous - these should be pulled immediately,' a post written by 'Team Bandt' said. Earlier this year, a range of T-shirts sold by the supermarket Aldi were pulled from the shelves after accusations of racism. The T-shirts featured logos which said: 'AUSTRALIA EST 1788'.","Social media storm after person spots 'racist' singlet .

"From the Abominable Snowman to the Loch Ness Monster, there's no shortage of mythical creatures rumoured to walk the Earth - and no shortage of people convinced they truly do exist. But few legendary beast aficionados are as committed as those dedicated to Bigfoot, with legions of hunters from Texas to Oregon dedicated to tracking down Sasquatch. Among them are Rick Dyer, a hunter from Georgia, and Las Vegas entrepreneur Tom Biscadi - both of whom say they are the man to uncover the truth about the mythical monster. The A-team: Las Vegas Bigfoot expert Tom Biscardi with his crack team of Sasquatch hunters . Found it? Rick Dyer has claimed to have tracked Bigfoot down not once but twice . Now a new BBC documentary, Shooting Bigfoot, has delved into their often bizarre world where conspiracy theorists and unscheduled falls in the river are all part of the job. But while the men are convinced, not everyone agrees, among them the mother of Rick's daughter Audrey. And the fact she's not convinced is partly down to Rick himself, who in 2008 claimed to have found Bigfoot but was soon revealed to have found nothing more than a Sasquatch costume that he had filled with possum roadkill. 'I hurt a lot of people in 2008 with the . hoax,' he admits, 'a lot of true believers, and I'd like to redeem myself and show . that I'm the real deal.' In a bid to prove it, he's travelled to Texas where reports from San Antonio say that a homeless person encountered the beast while sleeping rough in the woods. 'Some homeless people called it in and . three motorists called it in, and then I came up here and across this . path, I saw it,' says Rick. 'I'm not going to tell you how tall it is because I don't . know but it was a hairy upright creature and when I saw it, my heart . dropped. 'I am 100 per cent in no doubt that there is a Bigfoot and . that there is a Bigfoot right here.' But while Rick is dedicated to the pursuit of Sasquatch, his six years in the game make him a novice compared to Biscardi, who has spent 37 years hunting Bigfoot. 'I've seen the creature with my own eyes,' he reveals. 'I was 12ft away from one once and I freaked out. 'I made a dedication to . myself that day that I'm going to bring one of these things back because . I know they exist. 37 years later, I'm still doing it.' Hoax: Dyer's 2008 'discovery' turned out to be a Sasquatch costume filled with dead possums . The real deal? A computer generated image showing what the primate-like Bigfoot might actually look like . Famous: A still from the 1972 Patterson-Gimlin film purporting to show Bigfoot . Quite what Mrs Biscardi makes of it all is anyone's guess, although his son TJ has been known to team up with his father and his crack 'A-team' of Bigfoot hunters. Travelling with TJ and Tom is Young Blood, described by Biscardi as his 'chief tracker and sharpshooter' and Chico, an elderly survival specialist. When Biscardi isn't out hunting for Bigfoot, he's busy making documentaries; among them Bigfoot Lives, Bigfoot Lives 2 and Bigfoot Lives 3. It might sound bizarre but Biscardi is convinced he knows what he's doing. 'You hear about people saying they're a . Bigfoot hunter, Bigfoot researcher, Bigfoot this and that, crypto . zoologist,' he complains. 'Crypto my ass - the name of the game is this: you either heel . and toe it down that street and go out into the brush and look or . you'll never find anything.' While Rick might call himself a Bigfoot hunter, he says that he too is the real deal. 'God has sent me something to say ""Look, . there is a Bigfoot, be committed now."" Rather menacingly, he continues: 'Unfortunately for the Bigfoot, . I'm going to have to kill it. If there is someone out here in a costume, . they will be dead soon because I'm going to kill them.' So does Bigfoot really exist? Biscardi is convinced that the primate prints he finds come from a juvenile Sasquatch while Rick goes public with claims that yet again, he has managed to shoot and kill Bigfoot - and has the corpse to prove it. 'Growing up I thought I'd be a cowboy,' adds Rick, 'but I gave it up for the same reason that you don't . pursue a lot of your little pipe dreams. 'This is not a pipe dream - a . pipe dream is something you can't achieve.' Storyville: Shooting Bigfoot, tonight at 10pm on BBC4 .","Bigfoot hunters Rick Dyer and Tom Biscadi appear in new film .

"Stuart Broad is not usually a man to miss a trick but he was oblivious on Friday after becoming the first Englishman to take two Test hat-tricks. Only when the man on the PA system announced the feat at the end of an over where Broad had struck with his first two balls did any of the England team and, seemingly, the entire Yorkshire crowd, realise that he had also taken the key wicket of Kumar Sangakkara with the last ball of his previous over. Cue a subdued reaction from a bowler who had earned the acclaim of his home crowd at Trent Bridge when he took his first hat-trick against India three years ago and had also been on the receiving end of Peter Siddle’s hat-trick ball at Brisbane a few months earlier. He is the first bowler to claim one at Headingley for 57 years. VIDEO Scroll down to watch reaction after day one from Liam Plunkett . Happy days: Stuart Broad wasn't aware he'd taken a hat-trick but he left the field with a smile on day one . Getting on with it: Broad took two wickets with the first two balls of an over to get his second Test hat-trick . It was that sort of day at this famous . old ground where it is best to expect the unexpected and where the . cricket and the crowd rarely fail to entertain. This was a day of . extremes to start the decisive  second Investec Test — from Broad’s . hat-trick and Liam  Plunkett’s first five-wicket haul in Test cricket as . Sri Lanka were hustled out for 257, to a catalogue of English fielding . errors and two naive self-inflicted blows. There . was even the surreal sight, late in the day, of play being stopped when . Sri Lanka fielder Shaminda Eranga appeared to be struck by a piece of . cheese thrown by a spectator on the notoriously rowdy Western Terrace. Alastair . Cook will be happy to have taken all 10 wickets so quickly after . putting in Sri Lanka under leaden skies but the England  captain would . also have been frustrated not to have dismissed them for significantly . fewer. Missed chances are . one thing — and England squandered five on Friday — yet there was also a . rejected lbw that was shown to be out but which Broad failed to review, . and an edged catch by Sangakkara to wicketkeeper Matt Prior for which . no one appealed.

On fire: Plunkett leaps in the air after taking the wicket of veteran batsman Mahala Jayawardene for 22 . At stumps, . openers Cook and Sam Robson, who both badly need a score for different . reasons, negotiated 15 overs to leave England in a position from where . they should be able to dominate, even though Rangana Herath showed that . he may well be a threat today with one or two that turned. Cook, . without a Test century since he last batted here 11 matches ago, needed . a good day after increasing the pressure  on himself by hitting back . at  criticism by Shane Warne and then gambling on inserting Sri Lanka. His decision was justified because his four-man seam attack delivered . the goods on a pitch that did not have as much pace as England hoped but . still kept the batsmen honest with movement off the seam and through . the air. No one knew more . about exploiting the conditions than adopted Yorkshireman Plunkett, who . showed he can be the enforcer but also displayed skill by varying his . length and lines. Plunkett was on a hat-trick himself when he  dismissed . Mahela Jayawardene and Lahiru Thirimanne in successive balls but he . will not mind missing out on that after taking Nuwan Pradeep’s wicket . to  complete his best Test haul.

Job done: Alastair Cook negotiated 15 overs from the Sri Lankans before stumps as England finished 36 for 0 . Without loss: Sam Robson (left) is 21 not out and Cook is 14 not out at stumps . It . was quite a performance from a man who had not played a Test in seven . years before returning at Lord’s last week and who could easily have . been lost to the game when he left Durham two years ago. And it was . achieved in front of his father Alan, who has recovered from . serious illness. Plunkett’s . tally could so easily have been even better as he twice should have . claimed Sangakkara. The Sri Lankan has hit 36 Test hundreds, including . one at Lord’s in the first Test, and a further 46 half-centuries but he . can rarely have batted quite as badly in reaching 79 as he did here . after being given four lives by England. One . of the greatest of all batsmen should have been run out before he had . scored and gave three other chances before Ian Bell, in his 100th Test, . claimed a sharp catch to send him on his way. That . was the first of four wickets to fall in nine balls after tea as any . hopes Sri Lanka had of embarrassing Cook with a big score evaporated and . the tourists then failed to make any inroads when England batted.

To top off the grand gesture, the delivery driver arrived with a bunch of flowers and candles while a violinist was sent along to serenade her as she sipped champagne and tucked into her takeaway. A bit cheesy: Richard McKeever ordered a pizza for his girfriend, Juliet, 240 miles away in a romantic gesture which included a violinist and flowers . Mr McKeever, 26, came up with idea after Juliet, 21, moved back to Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, to finish her biochemistry degree . Mr McKeever, 26, came up with the idea to sweep his girlfriend, 21, off her feet after she moved back to England from Belfast, Northern Ireland, to finish her biochemistry degree at the University of Warwick. Determined to make sure the 240-mile distance over the Irish Sea would not impact on the relationship, he arranged the surprise pizza delivery. Juliet said: 'To say I was shocked was an understatement - it's not exactly your normal pizza delivery. 'It caused a bit of commotion on the street too as passers-by stopped to stare and my neighbours didn't have a clue what was going on. 'I was so touched and overwhelmed that Richard managed to pull this off.' The couple have been together for seven months after sparking up a relationship online. Mr McKeever ordered the pizza from more than 240miles away in Belfast, Northern Ireland . Juliet said the delivery caused a 'bit of commission' on her street when the violinist started playing . The couple, who met online and have been together for seven months, are determined to not let the distance impact on their relationship . After discussing their love of music with each other, they began talking over Skype until they made the decision to meet. Juliet flew out to meet her future boyfriend in Belfast, where he greeted her at the airport. Romance blossomed and lovestruck Juliet even organised a research placement in Belfast over the summer to be closer to her new beau. Now she has moved away, Mr McKeever hopes to keep the sparks flying over long distance. The coffee shop worker said: 'Long distance relationships can be tricky and it's the little things you miss, like having dinner together and curling up on the sofa with a pizza and a film. 'I thought a bit of old fashioned romance might be able to help to bridge the gap. 'We talk every day. Skype, texts, phone calls. I'm amazed we aren't sick of each other.'","Richard McKeever and Juliet spent summer together in Belfast .

"Ireland boss Martin O’Neill insisted that their Euro 2016 hopes remained alive and well despite 1-0 defeat by Scotland at his old stomping ground. O’Neill, who confessed that the ‘frenetic’ encounter at Celtic Park had been far from easy on the eye, is now pinning his hopes on a run of home games — including Scotland’s visit to Dublin next June — to regain momentum. ‘That’s us and Scotland on seven points each,’ said the former Celtic manager. ‘In truth, our own fate will depend on what happens in the Aviva Stadium. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Martin O’Neill confessed that the 'frenetic' encounter had been far from easy on the eye . ‘We’ve got four of the next five games at home. We’ve had a difficult run, three away games and one at home — seven points on the board. ‘With Poland winning in Georgia and Germany still the strongest team in the group, it’s going to be tough. ‘Everything is to play for. I would have believed that if we’d come out of this game unscathed. ‘We have to get ourselves together. If we’re talking about our next competitive match in March, we’ve got to get ourselves together and be ready for Poland. We are absolutely still in this, without a doubt.’ O’Neill confessed that Scots-born winger Aiden McGeady, booed every time he touched the ball, had made a less dramatic than expected impact on the game, saying: ‘I think that Aiden, like a number of players here, for the sort of form he has shown for us in the games, he would have been a bit frustrated tonight. ‘I haven’t spoken to him about that (the booing) but, for the form he has shown in recent times for us, the match he won for us in Georgia, I think he had a frustrating time. Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane and Gordon Strachan on the touchline at Celtic Park . ‘The atmosphere obviously was great. But this wasn’t a return to Celtic. It had a totally different feel to it. ‘Last night, when I came up here and walked on to the pitch, it might have evoked a few memories. But today I was totally focused on trying to get something out of the game.’ Addressing his own team’s fairly brutal performance, the Ireland boss added: ‘I don’t think either of the teams were able to get it down and play. After the first 10 or 15 minutes of the game, it kept developing in that style. ‘Scotland didn’t get hold of it, either. We weren’t able to do so. It’s a tough contest. We’ve been talking about if for weeks, that it would be a derby game, a derby atmosphere. ‘It had those ingredients. Neither team could keep possession long enough. ‘Whether that was because of the atmosphere, maybe a bit of nervousness, it applied to both teams. We’re disappointed because I thought we had opportunities to get it and play, despite the atmosphere. We were unable to do so. ‘We’ve conceded a goal after they’d forced corner – but I thought we were comfortable. We conceded from a set-piece. Ireland's Aiden McGeady made a less dramatic than expected impact on the game . ‘I thought it was a frenetic match. Stop-start a lot of times, littered with fouls. Just like a derby in many aspects. But I thought we were going to get something out of the game. ‘I felt the first goal would win. The two sides cancelled each other out, to coin the old phrase. I thought we were not in phenomenal danger when the goal occurred.’ The defeat comes at the end of a difficult week for O’Neill, who has lost key players to injury — and been distracted by allegations of Roy Keane getting involved in an incident with a fan at the team hotel. ‘The Roy Keane incident has genuinely not bothered me,’ he insisted. ‘It’s a distraction, that’s not a problem. ‘The injuries are part of the game. You curse your luck and get on with it. ‘No excuses. We had players out there tonight capable of winning the game, never mind coming out of it unscathed. Top scorer Robbie Keane started on the bench in favour of Shane Long . Keane came on as late substitute but could not affect the outcome . ‘We lost it, the game was on a knife edge, it could have gone either way. When Scotland scored, even they might have been thinking a draw would have been fair.’ Defending his decision to drop top scorer Robbie Keane in favour of Shane Long, O’Neill said: ‘I make decisions for the good of the team. Robbie accepted it because we were playing away from home and wanted to stretch the game. Shane Long can do that.’ Meanwhile, Ireland defender Seamus Coleman vowed the Republic would bounce back from the set-back. ‘We have to regroup now,’ said the Everton man. ‘We came here wanting to win the game but we would have been happy if we had left with a point in the end. ‘But unfortunately we switched off for the corner and they scored. ‘It is a horrible feeling. I know we pushed them back towards the end but it was not good enough and we’re all disappointed. ‘It’s a tough group, we knew it was going to be and we expected every game to be difficult.’","Martin O'Neill upbeat despite 1-0 defeat by Scotland on Friday night .

"I've had a few requests recently asking me for tips on quick and easy hairstyles, so this week I thought I'd try something new. When I'm in the mood to update my look, my first port of call is the catwalk shows as they're always a great place to find inspiration for new hair and make-up styles. You don't need to go the whole hog and recreate a really extreme 'fashion' look, it's more about discovering a new idea that will give your hair a modern, on-trend feel. Scroll down for video . Binky was inspired by the hairstyles on the catwalks of fashion week . The good news is, there were plenty of very simple updos on the autumn/winter runways, from super-sleek ponytails at Victoria Beckham to ballerina buns at Diane Von Furstenberg. My favourite trend, however, was braiding. Plaits popped up everywhere from Marchesa (cornrows) and Chanel (dreadlock braids), to Marc by Marc Jacobs (long, girlish looks). So I've taken the plaiting trend and adapted it into a simple yet sexy look I'm calling my Messy Milkmaid Braid. Jennifer Lawrence and Sienna Miller are huge fans of this casual boho-chic 'do – here's how you can get it. Step 1 - Prep . You don't want flyaway, super-clean hair when you're doing braids, as they won't stay in place. So start with day-old hair, or massage in a tiny blob of texturizing lotion such as Schwarzkopf Professional Osis+ 4 Play, to give your hair added hold. Binky says the point of this hairstyle is for it to look relaxed so don't worry if it isn't really neat . Step 2 - Braid . Now centre-part your hair and split it into two sections – one on either side of the parting. Leave a few long strands hanging free at the front, then loosely plait the two big sections. Don't worry if your plaits look at little messy as this is a laid-back, boho look that shouldn't be too perfect. Fix each braid with a hair elastic – try to find hairbands that match your hair colour, so they won't show up in your style. Step 3 - Hold . One at a time, fold each plait up and over your head, then secure in place with Kirby grips. Feel free to play around with the style once it's in place – you can loosen the braids for a grungier look, or pull more strands of hair out to the front to frame you face. Sienna Miller and Jennifer Lawrence are known fans of the Milkmaid style . Finally, fix your new style with a spritz of Bumble and bumble Cityswept Finish Spray. If you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could even accentuate your braids with some coloured hair chalk such as Bumble and Bumble Spray Chalk for a fun, festival-style feel. Simple, sweet and sexy with a fashion-savvy spin –that's what call I a clever 'do. BINKY'S BEST: HAIR SAVIOURS . Schwarzkopf Professional BC Bonacure Oil Miracle Shampoo – this argan oil-infused shampoo is perfect for those with coarse or dry hair, leaving it feeling nourished and super-soft. Rene Furterer Karite Intense Nourishing Mask – this weekly deep conditioning treatment injects dull or damaged hair with moisture, restoring smoothness and shine. Binky suggests using a colourful hair chalk if you want to create a festival vibe . Klorane Oatmilk Gentle Dry Shampoo Spray – this ultimate haircare staple revives and refreshes hair in-between washes, while giving locks a natural volume boost for a lived-in look. Schwarzkopf Professional Osis+ Volume Up – a few spritzes at the roots gives the hair full-blown, Hollywood style volume that won't budge all night.

"Danny Tickle landed the man of the match award against his old club as Widnes gave their play off hopes a huge lift with a stunning 24-10 victory over Wigan. Tickle booted six goals from six attempts and turned in a powerhouse display in the pack to dent Wigan's hopes of the League Leaders Shield. Patrick Ah Van crossed for two of the Vikings tries with Paddy Flynn grabbing the other on a night Wigan will want to forget. Best foot forward: Danny Tickle celebrates with teammates after kicking Widnes to a 24-10 victory over Wigan . Wigan, who swamped Widnes 48-4 at the DW Stadium in June, went into the clash with only one win in their last three games against Salford after a shock loss to Bradford and a draw at Hull KR. But the eighth placed Vikings had also won only three of their last 12 Super League matches and were looking nervously over their shoulders in the battle for the final play off spot. Wigan, who had lost only one of the previous 11 meetings with Widnes, welcomed back Michael McIlorum and Iain Thornley from long term injuries alongside recent absentees Gil Dudson, Tony Clubb and John Bateman but Matty Bowen, Ben Flower and Joel Tomkins were missing. Widnes skipper Jon Clarke, who retires at the end of the season, made his last home appearance with the Vikings' last two matches away at Bradford and Salford. Widnes made a fine start with only a flying Dan Sarginson tackle preventing a Chris Dean try. But the Vikings won the scrum against the head for Kevin Brown's long pass to put Ah Van over in the corner and Tickle landed the conversion before slotting over a penalty. Wigan were still recovering when Clarke's burst allowed Joe Mellor and Brown to combine and send Flynn racing in at the opposite corner. Again Tickle added the touchline conversion to make it 14-0 after 14 minutes. It would have been more embarrassing for Wigan had Ah Van been able to take a difficult pass from Rhys Hanbury with the line at his mercy. Wigan's opening try had an element of luck about it with a Blake Green pass rolling along the ground before Thornley put Dominic Manfredi over after 30 minutes. Green was more accurate with a teasing kick to the corner for Josh Charnley to outjump Ah Van and touch down - and this time Matty Smith was successful with the kick to cut the gap to 14-10. Only desperate defence prevented Charnley bagging a second try just before the break but Widnes deserved their half-time advantage although the warning signs were evident. Widnes made a perfect start to the second half with Ah Van going over for his second try after Wigan were caught napping from a kick with Tickle's fourth goal making it 20-10. The torrential rain made handling difficult, especially for Wigan, with Liam Farrell lucky to escape with only a yellow card for a high and late tackle on Mellor. Tickle struck two penalties to extend the advantage to 24-10 on the hour. Widnes looked hungrier than Wigan who can have no complaints at the final scoreline.

"A schoolgirl who was repeatedly raped in a 90-minute ordeal overheard by her mother has bravely waived her right to anonymity to speak out against her attacker. Paige Bilclough was 15 when she was attacked at knifepoint by Abdul Miah, then 19, on a piece of wasteland in Newcastle. As he assaulted her, he told her: 'You will always be the girl that got raped and no-one will like you.' But today the 17-year-old from Newcastle's West End said: 'He's the one that should be ashamed - he has lost everything and is behind bars while I want to be a singer and am getting on with my life. Paige Bilclough, 17, was just 15 when she was raped three times at knifepoint by Abdul Miah, then 19, right . Miss Bilclough, who has chosen to waive her right to anonymity, was raped three times on wasteland, above . Miss Bilclough was walking from a youth club to her aunt's house in the city's Rye Hill in December 2012 when Miah walked up to her, put a knife to her throat, and marched her down a dark alleyway to a secluded piece of wasteland. He then stuck his knife in a tree, ordered her to strip, and kept her there for an hour and a half, raping her three times. 'He just told me to take my clothes off,' she said.  'I was frozen and scared but I tried to do everything he said just so he wouldn't stab me. 'When you are in that situation you just focus on surviving.  Before it happened to me I thought I would have fought back, but you just do what you have to do to survive.' The attack was overheard by her mother who, worried about her daughter not coming back, had called her mobile.  When the phone was answered, she heard a man's mumbles instead of her daughter's voice. After the attack, during which Miah tried to degrade Miss Bilclough by telling her her life was ruined, he ordered her to dress and told her to empty her bag before grabbing cash and her phone and fleeing. Dreams: The teenager, from Newcastle's West End, says it is Miah, who dragged her off this street in the city, right, who should be ashamed, saying his life is ruined while hers is just beginning . Sobbing, she fled to her aunt's house and reported the attack to police.  Detectives found CCTV images of him in a hooded top walking along the street and his knife was recovered from the scene. Miah, of Elswick, was arrested five days later after police matched his DNA to a saliva sample taken when he was arrested in 2008 for taking a knife to his school Excelsior Academy. He admitted three counts of rape, robbery, and having a knife, and was jailed for 12 years in May last year. Miss Bilclough had wanted to face her rapist in court but her mother thought it would be too traumatic. She said: 'I did want to go to court as I thought seeing him might have been a bit of closure for me. 'At the time it happened I didn't see his face, but after he was jailed I looked at the picture of him on the Newcastle Chronicle website and he just looked like a little kid.' Convicted rapist Miah was sentenced to 12 years in jail at Newcastle's Law Courts, above, in May last year . She said: 'He's got what he deserved - he's behind bars now, and that's the life he's going to live from now on. 'I'm getting on with my life, but he's lost everything. 'I'm not ashamed of what happened to me - he's the one that should be ashamed.' Miss Bilclough is now working to put the attack behind her, saying: 'I do still think about it but there's no point in going over and over it.' And she says surviving it has given her a new strength. 'It's really given me a new determination to keep going - it's like I have a new light in my life because I have been given a second chance. 'I could have died that night, and now I don't take anything for granted.' The teenager now intends to train as a singer and vocal coach in the hope of becoming a professional singer. She said: 'I was going to try out for X Factor this year but I chickened out at the last minute. 'But I really want to do it next year. 'It's been hard to get my confidence up but I I'm going to work at it.'","Paige Bilclough, 17, has waived her right to anonymity to discuss her ordeal .

"The San Antonio Spurs delivered a decisive end to LeBron James' two-year reign atop the basketball world by routing the Miami Heat 104-87 on Sunday to win the NBA Finals four games to one. San Antonio trailed by 16 in the game's first seven minutes but outscored the Heat 55-29 over the decisive second and third quarters and were never threatened. James, the four-time NBA MVP who led the Heat to titles the past two seasons, scored 31 points but was largely ineffective after the first quarter when he had 17 points.

'It's selfless. Guys move, cut, pass, you've got a shot, you take it, but it's all for the team and it's never about the individual. That's the brand of basketball. 'They were the much better team.' The Spurs were paced in scoring by the Finals' MVP Kawhi Leonard who had 22 points, while Argentina's Manu Ginobili added 19. San Antonio hit just one of its first 12 shots and trailed 22-6 but outscored the Heat 25-11 in the second quarter and led 47-40 at the half. San Antonio, who lost to the Heat in the finals a year ago, opened the second half on a 18-4 run to seize a 65-44 lead, igniting the crowd hungry for the Spurs' first title since 2007 and their fifth overall. A three-point shot by Australian Patrick Mills and a jumper by Duncan hiked the Spurs' lead to 75-53 late in the third quarter and the rout was on.

'It just feels like a dream to me,' said Leonard. 'This is my second finals appearance in my third year. I've been just progressing each year and the team has also. 'Losing in the semifinals my first year, and losing the championship my second year, and now winning in my third year, it just makes you believe in your craft and your hard work.' James hit five of seven shots in the first quarter but nailed only five of 14 the rest of the way. The Heat shot 40 percent from the floor, including just seven of 25 from three-point range. Miami was the first team to play in four successive finals since the Boston Celtics in 1984-87, and were hoping to become the first three-time champion since the Los Angeles Lakers more than a decade ago. The title was the fifth for the Spurs' Tim Duncan, a 38-year-old, 14-time All-Star who has not yet said if he will continue to play. No avail: James heads for the basket during the second half, but the Spurs won 104-87 . Battle: Miami guard Dwayne Wade (left) attempts to steal the ball from Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard .

Mercurial Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who has coached Duncan to each of his titles, joins Phil Jackson, Red Auerbach, John Kundla and Pat Riley as the only coaches with five NBA crowns. In the 2013 finals against Miami, the Spurs squandered a five-point lead in the last 28 seconds of regulation of Game Six to lose 103-100 in overtime. The Spurs were so close to the title, the court was being lined with tape for the post-game award ceremony. Given new life, Miami went on to win Game Seven and the championship.

San Antonio came back this year with the same roster, except for the addition of Italian Marco Bellinelli. Quality minutes in the finals from Frenchman Boris Diaw, Mills and Brazilian Tiago Splitter, and improved play in the finals from Ginobili, lifted the Spurs to the title. James played well overall in the finals but Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh were unable to score consistently and the point guard pair of Mario Chalmers and Norris Cole underperformed. Bosh hit six of 14 shots for 13 points on Sunday, while Wade totaled 11 points on four of 12 shooting. 'They're that good,' Bosh said of the Spurs. 'I thought we'd get over the hump and we never did. They dominated us in this series, frankly speaking, and they deserve everything that they got.' The Heat's 'Big Three' - James, Wade and Bosh - are all eligible to become free agents in the offseason, and, despite winning the Eastern Conference in each of their four seasons together, it is uncertain if they will return.","San Antonio Spurs sealed a 4-1 NBA Finals series win over Miami Heat .

"Eight months since qualification and Steven Gerrard feels England are ready. ‘It’s time to walk the walk,’ says the captain, game-face on, at ease with his leadership responsibilities. There will be butterflies in the bellies in the dressing room in Manaus. Young players at their first World Cup like Jordan Henderson will look up, see Gerrard and feel better that he is the man who will lead them on to the pitch. ‘It is here now,’ said Gerrard. ‘All the distances and the miles we have covered, the heat preparation, we’ve done all that. There are no excuses now. It is time to walk the walk. In every tournament, the FA leave the players with no excuses and maybe it’s 99.9 per cent right. This time they’ve put everything in place and done everything possible for the players to perform. VIDEO Scroll down for Gerrard: We're not concerned about the state of the pitch . Time to perform: Steven Gerrard says there will be no excuses for England when they face Italy on Saturday night . Talking tactics: Roy Hodgson and Gerrard investigate the pitch in Manaus ahead of the game . ‘When the whistle goes against Italy, you are on your own. You are with your team, your squad, and you have to have belief in what we are going into the tournament with. I think we are in a good place.’ The six months since the draw, which threw England into Group D with Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica, have been encouraging. Italy have not won a game and Uruguay’s Luis Suarez has had knee surgery. And Roy Hodgson’s team has evolved, refreshed with youngsters. No 1 goalkeeper Joe Hart reclaimed his place at Manchester City and centre forward Daniel Sturridge has been prolific. ‘This is the most difficult and the most pressurised stage to deliver on, both personally and as a group,’ said  Gerrard. ‘It is all right having all the ability and talent, but it is also being cute, clever and having that knowledge of how to beat these sides. ‘Everyone has a good blend of players, everyone will think they’ve prepared right and then it boils down to who wants it the most; who gets the small details right; who has that bit of luck. ‘Are we going to be lucky? Will the small details and the referee decisions go our way? We will have to wait and see. All we can control we have done. It is not just about the 11. A lot of things around can be big factors. We have a good staff, it’s like a tree with Roy and Ray Lewington at the top and down to the pillars in the dressing room, experienced players who have been there. Relief: The England squad, including Danny Welbeck, train on Friday night in the north of Brazil . Pivotal: But Gerrard conceded that the 'fearless' England youngsters will need guidance . ‘No doubt about it, these young lads are going to need a bit of guidance. ‘There will be times when they help us with a bit of energy or legs or a sprint back and that is why it becomes so important that everyone pulls together. ‘The confidence and belief we would get if we do get the right result could be massive. We have to be clever and cute. People talk about playing the Liverpool way, but to go to Manaus and play the Liverpool way may not be possible. ‘We have a game plan to attack with confidence and belief. One of Roy’s main strengths is having a team that is well organised. That will never change, but it is the players’ responsibility to get the transition right; when to be bold and brave and attack and go for the jugular and when to stick together.’ It is 40 days since Liverpool’s title bid unravelled at Crystal Palace. A week earlier, it was Gerrard’s slip which allowed Demba Ba to put Chelsea on course for a victory which would change the destiny of the title. ‘What happened against Chelsea was a setback for me,’ said Gerrard. ‘But when you play at the top you’re under pressure every game. I am going to make a big mistake from time to time. I am human. I am normal. Pride: Gerrard says he has gotten over his Premier League heartbreak with Liverpool weeks ago . Team spirit: The England players have prepared well for their game, which will be hot and humid . ‘I haven’t been too hard on myself. It drove me mad for a few nights. ‘I would rather be in the position to  be shot down than be underneath the level of the Premier League and international football. I would much rather be out there and take the responsibility. ‘I’ve moved on. I’m in a great place mentally and physically. I feel strong and I believe I can perform. My form over the whole season got stronger and stronger. Certainly when I moved back into the controlling role it’s been up there with some of the best football I’ve played.’ Gerrard will win his 112th cap against Italy and can break David Beckham’s record of 115 appearances as England’s most-capped outfield player — if they make it into the knock-out rounds. ‘From an international point of view, this is the pinnacle but I would be very selfish if I was sitting here thinking about my own caps rather than how the team is going to perform,’ he added. ‘I will probably say something in the dressing room. It will be a message to say, let’s not have any regrets. Let’s relax and let it happen.’","Gerrard says the FA have left the England players with no excuses .

"The casket of St. Louis Cardinals player Oscar Taveras was carried by mourners during his Monday funeral in the Dominican Republic's Puerto Plata, photos reveal. Less than a year after making his Major League Baseball debut, Taveras died in a car crash. As the casket was led through a doorway by pallbearers, many mourners were seen documenting the procession with their phones. Several others were photographed placing their hands on the coffin. Scroll down for video . Remembered: Mourners are seen carrying the casket of Oscar Taveras on Monday. Members of the St. Louis Cardinals organization are expected to attend a burial on Tuesday . Accident: Taveras died Sunday, less than a year after he made his Major League debut with the St. Louis Cardinals . Funeral: Mourners are seen placing their  hands on Taveras' casket in Puerto Plata on Monday . Gone too soon:  Taveras, pictured in May 2014, was killed in the crash alongside his 18-year-old girlfriend Edilia Arvelo . The 22-year-old slugger's death was confirmed by his agent and newspapers in his native Dominican Republic, after he was involved in a traffic accident there on Sunday. 'He wasn't carrying documents at the time of the accident, but his body was identified by family members,' Col. Diego Pesqueira of the Metropolitan Transportation Agency said of Taveras. Taveras was driving a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro at the time of the accident on a highway between the beaches of Sosua and Cabarete in Puerto Plata, about 215 miles north of the capital of Santo Domingo. Edilia Arvelo, Taveras' 18-year-old girlfriend, also died in the crash. A funeral for Arvelo was held Monday in her hometown of Moca. Their bodies have been transported from where the funeral was held in Sosua to Santo Domingo's National Institute of Forensic Science, Fox News Latino reported. St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Matheny, general manager John Mozeliak and pitcher Carlos Martinez were part of a group from the organization with plans to attend a private burial service Tuesday in Taveras' country. 'I was asked last night to give some words regarding the tragic death of Oscar Taveras, but I just simply couldn't,' Matheny said Monday in a statement. 'To say this is a horrible loss of a life ended too soon would be an understatement.' Taveras was a teenager when he signed with St. Louis as an international free agent in 2008. He was regarded as one of baseball's top prospects and homered in his major league debut May 31. He also had a big solo drive in the seventh inning of Game 2 in the NL Championship Series against San Francisco. Promising: Taveras, seen October 12,  was regarded as one of baseball's top prospects and homered in his major league debut May 31 . Crash: Taveras and his girlfriend were in this 2014 Chevrolet Camaro . Hope: The Cardinals had just finalized plans for Taveras to spend most of November at the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida, and then head to the Dominican Winter League . 'He was someone that became an identity of our organization to some degree,' Mozeliak said in a conference call with St. Louis media before a visitation Monday night. 'When you think about how much has been written about him and how much has been talked about him, he never truly got a chance to show it at the major league level.' Mozeliak said he took a connecting flight from Miami with Taveras' father. 'Clearly, he was shaken by these events,' the GM said. Highway police spokesman Col. Diego Pesqueira said the road was wet from a recent rain but the cause of the crash is under investigation. An autopsy was done Monday but results weren't available. Moises Rodriguez, the international scouting director for the Cardinals, called Mozeliak with the news Sunday night. 'My very first thought was ""Is this true? Is this possible?""' Mozeliak said. 'I simply can't believe it,' he earlier said in a release. 'I first met Oscar when he was 16 years old and will forever remember him as a wonderful young man who was a gifted athlete with an infectious love for life who lived every day to the fullest.' Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. said the organization was 'stunned and deeply saddened' by Taveras' death. 'Oscar was an amazing talent with a bright future who was taken from us well before his time,' DeWitt said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends tonight.' 'All of us throughout Major League Baseball are in mourning this evening,' baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a Sunday release. 'Oscar, a young member of the baseball family, was full of promise and at the dawn of a wonderful career in our game, evident in his game-tying home run against the Giants exactly two weeks ago.' The Cardinals had just finalized plans for Taveras to spend most of November at the team's spring training facility in Jupiter, Florida, and then head to the Dominican Winter League. Taveras lost the regular right fielder job to fellow rookie Randal Grichuk, but that did not diminish the organization's long-term view that Taveras could be a star. Taveras hit .239 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 80 games in his only season in the majors. 'In my opinion, the word ""love"" is the most misused, and misunderstood word in the English language. It is not popular for men to use this word, and even less popular for athletes,' Matheny said in the Monday statement. 'But, there is not a more accurate word for how a group of men share a deep and genuine concern for each other. We loved Oscar, and he loved us. That is what a team does, that is what a family does. You will be missed, Oscar.' Matheny was a catcher for the Cardinals when pitcher Darryl Kile died of a heart problem in June 2002. St. Louis also lost Josh Hancock in a fatal car crash in April 2007. Each of those deaths occurred during the season, but the accident for Taveras happened with his teammates at home after losing to San Francisco in the NL Championship Series. Many of them took to Twitter to express their condolences. 'Absolute tragedy,' teammate Matt Carpenter tweeted after hearing the news. 'My prayers go out to Oscar [Taveras'] family.' 'We mourn the passing of Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras,' the MLB also tweeted. 'Last 30 minutes I've been sick to my stomach. Keep thinking about Oscar's big smile in the dugout whenever we made a big play/got a big hit,' All-Star reliever Pat Neshek posted Sunday night.","The 22-year-old died Sunday in a car crash in his native Dominican Republic .

"A Christian pastor has pledged to love his children regardless of their sexuality. Father-of-two John Pavlovitz had led his congregation at North Wake House Church, North Carolina, for 18 years. Now, in a controversial move that has shocked many Christians, he has outlined a four-part promise to embrace his children - Noah and Selah - if they come out. Pledge: John Pavlovitz, pictured with his wife Jennifer, daughter Selah and son Noah, is a pastor of 18 years from North Carolina and vows to love both his children whether they are gay or straight . In the blog post that has gone viral, he stipulates four promises: to be open about it, to pray for them, to love them, and to accept them as they are. He writes: 'If I have gay children, you'll all know it', adding that they won't be 'the best kept secret' in his family. In the second promise, to 'pray for them', he explains: 'I won't pray that God will heal or change or fix them. 'I will pray for God to protect them; from the ignorance and hatred and violence that the world will throw at them, simply because of who they are.' 'Above all,' he adds, 'I'll pray to God that my children won't allow the unGodly treatment they might receive from some of His misguided children, to keep them from pursuing Him.' Thirdly, he will love them - clarifying that he will not love them despite their sexuality or because of it. 'I don't mean some token, distant, tolerant love that stays at a safe arm's length. It will be an extravagant, open-hearted, unapologetic, lavish, embarrassing-them-in-the-school cafeteria, kind of love. Acceptance: He says if one or both children come out to him, he won't pray that God will 'fix' them . Love: Pavlovitz, pictured with his son Noah, says he will not love them because of or despite their sexuality . 'If they're gay, they are already': Pavlovitz, pictured with his daughter Selah, has divided opinion among his readers with his analysis of Psalm 139 which says God 'stitched them together in their mother's womb' 'They'll never doubt for a second whether or not their Daddy is over-the-moon crazy about them.' He ends by explaining that he will accept them as they are because 'if my kids are going to be gay, well they pretty much already are.' He quotes Psalm 139, which says that God 'stitched them together in their mother's womb', by way of explaining: 'I don't believe there's some magical expiration date approaching, by which time she and I need to somehow do, or say, or pray just the right things to get them to ""turn straight"", or forever lose them to the other side. 'They are today, simply a younger version of who they will be -- and today they're pretty darn great.' Pre-empting backlash, Pavlovitz, who is pictured with his wife Jennifer and two children, concludes his blog with a message to his religious readers. Protective: He said Noah and Selah may doubt many things but they will never doubt his love for them . He writes: 'Many of you may be offended by all of this, I fully realize. I know this may be especially true if you are a religious person -- one who finds the whole topic disgusting or unpleasant. 'If you're a parent, I don't know how you'll respond if you find out your children are gay, but I pray you consider it. 'If that day should ever come for me -- if my children should ever come out to me -- this is the Dad I hope I'll be to them.' The post amassed more than 2,000 comments in just a few days, with both gushing praise and damning abuse. One reader wrote: 'This is beautiful! I was smiling as I read the entire post.' However, another said: 'I find this extremely sad. How can a supposed pastor glorify sinful behavior?'","John Pavlovitz, a North Carolina pastor, has a young son and daughter .

"It’s the Australian state that is often overlooked, left off maps and even this year omitted from the national Commonwealth Games sports kit. But little old Tasmania is now outshining the rest of Australia when it comes to being a recommended tourist destination. The home of the Tasmanian Devil has made it into travel guide Lonely Planet’s 'Top 10 Regions to visit in 2015' list thanks to its fine food and stunning outdoors, with almost 1.6 million people already visiting its shores in the last year. 'The visitor numbers are now pretty much double the population of the state,' a Discover Tasmania spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Hobart, the waterfront capital and most populous city is Tasmania, was described by Lonely Planet as 'super-cool' The Bay of Fires, in the Bay of Fires Conservation Area on the northeastern coast of Tasmania, is a beauitful region of white beaches, blue water and orange-hued granite . The bay at Bishop Mountain, in Maria Island National Park, Tasmania, is a natural beauty . The Ben Lomond mountain is dominated by an alpine plateau over 1500 metres high, it is the main destination for downhill skiing in Tasmania. The windy road to the top is know as Jacob's Ladder . Hop 240 kilometres across the Bass Strait from the south of the Australian continent to the 26th largest island in the world and you will discover historic gems like more than half of Australia’s World Heritage Listed Convict Sites. Tassie is also home to the oldest Catholic Church in use in Australia, St John’s Roman Catholic Church in Richmond, and the oldest bridge in use in the country – the historic Richmond Bridge. Lonely Planet compared areas from around the globe and placed Tasmania fourth, recommending travellers visit Hobart's Museum of Old and New Art and an extension of the Three Capes Track in the state's southeast - due for completion in the new year and offering walkers a ‘stunning’ view of sea cliffs in the Tasman National Park. ‘Modern Tasmania has adopted a fresh, hip and inclusive attitude sparked by the brilliant revival of its now super-cool waterfront capital, Hobart, and the development of an eclectic year-long events calendar,’ Lonely Planet's Chris Zeiher wrote. He called the food scene a ‘gourmet's paradise’ and said Tasmania has emerged from its humble convict origins to become a ‘wild and dramatic, cultured and quirky, isolated yet accessible’ travel destination. Port Arthur penal settlement was established in 1830 and is an important part of Australia's convict history . Cape Tourville is the home of an unmanned, automatic light, lighthouse built in 1971 . The Freycinet Peninsula is bathed in stunning light in the late afternoon. Almost 1.6 million people visited its shores in the last year . Richmond Bridge is a heritage listed arch bridge, 25 kilometres north of Hobart in Tasmania . Richmond Bridge is the oldest bridge still in use in Australia and was constructed using convict labour until completion in 1825 . One of Tasmania's top tourist destinations is the world's steepest railway - the west coast wilderness railway . Visitors can witness stunning painted cliffs on Maria Island, a mountainous island off the east coast of Tasmania . Launceston is Tasmania's only inland city but is still surrounded by rolling hills and the River Tamar . The Museum of Old and New Art (MONA) is an art museum located within the Moorilla winery, in Hobart. MONA is the largest privately funded museum in Australia and draws huge crowds . Many of the first convicts in Tasmania lived in Port Arthur on the Tasman Peninsula . Lake Elysia near Cradle Mountain, in the Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, is one of the principal tourist sites in Tasmania, owing to its natural beauty . Discover Tasmania issued a comedy apology to the rest of Australia when the result was announced, saying Tassie should have in fact come number one. Their reasoning is that their ‘culinary delights are the pride of the state and the envy of others, with the majority of our food bred, grown or caught within an oyster shell throw of where it’s prepared and served’. ‘Not to be outdone our beers, ciders, whiskeys and wines are among the world’s finest. Sure, having the world’s purest water helps and is perhaps why one of our whiskies was named best in the world. ‘And while we’re not necessarily famous for our weather (beautiful one day, even more beautiful the next), it does attract some of the greatest wine makers on earth,’ they added. The blog post described how in Tasmania you can find four of the 7 Great Walks of Australia and ‘in our seas, the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies (IMAS) recently reported an influx of NSW octopuses travelling down to make love here rather than “doing it” in their own backyard.’ Almost 45 per cent of Tasmania is part of a reserve, national park or World Heritage Site. On Tasmania's west coast you will find Sarah Island, which is home to Macquarie Harbour Penal Station, a former British colonial penal settlemen . St. John's Roman Catholic Church, in Richmond is the oldest Catholic church still in use in Australia . The Mersey Bluff Lighthouse, in Devonport, was built in 1889 and looks stunning at sunset . Gordon River Dam and Lake Gordon in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park is simply breathtaking . Red lichen on rocks stand out in The Hazards and Coles Bay, in Freycinet National Park . The River Derwent near New Norfolk is a popular place to take a boat trip . The Beowulf climb at Coles Bay is popular with thrill seekers and adventurers . A man rides a horse along the peaceful beach at Frederick Henry Bay, Tasmania . Liffey Falls (left) is a series of four distinct tiered–cascade waterfalls on the Liffey River, is located in the Midlands region of Tasmania. Horseshoe Falls (right), meanwhile, is located in the Central Highlands region of Tasmania . Montezuma Falls is a temperate rainforest waterfall in the western region of Tasmania . Ruins of an old convict penal settlement still stand on Sarah Island in Maquarie Harbour, Strahan . Before the island broke away from mainland Australia 10,000 years ago it had already been inhabited by Tasmanian Aborigines for around 25,000 years. The first European to site the state was Dutch man Abel Tasman on November 24 1642 and early settlers were mostly convicts and their military guards. They were given the job of developing agriculture on the island and other industries. Discover Tasmania, the state's official tourism board, recommends the following four beaches as the best on the Apple Isle. 1. Wineglass Bay . 2. The Bay of Fires . 3. Friendly Beaches, Freycinet . 4. Shoal Bay, Maria Island . Many of the convicts lived in Port Arthur on the Tasman Peninsula and the area has now become Tasmania’s most popular tourist destination. However, in 1996 the site was marred by tragedy when it became the scene of the worst mass murder event in the English-speaking world, 35 people were killed and 23 were wounded when 28-year-old Hobart resident Martin Bryant opened fire. As well as the beautiful main island of Tasmania there are 334 surrounding islands, including those given female names such as Maria Island and Sarah Island. Tasmania is no stranger to the Lonely Planet guide. Hobart was named a top-10 city in 2013 and the east coast Bay of Fires was a top-10 region in 2009. It is Australia's only listing in the latest publication, and the Tasmanian government says the island state is punching above its weight and well on track to its goal of attracting 1.5 million visitors a year by 2020. Hundreds of regions were nominated for the Lonely Planet listing before a panel of in-house travel experts scored each on a criteria of topicality, excitement, value and ‘that special X-factor’. The title also lists its top-10 countries to visit in 2015: Singapore, Namibia, Lithuania, Nicaragua, Ireland, Republic of Congo, Serbia, The Philippines, St Lucia, and Morocco. The top-10 cities for 2015 are: Washington, DC; El Chalten, Argentina; Milan, Italy; Zermatt, Switzerland; Valletta, Malta; Plovdiv, Bulgaria; Salisbury, UK; Vienna, Austria; Chennai, India; and Toronto, Canada.

"The French interior minister has been accused of ordering police to remove tramps and gypsies from his neighbourhood 'so his wife can shop in peace'. Manuel Valls, 50, reportedly told officers to show 'zero tolerance' in evicting homeless people from the stylish district around the Place de la Bastille near his home in Paris. According to a satirical weekly, Le Canard Enchaîné, Mr Valls ordered the clean-up at the request of his glamorous wife, Anne Gravoin, after she allegedly complained of being accosted by a drunken down-and-out on a trip to supermarket. Elegant couple: Manuel Valls reportedly cracked down on the homeless people in his area after one accosted wife Anne Gravoin . On watch: Officers have now been stationed around the fashionable area near the Place de la Bastille, pictured, and are constantly moving on tramps and gypsies . Officers have now been stationed outside the Franprix store, and managers told the magazine police had now been outside for two weeks, moving loiterers on. Yesterday, Mr Valls said 'categorically' denied he was behind the police clean-up operation, saying the claims were 'unfounded', according to the Daily Telegraph. Paris police said the forceful approach was in response to complaints by right-wing politicians and petitions from residents over the past three months. But local officers reportedly said the move came 'because Madame Valls was very shocked by women begging with their babies. It was a humanitarian response.' Ms Gravoin, a classically trained . violinist, is no stranger to controversy. She was criticised in August . after saying of prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault’s wife Brigitte: 'It has . to be said that a musician is a little more glamorous than Mrs Ayrault, a . German teacher from the suburbs of Nantes!' Raids on Roma: Mr Valls previously expelled hundreds of gypsies from camps in the Parisian suburb of Evry, where he was mayor . She is said to regularly accompany first . lady Valerie Trierweile 'to choose dresses and outfits in the capital’s . top fashion stores.' This is not the first time her husband's heavy-handed treatment of gypsies on his own doorstep has come under scrutiny. In August, the minister ordered police to destroy a Roma camp in his political powerbase and to deport illegal immigrants living there. Officers armed with truncheons and shields moved into the settlement in the Paris suburb of Evry, where Mr Valls was mayor for 11 years from 2001. He was said to have acted because the camp was 'dangerously close to a commuter railway line' and could create public health problems. 'Not involved': Mr Valls is famous for his tough approach to down-and-outs in Evry, pictured, but he 'categorically' denied he was behind the latest police clean-up operation . Police arrived at 5am, and by 7am, young children could be seen dragging suitcases, bags and bicycles away from the site. More than 70 people were evicted from caravans and makeshift huts, with most expected to be returned to Romania. The raid was said to show that the Socialist firebrand was determined to ‘clean up illegal immigrants in his own back yard’, according to a party colleague. The source added: 'By breaking up a camp in his constituency he is showing he means business.’ Mr Valls said the camps were a ‘challenge’ to ‘people living together’ and insisted the police would uphold all court orders aimed at dismantling them. His tough stance on crime and illegal gypsy camps has seen him nicknamed the 'Nicolas Sarkozy of the Left'. Familiar approach: Mr Valls has been nicknamed the 'Nicolas Sarkozy of the Left' because of the former president's similar hardline stance on gypsies . Mr Sarkozy started a purge on Romas in the summer of 2010, pointing to the fact that up to 15,000 were living in camps across France, and proposing that police go to Romania to fight trafficking and other crime. Roma groups accused Mr Sarkozy of ‘ethnic cleansing’, pointing to the fact that gipsies had been targeted by the Nazis during the Second World War. Mr Valls is currently the most popular politician in France, with a 75 per cent approval rate, according to Ifop. Shortly before tackling the suburb of Evry, he ordered the destruction of numerous Roma camps across France, with sites broken up in Lille, Lyon and Marseilles, as well as Paris.","Anne Gravoin was reportedly confronted by drunk down-and-out in street .

"An 18-year-old trainee nurse died on a hen party when a lorry driver smashed into their coach which was travelling at just 5mph on a motorway, a court has heard. Bethany Jones was with a group of 20 women on their way to Liverpool when their coach was hit on the M62 in West Yorkshire by an articulated vehicle. Lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, 45, from Merseyside, denies causing death by dangerous driving and went on trial today at Leeds Crown Court. Bethany Jones, 18, (left) died  on a hen party when lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, 45, (right) smashed into their coach which was travelling at just 5mph on a motorway, Leeds Crown Court heard . Bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, was among the 21 people seriously injured in the crash, including Miss Jones's mother and sister. The minibus was either stationary or travelling at no more than 5mph when it was hit just after junction 32, near Pontefract, due to a problem with the vehicle's clutch, a jury was told. But Brian Cox QC, prosecuting, told the court that Ollerhead 'took no significant avoiding action by breaking or speeding' to avoid the collision, and 'if he had braked at all he did so at the last second'. Other vehicles avoided colliding with the coach but Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus. Mr Cox QC said: 'The defendant simply failed to act. The collision was avoidable had he observed and reacted to the coach. The minibus was either stationary or travelling at no more than 5mph when it was hit just after junction 32 on the M62, near Pontefract, West Yorkshire . Bride-to-be Stephanie Firth (left) was among the 21 people who were seriously injured. Minibus driver James Johnson, 62 (right) has already pleaded guilty to death by dangerous driving . 'He was driving a large articulated truck in a lane of traffic on a motorway and the standard of care he demonstrated was far below someone in his position. 'He can't have been paying attention and taking steps to avoid a collision by simply driving into the rear of the coach without breaking. 'The journey in fact ended abruptly in a tragic collision close to junction 32 on the M62.' The coach driver, James Johnson, 64, from Bradford, pleaded guilty to causing Miss Jones's death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing, the jury heard. His 24-seat Mercedes minibus began showing signs of mechanical error just minutes into the hen party journey on April 26 last year. Other vehicles avoided colliding with the coach but Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus . Mourners at the funeral of Miss Jones from South Elmsall, who was killed on April 26 last year . 'Before reaching the A1, the coach showed signs of mechanical failure, so much so that a number of passengers on the coach called on the driver to investigate the problem,' said Mr Cox. 'There was a smell of burning and in fact the coach had a badly burnt out clutch.' Miss Jones died after suffering multiple injuries and all of the other passengers on the coach, who were from the Pontefract area, were injured, some severely. The prosecution argued that both the coach driver and lorry driver are to blame for the young woman's death. Mr Cox said: 'James Johnson, the coach driver, has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. Indeed, the prosecution submit his driving was a substantial cause of the accident but it was not the sole cause. 'An additional and significant cause of the accident was Kevin Ollerhead's driving, which, submit the prosecution, fell far short, far below, the standard to be expected of a competent and careful driver. 'He too is guilty of causing death by dangerous driving and he too bears some responsibility for what occurred.' The jury was told that Ollerhead gave a statement to police in which he said he could not recall braking or steering but there was nothing he could have done to avoid the collision. Johnson will be sentenced following Ollerhead's trial, which is expected to last ten days.

"A high school senior in Duluth, Georgia will not graduate this year after being put on suspension for hugging a teacher. Gwinnett Public School District officials say the move was sexual harassment, but 17-year-old Duluth High School student Sam McNair says he was just trying to comfort the female teacher and that he comes from a family of 'huggers'. 'Something so innocent can be perceived as something totally opposite,' McNair told CBS Atlanta. His mother also says the suspension cold also cost him an athletic college scholarship. Sexual harasser? 17-year-old Sam McNair was suspended for an entire year after violating his school's sexual harassment policy by hugging a teacher. He is a senior and won't graduate on time unless the suspension is overturned . The teacher says she warned McNair that hugging was inappropriate and that the hug was more than just a hug - that McNair also kissed her. The unwelcome embrace was caught on one of the school's cameras and shows McNair hugging the teacher from behind, and resting his head on her shoulder. Evidence: McNair was caught on one of the school's cameras hugging the teacher from behind . Too close for comfort: In the disciplinary report, the teacher wrote that she could feel McNair's cheeks and lips touch her neck . Don't stand so close to me: The teacher is clearly not happy with the embrace, as she pushes McNair away . In the discipline report, the teacher says McNair's cheeks and lips touched her neck. McNair denies kissing the teacher, and says he didn't know it was against the school's  rules on sexual harassment to hug a teacher. He says he's hugged other teachers before - including the teacher in question. Mother April McNair says she should have at least been notified of the problem before a disciplinary action was taken that jeopardized her son's future. Should have been warned: Sam's mother April McNair is not happy she wasn't informed about the hugging problem before her son was given such a long suspension . 'He's a senior he plays football and was getting ready for lacrosse and you're stripping him of even getting a full scholarship for athletics for college,' she said. According to officials, Ms McNair can appeal the suspension to the school board. They would not respond to questions about the case directly, but issued a statement saying 'hearing officers consider witness testimony, a review of the known facts, and a student's past disciplinary hearing...when determining consequences.' While McNair does have a disciplinary record, none of his prior actions involved sexual assault.","Sam McNair, 17, was recently put on suspension for the rest of the school year for hugging a teacher .

"Bare legs are a badge of honour in the cycling world – a sign that you have finally joined the ranks of elite bikers. Until now it wasn't known whether shaving your calves really made you any more of a contender for the Tour de France. But a recent study has found that, far from being a bizarre trend, there may be a scientific basis to picking up the razor before cycling. Scroll down for video . A recent study has found that, far from being a bizarre trend, there may be a scientific basis to picking up the razor before cycling. Earlier this year, California-based manufacturer, Specialised Bicycle Components, posted a video claiming that shaving legs could reduce drag by seven per cent. That means a cyclist can exert 15 watts less power and still go at the same speed. The saving is equivalent to changing from a round-tube frame to an aero-style one. ‘We were shocked,’ Mark Cote, who heads aerodynamics at the firm, toldOutside magazine. ‘The numbers dropped so much it set my b******* meter off. I had to immediately check the equipment to make sure it was real.’ Doctors have reported a sharp rise in the number of men wanting cosmetic treatment to have unsightly thread veins removed from their legs. In the three months following Bradley Wiggins’ Tour De France victory in July, 10,000 new members joined Cycling UK, donned their lycra and took to the roads. However, many also decided to replicate their cycling heroes by shaving their legs. These unsuspecting men were surprised to discover red and blue thread veins previously hidden by the hairs on their legs. Thread veins are typically thin spidery veins which are prominent and can be unsightly. Dr Peter Finigan, specialist thread vein practitioner at Dr Newmans Clinic, a nationwide doctor-led consultancy which specialises solely in removing thread veins, has treated more than 50 male cyclists since September 2012 at his practice in Manchester. The reports emerged not long after doctors noted a sharp rise in the number of men requesting cosmetic treatment to reduce the effect of 'drinker’s nose' - unsightly thread veins on the face often blamed on heavy drinking. The experiment began when pro-triathlete Jesse Thomas showed up for a tunnel testing session with very hairy legs. His legs were so hairy, that the Specialised Bicycle team placed him on the high-end of something they called the ‘Chewbacca Scale.’ As a joke, he decided to shave his legs and see how much time it knocked off during his tests in the wind tunnel. ‘For me, a half Ironman is a four-hour race, and the winning margin can often be less than a minute, even 30 seconds,’ Mr Thomas told Jason Gay at Wall Street Journal. ‘If you can find something that shaved 15 seconds or 30 seconds - or maybe a minute or two - is huge.’ The experiment began when pro-triathlete Jesse Thomas (pictured) showed up for a tunnel testing session .

"Instead of wearing an old ripped shirt and a bit of fake blood this Hallowe'en, Rob Cockerham decided to wear a classier breed of costume. So the Sacramento, California, resident painstakingly recreated Downton Abbey itself for this year's fright-fest and documented the whole process on his website. Starting with foam board, Cockerham covered it in printed photos of Highclere Castle, the 5,000-acre, Jacobethan-style country house estate, situated in Hampshire - the setting for all five series of the popular ITV period drama. Elegant couture: Rob Cockerham painstakingly recreated Downton Abbey itself for his Hallowe'en costume . What would Lady Grantham make of it? He covered foam board in printed photos of Highclere Castle, the 5,000-acre, Jacobethan-style country house estate, situated in Hampshire . Once he had an entire wall printed and cut, he used spray glue to stick the printouts in place. The centre tower was big enough for Mr Cockerham's head, but not his arms. So, he cut out arch-shaped holes on the sides and, after the printouts were glued to the boards, all the sixteen sides of four corner towers parts - complete with quarter-inch foam brackets - started to come together. Rob says: 'Each of the exterior walls was almost four feet across, so I had to figure out a way to get this costume into a vehicle and through doorways. The answer was to assemble the costume with hinges at each corner. This would allow the costume to fold into a long diamond shape.' Once he had an entire wall printed and cut, Mr Cockerham used spray glue to stick the printouts in place . Innovative design: He assembled the costume with hinges at each corner, so he could get through doorways and into a car . Magical: Last year Mr Cockerham recreated the entirety of Disneyland for his Hallowe'en costume . Previous effort: One year Mr Cockerham enjoyed Hallowe'en as a tornado . He added: 'I considered a few different hinge designs, but settled on a length of corrugated plastic, slit down one side. This material is ideal for hot gluing, and it is super-strong. 'I looked around after the hinges were in place and realized I was finished! Somehow I convinced my kids to resist vaulting the castle walls. 'I straightened the top spikes, added a couple of PVC pipe cross-braces and I was done! The Downton Abbey costume was ready to wear!.'","Rob Cockerham recreated the country house featured in hit ITV show .

"Roy Keane batted off questions from the media regarding the furore which engulfed the camp on Wednesday last week after police were called to the team hotel in Portmarnock following an alleged altercation with another man. Speaking to the assembled press at the same venue for the first time since the incident, Keane's response when asked if he was prepared to discuss what happened, was: 'No, I'm not.' The Republic of Ireland assistant coach insisted the incident would not change his or the squad's routine before big games in the future.

'We were out last night for a meal, it was fine,' before adding with a flicker of a smile: ""We're not One Direction."" Wearing the same frown he adopted when confronted on the sideline at Celtic Park by match referee Milorad Mazic during Friday night's feisty 1-0 Group D defeat in Glasgow, he was similarly taciturn when asked if the publicity had proved a distraction. He said: 'No.' Shaun Maloney's wonders strike proved decisive as Scotland claimed a 1-0 victory at Celtic Park . Although police attended, the Football Association of Ireland later insisted at Keane's request, no arrest was made nor complaint received. The 43-year-old, who was the centre of attention in the build-up to last month's qualifiers against Gibraltar and Germany because of the release of his updated autobiography, remains big news in Ireland, where his partnership with Martin O'Neill captured the imagination when it was announced a little more than a year ago.","Roy Keane refuses to discuss incident at team hotel where the Republic of Ireland assistant coach allegedly got into an altercation with a fan .

"Former Manchester United skipper Roy Keane has backed new manager Louis van Gaal to revive the club's fortunes. The Dutchman, currently in charge of his national team as they prepare for the World Cup finals in Brazil, is set to take over at Old Trafford on his return. He will face the task of revitalising a club which slipped from being Barclays Premier League champions to the relative backwaters of seventh place after a bruising campaign under Sir Alex Ferguson's replacement, David Moyes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Van Gaal talk of his pride to be United manager . On point: Roy Keane believes Louis van Gaal is the right appointment to turn Manchester United around . However, Keane is confident the hugely experienced Van Gaal will turn United around. Asked if the former Ajax and Barcelona manager is the right man for the job, he said: 'You hope so. 'He is obviously a top manager, lots of experience. His contract was up with the national team, so that fell into place nicely. 'Fingers crossed, he'll be a manager. It's been a tough season for United - fingers crossed he'll do the business. I'm pretty sure he will. Moyes lost his job last month after just 11 months in the position, with veteran midfielder Ryan Giggs taking over the reins for the final few weeks of a campaign which ended without a trophy or European football for next season. Van Gaal will preside over a significant rebuilding programme as he attempts to restore the club's fortunes, and Keane is sure he will get the backing he needs. He said: 'Of course it's a big job. They need some players - I've said they need five or six players. 'They will bounce back. They are Man United.' Jumping for joy: Former United captain Keane (left) believes Van Gaal will improve United next season . With United seemingly ready to invest heavily this summer, they are already being linked with a series of potential targets. The latest is Everton midfielder James McCarthy, who is not currently on duty with the Republic of Ireland as he nurses an ankle injury. McCarthy only joined the Toffees in a £13million from Wigan in September last year, and Keane, who has worked with him in his role as Martin O'Neill's number two since, suggested he may be happy where he is. On the move? Everton midfielder James McCarthy (right) has been linked with a move to United . He said: 'He's only been at Everton two minutes. He's obviously making good progress, but I'm pretty sure there will be lots of speculation about lots of players going to United. 'But James is at a good club in Everton, he has had a decent couple of seasons and if he keeps progressing, who knows?

"A Rangers shareholder has complained to financial regulators about investor Sandy Easdale and asked them to launch an investigation. The complaint follows comments made by Easdale on April 24 – the day before Rangers published their 120-day business review – when he described the financial position of the club as ‘fragile’. Mark Dingwall — a former chairman of the Rangers Supporters Trust — has now written to the London Stock Exchange, the Financial Conduct Authority and Daniel Stewart, the club’s nominated advisors in the City, to express concerns. Complaint: Sandy Easdale (left) watches Rangers in January with his brother James (right) The emails — seen by Sportsmail — ask each body to ‘investigate the possibility’ that Easdale ‘is acting as a shadow director of Rangers International Football Club plc and used knowledge derived from such a position to enrich himself via the buying of shares in the company’. Sandy Easdale is not a member of the plc board – unlike brother James – but is a director of the Rangers Football Club Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary company. The complainant states that Sandy Easdale has ‘apparent access’ to financial information from the plc and that he appeared to ‘have knowledge of the content of the commercially sensitive 120-day review prepared by the company’. Champions: Lee McCulloch lifts the Scottish League One trophy after Rangers' second successful promotion . Dingwall’s email continues: ‘On April 24 the share price was 26p. That day after he (Easdale) made his statement it fell to 22p. ‘Mr Easdale bought 57,043 shares at 23p on May 1. By May 8, the price had recovered to 27p. ‘It is also noteworthy that Mr Easdale holds the voting rights to, but does not own, shares representing a further 22.10 per cent of RIFC Plc. I believe that, if he does have privileged financial information, those shareholders he holds proxies for may also have access to it or otherwise benefit from that knowledge.’ Born again: Kenny Miller will begin his third spell at Rangers next season after re-signing with the Ibrox club . No comment was forthcoming last night from the Financial Conduct Authority, the London Stock Exchange or Daniel Stewart. Rangers declined to comment on the complaint. Last week, supporter coalition the Union of Fans issued a statement questioning whether chief executive Graham Wallace or Easdale held the true boardroom power inside Ibrox.

"Gwyneth's latest blog post on her lifestyle website Goop deals with 'perfection' From running a website advising fans on how to eat, think, work and dress, to falling out with Vanity Fair over an unapproved article, Gwyneth Paltrow is notorious for striving to be ‘perfect’. But it seems the 41-year-old may be thinking about relaxing a little. Becoming rather philosophical recently on her lifestyle blog Goop, the mother-of-two shared some thoughts with her fans about ‘perfection’. The . actress says: ‘Striving for achieving a sense of perfection has been a . misguided belief in my life, often leading me down the wrong path. ‘It . has made me, at times, place value on the wrong things. It has made me . not listen to my true self for fear that I would somehow fail in . another's eyes. I was curious as to how the idea of perfection has . become so pervasive in our society, how it begins, how it hurts us and . perhaps, even, if it carries a certain benefit.’ She . then poses the question; 'Where does this idea that we need to be perfect come . from? 'How can we come to terms with (and find the beauty in) imperfection?’ Guest posts from Dr. Brené Brown, Ph.D., LMSW, Susan McNary, . Ph.D., Dr. Jessica Zucker, Ph.D and Peter Sims on the issues surrounding . perfectionism and how a person can break free of it appear next to the actress's musings. Gwyneth, who is in the process of separating, or ‘consciously uncoupling’, from husband Chris Martin, has taken great pains to keep the pair's public image very positive. Whatever is going on behind the scenes, the only side presented to the media is one of happy, mature adults, with seemingly no ill-will toward each other, parting ways while remaining a united parenting team. The actress says: 'Striving for achieving a sense of perfection has been a misguided belief in my life, often leading me down the wrong path' Gwyneth, who is in the process of separating, or 'consciously uncoupling', from husband Chris Martin, has taken great pains to keep the pairs public image very positive . Their super-civilised split has reportedly been taken to a new level by hiring  an ‘emotional guru’ to help ease the pain of their split. Celebrity healer Vicky Vlachonis, 39, who claims she helped Princes William and Harry deal with the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death, is paying weekly 90-minute visits to Paltrow and Martin to administer a range  of wacky treatments – including a ‘Morning Glory’ ritual, salt-and-pepper baths, ‘Tibetan Rites’ and ‘positive self-affirmation’ chanting. However, this latest post on Goop may raise questions over whether the stunning actress is growing tired of always seeming so together and perfect. Gwyneth Paltrow suggested that even water has feelings in a post in June and encouraged her Goop readers to consider the impact that unkind words may have on its molecular structure. On her blog, Gwyneth cited the work of Messages From Water author Masuru Emoto, whose studies have involved talking, shouting and playing music to water to observe the effects.   Gwyneth wrote on Goop: ‘I am fascinated by the growing science behind the energy of consciousness and its effects on matter. ‘I have long had Dr. Emoto's coffee table book on how negativity changes the structure of water, how the molecules behave differently depending on the words or music being expressed around it.’ Japanese scientist Emoto’s hypothesis began with the belief that water adopts the ‘resonance’ of the energy around it, and that polluted water can be restored through prayers and positivity.However his findings have been widely dismissed by the scientific community for a lack of experimental rigour leaving the studies open to the influence of human error. In 2003, Emoto declined to take part in skeptic James Randi's One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge, which would have won him $1,000,000 had he been able to replicate the experiment under test conditions.","Actress shares her thoughts on 'perfection' on lifestyle website Goop .

"The RAC is to launch a device that will warn motorists about faults in their cars before they break down. The matchbox-sized device, called the RAC Advance, transmits data about the car before and after every journey by slotting slots into a car's computer system. The automated system means that . drivers then receive a phone call, text or email telling them there's a . fault with their car. Pioneering: The RAC Advance gathers data on a vehicle by slotting into a socket beside the steering column and using 3G technology . If the car breaks down or has an accident it will automatically alert an RAC breakdown team with the vehicle's location and details of the problem. The miniscule device slots into a scart socket beside the steering column, where mechanics and technicians connect diagnostic equipment. It can then detect engine and gearbox problems, monitor imminent battery failure, battery drain and alternator problems. The device also checks for brake wear, throttle problems and whether the diesel filters have become clogged. Motorsists will be able to access data on their car remotely, using a mobile, tablet or PC. The early warning system builds on current telematics technology that utilises 3G connectivity. Information: The device records information about the car's performance to RAC before and after every journey and will automatically alert RAC staff if the car breaks down with its location . Miniscule: The tiny device, which will be available to all RAC members in 2013, is only the size of a matchbox . If an RAC team is contacted with a problem they can access the onboard diagnostic software remotely to identify the fault. It will also act as an instant alert to the rescue service in the event of a serious accident - providing a record of time and location record for the motorist. All of the RAC's 1,700 patrol vehicles have already been fitted with first generation devices and more than 35,000 fleet vehicles in the UK are using it. The device will be available to RAC members during 2013, with its price added on to subscription charges. Quick response: When a customer breaks down RAC staff will be able to determine a vehicle's whereabouts and gather information about the problem before they respond . RAC technical director David Bizley said: 'Offering peace of mind in a box, RAC Advance will revolutionise how we deal with our members. 'Some breakdowns can be avoided with a preemptive warning and intervention and this will significantly advance how we are able to deal with a breakdown or accident. 'With an accurate fault diagnosis and vehicle location, our patrols will be able to reach members more quickly and where possible, prepared with appropriate replacement parts. 'Our promise is to be the motorist's champion and our aim is to make it easier, safer, and more affordable for our members to own and run a car.'","The RAC Advance transmits data about a car before and after every journey .

"Winning a referendum to stay in the European Union will be ‘very difficult’, Tony Blair has claimed. The former Labour prime minister said holding an in-out referendum in 2017 would be a ‘disaster’ for Britain. Speaking to French TV, Mr Blair said it would be a challenge to convince voters that remaining part of the EU was in British interests. Tony Blair told French TV he could not be certain that Britain would vote to stay in the European Union . David Cameron has vowed to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU before holding an in–out referendum in 2017. Labour leader Ed Miliband has refused to back a referendum – insisting Labour would only call a vote if there was a transfer of powers to Brussels. Mr Blair was asked by French TV reporters about Mr Cameron's battle with Brussels over the demand that Britain pays an extra £1.7billion by December 1. The former Labour leader said: ‘There have always been, including during my terms, disputes on Europe. ‘But what's different today is that if the Conservative Party is re–elected next year, there will be a referendum on whether to leave the European Union. ‘I think it would be a disaster for my country and I think that the people of Britain will vote to remain in the European Union in the end. But I think that it will be very difficult.’ European Commission new President Jean-Claude Juncker has revealed Mr Cameron has a 'problem' with other EU leaders . The chart shows the monstrous bill handed to the UK by the EU in comparison with other member states . Mr Blair said many people in the EU had mixed feelings about Europe. He said: ‘But the difference is that [they believe] one must reform Europe from within, not by threatening to leave. ‘That's the difference.’ Mr Blair said he believes that Mr Cameron wants to remain in the EU but that he ‘can't be certain’. Mr Cameron has insisted he wants Britain to remain in a reformed EU. However, he is facing pressure from Tory backbenchers to say that he will campaign to leave the EU if he is unable to secure major reforms to immigration rules within the bloc. David Cameron is facing a battle to keep Britain in the EU, the former Prime Minister Tony Blair has claimed . Mr Blair said: ‘I can't be certain but I think that he wants to remain in Europe. ‘But it is very difficult for him in his party, because the Conservative Party, many people within the party are Europhobic. ‘I think that when one is prime minister of a country like Great Britain one knows full well that it is intelligent to remain inside the biggest political union in the world and the biggest commercial market in the world.’ Mr Blair said Britain could only continue to compete with countries like China and the United States if it remained part of the EU.

"Gary Neville insists the England management are more than happy with Wayne Rooney's contribution at the World Cup so far. Rooney came under fire for a sub-par performance in Saturday's 2-1 defeat against Italy. Rooney set up Daniel Sturridge for England's equaliser, but he missed two good chances in the second half of the defeat in Manaus. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the England squad train ahead of the crucial Uruguay clash . Disappointing: Rooney has been widely criticised for his performance against Italy on Saturday . Very important: Gary Neville says that Rooney's displays in training prove how vital he is for Engalnd . Neville, a former team-mate of Rooney, claims the England hierarchy have had no complaints about the 28-year-old, who he believes is still an important part of the national side. 'My opinion is that Wayne Rooney, after seeing him every day in training, is a very important player,' said Neville, now an England coach. 'He is our top goal scorer under (manager) Roy (Hodgson), he is our main assist man and probably but for a yard he would have been man of the match if he had scored that goal (against Italy). 'We came off the pitch the other night and had our coaching debrief with Roy, Ray (Lewington), Dave (Watson) and myself and there was no other suggestion that Wayne Rooney had played pretty well for us in that game, that he had done everything we asked for.' Paul Scholes, a former team-mate of Rooney and Neville, sparked controversy when he suggested the England striker may be past his best.Â . Satisfied: Neville, Roy Hodgson and the England coaching staff agreed that Rooney had played 'pretty well' Assist: Rooney provided the cross for Daniel Sturridge's equalizing goal against Italy in Manaus . Neville refused to get drawn into a row with the former Manchester United and England midfielder. 'Paul is a great friend of mine but I am coaching Wayne Rooney, I am of the opinion that when you get to a player like Wayne Rooney, you have to cope with everything that is thrown your way,' Neville added on BBC Radio 5 Live. 'It wasn't just Paul Scholes talking about Wayne Rooney. The fact of the matter is that it is one man's opinion, it's Paul's opinion and everyone else will have their opinion.' Neville concurred with Hodgson's assertion that the nation has an 'obsession' with Rooney. Expected: Neville says that players of Rooney's calibre are used to criticism and it happens at every World Cup . Pressure: Players like Gascoigne (left) and Owen (right) are always highlighted in tournaments says Neville . 'You can call it a debate or an obsession (about Rooney),' he added. 'I don't think either are wrong because every time I have been part of a tournament I have seen this with a player, whether it be (Paul) Gascoigne, (Michael) Owen, (David) Beckham or Rooney.

"A 71-year-old terminally ill Darwin man has died in what has been described as a 'clear cut case of suicide' after appealing for euthanasia drugs over social media. Martin Burgess had been suffering from rectal cancer, which soon spread through the rest of his body, for three years before he took to Youtube to describe his agony. While Northern Territory police are investigating the death, according to the ABC, Exit International Founder Dr Philip Nitschke who helped Mr Burgess upload his plea for help on Youtube, told Daily Mail Australia that it was clear his internet call-out was anonymously answered. 71-year-old rectal cancer sufferer Martin Burgess was found dead in his Darwin home on Thursday . Left with a permanent colostomy bag, constant muscle tension and nausea, Mr Burgess described his pain as 'severe' and feeling like he 'had been kicked in the same spot for six weeks'. 'Not being able to exert myself in any way has led to boredom and a feeling of uselessness,' he said in a video uploaded to Youtube on August 21. Exit International Founder Dr Philip Nitschke described his death as a 'clear cut case of suicide' 'Waking up in the morning, even now, means the start of another day of pain, despair, nausea, loneliness, uselessness and sitting on the veranda wishing I was dead. Sadness is a constant companion, self-esteem is non-existent.' In a second video, uploaded on August 30, the former federal candidate for euthanasia read out his phone number and address while pleading with viewers to send him a euthanasia drug. 'I have approached Dignitas [an assisted dying organisation] in Switzerland and while I was medically accepted, the required paperwork was unavailable. And frankly I'd rather die here in Darwin in my own home than in a lingering death in palliative care.' 'If there is anybody out there who could provide, supply or sell me enough of the euthanasia drug…, so I could have this choice, I would be very grateful.' Mr Burgess was found dead in his home on Thursday by a friend who also found a note, according to Dr Nitschke. 'It was a short note that thanked the Exit organisation and Youtube and mentioned that he had the support he wanted at the end,' Dr Nitschke said. 'He also made a point in the note about the suffering he was going through and that he couldn't continue any longer – how taking his own life was a sensible option.' Dr Nitschke also mentioned that the cancer sufferer had been in happy spirits a week before his death 'because he had been successful with his appeal on the internet.' 'What that did to him is he felt that he had some option, and he was pleased to know he had this choice. Before that he felt he would only grow worse and worse and more vulnerable before being forced out of his own environment and into a hospice,' Dr Nitschke said. In a video uploaded to Youtube on August 30 Mr Burgess, a former federal candidate for euthanasia, read out his phone number and address while pleading with viewers to send him a euthanasia drug . Although Mr Burgess did not share his plan of suicide with him in his final days, Dr Nitschke described his death as a 'clear cut case of suicide' and compared it to the death of Perth man Laurie Strike. At 84 years of age and suffering from an inoperable melanoma, Mr Strike's Youtube plea for euthanasia drugs was successfully answered by someone from California who mailed the drugs to his home. He died 'peacefully' in April this year, according to Dr Nitschke. The Exit International founder said there have been at least four other such cases that he knows of across Australia, involving people who were far too sick to seek other methods of finding the drugs. However while suicide is not a crime anywhere in Australia, Dr Nitschke warns that anyone who helps a person with the act, 'even if they are doing it out of compassion and love' will find themselves in a 'legal nightmare'. Dr Nitschke said there has been at least four other cases of terminally ill Australians, who were hopeful of choosing when they end their life, successfully seeking euthanasia drugs over social media . At 84, after suffering from an inoperable melanoma, LaurieStrike's plea for euthanasia drugs was successfully answered by someone from California who mailed the drugs to his home before his death in April . Despite a short period of time in 1995 when euthanasia was legal in the Northern Territory, assisting someone with the act will now land someone a sentence of life imprisonment. The same goes for anyone helping someone commit suicide in Queensland and West Australia while New South Wales, South Australia and Tasmania have a maximum penalty of 12 years in jail. Victoria's maximum sentence for the crime is only five years. Dr Nitschke said that both he and Mr Burgess were campaigning to change these laws and the Exit organisation has been increasingly, both in Australia and overseas, 'making sure that people have access to drugs themselves' so that their loved ones can avoid trouble with the law.","Martin Burgess was diagnosed with rectal cancer three years ago .

"Louis van Gaal is putting his faith in German talent with his summer transfer targets – but should he be looking elsewhere? In terms of medals won by Premier League imports, German players have just 20, less than the likes of Serbia and Norway, and 83 less than runaway leaders France. The French boast 45 Premier League medals thanks to the efforts of the likes of Patrice Evra, Eric Cantona and Patrick Vieira. VIDEO Scroll down to watch van Gaal targets Schweinsteiger and Hummels in training .

Schweinsteiger (left) could be tempted to link up with Van Gaal at Old Trafford, but Thomas Muller (right) has signed a new contract with Bayern Munich . German imports have just four – and two of those belong to Robert Huth - with Michael Ballack and Jens Lehmann also contributing. Incoming Manchester United boss Van Gaal is chasing Germany’s World Cup duo of Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mats Hummels but might do better to look elsewhere, judging by the medals table. Players coming to the Premier League from so-called lesser countries, including Ireland, Wales, Norway and Serbia have all performed better in trophy-terms. And the Germans haven’t performed much better in England’s two major cup competitions either. Just seven can claim to be FA Cup winners, while six have won the League Cup. Only Ballack is able to boast a clean sweep of all three English domestic trophies from his time at Chelsea. Boost: German trio Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski won the FA Cup with Arsenal last month . Rare sight: German players including Michael Ballack (left) and Jens Lehmann (right) have won just 20 medals . Natural winners: French stars, including former Arsenal midfielder Patrick Vieira, have won 103 medals in England . And the table could have looked even worse had Frenchman Lauren Koscielny and Welshman Aaron Ramsey not dug Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski out of a hole at Wembley in May with their game-deciding goals Arsenal's FA Cup final victory. According to past successes, Van Gaal might be better of following the Alan Pardew route and investing in French talent.

"Peter Odemwingie has set his sights on a 'dream' showdown with Argentina after taking Nigeria to the brink of the World Cup second round. The 32-year-old Stoke striker's first-half goal saw the Nigerians past Group F rivals Bosnia and Herzegovina 1-0 in Cuiaba on Saturday evening and left them within a point of reaching the knockout stage. Odemwingie, who was used only as a substitute in the opening 0-0 draw with Iran, is hoping his efforts will help him retain his place for an eagerly-anticipated clash with Lionel Messi and company in Porto Alegre on Wednesday. Crucial: Peter Odemwingie celebrating his winning goal against Bosnia & Herzegovina on Saturday . Harmony: The Stoke forward celebrating the vital finish with his team-mates . Newborns: Odemwingie annonced on twitter that his goal celebration was dedicated to his children . He told www.fifa.com: 'I earned myself a starting position and it was important to work hard to keep it, especially before a big game like Argentina, which is a dream for every player to play in.' Should the Bosnians, the only team in the group which now have no chance of qualification, avoid defeat by Iran in Salvador, Nigeria would be through regardless of what they do after winning a game at the finals for the first time since 1998. Odemwingie said: 'I'm so happy for the country, our fans, the team. It was maybe one of the hardest three points in my career, though.' There were plenty of familiar faces for Odemwingie at the Arena Patanal, with former Lokomotiv Moscow team-mate Emir Spahic captaining Bosnia and current Britannia Stadium colleague Asmir Begovic between the posts.

However, the striker insisted inside knowledge did not come into play when he homed in on Begovic for what proved to be the game's decisive moment with 29 minutes played. Asked if he felt he had the upper hand, Odemwingie smiled as he said: 'No, I don't think so as saving shots from close distance is one of the stronger sides of his game. 'He is a great guy. He knows I have a good shot and I tried to shoot a few times. I'm sure he is going to tell me off when I get back to Stoke. 'I had to do it for my country but I was so happy to see him on this stage and I exchanged shirts with him at the end of the game.'","Odemwingie looking forward to Group F showdown with Argentina .

"Frank Gillespie has been revealed as the man who is said to have had a bust-up with Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane at Portmarnock Hotel and Golf Links in Dublin on Wednesday evening. Gillespie, who resides in Boston but flew over to watch Ireland take on Scotland at Celtic Park, reportedly asked Keane if he could sign a copy of the former Manchester United midfielder’s autobiography. Keane rejected the request as he was not happy with what Gillespie wrote in his own book - Confessions From The Blackthorn: Publican Frank Gillespie’s Journey From Tyrrellspass To Boston - which was published 10 years ago.

Gillespie came into contact with a coffee table during the confrontation before the police and an ambulance were called to the scene. He then spent 10 hours at Beaumont Hospital. In a show of support for Keane, Ireland manager Martin O’Neill took the unusual move of issuing a video statement on Thursday. He said: ‘The FAI and I have been fully briefed about the circumstances of what happened at the team hotel. ‘Roy asked that the gardai [police] were called and he has notified them of what has happened. While this process is ongoing we are unable to say more at this point. ‘However having been made aware of the facts, I can say Roy has both my full support and the full support of the FAI, and John Delaney (FAI chief executive). ‘We are now focused as we have been all week on the game in hand and we won’t be saying anything more about this issue.’ Keane’s legal advisers have studied CCTV footage since the incident and his Ireland colleagues continue to support him.

"Channel 4 has been labelled tawdry after paying Holocaust denier David Irving £3,000 for what he says is a lock of Adolf Hitler’s hair. The strand will be DNA-tested in a TV show to be broadcast this week. Labour MP Ian Austin – whose Jewish father lost his family in the Treblinka extermination camp – said it was a ‘sick’ and ‘tawdry’ stunt. He told the Daily Mirror: ‘It’s appalling that Channel 4 would get involved with a Holocaust denier in some bizarre and tawdry show purporting to be entertainment. It’s disgusting, and raises questions about Channel 4’s public broadcasting remit.’ Channel 4 paid David Irving, 75, pictured, who was convicted of Holocaust denial in Austria in 2006, for a lock of Adolf Hitler's hair . Irving, 75, was convicted of Holocaust denial in Austria in 2006 and fined after claiming the Nazi leader did not order the annihilation of Jews. He has praised Hitler as ‘a great man’ and said his Gestapo were ‘fabulous policemen’. Irving also insulted the memory of victims further in 2009 by trying to sell Nazi memorabilia online – including the hair – allegedly collected by Hitler’s barber using sticky tape on the sole of his shoe. The hair will be used in Dead Famous DNA – which will also feature Marilyn Monroe, Napoleon and Charles Darwin – which starts on Wednesday night.

Lionel Messi stepped up once again to hand his team three points with a stunning late goal. Iran had battled valiantly and deserved a draw, but you just cannot give Messi an inch. 92mins: Di Maria makes way for Biglia. Iran have a throw-in deep inside Argentina's half but they look shell shocked. They've done it! He's done it! Messi the match-winner strikes again.  The little magician finds himself in space from 25-yards out, shifts the ball onto his left foot and curls the ball brilliantly past a helpless Haghighi. Wow! 89mins: Iran now look like they are going to secure their second 0-0 draw of the tournament. Credit to Carlos Queiroz. Iran have been so well-drilled this afternoon. Argentina are pressing down the left with Di Maria. 86mins: Chance for Iran to take the lead once again after a brilliant counter attack. Ghoochannejad was played through brilliantly and was running through on goal before just running out of legs and seeing his tame shot saved. Unlucky. 82mins: Superb tackle from Sadeghi stops Lavezzi in his tracks and puts the ball out for an Argentina corner. Alejandro Sabella's side have looked a lot more positive since the changes as Rojo fires a 30-yard strike just wide. 80mins: Di Maria's corner is turned away and it's Iran back on the attack.  Heydari crossed from the right but Argentina clear easily. The game is getting stretched now. 74mins: Several changes now as Shojaei makes way for Heydari,  Palacio comes on for Higuain and Lavezzi enters the action at the expense of Aguero. 72mins: Shojaei is shown a yellow card for a foul on Di Maria on the edge of Iran's box. Messi stands over the ball...and hits the side netting! 71mins: Dejagah takes yet another corner for Iran which lands at the feet of Nekounam but he's adjudged to have fouled Garay. Let off for Argentina. 67mins: Dejagah almost puts Iran in the lead! The Fulham star drives into the box before heading towards goal. Romero is forced into a fingertip save. Iran are on top! 64mins: Iran are really putting Argentina under pressure here as Reza almost capitalises on some sloppy defender inside the six-yard box. Iran have looked just as likely to score as Argentina in this half. 56mins: Replays shows that Zabaleta didn't get a touch to the ball and Dejagah was right to be so angry. Iran should have had a penalty there. 55mins: Dejagah is absolutely furious after being tackled by Zabaleta inside the Argentina box. The City defender looked to just get the ball before bringing down the Fulham star. 52mins: Best chance of the game for Iran Nekounam meets the ball with a diving header. The attempt is saved by the feet of Haghighi. 51mins: Aguero misses another chance as he fails to get on the end of another Rojo cross. This time the ball was perfect and just needed a touch but Aguero completely miss-timed his header. 49mins: Rojo attacks down the left before crossing for Aguero but the ball is too high for the City striker. Argentina may have all the talent in the world in the front three but they lack any real height. 46mins: Argentina start on the attack as a Zabaleta win a corner.  Timotian does well to clear. We're back underway in Belo Horizonte and Argentina take the ball. It's 0-0 at the break and it's no more than Iran deserve. Carlos Queiroz's side have been energetic and dangerous from set pieces while Argentina have struggled to carve the Iran defence open. Chances fell to Higuain and Aguero but both were wasted. Can Iran really do this? No reason why not... 47mins: Iran win another free-kick as Gago needlessly fouls Haji Safi on the left. Dejagah whips it in but Argentina clear. 45mins: Just two added minutes to play here and Argentina seemed to have lost their rhythm. Iran have battled well and had their chances from set pieces. 42mins: Iran come close with a corner as Hosseini heads just over. It's a good run from Hosseini but he just seems to dip his head at the vital moment. Iran are looking dangerous from those set pieces. 36mins: Messi lofts in another free-kick and Garay is up to meet it, but he just can't hit the target with his header. Iran were lucky to get away with that. Garay was in acres of space. 32mins: Referee Milorad Mazic gets his vanishing foam out and that can mean only one thing. Messi takes the free-kick but hits it well over the bar. Disappointing effort. 29mins: Iran are still hanging in there as Argentina keep looking for an opening. Chances have been few and far between for both sides. Messi has just been fouled by Timotian on the edge of the box... 24mins: Rojo heads just wide from an Argentina corner. The last thing Iran will want to do is gift their opponents a goal from a set piece. 21 mins: Chance for Argentina as Higuain feeds Aguero inside the Iran box. The Manchester City forward looks to curl one past Haghighi left hand but the keeper is equal to the strike. Argentina in complete control here. 17mins: Iran take a corner but the ball is well cleared by Fernandez. Argentina race towards the other end and find themselves with four against three but Higuain lacks the composure to make the numbers count. 14mins: An excellent ball into the box from Gago puts Higuain one-on-one with the Iran goalkeeper but Haghighi saves well. Haghighi has injured himself in the process and is currently receiving treatment. 11mins: Messi cuts inside and gets away his first shot of the afternoon. Unfortunately for the Argentine faithful, his shot is easily blocked and sent out for a throw-in. 9mins: Argentina have had 82 per cent of possession so far, but have struggled to carve out any real openings. Di Maria bombs down the left before being halted by Hosseini . 5mins: Argentina have their first chance of the game as Aguero swivels in the area before seeing his shot blocked. 4mins: Free-kick to Iran in a dangerous position after a Zabaleta handball. Dejagah crosses, but the ball drifts out of play after a flick-on. If Iran are to have any joy this afternoon, they need to get those set pieces right. 1min: Early free-kick to Argentina as Reza takes down Gago. Nothing comes of it as Di Maria lays crumpled in a heap and Iran regain possession. Here we go! Iran, all in red, get us underway. Matt Lawton: Respect to the women among Iran’s supporters here. Read today that they’re not allowed to attend football matches at home. It's Argentina first. The fans are making a lot of noise, but the players remain calm and silent. The Iran players on the other hand, arm in arm and belting out every word. 1-0 to Iran in the national anthem stakes. Iran are the first team to enter the tunnel as they go through a few last stretches while waiting for Argentina. The Iranian players were told to keep their shirts after the Nigeria game. Surely Messi's shirt will be a popular one after the final whistle. Got, got...NEED! Matt Lawton: Seems Argentina players are getting their way again today after the controversy over Alejandro Sabella’s team selection for their opening game. Messi wants 4-3-3 and 4-3-3 it is. This will be the first time Argentina and Iran face each other at a World Cup. The two teams have only met once before and the match ended 1-1 in 1977. Those Iran defenders will have been having sleepless nights worrying about how they are going to deal with Argentina's front three. The underdogs will be able to take heart from their hard-earned 0-0 against Nigeria last week but it might be slightly more difficult this afternoon. Image: Getty Images .

"The number of people living past 100 has soared by 71 per cent in the past decade. And while one expert believes this figure will continue to rise, he stated that anyone hoping to live for double or triple this time will be disappointed. Speaking at a gerontology conference, Professor Sir Colin Blakemore claimed there is a ceiling on how long humans can live, and how much the body can age - and he stated that that 120 years ‘might be a real absolute limit to human lifespan.’ Professor Sir Colin Blakemore (pictured) claimed there is a ceiling on how long humans can live and believes 120 years ‘might be a real absolute limit to human lifespan’. This is because living for longer is ‘so rarely exceeded’ that even with medical advances, it is unlikely this upper threshold will be raised . Sir Blakemore, 70, is a British neurobiologist and was formerly chief executive of the British Medical Research Council. He said people living for longer than 120 years is ‘so rarely exceeded’ that, even with medical and technological advances, it is unlikely this upper threshold will be raised. The claims were made at a Legal and General conference earlier this week, as reported by Tom Whipple in The Times. A panel of gerontologists and scientists discussed the future of medicine, global health concerns and life expectancy. Professor Sir Blakemore’s claims contradict those made previously by researchers at Buck Institute of Age Research, Novato, California earlier this year. Dr Pankaj Kapahi believes that scientific breakthroughs could potential extend human lives dramatically, by four or five fold. This could eventually lead to people living until they were 500 years old, for example. He made these claims after tweaking two genetic pathways in the lab worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which successfully boosted the creature's lifespan by a factor of five. While it could take years of research to extend humans’ lives in the same way, the study raises the prospect of anti-ageing treatments informed by genetic interactions, according to Dr Kapahi. It agreed that medicines will have a limited effect on extending human life, and it was more important to improve the health and quality of life for older people, rather than prolonging it. The panel also stated it was key to improve the life expectancy in poorer regions, or areas where people typically die much younger than other areas. The 2014 Global AgeWatch Index, which ranks 96 nations on the quality of life for the elderly, recently stated that by 2050, the number of over 60s will be 21 per cent of the global population. This is almost double the current figure of 12 per cent. The proportion of over-80s is growing fastest, too – projected to rise from two per cent now to four per cent of the global population by 2050.

The number of people living to 100 has increased by 71 per cent in the last ten years, and has shot up more than five-fold since the Eighties. There are now more than half a million people aged 90 and above living in the UK, with nearly 14,000 of them aged more than 100, compared to just 2,500 in 1980 . ‘In the early years, cancer researchers focused on mutations in single genes, but then it became apparent that different mutations in a class of genes were driving the disease process,’ he said. ‘The same thing is likely happening in ageing,’ he added. The number of people living to 100 in the UK has increased by 71 per cent in the last ten years, and has shot up more than five-fold since the Eighties. There are now more than half a million people aged 90 and above living in this country, with nearly 14,000 of them aged more than 100, compared to just 2,500 in 1980. There are also 710 people who have lived beyond their 105th birthday, up from 340 ten years ago. Data released by the Office for National Statistics also showed life expectancy has increased again, with the gap between the sexes continuing to close. Men born this year can expect to live to 78, while women will reach 82 on average. That is compared to just 70 for men born between 1980 and 1982, and 76 for women. C. elegans, a type of worm, was the first animal to have its whole genome, or genetic code, mapped, and has been widely used in studies of ageing and lifespan. The research, reported in the journal Cell Reports, involved blocking key molecules that affect the action of insulin and a nutrient signalling pathway called Target of Rapamycin (TOR). Single mutations in the TOR pathway were known to extend the lifespan of C. elegans by 30 per cent, while insulin-signalling mutations could double the amount of time they lived. Adding the two together might have been expected to extend longevity by 130 per cent, but the combined impact turned out to be much greater. The research may explain why it has proved so difficult to identify single genes responsible for the long lives enjoyed by human centenarians. ‘It's quite probable that interactions between genes are critical in those fortunate enough to live very long, healthy lives,’ said Dr Kapahi. Future research is expected to use mice to see if the same effects occur in mammals. ‘The idea would be to use mice genetically engineered to have suppressed insulin signalling and then treat them with the drug rapamycin, which is well-known to suppress the TOR pathway,’ Dr Kapahi said.","Professor Sir Colin Blakemore said there's a limit on how long we can live .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez has boldly predicted his 20-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley will go onto become the best English player of all-time. Two days before Wayne Rooney was handed his 100th cap by World Cup winner Sir Bobby Charlton, the Everton manager told club supporters at a Q&A event entitled 'An Audience with Roberto Martinez' that local boy Barkley would go on to surpass the achievements of both. 'There is no doubt in my mind he will be the best player England has ever had,' Martinez told the audience at the Titanic Hotel in Liverpool. VIDEO Scroll down to see Barkley talk about which players inspired him . Ross Barkley will become England's greatest-ever player, according to Everton boss Roberto Martinez . Toffees manager Martinez was speaking to supporters at an Everton Q&A event on Thursday evening . 'Ross has everything. Normally a player has the pace and power to get around the pitch or they have the vision to pick a pass. 'Ross can do both of those things, and he is technically gifted with both feet. Not only that, he is in love with the game.' Manchester City would love Barkley at The Etihad but it would cost them a British record £60million with Everton under no financial pressure to sell. Martinez added: 'He will probably be the biggest asset Everton have ever had' though he was referring to his qualities as a player rather than his valuation. Barkley played for England at the World Cup last summer and has been used wide or as a No 10 by Martinez.","Martinez praised his player, saying he is set for great things .

"Hull FC produced their best performance of the season to deny fierce rivals Hull KR a piece of history and put a major dent in their play-off hopes. The Robins went into the contest on a wet night at the KC Stadium chasing a hat-trick of wins over the Black and Whites for the first time in the First Utility Super League era, but left smarting from a 28-0 defeat which leaves their top-eight aspirations hanging by a thread. The Airlie Birds dominated a full-blooded first half and barely allowed Rovers into their 40, although they only had tries from Fetuli Talanoa and Setaimata Sa and two Jordan Rankin goals to show for their efforts. Three and no so easy: Hull FC prevented their local rivals from completing an historic Super League hat-trick . Tom Lineham settled any nerves Hull had on 45 minutes and the result was beyond doubt when Jordan Thompson crashed over, with Lineham completing a resounding win with an interception try. It was a typically frenetic start to the derby with ferocious tackling and over-exuberance resulting in numerous early errors. The hosts drew first blood on 10 minutes after a penalty gave them good field position, Richard Horne and Kirk Yeaman combining to put Talanoa over in the corner. Backed by a vociferous home crowd, the Black and Whites were celebrating again in the 19th minute and the try owed much to Rankin's composure. He controlled a poor pass by Danny Houghton with his instep before feeding Sa and standing back to watch the big centre power his way across the line. Rankin landed his first kick of the night to give Hull a 10-0 lead, one they were full value for amid a passionate and controlled first-half performance led by captain Gareth Ellis. Rovers failed to launch a meaningful attack and lacked discipline in the opening 40 minutes, with another penalty allowing Rankin to kick a two-pointer from 35 metres out on the stroke of the break. The Robins began the second period on the front foot and forced the first drop out of the night after Jamie Shaul was forced to put Kris Keating's kick dead. Unfortunately for the visitors and their strong travelling contingent behind the posts, Josh Hodgson, playing in his last Hull derby before leaving to play in the NRL, lost control of the ball trying to force a pass. Another error by Neville Costigan in his own 10 metres gifted the Black and Whites possession and they made him pay as Aaron Heremaia took a pass by his ankles, laid the ball on to Sa who fed Lineham to dive over for a simple score. Yeaman was at the heart of a melee in the aftermath of the try and that only served to fire Hull up even more. They scored again through Thompson on the hour mark after he capitalised on a half break by Heremaia. Rankin added the extras to make it 22-0 and it appeared as if that would be how it finished as both sides struggled to keep hold of the ball in increasingly greasy conditions. But Lineham plucked a Keating pass out of the sky and raced 90 metres to round off the scoring six minutes from time.

"Gamma rays are the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe. But how these mysterious waves are made, and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years. Now, for the first time, scientists have peered into the heart of an erupting star to uncover the origin of this stunning phenomenon. Gamma rays, emitted when a star explodes, are the most powerful form of radioactive waves known in the universe. But how these mysterious waves were made and where exactly they come from have baffled scientists for years. Pictured is an artist's impression of gas ejected in the nova explosion . Astronomers, led by Michigan State and Manchester University, made an unexpected discovery when looking at an explosion on the surface of a star. 'We not only found where the gamma rays came from, but also got a look at a previously-unseen scenario that may be common in other nova explosions,' said Laura Chomiuk, of Michigan State University. A nova occurs in a star that is part of a binary system – two stars orbiting one another. One star, known as a dense white dwarf, steals matter from the other and the interaction triggers a thermonuclear explosion that flings debris into space. It was from this explosion from a system known as V959 Mon, located some 5,000 light-years from Earth, that the researchers think the gamma rays were emitted. It was from an explosion from a system known as V959 Mon, located some 5,000 light years from Earth, that the researchers think the gamma rays were emitted. Artist’s impressions of the gas ejected in the nova explosion is pictured . This activity was first detected two years ago by Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. At about that same time, similar activity was being picked up by land-based radio telescopes around the world, revealing two distinct knots of radio emission. These knots were then seen to move away from each other. Astronomers have found the brightest ‘dead star’ ever recorded - but its very existence threatens to underpin our known laws of the universe. The pulsar - a dense and rapidly spinning remnant of a much larger star left over from a supernova explosion - has the energy of about 10 million suns and was previously thought to be a black hole. Its discovery, however, breaks a theoretical limit for how bright such an object can get - and it may also mean many other black holes found to date are actually pulsars. The discovery, published in the journal Nature, was made by scientists at Nasa’s California Institute of Technology (Caltech) using the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuStar). This pulsar is the remnant of a once-in-a-century supernova dubbed SN2014J that was spotted in the Cigar Galaxy, also known as Messier 82 (M82), 12 million light-years away. The rare event captured the attention of telescopes around the world but when astronomers looked at NuStar’s data they found that what they thought was a black hole was actually the brightest pulsar ever seen. Scientists believe the white dwarf and its companion gave up some of their orbital energy to boost some of the explosion material, making the ejected material move outward faster in the plane of their orbit. Later, the white dwarf blew off a faster wind of particles moving mostly outward along the poles of the orbital plane. When the faster-moving polar flow hit the slower-moving material, the shock accelerated particles to the speeds needed to produce the gamma rays, and the knots of radio emission. This artist's impression is believed to be the exact replica of the moment a star explodes. When the faster-moving polar flow hits the slower-moving material, the shock accelerated particles to the speeds needed to produce the gamma rays, and the knots of radio emission . 'By watching this system over time, and seeing how the pattern of radio emission changed, then tracing the movements of the knots, we saw the exact behaviour expected from this scenario,' Professor Chomiuk said. Since that initial detection by Fermi, the spacecraft has detected gamma rays from three additional nova explosions in other star systems. 'This mechanism may be common to such systems,' said Professor Chomiuk. 'The reason the gamma rays were first seen in V959 Mon is because it's closer to us.' Because the type of ejection detected in V959 Mon also is seen in other binary star systems, the new insights might help astronomers understand how those systems develop. 'We may be able to use novae as a 'testbed' for improving our understanding of this critical stage of binary evolution,' Professor Chomiuk said. Gamma rays can be dangerous and are capable of killing living cells. The medical field uses gamma rays, along with X-rays and other forms of high-energy radiation, to treat cancer. Fortunately, by the time gamma rays travel across the universe to us, they are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere.","Nasa's Fermi Gamma-ray Telescope detected gamma ray activity in 2012 .

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Harry Redknapp has admitted that he gets sent 'sick' and 'stupid' text messages all the time and insists that Malky Mackay deserves his second chance at Wigan. Wigan have offered Mackay a route back into football just three months after Sportsmail revealed that the Football Association had been handed a dossier of evidence accusing Mackay and Iain Moody of sending a shocking series of racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic text messages. It was a controversial decision taken by Wigan chairman Dave Whelan, but Redknapp is adamant that Mackay should be given another chance.

Mackay, pictured with Dave Whelan, was appointed the new manager of Wigan Athletic on Wednesday . The Scotsman took charge of his first training session on Thursday morning . 'I would ask people to judge me when they see me. I've apologised for my mistakes I've studied diversity and that's something that's ongoing. 'It has been a difficult period and I have made mistakes. I hope that in my time at Wigan, the people of Wigan and the supporters see who I am and see that I'm someone that desperately wants the club to do well.' Redknapp said: 'I get stupid messages from people all the time, silly jokes, sick jokes, I hate them and delete them straight away. But people do tend to do that in life, so he is not the only person who has made a mistake. 'I am sure his life has been hell for the last few months. He realises he has made a massive mistake and hopefully he will not make any more mistakes. 'I am not condoning what he done but he has got another chance. People get second chances in life.

Whelan revealed on Wednesday at Mackay's unveiling that there is a clause in his contract protecting the club if the FA charge him. The FA's investigation is still two or three weeks from conclusion and Redknapp warns that Mackay cannot make the same mistake twice. 'If he does it again he'll be bang in trouble. He knows that,' Redknapp added. 'Whenever I have met Malky, I have thought he was a decent person and a good football manager. He made a big mistake, you can't do what he did, and he has accepted that. He has apologised I am sure he has learned from that.' 'Fkn chinkys. Fk it.

"Rickie Lambert has summed up his World Cup journey to Brazil with England - describing it as the 'best' and the 'worst' experience of his career. The striker, who signed for boyhood club Liverpool this summer, completed a fairytale journey from working in a beetroot factory 13 years ago to representing his nation at the World Cup in 2014 when he came on a substitute during the 2-1 defeat to Uruguay. But England's earliest exit from a World Cup since 1958 means that the experience has also been a painful one for the 32-year-old. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rickie Lambert discuss the sombre mood in England's camp . Dream: Rickie Lambert (right) came on for England as a substitute against Uruguay . High and low: Lambert has loved playing at a World Cup but England's early exit leaves a bitter taste . Frustration: Lambert says that the mood in the England camp is not good following their early exit . England's only remaining fixture is Tuesday's dead rubber with Costa Rica and, although Lambert will hope to feature, he did not expect to be leaving Brazil after only three matches. 'It’s a difficult scenario to be in, everyone’s disappointed about what’s happened and the fact that we’ve got one more game left. 'But we’ve got to be professional and we’ve got to give our best and get three points to finish on a high against Costa Rica. 'It’s been the best experience of my career and probably the worst experience at the same time. 'It’s always difficult being an England fan and getting knocked out, but this time being involved is devastating to get knocked out at an early stage. 'It was probably the worst moment of my career when the final whistle went and we were knocked out of the World Cup. 'It was horrible. Maybe I might look back in years to come and think ""I’ve played in a World Cup"", that will live with me forever. But I can’t remember any moments that are as bad as that.' Fairytale: Lambert completed a dream move to boyhood club Liverpool this summer before flying to Brazil . Form: The 32-year-old enjoyed a fantastic season for Southampton, leading to his England call-up . Despite their premature exit, Lambert is fully supportive of England manager Roy Hodgson and thinks he should lead the country to the 2016 Euros in France. Lambert, who played in three separate divisions for Southampton before signing for Liverpool, is especially encouraged by Hodgson's decision to blood youngsters in Brazil. He told www.thefa.com: 'One thing is very important - we don’t make any knee-jerk decisions. 'I think the set-up we have, the manager who is in charge is definitely the person we need to go forward with the group of young kids coming through. 'The progression they have had under Roy has been amazing, so if he can keep the group together for another two years it’s going to be exciting and they are going to learn after what has just happened. Meteoric rise: Lambert played for Southampton in three different divisions and score in all of them . All alone: Roy Hodgson should remain as England manager despite their early exit, says Rickie Lambert . 'Roy has given the young players a chance and they have thrived on it. 'That’s definitely one of the positives we’ll take out of the World Cup and when the next scenario comes around in the next two years at the Euros, this is going to help them. 'That’s why this set-up needs to stay together.'","Lambert came on as a substitute in the 2-1 loss against Uruguay .

It would be a move back to the capital for the former England captain, who left West Ham for Leeds in an £18million transfer 14 years ago.

"Cardiff is the wettest city in Britain. The Welsh capital has topped a list of average rainfall dating back to 1981 in records held by the Met Office, coming in with 115 cms a year. In second position was Glasgow with 112 cms a year, and third is Preston with 103 cms. Scroll down for video . Cardiff gets an average of 115 cms of rain a year, the most of any British city . But Cardiff is fifth in the list of cities with most days of rainfall -well behind Glasgow . But the Scottish city is top of the pile of average annual days of rainfall, with 170 a year; Cardiff holding fifth position in this list with 149. Huddersfield is hot on the heels of Glasgow, with the Yorkshire city recording an average of 154 days of rain each year. And there's good news for Londoners, after the English capital holds the honour of being the driest city in Britain, with only 56 cms falling on average each year. Ipswich has the least amount of rainy days in Britain, with 107; London has 110. The Met Office declares a rainy day as any day where even a millimetre has fallen. Glasgow in Scotland suffers from having the most days of rainfall per year on average, with 170 . Rain at rush hour in London is everybody's nightmare, but the capital is actually Britain's driest city . Manchester, being in the North West, surprisingly only just made the top ten of wettest places. Pictured here are cricket fans covering up at Old Trafford. Despite the findings, the city of Cardiff remains popular with tourists . A spokesperson for Cardiff Tourism told MailOnline: 'I think the rain isn't just confined to Cardiff, as I think Wales can be quite a wet place on the whole really. 'But we have some fantastic indoor attractions that can be enjoyed if it's raining; we have Cardiff Castle and the National Museum that are both really popular. 'Then we also have the Cardiff Story, again indoor, that details the magnificent history of our city. 'I think Cardiff remains a really popular destination for tourists throughout Europe and the world. I have noticed more and more people are visiting from South America now, so they're obviously not put off by any rain.'

Cardiff Castle is one of the main attractions - and offers shelter if the weather takes a turn for the worse .

'Cardiff Bay is very popular with tourists, and has great indoor areas and restaurants, so the rain certainly doesn't put anyone off visiting here,' added the spokesman. The data on wettest cities was collected by Manchester Evening news, who will have been pleased to see North West only just sneak into the top ten for average rainfall, eighth with 84.3cms.

"The most boring calendar for 2015 has hit the shelves - featuring the post boxes of Wales. Self-confessed 'dull man' Kevin Beresford from Redditch, Worcestershire, came up with the idea to celebrate post boxes which stand in the cities, mountains and valleys of Wales. It follows his 2014 calendar which featured the telephone boxes of Wales which became a best seller. The post box calender follows Kevin Beresford's 2014 best seller about the best phone boxes in Wales . Self-confessed 'dull man' Kevin Beresford said that the post office boxes 'things of beauty' and of historical importance . Mr Beresford, 62, said: 'People may think post boxes are a bit dull but I they are things of great beauty and of historical importance. 'You might think that all post boxes are the same but there are over 400 different types. 'The calendar has pictures of post boxes mounted on poles, set into walls, and pillar boxes standing alone on city streets, at the seaside and amongst flower beds on country lanes.' Mr Beresford visited some of the most important and well-known post boxes in Wales. And his favourite is a Victorian box in the village of Laugharne, West Wales, which he claims was used by Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. Kevin said: 'People thought my phone box calendar for this year was a bit dull but it became a best seller. 'I think of myself as an artist - the works of some of our greatest artists have celebrated every-day mundane things like Andy Warhol's can of soup or Tracy Emin's unmade bed. 'It might make me a bit dull but I love things post boxes - I see them as crimson iconic receptacles. 'And I am recording a slice of British history which is fast disappearing. 'People aren't using post boxes and telephone kiosks theses days because of emails and mobile phones.'

"Real Sociedad's trip to La Coruna to play Deportivo was not going to be the big fixture of a weekend in which Barcelona entertain Sevilla but David Moyes has changed all that. The former Manchester United manager has looked back in his element this week taking training at Real Sociedad's Zubieta training ground and his arrival has turned the spotlight on Deportivo's Riazor stadium this weekend. With Erik Bretos, as his full-time bilingual shadow, Moyes has taken training all week barking orders in English with Bretos, a 25-year-old former journalism graduate and youth football coach translating when necessary. VIDEO Scroll down to see footage of David Moyes' pre-match press conference . Real Sociedad manager David Moyes attends a press conference in Spain with the help of a translator .

Imanol Alguacil has assisted Moyes having stepped up from the B-team where he was also assistant coach. And Moyes has already taken his first big decision by insisting that Real Sociedad B-team manager Asier Santana, who took charge of the first team as caretaker boss for one game after Moyes' predecessor Jagoba Arrasate was sacked, remains part of his team. Santana managed the team to a victory over champions Atletico Madrid in his only game in charge and he has impressed Moyes to the point where he will be alongside him on the touchline on Saturday. Real are 15th but there are 27 games left of this season and they have already beaten Real Madrid at home, as well as that win over Atletico Madrid, so there is plenty of room for optimism. Moyes also has Carlos Vela back from scoring twice against Holland on international duty. He returned to training on Wednesday afternoon and should start tomorrow in search of his 50th goal in his 140th game for the club having had a suspension lifted after being wrongly accused of diving to win a penalty in the team's last game. Moyes walks out to take one of his first training sessions at the Zubieta training ground . Carlos Vela (right) will be available for Moyes's first game against Deportivo La Coruna in La Liga . 'I like to play football that people enjoy watching,' Moyes said at his presentation. 'But most importantly I want to win.' That went down well among fans of a club who have seen their side play attractive football across the last two seasons but fail to turn the performances into points. Moyes' style will suit the Basques according to former West Brom player Zigor Aranalde, who also played at Albacete and so knows both leagues well. He said: 'If there is one place where the British roots of football in Spain have endured it is in the Basque country.' Moyes (right) poses alongside Real Sociedad president Jokin Aperribay (left) at Estadio Anoeta . Another veteran of both leagues, former Wrexham, Crewe and Real Sociedad striker Juan Ugarte added: 'It's another style of football here but Moyes is a good enough coach to handle that; just look at what he achieved at Everton.' But with the finishing touches being put to the plans ahead of his first game in charge, Moyes is now looking forward to a new beginning. 'I have enjoyed working this week with the players, they seem very open to what I want from them. The vibrations are good and I'm anxious to get started,' he said.","David Moyes set for Real Sociedad debut against Deportivo La Coruna .

"Roberto Martinez has warned the FA over taking Ross Barkley to next summer’s Under 21 European Championship. The Everton boss has a good relationship with England Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate but he has also outlined his concerns over whether Barkley has reached a point where that level of football is not suitable for him. Ross Barkley has only made brief cameos for England since making his debut against Moldova in 2013 . Southgate has been told he can have the pick of England’s young stars for the tournament in the Czech Republic next June and it is likely he will include Luke Shaw, John Stones and Calum Chambers in his squad. There is, however, a debate on Barkley, who has been a fixture in Roy Hodgson’s squads but has not yet nailed down a starting place. Everton midfielder Barkley has just returned to action after recovering from knee injury . Southgate has never had the chance to pick the Everton midfielder and Martinez is wondering how he intends to handle the gifted 20-year-old. ‘We need to remember what the reason is for playing for the U21s,’ said Martinez. ‘It is to get you ready to play for the first team. The moment that you feel ready to play in the first team, going back in your development, I don’t see how that can help... Ross has gone past that (U21 football) completely.’","Gareth Southgate has been told he can have the pick of England's young stars for the tournament .

"A man who found a giant Hula Hoop while snacking on a bag of crisps and put the snack on eBay has sold it for £712. Musician Stuart Hampton, 31, from Darnhill in Greater Manchester decided to sell the three-inch salt and vinegar flavoured crisp on eBay, believing it to be the longest in the world. He said: “It blew my mind when I found it, it was in perfect condition. The three-inch salt and vinegar flavoured Hula Hoop attracted an impressive 32 bids on eBay - selling for £712 . “I didn’t eat it because I thought it would be more fun showing it to the world.” He put it on the website last week and described it as 'the world's longest hula hoop'. Bids began at just £1 and then shot to £140 overnight, with the final bid, from Heywood, in Greater Manchester, coming in just before the online auction ended. In total there were 32 bids on the snack before bidding ended. Under item condition, Mr Hampton honestly put 'used' and said in the item description: 'Well, it's out of the packet, but I will put it in a sealed plastic bag for you.' Stuart Hampton was delighted when it sold and has said he will use the money to help found a commune . Another item for sale on Mr Hampton's eBay page is 'Love' - with proceeds going towards his dream, Freeriver . Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Mr Hampton said: 'I can't be sure whether it's a genuine bid or not. 'Legally the bidder has to pay up. 'If he or she doesn't pay within the next few days I will get in touch with the other people and sell it to one of them.' Mr Hampton (pictured) found the three-inch crisp while snacking in bed and shared it with the world . In response to the recent discovery of an even longer five-inch find by four-year-old Vincent Green from Edinburgh, Stuart said: 'I've heard that the owner of that one has eaten it, which makes mine definitely the biggest. 'It is all just a bit of a laugh though to be honest. 'I was walking down the street just cracking up laughing about it but if I do get the money it is definitely going towards my commune.' Mr Hampton has even set up a website to help fund his lifelong ambition, which he has already named the Freeriver Community. The website states: 'Freeriver is a space that will hold a spiritual and peaceful intention. It will be very free in nature with no set ideas, . 'Instead people will be free to find their own way and cultivate a way of being that feels right for them. 'All practices will be possible and explored. Things such as Yoga, Meditation, healthy eating with a vegan diet, singing, dancing, being creative, having fun, exploring philosophies and texts, discussions, time in nature, making music and daydreaming will all be welcome.'

"Sam Allardyce insists Andy Carroll’s return to fitness will not result in West Ham resorting to long-ball tactics. Carroll could make his first start of the season against Everton on Saturday after recovering from an ankle injury sustained in pre-season. West Ham striker Andy Carroll has only made one brief substitute appearance this season . The loss of the target man was viewed as a huge blow ahead of the season, but Diafra Sakho’s prolific form has helped West Ham cope without Carroll. Sakho is struggling with a back injury and that could open the door for 6ft 4in Carroll to return. But Allardyce insists the England striker’s selection would not signal an aerial attack. Carroll's last goal for West Ham was in the 3-1 victory over Sunderland last season . ‘We play slightly different in that we play more into Andy’s feet than we do into [Enner] Valencia or Sakho,’ said Allardyce. ‘Valencia and Sakho are so pacy we are a massive threat in behind the opposition when the midfield players like Mark Noble, Alex Song or Stewart Downing start sliding balls down the side of defenders. ‘Andy is not such a big threat in that area, he is a much bigger threat in terms of setting up attacks to get into the final third by playing into his feet or chest and not playing into his head. ‘No way do I tell a player to just knock it up to Andy’s head. I want them to be talented enough to knock it into Andy’s feet or chest. We want it on Andy’s head when it is crossed into the box because that is where he is at his best and where he can score.’","Andy Carroll set to make his first start of the season against Everton .

"We've all heard of the camera selfie, well how about the drone selfie? This incredible video, shot in an area renowned for its natural beauty, is American Matt Benedetto's version of the now popular pose. Atop cliffs at North Beach in Burlington, Vermont, US, the 24-year-old stands, control in hand, facing the drone cam, while stationed dangerously to the edge of the rock-face. Then off it goes. Benedetto appears calm and collected on the edge of the cliff . Soaring into the sky above, the quality and stability of the recording is incredible - colours of the forest clash perfectly against the dark blue waters of Lake Champlain. The landscape shots once airborne are spectacular. Speaking to MailOnline, Matt, from New York, said; 'I have had my drone for about a year now and fly it from time to time, mostly for fun with friends or around Vermont where I like. The scale of the amazing landscape becomes apparent as the drone flies up . American Matt Benedetto took a selfie - with a drone cam . 'I had hiked to that location before but with you never see the view from up there unless you are coming in from an airplane. 'I have a monitor that shows what the camera is seeing and was pretty blown away when I was filming that shot. 'I have been filming for a few years, mainly skiing, but started aerial flying within the past year. The drone sets off on its upward trajectory as Benedetto takes a hold of the controls . The area is superbly maintained by officials and volunteers . And asked about what thoughts were going through his mind when taking on the project, he added: 'My immediate thoughts were, I was probably standing way to close to the edge and I didn't know the rock had that over hang!' Lake Champlain and North Beach are held in high regard by officials and the local community. Water samples are sent off regularly to be tested.

"A four-man demolition crew on Tuesday started tearing down the squalid Massachusetts house in which the skeletal remains of three dead infants were found. The home's owner had until 9am on Tuesday to contact the town or seek a court order to halt the demolition, but failed to do so, Blackstone Town Administrator Daniel Keyes said. 'We have a professional demolition team in there right now,' he said, as a backhoe clawed at the outer walls. Scroll down for video . A house where the skeletal remains of three children were found last month is torn down by order of the town's Board of Health on Tuesday . The fire department in Blackstone, Massachusetts were forced to hose down the debris and dust to contain the offensive odors . A house where the skeletal remains of three children were found last month is torn down by order of the town's Board of Health today in Blackstone, Massachusetts . Erika Murray's home is guarded by a Blackstone police officer last month after a three-year-old girl and a five-month-old girl were found in the home along with three dead infants . All utilities had been shut off and someone went through the building to make sure no one was inside before work began, he said. The town's fire department was hosing down the debris and dust to contain the offensive odors still emanating from the home which had been filled with dirty diapers, animal carcasses and infested with insects and rodents. Blackstone's Board of Health ordered the demolition, which is expected to take two days. Erika Murray, the woman who lived in the house with four children and her longtime boyfriend, is being held on $1 million bail on charges including fetal death concealment. She has pleaded not guilty. Murray's lawyer Keith Halpern said last week that she appears to have mental health issues. He said Murray told him the dead infants were born starting about eight years ago and at least one was born alive and lived a few days before she found the child dead in a bassinet. A demolitiion crew member in a face mask assists in work on the home which had been filled with dirty diapers, animal carcasses and infested with insects and rodents .

A backhoe tore through the outer walls of the home after workers went inside to double check that the property was empty . Demolition was completed of the condemned home in Blackstone, Massachusetts on Tuesday . Accused: Erika Murray, pictured in court last week, told cops that one of the children found dead in her home had lived for several days before she found it dead. The remains of two other babies were also found . The state medical examiner has not determined how old the babies were or how they died. Murray's other four children, ranging in age from six months to 13 years, were removed from the house in August. Authorities found the infants' remains in a more thorough search a few weeks later. The remains of the three infants were found in Murray's older children's bedroom closets when authorities executed search warrants after neighbors raised the alarm. Her four children, ranging in age from five months to 13 years, were rescued from her filthy home on August 28 after her 10-year-old son went to a neighbor's home asking for help to quieten the crying five-month-old baby. The neighbor found the youngest child covered in feces. People watched on Tuesday as a house where the skeletal remains of three children were found last month is torn down by order of the town's Board of Health . Squalid: Investigators said the family's home was covered in soiled diapers, maggots, feces and running with rats and cockroaches . Neither the baby nor Murray's three-year-old child have birth records and both are severely malnourished. authorities said. The infant is extremely sensitive to sunlight and the three-year-old cannot walk, has poor muscle tone and only makes a few sounds. In court last week, prosecutors said the three-year-old's muscle tone suggested that she had spent most of her young life on her back. Workers in hazmat suits spent days cleaning out the house. The town spent $20,000 on the cleanup and about $8,500 to take it down. The house is owned by Kristina Rivera of Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the sister of Murray's boyfriend, Raymond Rivera. She had no comment and city officials said she has not responded to them. Raymond Rivera, who lived in the basement, has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he grew marijuana in the home.","The fire department in Blackstone, Massachusetts was hosing down the debris and dust to contain the offensive odors .

"A nine-year-old boy  found hanged in his bedroom  suffered neglect, witnessed domestic abuse and had been involved with social services for years, a serious case review has found. The victim, named only as Gavin, was just eight days away from his tenth birthday when his younger sibling found him unconscious in his bedroom in August last year. When paramedics arrived at the address there were no working lights on the upper floor of the family home, and they had to fetch a bulb from downstairs. Gavin was taken to hospital, but died nine months later. Now a report into his death has highlighted a series of 'missed opportunities' to help the youngster, from Stockton, Teesside. The nine-year-old boy, known only as Gavin, hanged himself in August last year. A report into his death revealed he had witnessed domestic violence, had been neglected, and was involved with social services for years . The serious case review described Gavin as a popular boy at school and a 'beautiful singer', though the deputy headteacher of his local said he 'had a sad face, even when he was happy.' Gavin and his family had been involved with different agencies in Stockton including Health, Social Care and Police going back to 2005, and had previous contact with social services in Durham. He had been the subject of a child protection plan on three separate occasions due to neglect, although at the time he was found hanged the family were not involved with Children's Services. He had been briefly fostered in 2006 over concerns about neglect and domestic violence in the home, which he ha witnessed. His school raised questions in May last year about his 'unkempt' appearance, and staff reported he appeared withdrawn and malnourished. His bad body odour was later found to be caused by the family's broken washing machine which was not quickly replaced. Despite these concerns, Mike Harrison, the independent author of the report, blasted the professionals involved with Gavin for 'collective inaction' in the first half of 2013. The report criticised their decision to end his child protection programme in 2012 as 'unwise' and 'insufficiently supported by evidence'. Gavin was never interviewed alone about his condition, and not enough was done to stop his parents putting pressure on him during questioning, the report concluded. Protection plans drawn up for Gavin and his siblings were 'insufficiently robust' and did not include enough details on 'what needed to change in the family'. Authorities were also unaware of the past history of Gavin's father because he had two surnames. This information could have given further insight into the father's 'ability to parent Gavin successfully', Mr Harrion wrote. The report also found a lack of communication between some of the agencies involved, with some excluded from Gavin's assessments. Some child protection workers also lacked knowledge about programmes to help domestic violence and abuse perpetrators. Despite this, the review concluded that nothing could have been done to save Gavin, as he had no history of self-harm and had expressed no desire to take his own life. The report says that there 'was no information or indication given to professionals or agencies throughout the period of this review, or before, that would give rise to concerns that Gavin would in any way harm himself deliberately'. It added that it was 'clear the events which occurred on August 8, 2013, could not have been anticipated by any of the professionals or agencies who were or had been involved with Gavin'. The incident was investigated by the police, who were clear that Gavin’s injuries were caused by his own actions and did not involve a third party. Report accuses some child care professionals from Middesbrough (pictured) of 'collective inaction' over Gavin in the early part of 2013, and said the decision to withdraw his support programme in 2012 was 'unwise' Colin Morris, the independent chair of the Stockton-on-Tees Local Safeguarding Children Board, said: 'This was a tragic incident, and our thoughts are very much with Gavin’s family at this time. 'Gavin did not have a history of self-harm. The independent review is clear that the events which occurred that day could not have been anticipated by any of the professionals or agencies who were or had been involved with Gavin and his family. 'The purpose of a Serious Case Review is to ensure that lessons are learned, and the independent author has made a number of recommendations to improve multi-agency working. 'Some of these recommendations have already been implemented while a number of others are well under way.' Those recommendations include a review of commissioned support services, which assist children in need and children in need of protection. Staff should also be better informed about what programmes can be used to help those at risk of causing domestic abuse. There should also be a comprehensive  review of record keeping, including the required content of records, security and access to records.","Boy, named only as Gavin, found unconscious days before tenth birthday .

"A woman cyclist has been left fighting for her life after being crushed by a lorry in central London this morning. The rider, who is believed to be in her twenties, was ‘crushed’ under a large tipper truck at Ludgate Circus at about 11.30am today. London Ambulance Service found the woman in cardiac arrest and 'extensive efforts' were made at the scene to resuscitate her. The bike can be seen crushed under the large wheel of the truck following a collision at Ludgate Circus today . A woman cyclist was rushed to hospital where she is fighting for her life after collision with large tipper truck . She was taken to Royal London Hospital with serious injuries, where she remains fighting for her life. Witnesses at the scene say the cyclist was 'crushed' under the large lorry, which appeared to be turning left at the junction with Ludgate Hill and Farringdon Street. City of London Police closed roads surrounding Ludgate Circus and re-opened them at about 5pm this evening. The junction has become notorious for accidents - and is the second in a matter of months after Victor Manuel Ben Rodriguez was crushed under a lorry in April. The 32-year-old Spaniard had been on his bike on the way to a job interview when he was hit by a truck and suffered severe head injuries. London Assembly Green Party member Darren Johnson said there had been six cyclists killed or seriously injured at the junction between 2008 and 2012. Two cyclists look on at the crash scene, which is in a notorious spot where six other cyclists have been killed or injured between 2008 and 2012 . The scene  in April when Victor Manuel Ben Rodriguez was killed after colliding with a lorry at the same spot . He added that Ludgate Circus had featured on Transport for London's original list of 100 junctions which it planned to overhaul following safety concerns, but that it had not featured on a revised list of 33 junctions where work would be carried out. People are now calling for something to be done and several have taken to Twitter in a bid to sort it out. Twitter users have called on Mayor of London Boris Johnson to do something about the junction . Jocelyn Bailey posted: 'Just walked past an awful bike v lorry incident at Ludgate Circus. How many times does this have to happen before we sort it out?' Callum Stott wrote: 'Horrible to hear of another HGV Vs Cyclist accident at Ludgate Circus again, sounds identical to the poor man who died there 3 months ago'. While others directed their tweets at Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. Sammy Lizard said: 'Boris you MUST step in the junction of Fleet & Ludgate Circus a killer for #cyclists stop anything turning at the junction!' Another tweeted him: 'another cyclist run over at Ludgate Circus. Twice in matter of months. Do something for cyclists & pedestrians.' The London Cycling Campaign wrote on their Facebook page: 'We're saddened to hear of a woman involved in a serious collision with an HGV at Ludgate Circus. 'We hope for the best for the victim and our thoughts are with her and her family.' A London Ambulance Service spokesman told the London Evening Standard: 'We were called at 11.30 to reports of a collision involving a lorry and a cyclist. 'A woman believed to be in her 20s was in cardiac arrest at the scene, and extensive efforts were made to resuscitate her. She was taken by ambulance to the Royal London Hospital as a priority.'

"The World Cup’s opening game will take place on Thursday without a proper test event that would meet UK legislation requirements at the newly-erected Arena de Sao Paulo. A junior game was held at the 61,000-seater ground on Sunday but the local fire department’s refusal to approve the temporary seating area that accounts for around 20,000 seats meant nobody could sit in that part of the ground. On Monday night FIFA were still preparing a statement on the situation but it is true that special machinery has been used to test the strength of the stand. Ready? The Arena de Sao Paulo stadium will host the opening game of the 2014 World Cup . Not long to go: A junior game was held at the stadium on Sunday . Working: With just two days to go before the World Cup kicks off, Brazil is racing to get its stadiums ready . Whether, however, that is representative of 20,000 football supporters at a match between hosts Brazil and Croatia remains to be seen. The tests the stadium has so far been subjected to certainly don’t meet standards in the UK. UK stadia are governed by ‘The Green Guide’, which is a range of legislation that forms the granting of a licence. Central to the process, say stadia experts in the UK, is ‘the testing of stadia life safety systems’. Early stages: Two people were killed by a collapsed crane during the stadium's construction . That involves holding an ‘appropriate number’ of test events with recommendations that they should be undertaken at 30 per cent capacity, 60 per cent capacity and a test event at or around 100 per cent. Even with temporary seating the strict rules apply. During the construction of the Arena de Sao Paulo two people were killed when a crane collapsed onto the roof. Workmen were still racing to finish the stadium on Monday, although it appeared to be little more than finishing touches. The Arena de Sao Paulo staged four test events at different capacities. The test events mainly serve to evaluate flows and test services for the spectators and the match operation. The license to operate the FIFA World Cup matches at the Arena de Sao Paulo as well as the safety and security licenses are due to be published tomorrow in line with standard Brazilian procedures. FIFA and the Local Organising Committee (LOC) rely on the urban mobility planning presented by host city Sao Paulo, which includes not only the usual means of transportation but also contingency plans in case of one of the modals is unavailable or partially working. What FIFA and the LOC always stress is the importance of fans to plan their way to the stadium and leave early for the match, what avoids arriving too close to kick-off and allow them to enjoy all the attractions offered at the stadium, which on 12 June will also include the opening ceremony, at 15.15. Pressure: Neymar and his Brazil team-mates open the World Cup with their game against Croatia on Thursday . Anticipation: Fans attempt to catch a peek of opening ceremony rehearsals .","Arena de Sao Paulo will host Brazil vs Croatia World Cup opener without a test taking place that would meet UK legislation .

"Everton manager Roberto Martinez admits West Ham counterpart Sam Allardyce may sometimes be criticised for his methods but fans have to accept he 'guarantees' results. This season Allardyce has added a more attacking element to his style to capitalise on the summer signings of Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho and that has taken the Hammers into the top four. The former Bolton, Newcastle and Blackburn boss has long been associated with a more direct brand of football which brought criticism from his own fans last season, when they finished 14th. Sam Allardyce (pictured) is a results man, according to Everton manager Roberto Martinez . At the end of last season, West Ham fans had lost patience with Allardyce, holding banners at matches . However, that appears to have been forgotten as wins against defending champions Manchester City and runners-up Liverpool have helped the side into the Champions League places. 'Sam is a very experienced manager who has been in this league for a long time,' said Martinez ahead of their meeting at Goodison Park on Saturday. 'He has been building clubs, coping with big expectations, but he always guarantees results. 'What he has done with West Ham this season is find a good balance of a side who can be difficult to play against but still really threaten in dead-ball situations but now they have brought in flair and players who can score goals out of nothing from open play and that is a really strong combination. 'In football you make your own choices and decisions and there are many styles you can play and it is up to fans to like or dislike that. 'Winning is important; for certain people in the game the only thing that matters is the result, for others who are a bit more romantic they appreciate more the way you win or the way you want to play than just the short-term result. Martinez (right) believes it can be a very successful season for West Ham, given their impressive start . Last time out, Everton's Leighton Baines (centre) scored a penalty as the Toffees drew 1-1 at Sunderland . 'I think it can be a really successful year for West Ham.' Martinez's concern as his side return from the international break looking to build on seven points from their last three matches is a growing injury list. He has 10 players undergoing treatment at the moment, among them left-back Leighton Baines and midfielders James McCarthy, Gareth Barry and Steven Pienaar. With Baines rated 'touch and go' and John Stones, Antolin Alcaraz and Bryan Oviedo all out, it is likely Martinez will have to tinker with his defence with Luke Garbutt in line for his first Premier League start after a one-minute debut as a substitute in April. 'We have a large squad. I feel they are coping well with the demands we have this season,' said the Spaniard. West Ham have had a brilliant start to the season, and sit fourth in the Premier League table . Diafra Sakho (left) pictured scoring at Manchester City at Upton Park - West Ham won the game 2-1 . 'It is nothing different. The team is ready to adapt and cope with variations. 'We have options; Luke Garbutt has been playing really well behind the scenes with the Under-21s.' At the other end of the scale former academy graduate Leon Osman is set to make his 400th appearance for the club, joining just a dozen players, including the likes of Neville Southall, Brian Labone and Dave Watson, who have reached the landmark. 'It is so difficult to find such a loyal footballer who can also cope with the demands of the modern game,' said Martinez. 'You need to swim against the current because there are so many forces taking you away from spending 10 years at one football club. 'I think Leon Osman and Tony Hibbert are two big pillars for us in the way they have come through the academy, devoted their careers to the club and they are true Evertonians.'","Everton host West Ham at Goodison Park on Saturday afternoon .

"A shooting sent terrified patrons scrambling from a Miami nightclub early Sunday and left 15 people wounded, including an 11-year-old child, authorities said. When Miami police and rescue crews arrived at a club called The Spot around 1am, they said they found chaos among the large throng of adults and teenagers gathered there. Rescuers found wounded people inside and outside the club, some too hurt to flee, Miami Fire Rescue Capt. Ignatius Carroll said. The first emergency crews arriving on the scene were warned to use caution 'because there was still active shooting taking place in the area,' Carroll said. At least one person was reported in critical condition but the extent of the other injuries wasn't immediately known. Emergency personnel wheel a victim of the shooting in Miami's The Spot nightclub . It's unclear how many shooters there were and what caused the shooting at The Spot in Miami . Some people were running, 'people were screaming, people were saying they were shot,' Carroll said, adding others were yelling for help for friends who had been shot. One male was found unresponsive and not breathing when emergency responders arrived. Five girls between 11 and 17 years old also suffered gunshot wounds, Carroll said. Details were sparse in the hours after the shooting. Investigators sought to piece together what happened in what was described as a scene of confusion. 'The investigators are still interviewing witnesses,' police spokeswoman Frederica Burden said. 'They're going from hospital to hospital.' She said it was not immediately clear who or how many fired weapons and what prompted the gunfire. No arrests or suspects had been reported by Sunday afternoon. Authorities said there were many young people at the site. At least three of those hurt were transferred to a pediatric unit. 'What was very surprising to the responders was that these were kids that were out at 1 o'clock in the morning in a club and this type of violence took place where a bunch of kids were gathering ... it's very disturbing to see that,' Carroll said. A spokeswoman for Jackson Memorial Hospital said she did not have permission from the victims to release their conditions. Emergency personnel tend to the wounded outside The Spot, a nightclub in Miami, where a shooting broke out early Sunday morning . Authorities said they are investigating what type of club The Spot is and why so many underage children were there. 'Was it a private party, was it open to the public, that's what we're trying to figure out,' said Officer Burden. Fire Rescue officials also will follow up with the venue to determine whether it's a teen club, whether it's licensed as a club for regular gatherings or whether this was an informal event, Carroll said. A phone number for the club was out of service. Early Sunday, police and other emergency officials cordoned off the outside of the club with yellow crime scene tape and police crowded the entrance to the club. Emergency vehicles also blocked the roadway for hours. Fifteen people were wounded in the shooting, including an 11-year-old girl .

"Stuart Pearce claims Jack Wilshere won’t even kick a ball for England at the World Cup. The former England Under-21 coach claims the Arsenal midfielder is short of form and confidence ahead of the opening game against Italy in Manaus on Saturday. Pearce told talkSPORT: ‘I think there are five players that will not kick a ball at the World Cup. Forster and Foster are the obvious ones and I think Shaw, Smalling and Wilshere will be the others. Bench mark? Jack Wilshere will not get any playing time at the World Cup, according to Stuart Pearce . 'I think he [Wilshere] is very, very short of form. Watching the last game [against Honduras] I didn’t see a Wilshere that sprung on the scene many months ago.

"An innocent Easter egg hunt took a horrific turn when a mother followed a foul smell coming form under her house - and found a rotting corpse. Tara Hanouskova, from Knoxville, Tennessee, was hunting for chocolate eggs in her back garden with her four-year-old son when she was struck by the odour. She had noticed a smell earlier in the week that seemed to be getting progressively worse, but had been unable to pinpoint the source until that moment. Chilling find: The mother found the body under her house during an Easter egg hunt with her four-year-old child . She told WNCT that the smell had been neither consistent nor strong, and until that day had not been so bad she'd been compelled to find the source. 'I really don't even know how he got there,' she said. Luckily, she was able to get her special needs son back in the house before he saw anything traumatic. 911 dispatchers even notified police and fire that this was a sensitive situation, and emergency responders were careful not to use sirens or lights. 'They were very respectful; they tread lightly,' Hanouskova told reporters. 'My son has no idea what happened.' Homeowner Tara Hanouskova said she had no idea how the body could have ended up under her home . As Hanouskova's son is a special-needs child, responders were careful not to use lights or sirens, and called as little attention as possible to what was happening . Tests . later revealed that the body of a middle-aged man had been there for . around two weeks. According to the WBIR TV station, the fateful easter egg hunt took place on Wednesday evening, with the rotting body being found at around 7.20pm. The body was so badly decomposed that it could not be immediately identified. Police said that the man was carrying no identification, and that it was impossible to take fingerprints at the scene. The 5'4"" man had no scars of tattoos and weighed some 170 pounds. He had brown hair and brown eyes. It also emerged that a gardener who visited the house to cut the grass - who was even asked to investigate the smell - also failed to track down the body. The body was reportedly found underneath decking, which was large and close to the ground. The corpse was around 20 feet from the outer edge of the dark and narrow space underneath. Foul odour: Police estimate that the body had been under the house for around two weeks . What lies beneath: The woman found the body, some 20 feet away from the edge of the decking . Preliminary autopsy results have led police to believe the man died of a medical condition, but they are waiting for confirmation before describing the death definitively as 'natural'. Investigators still don't know the identity of the body because they had little to go on during the initial discovery. The man didn't have identification and the body had decomposed to the point police couldn't take point fingerprints in the field.According to police, the man did not match any descriptions for missing people in the area.","Woman was playing with her child in Knoxville, Tennessee, on Wednesday .

Comparing the popularity of wine and beer around the world in 2013, the Comparecamp.com graphic reveals overall, drinkers prefer hops to grapes, with 187bn litres of the brew being drunk versus wine's 24bn litres - or two bottles of beer per one glass of wine. Andorra came second in the list of the biggest wine drinkers, followed by France, St Pierre & Miquelon and Slovenia - with the US appearing in 56th place. And while it may seem as though its the Brits who love a pint, the study reveals the Czech Republic is world's biggest beer consumer, with 235 litres of beer drunk per person every year. Austria, Germany, Estonia and Poland make up the top five - with the US in 14th place. The US came out on top as the world's number one wine market, followed by France, Italy, Germany and the UK. Barleywine comes out as the most drunk beer in the world at 15 per cent, followed by stout (10 per cent), and India Pale Ale (seven per cent).

"Every family has their own approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition - and the Obamas are no different. Appearing on The Chew this afternoon, the First Lady revealed all the ways she makes sure her family eats healthily - from making time for sit-down dinners all together to requiring her daughters to finish their vegetables. And when it comes to dessert, 16-year-old Malia and 13-year-old Sasha have been trained to only have them on weekends.

"With just weeks to go for many to claim their holiday entitlement, research has revealed that British workers allow 60 million days to go to waste - worth a staggering £5.37bn. For two in five of us, the holiday year runs from January to December, meaning time is running out to take that winter break. Only half of all employees - falling to a third of those aged 18-24 - have claimed all the holiday due to them in their last full holiday year. Almost half of the working population will lose an average of six days paid holiday a year . Forty-four per cent of the survey's respondents were in full-time employment, thus qualifying for at least 28 days' statutory leave per annum. They lost around six days' paid leave, which is worth £542.40 based on the average weekly earnings of employees in Britain. The same pattern is emerging for the current holiday year – with an average of over seven days still due to employees and little compensation if they cannot take their full entitlement. Only 10 per cent of respondents said that their employer has agreed to pay them in lieu of lost days. Seventeen per cent said they are too busy at work to take time off and a further 16 per cent said that their employer makes it difficult for them to take their full entitlement. The problem becomes more marked for two in five workers (42 per cent) whose holiday year runs from January to December. The survey found that those employees have an average of 5.5 days' leave due to them before their entitlement runs out in less than two months' time. One in five still have 10 or more days of holiday entitlement left. Thirty-one per cent of people on a January-December holiday year plan to get away in December . For many who intend not to lose their entitlement, booking a December trip away could be just the tonic - but again it's best to do your research. Tenerife: Interpalace Hotel, Puerto de la Cruz .

Cost Comparison of a seven-night B&B flight-inclusive package for one with resort meals/drinks . The Post Office Travel Money Holiday Entitlement Report reveals that 31 per cent of those whose current holiday year ends in December plan to use some or all of their entitlement on holidays before then. Although people with paid leave to take before the end of December set a generous average holiday budget of £638 per person – rising to £1,000 or more for one in five (22 per cent), separate Post Office Travel Money research found that people would be better off to travel early in December rather than over the festive season. A week away over Christmas and Boxing Day to four destinations rated among the cheapest in the Post Office's recent Winter Sunshine Report was found to cost 43-52 per cent more than it would earlier in the month.

"The changing of the guard. Adios Espana. Gone but never forgotten after six sensational years of  tiki-taka delight. Spain’s sell-by date turned out to be June 2014. Hopefully Brazil will flicker only momentarily across our short-term memory and we will wind back the clock to Euro 2008, South Africa 2010, and to Euro 2012. Two-time champions of Europe, first-time champions of the world and playing a brand of football that involved pass after pass after pass then boom. Four years on: Iker Casillas lifts the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after beating Holland in the final . Delight: The Spanish captain lifts the European Championship trophy in 2008 (left) and 2012 . Not everyone’s cup of tea, which is why some may delight in the demise of La Roja and their frills. Hopefully, most will reserve a nod of respect for the legacy left by the delightful dancing, swirling matadors. Football historians of the future will certainly be able to pigeon hole the second decade of this century into its own unique category. Just as professionals were getting taller, bigger, more muscly, along came these smaller, trickier, talented players. They put the fizz into physical and the result was a joy to watch. Every so often a generation is born at a club, which then becomes the core of a national side. Spain’s identity became intertwined with Barcelona, a triumph for the Catalans. Suddenly a country which had gone 44 years without winning a major trophy were beginning to look the business. Six years ago Spain sliced a swathe through Austria and Switzerland with Luis Aragones at the helm. Andres Iniesta, Xavi, Fernando Torres, David Silva, all young and hungry, were unstoppable. Italy were shoved aside in the quarter-finals on penalties, Russia in the semi, which left the mighty Germans standing in the way. Dink! Fernando Torres scored a superb goal for the Spaniards against Germany in the Euro 2008 final . Bosh! Andres Iniesta smashed home an screaming winner against Holland in the 2010 World Cup final . Xavi created the first-half opening for Torres with his chip and the Chelsea striker got the better of Philip Lahm to beat Jens Lehmann. A seismic shock went through world football. The World Cup was a whole other ball game, though. Once again Spain did not disappoint as they became the only European team to win the Jules Rimet trophy. Iniesta scored the extra time decider while Iker Casillas won the golden gloves for conceding just two goals and David Villa won the silver boot. Barcelona were ruling in La Liga and Europe and Spain were conquering the world thanks to the pass masters plus a heartbeat from inspirational defender Carles Puyol, he of the frizzy hair. The centre half could score a goal, too. Remember the thumping header from Xavi’s corner which beat Germany in the semi-final in South Africa? Two years ago Iniesta was voted player of the tournament at Euro 2012 as the Spanish armada sailed through to their third consecutive title. Bang! Defender Carles Puyol scored a thumping header against Germany in the 2010 semi-final . It was glorious to watch. David Silva’s tricks, Cesc Fabregas’s runs, Juan Mata and Torres coming off the bench to score in the last few minutes of the final against Italy. Last season Barcelona’s standards slipped. The mirror image that is the national team have been a shadow of themselves too. It’s been a privilege, though. Goalkeeper Casillas, who made major errors in the two defeats, appeared heart-broken as he begged: ‘We ask people’s forgiveness.  We are responsible but also the first ones to feel the pain. The exit was treated as a tragedy in the Spanish media - Madrid sports daily Marca's headline was ""The End - a lamentable end to a glorious era for La Roja"". Not up for it? Xabi Alonso admitted that the Spanish players didn't have the hunger at the World Cup . Xabi Alsonso, formerly of Liverpool and now of Real Madrid, also admitted that Spain were not hungry enough and too many players were unhappy. What an indictment. ‘I believe that we haven't been able to maintain the same levels of conviction, of hunger. The success, the happiness of before is gone, it's run out and we haven't been able to keep it going. ‘It's a completely unexpected failure but that is sport. These things happen. It was unexpected but we have to take the great sadnesses in the same way as we take the great joys, as men. ‘It hurts our pride a lot, but this is football. But as I said, we've known how to win and now we have to know how to lose. Trouble: Spain were dumped out early of this month's tournament over in Brazil after two defeats . ‘We've made lots of mistakes, we've lost a bit of our know-how, and we've paid for it with our solidity that had helped us win so many games. ‘Eras end with defeats... and this was a painful defeat. Mentally we weren't ready, physically maybe the same but, putting that all together, we weren't in the best shape. 'Then we have played against teams that were well-prepared and at their peak, and now we're going home.’ Not yet. Curitiba next Monday awaits. Hopefully Spain can make it a send-off to savour, even if it is ultimately meaningless.

"Former British Airways pilot Bartle Frere has been found guilty of soliciting sex from boys in India . A disgraced former British Airways pilot is facing jail after being found guilty of soliciting sex from children during stopovers in exotic locations. Bartle Frere, a captain with the airline, was convicted of two counts of arranging to meet boys for sex while on layovers in India. He was also found guilty of having six DVDs of naked Ukranian boys at his home in Shipton Gorge, Dorset. He now faces a re-trial on 17 other charges, including five of performing sex acts on a boy under 16 in Dorset between 2001 and 2003, after the jury were unable to reach a verdict. Police arrested Frere, a longhaul pilot, on November 10 last year as he arrived back in the UK following a flight to Bangkok, Thailand. During the trial at Bournemouth Crown Court, jurors were told how Frere, 50, had messaged boys in India using social network Facebook in 2007 and 2008. The messages were found on his computer when police raided his home the day before his arrest. They seized his mobile phone and it was alleged that the day before his arrest he had searched the internet for the term ‘where to pick up underage boys in Bangkok’. During the prosecution’s opening speech, Elizabeth Bussey-Jones told the court said: 'Conversations sent electronically indicated he was meeting these boys during his role as a pilot. 'In one . string of messages he apologises to one boy for not coming to Chennai . but said he was trying to swap his flights with another pilot. 'Mr Frere wrote: ""I want to hug you and have a bath with you and cuddle you in bed"".' Frere was also found guilty of six counts of possessing child . pornography after officers found DVDs of naked Ukrainian boys in his . attic. He now faces a retrial on 17 other counts . After Frere was arrested, detectives had . to call in MI5 to help crack the security codes to 25 different . heavily-encrypted storage devices at Frere’s home. Once . opened, investigators found video footage of one of the alleged UK . victims, indecent photographs of children, web searches for underage sex . websites and a copy of an infamous book related to paedophilia, the . court heard. Police also uncovered six different DVDs of naked boys at the house in the same raid. During . his defence Frere said he found young boys 'aesthetically pleasing' but . denied any sexual attraction, calling himself 'asexual'. Guilty: . Undecided: . He said he had sent the messages to the Indian boys to 'shock them' into realising how easily they could be preyed on. Frere, an amateur filmmaker, told police in an interview that he had bought the DVDs to study them artistically. The . jury of eight women and three men unanimously agreed Frere was guilty . of six counts of possessing indecent photographs of children. They found him guilty of arranging on two counts of facilitating the commission of child sex offence by a majority of 10-1. The . jury was then discharged after the foreman told the judge they would . not be able to reach a 10-1 majority verdict on 17 other charges. Addressing the jury, judge Peter Thompson said: “I discharge you from returning any further verdicts. 'It . is quite clear you have paid a great deal of attention to this case. There is no blame or shame to be felt by any of you that you have not . been able to find verdicts on the outstanding counts.' He told the CPS it has 14 days to inform the court if it intends to retry Frere, and that any trial would take place in 2015. Chris . Stopper, prosecuting, told the court he was '99 per cent certain' the . Crown Prosecution Service would seek a retrial on the outstanding . counts.

"George Osborne has found an unlikely ally in his party’s plans to reform the welfare system. Deirdre Kelly, who found fame as White Dee in the Channel 4 series Benefits Street, yesterday agreed the amount given in state handouts needs to ‘tighten up’. The single mother-of-two admitted she used to receive £212 a week to live on – and had more money in her pocket than some of her friends with full-time jobs. Scroll down for video . Deirdre Kelly, who found fame as White Dee in the Channel 4 series Benefits Street, yesterday agreed the amount given in state handouts needs to ‘tighten up’ after revealing she used to receive £212 a week . Miss Kelly, 43, who has not claimed benefits since May, was convicted of stealing more than £13,000 of taxpayers’ money meant for vulnerable residents while working at a local council. Since appearing on the documentary, she has gone on to star in reality TV shows and has been conducting numerous interviews about the welfare system while at the Conservative Party conference. When asked during an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme yesterday about the problem of people on welfare who found it was not worth their while to work, she said: ‘When I was part of the benefit system it worked out that I would have at the end of a week £212 – yeah, that’s cash. ‘I don’t know any of my friends who work 40-plus hours a week who have £212 in their pocket to spare. But obviously that’s not my fault. It’s the Government who decides how much the individual has to live on. So it does need tightening up.’ Asked what she thought of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and the Coalition’s reforms so far, she replied: ‘I don’t make much of it. He’s trying to get the taxpayers on side.’ Despite previously declaring herself a Labour supporter, she said of the party’s welfare policies: ‘I’ve not heard Labour say anything actually.’ 'I’ve not heard Labour say anything actually': Miss Kelly's assessment of the Opposition's benefits proposals . Miss Kelly angered taxpayers earlier this year after saying she would continue claiming until the Government stopped her. The Department for Work and Pensions met with her ‘showbiz agent’ in May after David Cameron warned she could lose her benefits if it was found she was earning a lot from her promotional work. She received more than £200 a week from a combination of employment and support allowance – formerly known as incapacity benefit – child tax credit and child benefit, plus £500 a month in housing benefit. A court heard she had worked as an administration assistant for her local authority in Birmingham for seven years but began stealing cash and cheques from a safe, while manipulating paperwork in an attempt to cover her tracks. She was caught after an internal audit. Miss Kelly claimed in court she had used the cash to feed her partner’s crack cocaine habit and pay household bills. The judge spared her a jail sentence only because she had no previous convictions and to ensure her children were not put in care. She received a suspended sentence and was ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work. At the conference, Miss Kelly told a fringe event she was considering voting Ukip in next year’s election. She added: ‘[Nigel] Farage doesn’t seem to be doing a bad job.’ When it was pointed out that Ukip leader Mr Farage had not set out a full set of welfare policies, she said: ‘He’s been clever then hasn’t he? He’s leaving it to everyone else to dig a big hole for themselves and then he’ll swoop in and take over.’ Miss Kelly said it had been a ‘privilege’ to speak at the event on Monday night, but accused one audience member of being ‘downright rude’ after he asked her: ‘Why should people like you get fags and booze on the State?’","Deirdre Kelly spoke at a fringe event held by the Policy Exchange think tank .

"We all indulge in a few wintry treats at Christmas. There’s the plum pudding, the sticky mince pies – and this year, the seasonal fresh fruit. An extraordinarily mild December has brought an unexpected crop of raspberries, while wild garlic is also starting to grow. Mild: The relatively warm weather has encouraged raspberry bushes to grow fruit several months early; horticulturalist Steve England is pictured with a plant he found in Stoke Park, Bristol . Unusual: The plant was apparently 'tricked' into thinking that it was already spring . Gardener Steve England spotted a raspberry bush with red berries – and said more apples have stayed on the trees than usual. He said: ‘We were stopped in our tracks when we saw a raspberry bush with lots of bright red fruits. ‘We all had a single refreshing  and tasty out-of-season raspberry, and went home full of the joys  of spring. Delicious: Mr English enjoyed the out-of-season snack on his walk through a park in Bristol . Bud: This wild garlic was also growing, well in advance of when it would usually appear . ‘The trees are also completely laden with apples – I’ve never seen anything like it.’ Mr England was leading a wildlife walk in Stoke Park in Bristol. He . said: ‘One of the first things we spotted was the Arum Lily, also . called the Lords and Ladies, and it should be fast asleep at the moment. Then we came across some wild garlic beginning to grow.’ The amateur . naturalist said that when cold does set in, it will have disastrous . consequences because wildlife is ‘being tricked into thinking that . spring has arrived early’. He added: ‘Regardless of the time of year, . as soon as the soil temperature reaches 16C (61F) and above, seeds will . start to grow. Harvest: An apple tree in Bristol was laden with fruit thanks to the unseasonable warmth . Orchard: The fruit has appeared because of the warmth of the soil, but will probably die again soon . ‘Sadly when we do experience cold temperatures, and . we will, the plants that have sprouted will be killed off by the frost. Then they will not re-grow until next spring.’ There have also been . unseasonable reports of butterflies at Lower Way lakes in Thatcham, . Berkshire.

"A gay couple were forced off a bus after the driver branded them 'not real men' as he delivered a tirade of homophobic abuse after he spotted them kissing. Jack James, 23, had been travelling through London on his way home from work when he was ordered off the bus after his partner gave him a light kiss. He said the driver of the London bus told the couple it was disgusting and kicked them off, saying 'my bus, my rules.' The abuse is the latest in a series of homophobic incidents, and follows a mass kiss-in staged in Sainsbury's in Brighton last month, after a lesbian couple claim they were asked to leave because they were spotted kissing. Scroll down for video . The gay couple were asked to leave the number 89 bus as they travelled through Blackheath, south London . The abuse is the latest in a series of homophobic incidents as protesters staged a kiss-in in earlier this month (above) after a lesbian couple were asked to leave a Sainsbury's store in Brighton allegedly for kissing . Transport for London said it was investigating the incident on the bus and studying CCTV footage. Mr James, an events coordinator from Greenwich, told the Evening Standard: 'This type of homophobic bullying cannot be tolerated. 'I am considering making a complaint to the police about this.' He said the abuse started when the couple were travelling on the number 89 bus near Blackheath, at about 10.30pm on October 8. Mr James said they were ordered off the bus after his partner gave him a peck on the lips and the driver started shouting and swearing, saying 'I don't want to watch that.' Confused, the couple confronted the driver to ask if he was talking to them when it stopped at the next stop. He replied that he was, and told them they were disgusting. 'Once we got off the bus we were fuming and I was shaking,' said Mr James. 'The bus stopped again and he shouted and told us we were not real men and we should f*** off.” Shoppers watched as a couple kissed in store as part of the kiss-in protest at the supermarket in Brighton . The kiss-in was held after Annabelle Sacher and her partner were asked to leave the Sainsbury's supermarket . Ken Davidson, TfL’s Head of Bus Operations, said: 'All customers have the right to use our services without fear of being abused and offensive behaviour is completely unacceptable.' He said the matter was being thoroughly investigated. The incident comes after protesters staged a mass kiss-in in a Sainsbury's store in Brighton earlier this month after a lesbian couple were asked to leave the store. Annabelle Sacher and her girlfriend were asked to leave the shop after a customer complained when she saw the student give her girlfriend a spontaneous peck on the cheek. The customer had complained she found the lesbian kiss 'disgusting' and was concerned for her child, and Miss Sacher and her partner were asked to leave. The row began on National Coming Out Day and led to criticism from gay rights campaigners. Sainsbury's apologised after the incident and promised it would not happen again. A spokesman said that the security guard had not told Miss Sacher to leave, but had asked her to stop kissing. The supermarket has made a donation to a charity of Miss Sacher’s choice.

Mrs Wilkinson was ordered to pay £3,600 in damages for discriminating directly against the couple, who have been together for eight years.

"A rapper known as 'Big Paybacc' was shot and killed inside a Mcdonald's in California on Thursday as he sat and ate a meal in the fast food restaurant. The 38-year-old whose real name is Habeeb Ameer Zekajj, was reportedly eating lunch in the restaurant in Palmdale, when someone came into the restaurant and shot him once. Sheriff’s homicide detectives responded just before 12:30 pm to the restaurant in the 37200 block of 47th Street East, officials said.

According to eyewitnesses,  there were about 15 people  inside the restaurant at the time of the murder. LA County Sheriff’s Department Lt. John Corina told reporters: 'There was no altercation.

It wasn’t like he shot up the McDonald’s. He just shot him and left.' Meanwhile, his distraught girlfriend Jessica Jefferson said Zekajj has left behind three children.

She added: 'For them to be that bold to run up to someone in a McDonald’s in daylight, in front of people, kids you know, and to just take some kind of vengeance on somebody, it’s, it’s inhumane.' And despite his image as a tough gangster rapper she wants people to know he was a really nice person.

"Royal pursuit: Prince Charles is a well-known country sports enthusiast . Licensed gun owners have expressed outrage over a new hotline which the public can call if they suspect neighbours with firearms are terrorists. The new Crimestoppers number has also raised fears that it will be used by animal rights activists to make false accusations against country sports enthusiasts, whose numbers include members of the Royal Family, such as Prince Charles. The Home Office-approved measure is designed to encourage anonymous tip-offs about individuals at risk of criminal or terrorist behaviour. Andy Marsh, the Association of Chief Police Officers’ firearms spokesman, has called on members of the public, including shooting enthusiasts, to help police gather intelligence about possible extremists with access to firearms. He said: ‘If you are concerned that guns are being kept insecurely or notice signs that shooters may be vulnerable to criminal or terrorist groups or have shown sympathy towards extremist acts, please report it.’ But the Countryside Alliance condemned the move as ‘an unwarranted attack on shooting’ and fears the hotline will lead to law-abiding citizens being wrongfully branded terrorists. The organisation also insists there has not been one case of a lawful gun owner being radicalised to take part in terrorist activity, or any problem with the theft of licensed firearms. Alliance chiefs condemned the hotline as ‘a waste of time and money and an unwarranted attack on shooting’ and said it could be used by activists to make false accusations. Concerns: The new Crimestoppers number has  raised fears that it will be used by animal rights activists to make false accusations against country sports enthusiasts . Tim Bonner, director of campaigns, said he hoped to mobilise the country’s licensed gun owners to lobby the Government to drop the scheme. He said the campaign was ‘unjustified and ill-judged, and it will serve only to waste police resources and alienate a large and law-abiding section of the community’. He added: ‘We have not been made aware of a single recent incident in which a licence holder has misused a firearm in pursuit of an extremist agenda.’","Licensed gun owners express outrage over new Crimestoppers hotline .

"Roy Keane’s criticism of Everton is ‘nonsense’, according to Roberto Martinez. Keane irritated Everton manager Martinez after claiming last weekend he puts pressure on his players not to represent the Republic of Ireland, using James McCarthy and Seamus Coleman as examples. McCarthy has a hamstring problem that prevented him featuring in Ireland’s recent fixtures and is likely to stop him playing in Saturday's Goodison match against West Ham.

Normally with these injuries they clear between eight and 10 days but you are injured.’ James McCarthy (left) missed both of Ireland's recent games after being injured against Sunderland . The added sensitivity around the issue is that McCarthy was born in Scotland and Martinez feels Keane’s comments have created an unnecessary issue. Martinez added: ‘If there is an issue it should be treated with respect, and privately, to try to get to the bottom of it. 'To come out and make things public could (have) some of the Irish fans thinking that the players don’t want to play, or that Everton have stopped some players from playing. That’s nonsense.

"Claire Allnutt died when a dirty drip, which was administering antibiotics, was left in her arm for four days, triggering deadly blood poisoning . A woman who was recovering from a flesh-eating bug died in hospital due to the NHS's failure to provide a full service at weekend, her parents have claimed. Claire Allnutt had been in hospital for two months where she was being treated for the infection necrotising fasciitis. The 28-year-old died when a dirty drip, which was administering antibiotics, was left in her arm for four days, triggering deadly blood poisoning. An inquest heard a junior doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital spotted fungal spores in the tube carrying the drugs to Miss Allnutt's arm on a Friday. But it was not removed until the following Tuesday, the coroner was told. Observation notes showed Miss Allnutt's condition worsened over the weekend, but medics decided to monitor her and no action was taken until the Tuesday. By that time, life-threatening blood poisoning had set in. Miss Allnutt suffered several heart attacks before she passed away in the early hours of the following morning. A coroner heard the 28-year-old, who had learning difficulties, had initially refused to consent to the tube being withdrawn because she had a phobia of needles. The inquest was told Miss Allnutt's condition worsened over the weekend, but senior sister Julie Caunt told the court there 'was never a sense of urgency' about her treatment. Miss Allnutt's temperature had risen to 39C over the weekend and her blood pressure had decreased to a worrying level. The coroner said part of the issue was that the infection was spotted on a Friday which he said was the 'worst time for this to happen'. Medical director Dr Mark Patten, from Luton & Dunstable Hospital, told the hearing Ms Allnutt's death 'led to a lot of soul searching at the hospital about the prevention of infection'. But her family questioned why a specially-trained nurse for patients with special needs, who had helped Miss Allnutt in the past, was not called. Her parents added they were not contacted about her deteriorating condition - and said the tube should have been removed sooner. After the inquest her father Richard Allnutt, 61, a site manager, accused the NHS of only working a five day week and said the family was considering legal action. He said: 'It is clear to us that the NHS only seems to work Monday to Friday. 'On the Friday it was known that the line had to be removed, but it wasn't until the following Tuesday that it happened.' He added: 'It was extremely hard to hear all the details of it in court today and I am amazed that so many people were involved. Miss Allnut's mother Ann, 57, a hospital ward clerk, said: 'It was three months of torment for us. 'We saw her recovering and we thought there was light at the end of the tunnel - but then she dies from something that was completely avoidable. 'It is heartbreaking for us a family.' Bedfordshire and Luton coroner Tom Osborne said medical staff failed to communicate with each other effectively. He said: 'On January 24 a PICC line became infected and microbiologists advised it should be removed. An inquest heard a junior doctors at the Luton and Dunstable Hospital spotted fungal spores in the tube carrying the drugs to Miss Allnutt's arm on a Friday. But it was not removed until the following Tuesday . 'There was a failure to remove the the line until January 28, but by then she had developed sepsis. 'There was also a failure in monitoring the deterioration of the condition.' He added: 'What had happened here is a clear indication you can have ipads and modern technology and super drugs. 'But at the end of the day medicine is not about that, it's about medication.' The hospital has admitted failing Miss Allnutt and bosses said they have since implemented changes. Microbiologists at the hospital will now speak directly to consultants, rather than junior doctors when discussing infections. The hospital has also raised awareness of sepsis and how to monitor it more carefully. Nurses are now required to record the condition of drip lines in patients daily to avoid the infection becoming fatal. A spokesman for Luton and Dunstable Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We have given an unreserved apology to Claire Allnutt's family following her tragic death last January. 'Since then, the hospital has carried out a thorough investigation to understand the reasons for Claire's untimely death and to assist the Coroner's inquest. 'The hospital has learned from the events that occurred prior to Claire's death and has introduced a number of changes in practice, which have since been implemented and are being constantly monitored and evaluated.' Miss Allnutt, from Luton, Bedfordshire, leaves her partner David Stickley, 32.","Claire Allnutt was recovering after suffering necrotising fasciitis .

"Ryanair has lost its appeal against a £6million penalty that was levied against the no-frills airline for violating France’s labour laws. The Dublin-based carrier was previously found guilty of hiring and paying local staff from Marseille under Irish contracts to save money on taxes. Instead of paying up to 45 per cent in social charges – the normal figure in France – Ryanair paid just 10.75 per cent in Irish charges. Ryanair has lost its appeal against a £6million penalty for breaching France's employment laws . In their decision to throw out Ryanair’s case, appeal court judges agreed with a lower court’s ruling that Ryanair was guilty of ‘clear social dumping’ and that the case was ‘an issue of unfair competition against other airlines that respect national legislation.’ The decision was hailed by Jean-Victor Borel, lawyer for France’s Ursaff social security collecting agency, who said: ‘The message of the court is clear. European law is not an instrument designed to defraud the social security’. Ryanair’s actual fine was £167,000 but it was also ordered to pay £6.3million in damages and interest to unpaid social security agencies. The airline had profits of nearly £450million in the last financial year. But it appears the court battle will have another chapter as Europe’s largest low-cost airline has instructed its lawyers to immediately appeal the ruling by the Marseille courts to the French Supreme Court. In a statement, Ryanair said the ruling is contrary to EU law on mobile transport workers and follows similar cases against easyJet in 2010 and Cityjet and Vueling in 2012. The airline said it will also appeal any attempt by the French authorities to seek double payment of social insurance payments which have already been fully paid in Ireland ‘in respect of work which takes place entirely on Irish aircraft and therefore on Irish territory.’ Ryanair had four planes and 127 employees at Marseille Provence Airport (Marignane) Ryanair spokesman Robin Kiely said: ‘Ryanair will appeal this ruling to the French Supreme Court on the basis that European employment law clearly allows mobile workers on Irish registered aircraft to pay their taxes and social taxes in Ireland. ‘We will also be seeking a referral to the European Court of Justice to prevent these attempts by the French authorities to claim social taxes that have already been paid in full to Ireland.’ Rival airline easyJet has already been give fines of more than £1million for the same offence. Ryanair had four planes and 127 employees at Marseille Provence Airport (Marignane) without applying French employment laws or filling out tax declarations in the country. The Dublin-based carrier has instructed its lawyers to immediately appeal the decision to France's top court . Prosecutors had even urged the Aix-en-Provence court to symbolically confiscate four Boeing 737s based at the site - a request which was refused. The civil plaintiffs in the case, which include a pilots' union and a pensions fund, were seeking more than £8million in damages. Roland Rappaport, a lawyer for the SNPL pilots' union, had urged the court to 'make an example' of Ryanair in its ruling. Prosecutors said there was no doubt Ryanair was operating in France, given that it had material and staff based permanently at the airport, and its employees lived in the area.","No-frills carrier was found guilty of paying local staff under Irish contracts .

"The camp site of suspected cop killer Eric Frein has been discovered by Pennsylvania police, narrowing their manhunt to one square mile-and-a-half are in Monroe County. Two days after the campsite was discovered littered with a stash of food, ammo, clothing, and other supplies that were confiscated by police, there was also a sighting of Frein reported. However Pennsylvania State Police spokeswoman Trooper Connie Devens said the identification was not positive. 'The search teams are following up on a possible sighting by law enforcement in the area from earlier this afternoon,' she said. 'And other teams that are searching in other areas of Price and Barrett Townships.' The camp site of suspected cop killer Eric Frein has been discovered by Pennsylvania police, narrowing their manhunt to one square mile-and-a-half are in Monroe County . ABC News reports that authorities also found more than 90 rounds of ammunition for a .308 rifle last week. That weapon is the same gun that Frein allegedly used to ambush two state troopers on Sept. 21, leaving one dead and the other wounded. 'One of the things he seems to be surviving on predominantly would be cans of tuna fish and ramen noodles,' said Lr. Col. George Bivens. Bivens said seizing these supplies is crucial, as Frein does not appear to be trying to live off the land. Police believe they've found most of Frein's food and that he is not trying or able to live off the land . 'I believe his food is running out and we've seized a big amount of it,' he said. They have also found empty cigarette packs, an AK-47, even more ammo, and two pipe bombs. Frein learned how to shoot form his father, who is a retired Army major, and is a self-trained survivalist. He is also a reenactor with a special interest in Eastern European military and weapons.","Eric Frein is accused of ambushing two police, leaving one dead and the other wounded .

"A Methodist pastor who was disciplined after he officiated at the wedding of his gay son will be allowed to remain an ordained minister. The Judicial Council of the nation's second-largest Protestant denomination ruled on Monday that a Pennsylvania church jury was wrong to defrock Frank Schaefer last year after he refused to promise that he would never perform another same-sex wedding. The council ruled on technical grounds and did not express support for gay marriage in general. Its decision is final. Methodist pastor Frank Schaefer, who was disciplined after he officiated at the wedding of his gay son in 2007, will now be allowed to remain an ordained minister on technical grounds (Photo June 24) Reached by phone after the decision, Schaefer called it 'amazing.' He said he was pleased, 'not just for myself, but for everyone in the LGBTQ community and the church. 'This is a positive decision that keeps the dialogue going. They didn't bar a person who is an outspoken activist and who has said that, if asked, he would perform another gay marriage.' Although the United Methodist Church has welcomed gay and lesbian members, the church's Book of Discipline rejects sex outside of heterosexual marriage as 'incompatible with Christian teaching.' Since his church trial, Schaefer has become a gay rights activist, galvanizing other Methodists who support full inclusion of gays and lesbians in the church. Following his hearing before the Judicial Council on Wednesday, Schaefer said he had no regrets for his actions. Rev. Frank Schaefer, center, and his son, Tim Schaefer, second from left, walk to a meeting of the Judicial Council of the United Methodist Church, in Memphis, Tenn., on Wednesday 22 Oct . When his son first came out to him as gay, Schaefer said he learned that church doctrine had made his son believe he could not go to heaven. 'He did not want to live any more. He was in so much pain,' Schaefer said. So when his son asked Schaefer to officiate at his wedding, the minister accepted. 'I did what I did based on my heart and my conscience.' However, Schaefer hid his son's 2007 wedding from his conservative Pennsylvania congregation. The small, private ceremony was held in a restaurant in Massachusetts, where gay marriage had been legal for three years. Schaefer's actions did not become public until 2013, after a member of his congregation learned of the wedding and filed a complaint. Rev. Frank Schaefer, center, arrives for a meeting of the Judicial Council of the United Methodist Church on Wednesday. He was suspended and defrocked in 2013 for officiating at his son's wedding to another man . The United Methodist Church, with more than 12 million members worldwide, has been debating its policy on same-sex relationships for four decades, but recently frustration with the current policy has fueled a movement to openly defy church law. Meanwhile, supporters of the church's stance on same-sex relationships have been pressing church leaders to punish ministers who violate church law. And some conservative pastors have called for a breakup of the denomination, saying the split over gay marriage is irreconcilable. In its Monday decision, the Judicial Council noted that some might view the decision as a 'flagrant disregard' for church discipline, while others will support it. 'We are mindful of the divisions within our church,' the decision reads. The council essentially found that Schaefer was subjected to two distinct punishments. First, he was given a 30-day suspension. Tim Schaefer, right, the gay son of Rev. Frank Schaefer, and his mother, Brigitte, sit together at a hearing for his father before the Judicial Council of the United Methodist Church last Wednesday in Memphis . Then, he was defrocked after he would not promise to uphold the church's Book of Discipline 'in its entirety.' That second punishment was wrongfully imposed for a possible future violation. The Rev. Christopher Fisher, who argued before the Judicial Council that the church jury was within its rights to defrock Schaefer, said he was disappointed in the decision. 'I understand the legal technicality they have hinged it on,' he said. But he also said that it was not clear to the church jury that the penalty they imposed was not allowed. Schaefer, who was transferred to a California ministry in July, hopes the church will change its stance at its next General Conference in 2016. In the meantime, he has been traveling the country giving talks and sermons on gay acceptance. Last month, he released a book about his experience - Defrocked: How A Father's Act Of Love Shook The United Methodist Church.","Methodist pastor Frank Schaefer will be allowed to remain an ordained minister - the Judicial Council ruled on technical grounds .

"Three years since it was discovered during excavations on an ancient cemetery, a rare bronze Roman cockerel has been given a permanent home. The 2nd century figurine is believed to be one of only nine ever found in the Roman Empire, and is part of a new exhibition at the Corinium Museum in the Cirencester. Other finds on display include a hoard of almost 1,500 Roman coins, and the perfectly preserved vase it was found in. This bronze and enamel cockerel was found in a child's grave in Roman Cirencester in 2011 - and has been painstakingly restored. It is now on display at the Corinium Museum . Archaeologists made the discoveries three years ago while excavating a western cemetery at the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester - or Corinium as it was known when it was the second largest town in Roman Britain. The bronze and enamel cockerel was said to have been placed in the grave of the two-year-old Roman . girl by her parents, and experts believe it was used to ask the Gods to protect her. They also . believe the expensive gift was placed in the grave to ease their daughter's transition into the 'next world'. The child was buried wearing hobnailed . shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel, and the remarkable . enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green. There is a separately moulded tail plate, also enamelled, with ‘openwork’ decoration. The beak is shown open, in the act of crowing. It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury. Experts . claim it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also . responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. Statues of this god, including one in the Corinium Museum, commonly show a cockerel at the base. The association probably stems from Mercury’s role as the messenger to the gods and that of the cockerel as ‘announcer’ of the new dawn. Mercury was also the ‘herdsman for the dead’, guiding newly deceased souls on their passage to the afterlife. It is therefore possible that the cockerel was an offering by a devotee of Mercury and expresses a parent’s particular concern to ensure safe transit of a loved one into the after world. 'It is the most significant Roman cemetery investigation in the town since the early 1970s,' said a spokesman for the town’s Corinium Museum. 'The cockerel found underneath the former Bridge’s Garage site - now St James’s Place - is one of only nine known cockerel figurines from the Roman world, and is the only example with its tail intact. 'Displayed with the cockerel are an exceptional example of a Roman flagon and a selection of jewellery which include beads and bracelets found in a richly furnished child’s grave. 'These are high status objects, which give a fascinating insight into the people of Corinium. Neil Holbrook, Chief Executive of Cotswold Archaeology added: 'The . cockerel is the most spectacular find from more than 60 Roman burials . excavated at this site. 'It was excavated from the grave of young child . and was placed close to its head. Interestingly a very similar item was . found in Cologne in Germany and it looks like they both could have come . from the same workshop based in Britain.' The Tetbury Hoard, also on display at the museum, contain 1,437 silver and copper-alloy 3rd century Roman coins. 'The hoard is the museum’s first Roman Coin Hoard and comes from a fascinating period of political upheaval across the Roman Empire,' continued the museum's spokesman. 'It was a time of rapid succession of rulers and usurpers. The coins themselves tell this story. 'Depictions and inscriptions represent 12 emperors from just a 16 year period.' The child was buried wearing hobnailed . shoes and was accompanied by a pottery feeding vessel and the remarkable . enamelled bronze figurine of a cockerel. The cockerel is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, eyes and ‘comb’ are inlaid with enamel, which now appears blue and green.

The cockerel (pictured) is 5-inches tall (12.5cm) and the breast, wings, and eyes are inlaid with enamel . The conservation work took four months to be painstakingly carried out by experts. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook, from Cotswold Archaeology, said the work had 'exceeded expectations', particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail. 'It reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been,' he said. 'This must have cost, in current money, thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make, and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three-year-old child is not something that you would do lightly. 'It really shows that this was a very wealthy, important family, and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child.' A burial site was unearthed at the . site including more than 40 burials and four cremations; something . experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the . 1970s. This . particular figurine is one of only four ever found in Britain, with a . total of eight known from the whole of the Roman Empire. Mr Holbrook added: 'Without a doubt this is the best Roman cockerel ever found in Britain. 'This is the best find that I have seen come out of Cirencester in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance.' The . object is believed to have been made in northern Britain, with evidence . pointing to a workshop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which made enamel . artefacts. Talks are under way to find a permanent display site for the cockerel, possibly at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester. Only nine similar cockerel figurines are known from the Roman world, including four from Britain. The similarities in construction and decoration suggest that they were made at roughly the same time and could have come from the same workshop. Our example is the only one from Britain to have come from a grave and the only one from any location to have survived with a tail. The two which are closest in form are from Cologne in Germany and Buchten in the Netherlands. In these examples the enamelling survives in the original colours of yellow, blue and red and it is probable that the Cirencester example was originally just as brightly coloured. Britain produced some of the finest enamelled objects in the Roman Empire and these were traded as far afield as Germany, France, Spain and Italy. The four enamelled cockerels from the continent all come from Germany and the Low Countries.","Enamelled bird was was found in a child's grave in Cirencester in 2011 .

"A California court heard Friday that an educator accused of sexual assault by a former pupil in a phone conversation that was videoed and later uploaded to YouTube had sex with the girl more than 100 times when she was aged between 12 and 14. The judge refused to dismiss sexual assault charges against Andrea Michelle Cardosa, 40, a former assistant principal who was charged in February with 16 felony counts, including five counts of aggravated assault on a child. Prosecutors said Cardosa abused the former student Jamie Carillo, who is now 28, from 1997 to 2001, starting when the child was 12 and attending Chemawa Middle School in Riverside. Fall from grace: Cardosa's family wept in the back of the courtroom as her bail was set at $5 million . According to court documents, the relationship began with Cardosa kissing the girl, and progressed until they had their first sexual encounter in the girls locker room at school. On another occasion, Cardosa drove Carillo to a secluded area and had sex with her in the back of her car, allege prosecutors. Carillo says that Cardosa once took her to her sister's home to have sex, and when they heard the front door open Cardosa threw the then-13-year-old Carillo into a closet and threw clothes in on top of her. She told her sister she'd stopped by the house to take a shower. The girl said that between the time she was 12 to 14 years old, she had sex with Cardosa 'over 100 times.' Another former student came forward after seeing the video and Cardosa was also charged with abusing her. Other victims: After Carillo (pictured) posted her video on YouTube, a second alleged victim came forward . Write caption here . In the video posted online on January 17, the former student telephones Alhambra High School, where Cardosa was working, and receptionists connect her to a woman who identifies herself as Cardosa. 'You should be so ashamed and so disgusted with yourself,' Carillo says. 'I am. I am,' the woman says. 'I regret it every day. Every day.' The former student did not detail the alleged abuse in the video. Documents reveal that the relationship between Carillo and Cardoso continued until the girl was 18 years old. When Carillo tried to leave Cardoso, reports the Press-Enterprise, she threatened to kill herself, smashed her head repeatedly on a table and refused to let Carillo leave. She then forced Carillo to have sex with her and the girl was only able to leave once Cardoso fell asleep. The last time the pair saw each other was in 2007, according to court documents. Cardosa visited Carillo after she gave birth to her first child. Cardosa told the younger woman that she 'wanted to get back together' and that she and her newborn son could move in with her. Serious charges: Cardosa is facing life in prison if she is found guilty of 16 felony charges stemming from child sex abuse allegations . She also threatened to tell Carillo's family that she was a lesbian, reports the Press-Enterprise. Cardosa pleaded not guilty at the hearing, where defense attorney Randy Collins argued that the case should be dismissed because police investigated in 1998 when the mother of the Carillo's friend became concerned about Cardosa's relationship with the student. That means the statute of limitations for charging Cardosa has expired, he argued. Prosecutors countered in court papers that the girl told police nothing was wrong because Cardosa urged her to lie and therefore the window to file the case remained. 'You can’t force her to say she was a crime victim. Police stopped investigating,' Supervising Deputy District Attorney John Henry said, reports PE.com. 'The statute is triggered when the victim reports she is a victim.' Riverside Superior Court Judge Helios Hernandez allowed the case to proceed Friday and also rejected a defense motion to reduce Cardosa's $5 million bail.

"It was meant to be a 'survival' event for people who wanted to be scared, challenged and pushed to their limits in the build up to Halloween. But for one passer by the fear was too much, and they mistook the appearance of 20 men and women being bundled into the back of a van by men dressed in balaclavas and brandishing guns for an actual kidnapping and phoned 999. Armed officers and the Sussex Police helicopter was despatched to deal with the van - and police swooped on the men, armed with plastic guns. It even took a while for staff members, employed as actors,  to realise that the police were real and stayed in character thinking they were part of the event. Outbreak organised the Outbreak event to 'terrify' participants as they were led into a fake military base . The experience saw ticket holders meet at a secret location in Brighton where they were promised a 'physical horror' event and their chance to 'star in a real-life apocalypse movie.' They were 'processed' and taken to a fake military base, accompanied by realistic military escorts, and then sent to face challenges in the field. A key part of the Outbreak event, to terrify participants, saw them being bundled into the back of a van by men clad in balaclavas and brandishing guns. They were then told that they had been given a dose of a nerve agent and had two hours to get to the cure. It was at this crucial point that armed police swooped on the van in the village of Albourne, West Sussex. Spokesman for Outbreak, David Parker, said: 'Most of the participants thought the police were part of the event and a few members of staff stayed in character at first. 'It took a while for them to believe that the officers were actually from a real police force. Actors dress up as armed guards for the Outbreak event to make it more authentic for people taking part . Participants in the Outbreak Halloween event were put through their paces in a number of challenges . 'We believe a member of the public walking past the private land where the event was taking place saw one of the scenes where people with replica guns force participants into the back of a truck and called the police. 'Before we knew it, armed police and the helicopter had been despatched.' Mr Parker said more than 1,000 tickets had been sold for the event, which took place all weekend and involved a cast of 60 actors. Around 60 actors take part in the event, held in Brighton and advertised as a physical horror experience (right) Organisers said actors keep in character throughout the event and some thought the police were on the team . In an advert for the event participants are advised: 'This event is not for the faint hearted.' He said the 20 men and women affected on Sunday were the last group of the weekend to take part. They were still able to continue with the event albeit with a 20 minute delay after police realised there was no real danger. Mr Parker said Sussex Police had been made aware that the event was taking place but he understood that they had to take a report of this kind seriously. He said: 'It was definitely a case of crossed wires. 'As soon as they realised the guns were plastic, it all ended very quickly. 'One of our cast members even thought we had set them up and it was all part of the day.' He said they had taken steps to make the event as authentic as possible. He added: 'We had even taken military advice so that our armed actors could look as realistic as possible.' The Halloween experience, created by White Knuckle events, saw ticketholders meet at a secret location in central Brighton where they were taken on to the South Downs. Participants were told they would be able to crawl, climb and navigate within areas of reduced lighting, and they were likely to get muddy and wet.","Thrill seekers met for Halloween-themed survival event in secret location .

"Kobe beef steak costing £150 for 180g will soon be available in London at Martin Williams' new restaurant . The former managing director of Gaucho is set to open the first of his three establishments M Grill next month on Threadneedle Street in the City. The international grill restaurant specialises in the best steak cuts from across the world and offers single cuts from six selected countries - Argentina, France, South Africa, Japan, Australia, and the US - with prices ranging from £18 to £149. Steaking a claim: Martin Williams' M Grill will be serving Kobe beef steaks which cost £150 for 180g . The 38-year-old plans to open a second M in the West End this time next year, with a third planned for 2016. Mr Williams told MailOnline: 'I was very keen to not shy away from Kobe because of its price. When I was in Tokyo last month, I became obsessed by the unique quality and flavour. 'For M GRILL we selected six countries in the world that breed the best beef, then chose a single cut from each. 'The beef offering at M Grill ranges from Onglet from France at £18 and rump from Argentina at £19 to Blackmoor Australian Wagyu Sirloin at £130 and Kobe fillet at £150. 'We are the United Nations of steak! 'My family has a home in France, where I have become an Onglet Addict. It isn't about price, it’s about quality. Elite beef: Kobe's high fat content ensures excellent marbling and a buttery, decadent texture . Mr Williams is 'incredibly excited' about the November opening of his new venture M Grill . 'Kobe is phenomenally expensive and phenomenally rare,' he also said to The Standard. Mr Williams' second restaurant Raw shares the same 15,000sqft site as Grill. The space will house a wine bar, a 'secret den for City boys' and sleeping pods as well as the two 100-cover restaurants. The former Gaucho boss - who worked in the famous steakhouse chain for over nine years - is 'incredibly excited' about the November opening and has assembled a 'dream team' to ensure his venture is a success. 'The amount of bookings that we have received, since opening our phone lines last week has been phenomenal,' he said. 'I have handpicked an amazing team from London’s top restaurants to join me in creating M. 'To have secured my Head Chef from Chiltern Fire House and Restaurant Director from Cecconi’s is fantastic. I have a ""Dream Team"" and can’t wait to take hospitality to a new level with them.' Mr Williams is the former managing director of Gaucho, a steak chain with 17 restaurants worldwide .

Japanese beef - which was banned for 13-years after the BSE scare - has only recently been reintroduced to London. Kobe is prized for its superb marbling, buttery texture and high percentage of fat (it can contain up to 25 per cent fat).

"The Sunday Mirror sex sting that led to the resignation of Tory MP Brooks Newmark is a matter of ‘urgent public concern’, the head of Britain’s new Press regulator warned yesterday. Former judge Sir Alan Moses, the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), said it was likely the tabloid would face an investigation. The warning came as it emerged that more than 100 MPs were approached as part of the sting, including David Cameron. Former judge Sir Alan Moses, the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), said it was likely the Sunday Mirror would face an investigation into its sting on Tory minister Brooks Newmark . Civil society minister Mr Newmark resigned after the paper revealed he sent explicit pictures of himself to a male journalist posing as a fictitious female Tory activist called Sophie Wittams. Fellow Tory MP Mark Pritchard has made a complaint to Ipso and said he would contact Scotland Yard over alleged entrapment. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference, Sir Alan said the matter was being treated extremely seriously. But he warned a ‘rush to judgment can lead to injustice’, adding: ‘The Mirror is entitled to a fair hearing.’ Political website Guido Fawkes, which carried out part of the sting, last night defended its action and said it was not a ‘fishing operation’. 'MPs have been shown to be corrupt in the past by sting operations,' a statement on the site said. The civil society minister, pictured with his wife, resigned after the paper revealed he sent explicit pictures . 'How do our critics expect us to prove an MP is exploiting his position for carnal gain? 'This was no fishing operation, it was a narrowly targeted effort. 'The Sophie Wittams Twitter account followed almost 100 MPs as part of the cover story – not to target them – which is obvious given that many of them were women MPs and the list included the Prime Minister. There was no intention to trap the PM.' The Sunday Mirror declined to comment but previously defended the sting, saying there was ‘clear public interest’.","Sir Alan Moses is head of new Independent Press Standards Organisation .

"Rolf Harris is said to have created a working didgeridoo instrument while serving time in prison . Jailed paedophile Rolf Harris has made his own didgeridoo behind bars, it has been reported. The 84-year-old is said to have created a working copy of the Aboriginal wind instrument during art classes at his former prison - HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire. He has since been moved to Stafford prison where he has joined the choir, singing with other inmates during Sunday services, according to the Daily Star Sunday. A source told the newspaper: 'Harris is doing everything possible to keep himself occupied. 'He carved the didgeridoo from wood he found in the jail garden and it is really good. 'Harris is a superb craftsman and making the instrument was a form of therapy for him.' The disgraced entertainer was sentenced to five years and nine months in prison in July after he was convicted of 12 indecent assaults. Harris is appealing the convictions, which include an assault on an eight-year-old autograph hunter, two on girls in their early teens and a catalogue of abuse of his daughter's friend over 16 years. The Sunday newspaper also reports that the pensioner worked in the farm and gardens unit where he worked as a gardener for £9.60 a week - and in his spare time would make sculptures from fallen wood. It reportedly took a month for him to create the didgeridoo, which is about 3ft long and has been decorated on the outside with figures and images. The artist, who famously painted a portrait of the Queen, also created a sculpture of interlocked chains out of wood to 'represent his time in jail'. He has applied to have the instrument and sculpture transferred to his new cell on the vulnerable sex offenders wing at HMP Stafford but is is thought guards have refused on the basis that inmates are not allowed to have large personal items. His decision to join the choir came as a shock to many after he previously shunned religion in his autobiography.

"This is the terrifying moment the 10-year-old son of Steve Irwin bravely faced off against a giant crocodile. Robert Irwin stepped into the crocodile enclosure at his late father's Australia Zoo near Beerwah on Queensland's Sunshine Coast on Thursday and got a little bit too close for comfort as he went face to face with the reptile.

Robert was feeding the crocodile in front a packed crowd for the zoo's daily feeding show at the Crocoseum when the animal's patience seemed to run out . 'I've seen him feed the crocs a few times, but I've never seen him get that close before,' an onlooker told Daily Mail Australia. 'I think Bob was holding the meat where the crocodile couldn't actually see it, so I think its patience was running out. I guess he'll know to throw the meat where it can be seen next time.' Photos of the moment show handler and Steve's best friend, Wes Mannion, grabbing hold of Robert's shirt as they inched closer to the crocodile. 'They're dangerous creatures (and) are unpredictable.

US singer Justin Timberlake and his entourage were among the throng of people watching Bob's close encounter. 'We’re all really proud of how well Robert is doing during our Wildlife Warriors show,' a spokeswoman from Australia Zoo told Daily Mail Australia. The famous crocodile hunter died in 2006 when he was stung by a sting ray. His son Bob was just three years old .

"Virtual reality is on the brink of being mainstream, but for some the cost of systems like Oculus Rift is still too much too bear - a development kit at the moment costs £220 ($350). But now French electronics company Archos is planning to release a budget headset that costs only £25 - albeit with the help of a smartphone. The VR glasses require you to strap a phone before your eyes, providing an apparently immersive virtual reality experience akin to Oculus Rift. Scroll down for video . French electronic company Archos has unveiled a budget VR headset (show). It will cost just £25 ($30) and goes on sale in November. The product straps to your head and a phone slides in the front. Two eyepieces then allow stereoscopic views of the phone. Various 3D-enabled software can then be used with the device . The Archos VR Glasses will be available in November starting at £24.99 ($30). While other comparable products exist on the market, including Carl Zeiss' £60 ($100) VR One and Samsung's £125 ($300) ear VR, Archos' gadget is by far the cheapest. It works by strapping a headset around your head and then slotting your phone into a gap in front of your eyes. Virtual reality-enabled software can then be loaded on the phone and viewed through the headset. It supports any phone up to six inches (15.2cm) in length, although it's recommended to use one with a 1080p display and quad-core processor. And any operating system - Android, iOS or Windows - is compatible. The Archos VR Glasses (shown folded up) will be available in November starting at £24.99 ($30). While other comparable products exist on the market, including Carl Zeiss' £60 ($100) VR One and Samsung's £125 ($300) ear VR, Archos' gadget is by far the cheapest . The device works by providing a stereoscopic view of your phone. There are two eyepieces, one for each eye, and when looking at 3D-enabled software such as movies and video games, the effect will appear 3D to the user. While exactly specifications have not yet been revealed, it is apparently 'lightweight yet robust' according to Archos. 'Consuming digital content has gone through lots of revolutions lately,' says Loïc Poirier, CEO of Archos. 'Virtual Reality is another one that we help sharing with people by providing high quality yet attainable devices.' Last month, Oculus unveiled its Crescent Bay model of the virtual reality technology that is lighter than its predecessor, and now features 360-degree tracking. Reports claimed the consumer version of the device will launch in 2015 and could cost as little as £120 ($200). The 360-degree tracking means the headset will be able to more accurately monitor a wearer's head movements, which in turn will make games more immersive and true-to-life. Elsewhere, the headset has a higher resolution, per eye, than the current second-generation development kit - DK2 - and these displays are powered by Samsung devices. A teardown of the DK2 revealed that the headset uses Samsung Galaxy Note 3 displays, and experts claim the latest generation device will feature screens from the flagship Note 4. By comparison, the DK2 has a resolution of 960 x 1080 per eye, and the Note 4 screens would give the latest model 1280 x 1440 resolution. Aside from these specifications, Oculus VR is yet to release the rest of Crescent Bay's features, or a price tag for the gadget. Oculus Rift (shown) is the current leader in the virtual reality market. The firm was acquired earlier this year by Facebook for £1.2 billion ($2 billion), and gamers are waiting for a consumer version of the virtual reality headset to be launched next year .","French electronic company Archos has unveiled a budget VR headset .

"Mexican authorities are questioning nine police officers from the  elite 'Hurcules' cartel-busting unit in connection with the killing of three U.S. citizens on vacation in the country. Erica Alvarado Rivera, 26, and brothers, Alex, 22, and Jose Angel, 21, disappeared on October 13 while visiting their father in the border city of Matamoros with Erica Alvarado's 32-year-old Mexican boyfriend, Jose Guadalupe Castaneda Benitez. Their bodies, identified yesterday, were found burned, most likely from lying in the hot sun for so long, police said. Each had been shot in the head. Tragic: Erica (left), who has four children between the ages of 3 and 9, had been scheduled to begin studying to become a nursing assistant next month while Alex (right) and brother Jose had been scheduled to make their annual pilgrimage to Missouri as migrant farm workers more than a week ago . Parents of the three siblings, whose bodies were identified Thursday, have said witnesses reported they were seized by men dressed in police gear calling themselves 'Hercules,' a tactical security unit in the violent border city of Matamoros heavily racked by cartel infighting. Nine of the unit's 40 officers are being questioned, Tamaulipas state Attorney General Ismael Quintanilla Acosta said. It would be the third recent case of alleged abuse and killings by Mexican security forces and the first to involve Americans. The father of the three Americans, Pedro Alvarado, identified his children from photographs of the bodies showing tattoos, Quintanilla told Radio Formula. Clothing found with the bodies also matched that of Erica Alvarado Rivera, 26, and brothers, Alex, 22, and Jose Angel, 21, who disappeared Oct. 13 along with Jose Guadalupe Castaneda Benitez, Erica Alvarado's 32-year-old boyfriend. Tamaulipas authorities said it could take 24 to 48 hours for DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were those of the Alvarado siblings, who were last seen in El Control, a small town near the Texas border west of Matamoros, about to return home to Progreso, Texas. Grief: Their mother Raquel (pictured), said witnesses told her that the brothers arrived to find members of the Hercules police unit pushing and hitting their sister and Castaneda . 'They were good kids,' said an aunt, Nohemi Gonzalez. 'I don't know why they did that to them.' The three siblings shared their mother's modest brick home on a quiet street in Progreso less than three miles from the border. Erica, who has four children between the ages of 3 and 9, had been scheduled to begin studying to become a nursing assistant next month. Brothers Jose Angel and Alex had been scheduled to make their annual pilgrimage to Missouri as migrant farm workers more than a week ago, Gonzalez said. When they weren't on the road, they divided their time between their mother's house in Texas and their father's Mexico. Officials have not commented on the events that led up to the disappearances, but the families' informal inquiries produced this version: . On Sunday, Oct. 12, Erica drove her black Jeep Cherokee across the border to El Control. She dropped it at her father's house and went to visit with her boyfriend. Her mother, Raquel Alvarado, had told her to be back in Progreso by early Monday morning, because Raquel had to work and Erica's kids had to get to school. Raquel put the kids to bed Sunday night and awoke at 4 a.m. to see Erica was not home. She began calling her daughter's cellphone, but got no answer. At that point, it appears Erica was fine. She continued calling through the morning of Oct. 13. 'I'm always worried about her when she goes over there,' the mother said. Around 1 p.m., she reached her former husband. He told her Erica had called her brothers and asked them to bring her Jeep to a roadside restaurant under a bridge near El Control where she was eating with her boyfriend. One brother drove her Jeep and the other drove his Chevrolet Tahoe because they all planned to return to Progreso from there. Questions: The country already is engulfed in the case of 43 teachers college students missing in southern Guerrero state at the hands of a mayor and police working with a drug cartel . According to Raquel Alvarado, witnesses told family members that the brothers arrived around 12.30pm and saw members of the police unit called Hercules pushing their sister and Castaneda and hitting Erica. When the brothers intervened, the police took all four of them, along with their vehicles. The witnesses said the armed men identified themselves as members of the Hercules unit and warned against intervening. A September news release from the city about Hercules showed an armed force in fatigues and face paint. Mayor Leticia Salazar officially introduced Hercules as a group with particular skills to confront crime in high-risk operations. They have passed background checks and are trained by the state, Quintanilla said. Neither Salazar nor the city's spokeswoman returned messages seeking comment Thursday. The country already is engulfed in the case of 43 teachers college students missing in southern Guerrero state at the hands of a mayor and police working with a drug cartel. Fifty-six people are under arrest, including dozens of police officers. In June, soldiers killed 22 suspected gang members in Mexico state, then altered the scene and intimidated witnesses to hide the fact that most of the dead were executed after they surrendered, a National Commission on Human Rights report said last week. Three soldiers face murder charges. 'We will apply the full force of the law and zero tolerance,' Tamaulipas Gov. Egidio Torre Cantu said, lamenting the death of the three Americans and a Mexican citizen, even though their identities had yet to be confirmed by DNA. Presidential spokesman Eduardo Sanchez declined comment when asked about the newest case. The U.S. Embassy said it was aware of the reports but had no information to share 'due to privacy considerations.'

Saturday picked Brooklyn federal prosecutor Loretta Lynch to be . the next U.S. attorney general, praising her as someone who . would bring a commitment to criminal justice reform and other . key administration priorities. If confirmed, Lynch, 55, would be the first black woman to . serve in the post, bringing with her a family history that . stretches back generations to great-great grandparents who were . slaves.

Lynch would replace Eric Holder, the first black attorney . general, who has held the job since Obama took office in 2009. She was among several candidates Holder had recommended to . succeed him. 'Loretta might be the only lawyer in America who battles . mobsters and drug lords and terrorists and still has the . reputation for being a charming people person,' Obama said in . announcing the nomination.

The announcement, made in the White House's Roosevelt room, . was unusual both for its timing and for Obama's selection of . someone for a top job with whom he has little personal history. After the announcement, Lynch took to the podium and expressed her gratitude toward Obama and his faith in her. 'If I have the honor of being confirmed by the senate,' Lynch said, 'I will wake up every morning with the protection of the american people my first thought and I will work every day to safeguard our citizens, our liberties, our rights, and this great nation which has given so much to me and my family.' It is hard to say whether the nomination will be welcomed by Republicans on Capitol Hill who often disagreed with Holder during his time as attorney general, according to Fox News.

"Should Ross Barkley start for England at the World Cup? During one of Everton’s first training sessions under Roberto Martinez, the new manager set up a small-sided drill to assess the technical ability of his players. Martinez paid special attention to Ross Barkley as the young midfielder snatched at a couple of chances and sent them high and wide of the small target. ‘It would have been easy for the players to be critical of him, but what impressed me was that he had their complete respect,’ Martinez recalled on Thursday. Talent: Ross Barkley (centre) has the full backing of his Everton boss Roberto Martinez . The Everton midfielder composed himself and hit the target with shots into the top left and top right with his next two shots. ‘Again, no-one said a word,’ said Martinez. ‘They just knew that’s what he can do.’ Barkley’s decision-making has become a discussion point after Roy Hodgson’s fumbled attempt to deflect some of the attention from the youngster. England’s head coach knows it doesn’t work like that, especially with a World Cup in Brazil just days away. Hodgson, for all his world- wise experience of football at every level, knows better than that. Or at least he should do. Toffee: Martinez believes Barkley is the 'biggest talent for his age' in European football . Maestro: Barkley was one of England's best players during the 2-2 against Ecuador . Martinez, who was in his office at Everton’s Finch Farm training centre, watched Barkley’s outstanding performance against Ecuador in his first start. ‘He is the biggest talent for his age I have seen in European football,’ he added. That is quite a statement. ‘He is a special player, a unique player and that is so rare. He has power, pace and technical ability - elements you rarely find in a player. He would look at home in the Spanish, German or Dutch models, no doubt about it. We have a responsibility to develop his talent and to protect and nurture him.’ Ill-judged: Roy Hodgson attempted to protect Barkley by criticising his passing after the game . 35- Barkley made 35 passes against Ecuador, only misplacing three . 1- Ecuador saw his first assist of the season. He made none for Everton . Hodgson wanted to protect him too, but chose his words badly when he criticised Barkley for  giving the ball away too often. It was clumsy, particularly after the young midfielder had set up Rickie Lambert’s goal that started with a nutmeg on Jorge Guagua before a breathtaking run that led to England’s second. ‘He’s got drive, he’s got energy, but he’s got to learn when to release the ball,’ was Hodgson’s damning assessment of his performance. It felt like a strange thing to say. ‘For every good turn there was a time when he lost the ball and put us on the back foot defensively,’ he added. No 10: Barkley (left) has been compared to former England midfielder Paul Gascoigne . But Barkley is a breathtaking  talent and Martinez believes he  will mature into a ‘No 6’ central  midfielder in time. He plays a risky game, eager to please and show-off his ball skills for club and country. In the right area, it should be encouraged. ‘The back heel to Rooney, the pass for Lambert’s goal and the shot Ross had, give you an  indication of the player that he will become,’ added Martinez, who will travel to the World Cup next week. ‘We have to allow him room to develop and let’s not put too much pressure on him. At the moment  he is perfectly suited to playing in the No 10 role, but in time he will develop into the complete  midfielder. Nothing fazes him, but the World Cup is a massive event and Ross needs protection. ‘We just need to calm things down a bit and don’t expect too much from him. I’ve seen what Roy had to say after the game but I think he was just trying to protect him a  little bit.’ Barkley’s team-mates have been impressed with his ability and he has added another dimension to this England team ahead of the opening group game against Italy. Frank Lampard, who captained the team against Ecuador in the Sun Life Stadium, is convinced he has the characteristics to be a top player. Shocked: Martinez was shocked by the 'complete respect' that Barkley had from Everton players . ‘It’s the fearlessness of youth,’ said Lampard. ‘He has great ability on the ball, running at people and taking them out — and that’s what you want to see. ‘It’s brilliant for him, brilliant for the team and individually to see him come through. It’s great for the team to have players in those attacking areas who can make things happen. ‘I’m sure he will have learnt a lot from the game in terms of positions to pick up, times to turn, times not to. But when you’ve got players like that in a team, players who can run away from people and make things happen, then you’re very happy. Going places: Frank Lampard claims Barkley has the characteristics to become to top player for England . ‘He’s a young boy and good luck to him, it’s good to see him come in and do so well.’ Like Martinez, Lampard sees Barkley in a more advanced role  in the early phase of his development. There is a swagger about the Liverpudlian, with flashes of Paul Gascoigne in his swashbuckling nature. At 20, he is still learning the game. ‘He’s got the bit between his teeth and he’s more of a No 10 than I ever was,’ added Lampard. ‘He’s very good at receiving the ball and turning quickly. He’s only going to get better. ‘That’s his first start so, considering that, when you look at him and what he’s done, he’s made the  second goal and shown enough there that we can say that he deserves his place in the squad. He’s a great addition.’ Taking them on: Barkley was willing to run at Ecuador in Miami and his positivity led to England's second goal .","Everton boss Roberto Martinez claims Ross Barkley is the best player of his age in Europe .

"The body of a man was found by a group of children at a popular beach in Sydney's east on Monday afternoon. Believed to be in his 50s, the man was found at Clovelly in Gordon's Bay near Coogee just before 12:45, following reports that a man had been injured. Police say a number of children were playing on the rocks when they discovered the man. They alerted their father who contacted police. Scroll down for video . A man's body was found in  Gordons Bay, Coogee after falling from a cliff . 'It's unclear whether he has jumped or fell, it was a spearhead injury, he didn't drown,' said media SLS spokesman Matt Miller . Paramedics were called and went to treat the man who had severe head injuries but he died at the scene. Surf Life Saving NSW say the man died after falling off a cliff face. 'It's unclear whether he has jumped or fell, it was a spearhead injury, he didn't drown,' said media spokesman Matt Miller. 'Lifesavers from Coogee and Clovelly attended, as well as the offshore rescue boat, but it was clear when they got there the man was deceased.' 'Ambulance declared him dead straight away,' he said. Police have commenced investigating the incident and are following initial inquiries and believe the man was walking along a track beside a cliff face when he slipped and fell onto rocks below. The grim discovery was made during a busy period, with a number of beach goers watching as police and surf life savers recovered the body.

"Atletico Madrid defender Joao Miranda has revealed he is negotiating a move away from the Spanish champions and says he is in discussions with clubs in Spain's Primera Division and the Premier League. The Brazilian centre-half was one of the crucial pillars of Diego Simeone's side last year - his solid partnership with Diego Godin helping Atletico keep the tightest defence in Spain on their way to winning the league title. Atletico signed Miranda on a free transfer from Sao Paulo in 2011 and inserted a 30million euro (£24.2m) buy-out clause into his latest contract renewal to wade off interest from rival clubs. Scroll down for video... Exit strategy: Miranda (L) has revealed he has started negotiations with Premier League and La Liga clubs . However, the 29-year-old has insinuated he wants to leave the Vicente Calderon and explained that the buy-out clause will not necessarily be a stumbling block to interested clubs. 'I have received several offers and we are negotiating,' Miranda told Radio ESPN. 'I have offers from the Spanish and English leagues, and other competitions. My agent is currently in Europe, resolving my future. My buy-out clause with Atletico Madrid is 30m, but that is negotiable.' Going Dutch? Incoming Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is a known admirer of the Brazilian defender . Miranda did not reveal which clubs in England are chasing his signature, although he has been linked with Manchester United in the past. The defender also admitted his dismay at being left out of Luiz Felipe Scolari's World Cup squad, and announced that his brief international career - he has made just seven appearances for Brazil - had come to an end. 'I'm sad,' he said. Sad: The defender is disappointed not to have been included in Brazil's World Cup squad . 'I was quite hopeful about getting called up and it was very disappointing to not make it into the 23-man squad. 'I'm enjoying a very good spell at the moment, booth physically and technically. I believe I could have helped Brazil.' 'I will continue my life with Atletico Madrid or another club, because I have offers. But my time with the national team is over.'","Joao Miranda is ready to leave La Liga champions Atletico Madrid .

"The game at the very top level is fast approaching an age whereby prudence pays. Although there is a deal of scepticism as to whether UEFA can fully enforce their stringent Financial Fair Play rules, there is a definite sea change afoot. With that in mind, the rise in pre-contract agreements could be a steep one in the coming years. Free transfers are nothing new - and do cost clubs hefty amounts in inflated sign-on fees - with some managers hoping to get business done early. And in truth, those in the Premier League are planning for next August now. There are a raft of players from across the world who are available to sign ahead of the 2015-16 season; scouts up and down the country try to remain two steps ahead - forever looking two transfer windows in front of themselves. If they’re not looking, others certainly are. Germany's World Cup winner Sami Khedira is one of a raft of players potentially available on a pre-contract . Brendan Rodgers will already be on the hunt for new faces to help strengthen his Liverpool squad . Simply put, a club can talk to any player who plies his trade in another country out of contract in June 2015 from New Year's Day about signing at the end of this season. They can put pen to paper on a deal, with a target committing to a contract before his current one expires. Dani Alves, for example, is available should Chelsea feel the need for another right back, but Steven Gerrard - also a free agent in seven months - is off limits to domestic rivals for now. So, who could they be scouting as we count down to January? Sportsmail takes a look at the available stars on pre-contract agreements in two months’ time - firstly in an XI format, and then with a collection of notable others. Sergio Romero (Sampdoria) Interest: Manchester United, Liverpool . The man who saved two Holland penalties in the World Cup semi-final could well be leaving Serie A at the end of this season. Argentina's stopper - who was shortlisted for the Golden Glove award in Brazil - would be very handy for most sides. One wonders whether Brendan Rodgers fancies deploying someone down at Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Sergio Romero was Argentina's goalkeeper during the 2014 World Cup and plays for Serie A's Sampdoria . The 28-year-old dives to his right as he thwarts Holland's Wesley Sneijder in the World Cup semi-fina shootout . Dani Alves (Barcelona) Has already made it clear that he won’t be staying at the Nou Camp beyond his current contract and would represent an exciting prospect for almost every side in Europe. A veteran of the Champions League but still with the vibrancy a full back in England requires, the Brazilian will have many suitors. Giorgio Chiellini (Juventus) Interest: Manchester United, Manchester City . Whether the Old Lady’s skipper pens new terms in Turin remains to be seen - it certainly isn’t beyond the realm of possibility - but the central defender will have a few in his ear. With Juventus having won the last three titles - a fourth appears to be on its way - Chiellini may fancy a change, particularly given he’s only played in Serie A. Dani Alves has already made it clear that he won't be staying at Barcelona beyond his current deal . Right back Alves has 79 caps for Brazil and formed part of the back four at the Nou Camp for the last six years . Basle central defender Fabian Schar was partly responsible for Mario Balotelli's dismal night in Switzerland . John Terry, Michael Carrick, Anderson, Danny Ings, Connor Wickham, Morgan Amalfitano, James Milner, Glen Johnson, Emmanuel Adebayor, Mathieu Flamini, Bryan Ruiz, Mark Noble, Ron Vlaar, Steven Gerrard, Mikel Arteta, Winston Reid, Fabian Delph, Youssuf Mulumbu, Maya Yoshida, Claudio Yacob . Fabian Schar (FC Basle) Interest: Arsenal . One of the emerging central defenders in Europe and with designs of bigger things. Excellent against Liverpool in the continent’s premier competition only a matter of weeks ago and has plenty of admirers. Only 22 so would require a compensation fee to be paid, but that would come out at less than Basle’s asking price otherwise. Alvaro Pereira (Sao Paulo) Interest: Tottenham . Uruguay’s chosen left back during the summer World Cup, Pereira was the man to continue playing despite a heavy clash with Raheem Sterling in England’s group stage defeat. Loves to gallop forward. Uruguay's Alvaro Pereira played on despite suffering after a heavy clash with Raheem Sterling in Brazil . The full back (pictured playing for Sao Paulo in October) loves to gallop forward from his defensive station . Sami Khedira (Real Madrid) Interest: Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City . The real standout player available to clubs who want to get their business done swiftly. It’s no secret as to Khedira’s obvious ability - with Arsenal interested in the central midfielder - and, although his wages will undoubtedly be high, not many would pass up the opportunity to add the German. Rasmus Elm (CSKA Moscow) Interest: Arsenal, Manchester United . Perhaps someone who will peak the interest of those beneath the top six in the Premier League, Elm is a classy midfielder on the ball but also has a height advantage over most. Those attributes - plus possessing an excellent engine - make the Swede desirable. Khedira is out of contract at Real Madrid this summer and is wanted by a host of clubs, including Arsenal . The central midfielder (battling with Jeremy Mathieu in October) has been linked with a move away . Rasmus Elm (pictured celebrating while playing for Sweden against Germany) has all the attributes . Yevhen Konoplyanka (Dnipro) Interest: Liverpool, Tottenham . Liverpool failed to sign the winger last January because Dnipro dug their heels in, but the Ukrainian side must be regretting that now. Interest is high for the jinking creator and he is certain to leave on a free. It’s a matter of who gets there first. Andre Ayew (Marseille) Interest: Liverpool, West Ham . Always one who is talked about when a window comes around, and January will be no different. Marseille won’t see any value in taking the money and running, so it’ll be interesting to see who courts the Ghanaian livewire. Yevhen Konoplyanka (left, against England's Kyle Walker in 2013) almost joined Liverpool last January . Marseille's Ghanaian Andre Ayew (right) is consistently linked with moves to Premier League teams . Eduardo Vargas is on loan at Queens Park Rangers from Rafa Benitez's Napoli in Serie A . The Chilean has impressed for Harry Redknapp's side this season, notably against Liverpool at Loftus Road . Eduardo Vargas (Napoli, on loan at Queens Park Rangers) Interest: QPR, Arsenal . Is QPR merely a shop window for the Chilean? Perhaps, perhaps not. Harry Redknapp will be well aware Vargas is out of contract and - should Rangers have designs of consolidating in the Premier League, they could do a lot worse than to get this one sorted. The one thing that may work against them is question marks over which division they’ll be in next year. Luiz Adriano (Shakhta Donetsk) Interest: Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool . Simply put, the striker cannot stop scoring. It’s nine (yes, nine) goals in the Champions League already, including five away at BATE Borisov. He is a late developer and an unknown commodity but had a hand in two on his Brazil debut against Turkey on Wednesday night. Luiz Adriano had a hand in two Brazil goals against Turkey during an impressive debut on Wednesday night . The Shakhtar Donetsk striker can't stop scoring in the Champions League - he has nine already this term . Stipe Pletikosa (FC Rostov) At 35, the goalkeeper - with 114 caps for Croatia before retiring from international football - may be looking for one last move before he calls it a day for good. Would surely only act as a No 2, but definitely someone who could act as reliable cover. Nigel De Jong (AC Milan) Looking for that little bit of added steel in midfield? De Jong may well be your man. A fierce competitor and someone who Manchester City have missed a touch this season. Maxi Pereira (Benfica) Bombs forward from right back and one of the more exuberant fliers to watch in Europe. Maxi Pereira (in action for Benfica against Monaco) is lightning and exciting to watch on the right . Ignazio Abate (AC Milan) Played in Italy's back four during the World Cup and did so impressively. A good age at 28. Yoann Gourcuff (Lyon) Has never scored enough goals given his position and the quality he has, but would still provide a touch of class to a range of sides. Andre-Pierre Gignac (Marseille) Not keen on signing a new deal, with the striker - linked with Arsenal and Newcastle - seemingly on his way.

"A teenager ended up on life support just hours after putting a tampon in, having developed the lethal illness toxic shock syndrome. Jodie Craig, then 16, feared she was having a heart attack when she became so weak she struggled to move, and began to vomit. Her temperature soared to 47°C as a fever took hold. She was rushed to hospital where doctors diagnosed toxic shock syndrome, a rare but life-threatening condition. Jodie Craig was 16 when she was rushed to hospital in Edinburgh suffering toxic shock syndrome, a rare but life-threatening illness caused by the bacteria staphylococcus and streptococcus . The teenager put a tampon in at around 3pm, but within two hours she felt she was suffering a heart attack as her temperature soared and she struggled to move . Miss Craig's mother Dawn was warned her daughter might die, as doctors put her on life-support in intensive care. For two years she struggled to recover, suffering stress-related alopecia and pneumonia . It is caused by bacteria called staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, which normally lives harmlessly on the skin. But when the infection invades the body's bloodstream it releases poisonous toxins. Miss Craig, now 20, told MailOnline: 'My temperature soared and my mum was told I might die. 'I was in intensive care for four days and hospital for a further week and a half. 'I had to take 17 different antibiotics a day and was incredibly weak. I can't believe all that happened from a tampon.' In the two and a half years that followed, Miss Craig lost 60 per cent of her hair and developed pneumonia. But four years on from the near-fatal nightmare in August 2010, she is back on her feet - thanks in part, she said to her love of Irish dancing. The account manager, said: 'On the day, I put a tampon in at 3pm. 'Soon after, I started feeling ill so mum called the doctors who told me to come in the next day. 'By 5pm I felt awful and went to lie down. I thought I was having a heart attack. I was so weak I couldn't move and started being sick. The now 20-year-old credits Irish dancing with helping her recover. She said: 'It's been really hard, but I'm just so grateful to be alive' Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but life-threatening bacterial infection. It is caused by staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. These bacteria normally live harmlessly on the skin, nose or mouth. But they can invade the body's bloodstream, where they release poisonous toxins. The toxins damage tissue, including skin and organs, and can disturb many vital organ functions. TSS is a medical emergency and sufferers must see their GP as soon as possible. Patients should be referred to hospital immediately. The signs of TSS include: . Anyone can develop TSS but for reasons that are not fully understood, a significant number of cases are in women who are on their period and using a tampon - particularly those designed to be 'super absorbent'. TSS can also occurs as a result of an infected boil, insect bite or wound. If left untreated, TSS can cause shock and organ damage that results in death. Source: NHS Choices . 'I couldn't lift my arm up so I pushed my mobile to the floor and hoped mum would hear it.' Paramedics were called, diagnosed a fever and told her to attend her GP's surgery the following morning. But when she got there, the doctor sent Miss Craig straight to Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. 'Doctors told mum that I was seriously ill, but they didn't know why,' she said. 'They said I wouldn't make it and told her to call the family to come and say goodbye.' However as the doctors went to insert a catheter in her, they saw she was wearing a tampon. Immediately, she was put on a drip  of antibiotics. But the illness had a long-lasting impact. Over the next few months, Miss Craig's hair started falling out and she was diagnosed with stress-related alopecia. 'Doctors told me that in fighting TSS, my body had suffered lots of changes and my hair had been affected,' she said. 'That was the worst part. I was only 16.' She also battled pneumonia caused by a weakened immune system. And when she started back at school, she would collapse due to tiredness. It was agreed she could do limited time in class and spend most of the time at home. Despite this, she was awarded Highers in English and biology. She also discovered a love of Irish dancing. 'I had done nothing because I was so weak,' Miss Craig told MailOnline. 'But my best friend, Robyn, lives opposite a dance teacher and she told me about it. Now I compete in championships.

"A teacher has resigned over Ebola fears after her school ordered her to stay home for 21 days following a mission trip to Kenya - even though there have been no cases of the virus there. Susan Sherman, who worked for the Archdiocese of Louisville, Kentucky for 16 years, was asked to stay away from St Margaret Mary Catholic School because of parents' and parishioners' concerns. But Sherman, a registered nurse, complained that the demands were never properly communicated to her and that the decision was based on 'ignorance', she told WLKY. 'It is with sadness that I tell you that I have resigned my position as your teacher,' she wrote in a letter to students. 'Apparently, I have lost the trust of a large number of people in our school community.' Snub: Susan Sherman has quit her job at a Louisville school after being put on 'precautionary leave' for 21 days after returning from a mission trip to Kenya last month - a decision she said was based on ignorance . In the letter, which relatives shared on Facebook, she said that 'contrary to some perceptions, I did not go on this mission trip recklessly or without thought'. Rather, she  kept up-to-date with the news and took all of the necessary vaccinations and medications. 'This was my fourth trip to Migori, Kenya to work in the Kenya Relief clinic,' she explained. 'I went with full confidence that knowing that my hosts would take heroic measures to keep me and my fellow healthcare workers safe. I'm committed to return to Migori at least once each year.' The 60-year-old had visited Kenya with her husband Paul, 64, a retired orthopedic surgeon, on a medical mission with the faith-based organization Kenya Relief, the Courier-Journal reported. The tiny Kenyan village where she worked is more than 4,000 miles from where the main outbreak of the virus has been reported in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia in West Africa. Despite the distance between her and the virus, parents and parishioners expressed their concerns - at a time when 'a new or suspected Ebola patient was being named [in the U.S.] each day,' the Archdiocese said in a statement shared with WHAS11. Thousands of miles apart: Sherman was on a mission trip to a tiny town in Kenya - which is more than 4,000 miles away from the Ebola-ravaged countries of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, seen left . Anger: Sherman, pictured left with her husband Paul and right with one of her daughters, is a registered nurse and said she took Ebola fears seriously - but that she was thousands of miles away from any outbreak . 'Some St. Margaret Mary parents were googling and distributing media articles naming Kenya as a ""high risk"" country and were approaching the local media about their fears,' it said. 'Unfortunately attempts to communicate facts and reduce fear were unsuccessful, so parish administrators decided to ask Mrs. Sherman upon her return to take a precautionary leave of 21 days with pay and to secure a doctor's note about her health. 'This decision was made to protect the well-being of students in light of the uproar.' But  the requested leave was 'not effectively communicated' to the teacher and she only learned about the leave when she returned from the trip, the Archdiocese said. 'This communication failure is unacceptable, and the leadership of St. Margaret Mary and the Archdiocese has apologized to Mrs. Sherman for this failure,' it continued. 'Mrs. Sherman, however, communicated to the parish that in light of the poor communication and all that had been transpired, she felt unwelcome and did not see how she could effectively continue as a teacher.' Clash: She has worked for the district for nearly 20 years but had started at St Margaret Mary Catholic School, pictured, only earlier this year. The Archdiocese said it regretted her decision to resign . The school 'is deeply apologetic for any pain that this situation has caused Mrs. Sherman and very much regrets Mrs. Sherman's decision to resign,' it said. The school is now working to replace Sherman. The Shermans said that other members of the team who went to Kenya have returned to their jobs without any problems. Mrs Sherman had worked for the Archdiocese as a teacher from 1998 to 2004, and then continued as a substitute teacher. She joined St Margaret's this year. 'More than anything I want educators to educate, and parents to support them, and administrators to support the educators,' she wrote in a statement. 'Then the kids get the best education and that is part of the problem here, the kids were lost in this equation.'","Susan Sherman went on a medical mission to a small Kenyan town that was more than 4,000 miles away from the Ebola outbreak in West Africa .

"England captain Steven Gerrard expressed his relief that England’s players had emerged unscathed and criticised 'poor' refereeing following a stormy affair against a cynical Honduras. The Central Americans – who held England to a goalless draw in Miami on Saturday night – had four players booked and Brayan Beckeles sent off following a stray arm on Leighton Baines which earned him a second yellow card. The match was delayed for 30 minutes during the first half because of an electrical storm, but that did not dampen the enthusiasm of the Hondurans who were guilty of a string of dangerous challenges. Unhappy: England captain Steven Gerrard criticised the refereeing after England's draw with Honduras . Daniel Sturridge was on the receiving end of a kick to his chest from Emilio Izaguirre, a misdemeanour which earned the Celtic defender a booking from referee Ricardo Salazar. And skipper Gerrard was critical of both Salazar and the Honduras players after the game. ‘We’re quite frustrated in the dressing-room,’ he told ITV. ‘We thought the refereeing was poor. I think we’re a bit relieved that we’ve come out of there with no injuries. Physical: The England captain was unhappy with some of the challenges that took place in Miami . Force: Gerrard feels the impact of a challenge from Honduras' Luis Garrido at Sun Life Stadium . Exchange: Gerrard confronts Garrido after his strong challenge during the first half . ‘They were making some horrific tackles for a friendly a week before the World Cup. I certainly got caught with a bad one. I don’t understand referees when a player kicks the ball into a player’s chest, it’s a clear red card in the first half and the game could have been different.’ And goalkeeper Joe Hart added: ‘The Honduras team were hell-bent on breaking it up, legally or illegally. ‘Stevie caught a bad one, Sturridge got smashed in the chest and Bainsey nearly had his head taken off and the lad got sent off.’ Gerrard, however, feels England must improve heading into the World Cup. Fiery: Emilio Izaguirre brings down Daniel Sturridge and then kicks the ball straight at him from inches away . Stand off: The England striker confronts Izaguirre as Jordan Henderson arrives on the scene . ‘If you look at the chances we maybe had the better chances,’ he said, ‘but we need to learn to play better in these conditions because the opposition is going to improve.’ England manager Roy Hodgson, meanwhile., tried to be more diplomatic and did not talk as openly about the Hondurans' approach. ‘They were quite physical,’ he said. ‘It was a real stop-start game, one of the most frustrating I've been involved in for a long time. We had a long stoppage, I thought we dealt with it and in the second half it was attack v defence. Dismissed: Brayan Beckeles was given a second yellow card for elbowing Leighton Baines . Seeing red: Beckeles is given his marching orders after two bookings at Sun Life Stadium . ‘They got their men behind the ball and we didn't take our chances. We attemped to make them but this is a game I will soon forget. ‘I will take the draw and that we got away without injuries and that we have experience against Central American opposition.’","Steven Gerrard unhappy with 'horrific' tackles and 'poor' refereeing .

"Juan Mata says it will be impossible not to cast his mind back to the last World Cup final when Spain face Holland on Friday but he also warns that the holders have not just come to Brazil to hand over their crown. 'Right now I’m not thinking about the last final but when I’m there out on the pitch and I have them in front of me, I’m sure the memories will all come flooding back,' he says. Mata was on the bench as Andres Iniesta scored the most famous goal in Spain’s history against the Dutch in Johannesburg four years ago. The team to beat? Spain lift the World Cup after defeating Holland in 2010 . Winner: Andres Iniesta (centre) scored the historic winning goal for La Roja after a tough battle in Johannesburg . He remembers: 'When he scored, the first thing I did was look across to the linesman to see if he had lifted his flag, to make sure there was no offside. Then I looked up at the scoreboard and saw ‘115m, 1-0.’ 'The time spent waiting for the final whistle seemed so long. We were trying to pressure the fourth official to make sure that he didn’t add on too much time. Those final five minutes were torture.' Holland can take a revenge of sorts tomorrow in Salvador but Mata warns that despite winning the last three major tournaments Spain have not lost their hunger and that even their older players are ready to give everything again, one more time. He says: 'When you look at the ages of some of the key players, this is probably the last World Cup for them. But they will want to play at this tournament, even if it is their last, and I am sure they will want to say to the world: ‘we’re still here’. History: Iniesta scored the decisive goal four minutes before the end of extra-time . La Roja: Juan Mata is hoping the Spanish squad can defend their World Cup crown . 'And then the young players coming up behind them have a brilliant future. They more or less play the same style of football and they can give the national team continuity.' One of those young players will be Mata who says: 'People ask has the motivation gone with so many tournaments won but I’m only 26. It doesn’t take any motivation away from me. It makes me want to live it all again.' Mata’s World Cup chances were almost ruined by falling out of favour at Chelsea. He found a new home at Manchester United but joined the club at a difficult moment and could easily have missed the final cut.' 'Sometimes [when playing for Manchester United] I thought ‘I have to prove a point to the national team here’ but it’s much better to go out onto the pitch and play as you always do for your club and let things happen naturally. It’s no good thinking: ""I’ve got to play well to go to the World Cup"".' New home: Mata (right) signed for Manchester United from Chelsea in January . Prepared: Mata challenges Jordi Alba (left) during a Spain training session on Tuesday . There was silence from Del Bosque in those difficult months. It’s not the Spain coach’s style to be in contact with the country’s foreign legion but when it came to picking his 23 he had no doubts about including the United midfielder just as he had done in the Confederations Cup final one year ago when Mata started the final against Brazil. Can Spain put right what went wrong last time in the Maracanà? 'Lots of things went against us that day,' he says. 'The physical difference between the two sides and the atmosphere both worked for Brazil and we had that bit of bad luck when David Luiz cleared one off the line from Pedro. 'I think if we had scored then, it would have taken the edge off of the atmosphere and the game. The stadium was incredible, and there was so much noise. 'Then they scored two goals while we missed out on that Pedro chance, and that’s where the game got away from us. They will be among the favourites again but so will we.' Mata dismisses the idea that the Confederations Cup defeat showed that Spain had been ‘found out’ as a team with only one way of playing. 'I think we do have variation within our game. We have players who can open up the pitch when the game is tight. We have strikers who are physically strong and we have full-backs who can overlap. 'I think the coach has a very clear footballing identity, a way of playing that we all believe in, but I also think that we have other options. Looking back on the Brazil game, for example, they were better than us. It wasn’t a lack of variety or an inability to play another way.' Pedigree: Mata scored against Italy during Spain's Euro 2012 final win in Kiev . This time Spain have a ‘Brazilian’ of their own with Diego Costa offering something different in attack. 'In principle, he’s different,' says Mata. 'If you ask the strikers who have played for Spain over the last few years they will tell you that it’s a very hard job. The way that Spain plays makes it difficult for them. That is why Cesc [Fabregas] or [David] Silva have played in attack and it’s been a good solution. But I think Costa can bring what he has brought to Atlético. Goals. That’s the fundamental thing: goals, goals, goals. 'He can battle with the central defenders. He can receive the ball with his back to goal and bring others in. He can get behind defences although that is harder when you play for Spain because teams sit so deep. Strength: The Manchester United star hopes Diego Costa can make an impact in Brazil . 'But he played fantastically this season. His team has played incredibly well and he was often their most important player. He’s done enough to be called up, that’s for sure.' Back in Spain expectations will also be high and only heightened by the memories a game against the Dutch will bring to the surface. 'People get used to winning; it becomes all or nothing,' says Mata of the increased demands back home. Could that same expectation count even more against Brazil than it will against Spain? 'I spoke to Oscar about this some months ago and he said: ‘Everyone is expecting us to win’. I think that’s a double-edge sword. It can really carry you through out on the pitch and give you incredible energy but it things don’t go well then it’s an extra pressure.” Favourites: Spain are likely to have to face their Confederations Cup conquerors Brazil if they are to defend their crown . Mata says recreation will again be important as Spain try to distance themselves from the pressure. 'We had a games room four years ago with cards, pool, table tennis and it helped get us through. I would play table-tennis with Sergi Busquets and Gerard Piqué who’s very good. Sergio Ramos played. It was very competitive.' Games time will once again help players switch off from the demands of being the team everyone wants to beat. No country has ever won four straight tournaments. Atmosphere: Mata believes keeping up team spirit will be key to dealing with World Cup pressure . To do it, and do it in style would probably not only mean Spain kept their ‘world’s greatest’ crown but also inherited the 1970 Brazil team’s ‘all-time greatest’ title. 'In 2012 we realised that it was not enough to win or play well. We had to win and play well. That’s great because it shows that people have high expectations of us and that comes from what we have achieved before. 'But it also means that people sometimes forget that winning is not so easy. The demands are huge and what we want to achieve is huge too.' Talent: The Spanish midfielder will look to help his side keep their 'world's greatest' crown .","Juan Mata recalls being on the bench as Andres Iniesta won the 2010 World Cup for Spain .

"Infected: Simon McClure was a frequent visitor to Switzerland and Thailand where he used prostitutes . An HIV sufferer who passed on the potentially deadly virus to his lover may have infected hundreds of other women, it was claimed today. Simon McClure ignored ‘clear advice’ from doctors when he was diagnosed in 2006 not to have unprotected sex. The 38-year-old from Middlesbrough later boasted of sleeping with hundreds of women and had only recently returned from honeymoon in Cuba. While McClure now sits behind bars, detectives issued an urgent appeal to identify any other women he may have infected. His one known victim told of her harrowing ordeal today and said McClure – who was jailed for two years and six months – had destroyed her. She said she had to endure a life sentence while he would be free by the Christmas after next, having served just half of his jail term. ‘I despise him,’ said the mother of three. ‘I’m now aware that he boasted about sleeping with hundreds of women. Nor did I have any idea he was HIV positive.’ She only discovered that she was carrying the virus after a routine check when she was 28 weeks’ pregnant with McClure’s daughter in 2008. The woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, went into premature labour the next day and gave birth. Her child, who is now two, is not carrying the virus. McClure pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm at Teesside Crown Court. The 38-year-old HIV carrier was a frequent visitor to Switzerland and Thailand, where he used prostitutes, and had boasted about sleeping with 'hundreds' of women. Prison: McClure was jailed for two years and eight months at Teesside Crown Court (pictured) after he admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim . He was diagnosed after returning from . South East Asia in 2006 but did not tell people he had unprotected sex . with, Alexander Menary, prosecuting, told the court. His victim's brother and aunt revealed how she is struggling . to come to terms with how her life has changed. The family said they . were disappointed with the sentence of two years and eight months. Her . brother said: 'You get more than that for burglary.' Her aunt said: 'We . don't think it is long enough. She has to live with this every day. She . has got a life sentence. He will be out before Christmas next year.' His lawyer, Graham Brown, told Judge . Howard Crowson said: 'He hasn't done . what was right and proper.' Police fear 'hundreds' of McClure's  sexual partners could be infected by the virus, pictured under a microscope . In a victim impact statement, the victim told how she is worried about passing on the virus, and . said: 'My life will never be normal again.' She revealed she was . rejected by a dentist and doctor, and has to ensure nobody touches her . toothbrush and that cuts are carefully managed. McLure was told by Judge Crowson that his . risk-taking was premeditated. The judge added: 'I am sure you knew - . everybody is aware - of the risks involved in having unprotected sex . carrying HIV. 'Any form of intimate sexual relationship has a degree of . mutual trust and you breached it by what you did. 'The effect on her has . been devastating. She endured the fear, having given birth prematurely, . that the child may also carry the virus... the happy news has been . given that it does not. 'She will have to live with what is, . unfortunately, still in this country, a stigma which attaches itself to . people who carry this virus, even though she is not at fault for it.' Outside the hearing, Detective Inspector Andy Greenwood, of Cleveland Police, said: 'If anybody has any information in relation to McClure they should come forward. 'The possibility exists that he has had relationships with other people that we are not aware of and we would urge them to contact us immediately. 'He has now been sentenced to an appropriate period of custody, so they can come forward now and tell us about it and we can take the appropriate action.' Mr Greenwood added: 'The victim will suffer for the rest of her life through the reckless and callous behaviour of this individual. 'She is unable to have a normal life and carry out day-to-day activities through no fault of her own.'","Simon McClure ignored 'clear advice' from doctors about unprotected sex .

"A former executive at the News of the World, whose emails revealed widespread phone-hacking at the now defunct paper, was jailed for eight months yesterday. Ian Edmondson had already admitted conspiring with colleagues to illegally access voicemails and has been linked to 334 hacking cases including those of Jude Law, Sienna Miller and Paul McCartney. Passing sentence at the Old Bailey, Judge John Saunders told the 45-year-old ex-news editor: ‘There was considerable pressure on journalists at the News of the World to obtain stories to sell newspapers - that may have led to a belief that the ends justified the means.’ Ian Edmondson, whose emails revealed widespread phone-hacking at the News of the World, has been jailed for eight months . Edmondson is the eighth employee of what was once Britain’s biggest-selling paper to have been convicted of involvement in hacking. Hacking first emerged in 2006 when bosses at the paper’s parent company, News International, said it was limited to ex-royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn Mulcaire, who were both jailed. However the discovery of emails from Mulcaire to Edmondson, by then the paper’s associate editor, led to a major new police investigation. Ian Edmondson has been linked to 334 hacking cases including those of Sienna Miller (pictured) and Jude Law . The emails, dating from 2006, provided instructions on how to hack the phones of the then deputy prime minister, a government minister and Frederick Windsor, the son of Queen Elizabeth's cousin. Edmondson, who was sacked in 2011, was a defendant in the trial that led to the jailing of his former editor Andy Coulson, who later become David Cameron’s media chief. The trial was told Coulson had once instructed Edmondson when he was working on a story about a celebrity to ""do his phone"".","Ian Edmondson admitted conspiring with colleagues to illegally access voicemails .

"Down on the farm: Sir Paul McCartney with his first wife Linda on the estate in the early 1970s . He was so happy there he wrote it a ‘love letter’ that became a massive chart hit. But Paul McCartney’s estate in the Mull of Kintyre is now at the centre of an embarrassing row after he dismissed two members of staff. Caretaker Jimmy Paterson has been given three months to leave his tied cottage, and estate manager Bobby Cairns has been fired. It is understood the pair, with 55 years of service between them, are under strict contractual instructions not to reveal any details. But their friends and families said last night the sackings came out of the blue, and they believe Sir Paul has fallen out of love with south-west Scotland. One neighbour said: ‘I think he lost faith in Mull of Kintyre when Linda died [in 1998]. He’s hardly been here.’ The former Beatle, who is 71, bought the remote farm in 1966 and it became a refuge where his late wife Linda and he found solace, and where their children spent the summer holidays. He bought two neighbouring farms in later years and created a 600-acre wildlife haven. ‘It seems like he’s lost interest,’ said the neighbour. ‘He came far more when Wings were on the go. He was around more in his heyday, when he’d come in his private plane. ‘And that’s when he had the big gates and the guards. ‘I don’t think he’ll be planning to sell the land – he’ll just be trying to make it more of a viable unit. But unfortunately these two chaps are going to lose their jobs. ‘Somebody else said he’s got a new factor, someone who looks after his estate, and they’ve seen that it’s been losing money. So we think that might be why.’ Mr Paterson, 50, who lives at High Peak Farm with fiancée Marion Pope, 51, and their 17 dogs, takes care of day-to-day business. Yesterday Miss Pope’s mother Margaret Barnes said: ‘I know Marion will be hurting badly, and Jimmy will be as well. I don’t know where they’ll go. 'Marion had a house before she moved to the farm but she gave that up. The Beatle, 71, famously sang that he wanted to always live there. But since then he has fallen out of love with it . 'It is a shocking thing to have happened, especially with Jimmy being there 20 years. 'You’d think they’d be given more than three months. ‘I hope she is alright. The farm was her life.’ Mr Cairns, 52, who lives in nearby Campbeltown, was also staying tight-lipped. A friend of Sir Paul said the decision had not been made lightly, and added: ‘The land has been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair this last 15 years or so, hence making the change in management. ‘They want to bring the land back up to scratch and make it workable again. It’s time for a change. The McCartneys spent their time in their 'little hideaway' with children Mary, Stella and James . 'The Forestry Commission will be involved and Paul’s people are taking advice on what to do.’ Sir Paul once described the farm as a ‘little hideaway’, adding: ‘It is a lovely place. I love it. I love the people up there. ‘I am so relaxed up there, I can sort of breathe when I get up there, pure air.’ Following Linda’s death from breast cancer in 1998, a statue of her cradling a lamb was set up in a memorial garden in Campbeltown. More recently, the sprawling farm was listed as a £1.5million asset during Sir Paul and Heather Mills’s divorce battle. Last night a spokesman for Sir Paul declined to comment.","The £1.5m Scottish estate was a 'little hideaway' for the McCartneys .

"Raheem Sterling will miss England's final warm-up game against Honduras on Saturday after he was sent off during the draw with Ecuador in Miami. The Liverpool forward saw red with 11 minutes remaining after a wild sliding tackle on Manchester United counterpart Antonio Valencia sparked a late brawl. Substitute Sterling had only been on the pitch for 15 minutes before launching into a flying challenge near the touchline which won him the ball - but took Valencia out afterwards. Harsh? Raheem Sterling saw red and will miss England's final friendly against Honduras . The angered Ecuador captain responded by jumping to his feet and grabbing the England winger’s neck, before the pair were split up. Sterling's absence against Honduras means he will struggle to force his way into Roy Hodgson's starting line-up for England's opening game of the World Cup against Italy on June 14. Valencia, who suffered an horrific leg break four years ago after a challenge from Rangers' Kirk Broadfoot when playing for United in the Champions League, apologised to his team-mates and coach Reinaldo Rueda after the game. 'I am sorry for the fight with Sterling,' said Valencia. 'I apologised to the team after the match and the coach.' Team-mate Segundo Castillo nearly missed out on Ecuador’s World Cup squad because of a knee injury he sustained against Mexico. Flying in: Sterling went in hard on Valencia, sparking furious scenes as the two sides battles to a draw . Making contact: Sterling gets the ball and the man with a reckless challenge . Going to ground: Valencia is knocked off his feet by the impact of Sterling's tackle . Valencia reacted so aggressively against Sterling because he feared the Liverpool winger could have ended his World Cup prospects. 'When he (Sterling) tackled me I thought about Segundo Castillo,' Valencia said. 'He nearly missed the World Cup because of injury and I feared I would too, but thankfully I am OK.' Hodgson later spoke of his 'disappointment' after the duo were given their marching orders. 'I'm disappointed,' he said. 'I thought it was a fierce challenge from young Raheem, not a foul challenge. He played the ball and accelerated into the ball. 'I'm disappointed with Antonio's reaction, grabbing the player. Had he not jumped up there wouldn't have been a problem but, when he does that, the referee had to deal with that and sent Raheem off. I'm pleased Raheem didn't react to a lot of people milling around him. 'Jack had been on the receiving end a few minutes early from a very similar challenge from an Ecuadorian player and did not react.'

"A jilted ex-boyfriend tried to kill his former partner by setting fire to her home after she refused to take him back when he sent her flowers and a card, a court heard. Gary Griffiths, 44, is accused of pouring petrol through the letterbox of ex-girlfriend Tracey Powell's home in Brownhills, West Midlands, the day after his attempts to win her back failed. Wolverhampton Crown Court heard today how Griffiths was caught on CCTV near to her home after the fire broke out in the early hours of March 4 this year. Prior to the blaze, he allegedly sent a text to Miss Powell, a teacher, saying: 'Goodbye Tracey'. Gary Griffiths, 44, is accused of pouring petrol through the letterbox of ex-girlfriend Tracey Powell's home in Brownhills, West Midlands (centre), the day after his attempts to win her back with flowers and cards failed . The court heard she had just dumped Griffiths after a two-month relationship but they had remained in contact. She said: 'He wasn't that happy and said he was annoyed about the fact that we were not seeing each other.' Miss Powell told the jury she was woken up by calls to her work and private mobile phones shortly before the fire broke out but ignored them when she recognised Griffiths' number. As well as the 'Goodbye Tracey' text, she also claims he sent her a message to say she should take her pet dog 'Becks' with her to work and that 'the fire starters are going to burn down' the street. She managed to escape the blaze after calling 999. She said: 'I was shocked and thought it was a bit aggressive. Literally as I read it I realised something was going on outside. 'I heard a noise like a clunk or like something shutting. 'I looked outside and I saw something like hazard lights. 'Instinctively I opened the window and I saw him and saw flames from the footpath below the window. The flames were at the front door.

I called 999. 'I could smell smoke and burning and the petrol smell was really strong.' Firefighters arrived and extinguished the fire which caused damage to Miss Powell's front door and smoke damage to her home. Griffiths denies attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life. However, he has admitted a further charge of arson being reckless as to whether life is endangered.

"Click here to see more from our brilliant Match Zone service including this map if Fellaini's goal . Until Marc Wilmots made the changes that produced two quite brilliant goals in the final 20 minutes, Belgium were in danger of turning into England of the more recent past here on Tuesday. A ‘golden generation’ of talent, a squad seemingly overflowing with big-money individuals, that comes together for the national team to play stuttering, stagnant football. They were dreadful, a goal down and playing nothing like as well as they should have been given the players they have at their disposal; the third most expensive squad in the competition behind Brazil and Spain based purely on transfer fees. The England players to which one refers  might wish to point to the fact that, as awful as they were against Algeria four years ago, they did at least stop them scoring in one of the most mind-numbing, goalless and utterly soulless encounters in World Cup history.

Att: 56, 800 . *Player ratings by MATT LAWTON at the Mineirao Stadium . It was thanks to England, not to mention one or two other teams, that Algeria came into this tournament having not celebrated a World Cup goal since scoring against Northern Ireland in Mexico in 1986. But thanks to Belgium, and in particular to Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen, that run came to a sudden and dramatic end when Faouzi Ghoulam converted his 25th minute penalty here at the Estadio Mineirao and celebrated like he had just won the entire tournament. In fairness to the Valencia forward, whose perfectly timed run panicked Vertonghen into committing the foul in the first place, he had just scored a goal that threatened to secure the biggest shock of the competition so far. A victory against one of the pre-tournament favourites. In the end it was not to be, Wilmots making the changes – with Marouane Fellaini and Dries Mertens among them – that produced the response the Belgium manager desired. A 70th minutes equaliser from Fellaini and a marvellously executed goal, courtesy of Eden Hazard’s perfect delivery for Mertens 10 minutes later. Perhaps it was to be expected. Perhaps we should remember that, Daniel Van Buyten aside, these Belgian players had never been to a World Cup before. But they certainly made life difficult for themselves even if Wilmots claimed beforehand that, having studied videos of their last 10 games, he knew everything there was to know about Algeria.

Incident: Referee Marco Rodriguez gives a yellow card to Vertonghen as Vincent Kompany looks on . Back of the net: Belgium's Thibaut Courtois (left) fails to save Feghouli's penalty . The highest-ranked team in Africa certainly started positively against a Belgium team burdened by a degree of expectation and a lack of experience on this stage. Belgians have long been of the view that this group can emulate the side that reached the semi-finals in 1986. Why they thought they could prove themselves fast learners and progress comfortably from a group that also includes Fabio Capello’s Russia. Before long Belgium did appear to be in command, dominating possession but finding life a little frustrating against opponents defending very deep. Eventually Axel Witsel unleashed a blistering effort from distance that Rais Mbolhi could only parry. Making history: Algeria players celebrate their team's first World Cup goal in 28 years . Romelu Lukaku failed to get a single touch of the ball inside Algeria's penalty before being substituted - Click here for more from our brilliant Match Zone service . Poor: Lukaku failed to touch the ball inside Algeria's box during his 58 minutes on the pitch . Joy: Feghouli celebrates with his team-mates after scoring his team's first goal of the 2014 World Cup . It made the penalty they conceded all the more frustrating for Belgium; to have that much of the ball but find themselves a goal down after 23 minutes. There was no question of it not being a penalty, Vertonghen allowing himself to get caught by the run of Feghouli in pursuit of a teasing Faouzi Ghoulam cross and committing the foul – a foolish foul – in desperation. It amounted to a dreadful piece of defending, with Kompany certainly wasting no time in expressing his disappointment to his colleague. Feghouli’s successful conversion not only ended that long wait for an Algerian World Cup goal but put the Belgians under enormous pressure. Witsel tested Mbolhi again, while Vertonghen endeavoured to make amends for his mistake with a free-kick that whistled over the Algeria crossbar. Struggle: Kevin De Bruyne (left) struggled to make an impact for the Red Devils . In the middle: Dembele (right) flies through the air after being fouled by Medjani . Hazard had endured a difficult first half, too, but he did burst clear at one stage and so nearly present Lukaku with the simplest of opportunities to equalise. As it was, Hazard’s delivery just eluded him. Armed with a clipboard, Wilmots seemed ready to make changes at half-time. He certainly needed to. For all their possession – 66 per cent in that opening 45 minutes – they were alarmingly short of ideas, with Lukaku a lumbering, ineffective presence at the pinnacle of their attack. Nacer Chadli was also among those who disappointed and a player already reflecting on a poor season for Tottenham – he was one of four Spurs players to start this contest – was hooked during the interval, Mertens stepping off the bench to replace him. Ouch: Mehdi Mostefa (left) scythes down Hazard during a difficult first 45 minutes for the Red Devils . Lukaku would not remain on the pitch much longer, losing his place to the relatively inexperienced Divock Origi. Wilmots when then make a further change, sending on Fellaini. While Wilmots would have been alarmed to see Carl Medjani so nearly score a second for Algeria, the introduction of Origi almost paid off when he accelerated into the box only to see Mbolhi block his effort with his legs. In the end the breakthrough for Belgium came from a Kevin De Bruyne cross that Fellaini rose impressively to meet with a header that crashed home via the underside of the crossbar. It would be De Bruyne who then made the crucial interception to spark the next attack, with Hazard then bursting down the left flank before crossing into the path of the advancing Mertens. A moment of joy mixed with relief, and proof that, for all the disappointment of that first half, they have already gone one better than the England of four years ago.

"When you hit the spot, nothing feels better than scratching an itch. And it seems this black bear has done just that.

Lost in the rhythm, it stamps its foot while lunging up and down in a circular motion. Maximum extension: It throws itself int the air to build momentum as it appears to be enjoying it . And back down again: It pounds its paw down on the floor to rub its neck against the bark . Here we go again: The bear, one of just 25,000 of its kind, then swings back around to start the move again . At one point, it slows down, seemingly savoring the moment - before whirling its head around again and getting right back into the swing of it. And then - out of the blue - it stops, jumps to its feet, and looks alert as if nothing had ever happened. Facebook users rushed to comment on the adorable video, taken on September 21.

"All he could do was watch. Vicente Del Bosque stood on the Maracana touchline - grim-faced, hands in pockets and moustache somehow bowed - presumably wondering how it came to this. Humiliated in the most embarrassing way possible, it is the end for Spain. For six years they have been the most proactive, visionary side in the world but on the eastern coast of Brazil on Wednesday night they lacked cohesion, fight and a basic plan. As the whistle was blown on their World Cup defence, the coach’s head dropped before he arched back inside having long since accepted that the lights are probably out on his managerial career. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Vincente Del Bosque get on the wrong bus . Shock: The world champions are out of the 2014 World Cup after two consecutive defeats . Won't need these again: Iker Casillas throws his gloves to fans after a poor display at the Maracana . Head bowed: Vicente Del Bosque got major decisions wrong throughout a dismal campaign for Spain . The statistics don't lie, either. They have conceded more goals (seven) this time around than they did in winning the the last three major competitions over the last six years, and the 14 shots they've allowed on goal is only three shy of the entire amount four years ago. Against Chile only Sergio Ramos and Santi Cazorla sent more than one shot on goal. Diego Costa didn't manage any. David . Silva lost the ball a staggering 22 times. Their pass completion percentage was at . its lowest since a quarter-final defeat against South Korea in 2002, . while Andres Iniesta attempted fewer passes than ever before. The front four made four challenges between them, the side's overall tackling success was down by 11 per cent compared to South Africa 2010 and their time in possession is now more passive. The list goes on: this was a side happy to stand and stare blankly as they were chastened. It means Spain are now the third holders in the last four tournaments - following France (2002) and Italy (2010) - to be dumped out in the first round. The South Americans were excellent, thoroughly deserving of progressing from Group B alongside Holland, but the ease in which the champions were dispensed with was difficult viewing. So too was their lack of urgency and stomach to coherse themselves out of a hole. Decisions from the top have been constantly curious and proven as badly wrong from start to finish. They have remained fiercely loyal to some – Iker Casillas in particular – and decided to dump more deserving others. Xavi was unused on the bench. So too was Gerard Pique. Meanwhile Del Bosque plumped for the castigated goalkeeper and an unfit Diego Costa. Casillas’ flapping has cost them the chance to at least take this to the final group game; hardly surprising given he’s turned out just twice for Real Madrid in La Liga since January 2013. Maybe Jose Mourinho was right after all – he saw this two years ago. Horror: Casillas has been a walking mistake this tournament and was consoled by Sergio Ramos against Chile . Awful: Brazilian-born Diego Costa has been a huge disappointment for Spain in the first two games . It isn’t just his gaffes that are the problem for Spain though. Is it too straightforward to ponder the legitimacy of a captain having to be comforted by Sergio Ramos after yet another mistake? What sort of message does that give off? And what does Casillas say to his team-mates at half-time, staring down the barrel without the guts to fight on? Their leaders have vanished. Ramos appears to be the sole figure willing to send rockets up behinds, to cajole, to care. They lack a man to put it about, mix things up and upset the bodies within the camp that have been engulfed by the sycophancy surrounding their six-year domination. Carles Puyol’s absence is hitting La Roja harder than was initially anticipated. They are a sorry mess, not even a shadow of former selves, with Casillas the pin-up and only wearing the armband by design. While his international demise is sad to see, it’s nothing compared to Xavi. Having to watch Sergio Busquets and Xabi Alonso make a dog’s dinner of shepherding Arturo Vidal – for a man of his guile – must have been tortuous. The pictures of the Barcelona midfielder on the bench were painful. Busquets failed to win a single tackle all night. Trouble: Fernando Torres looked more threatening than Costa despite struggling for form in recent years . Is that a captain's stance? Casillas looked bemused in the tunnel before going out for the second half . Out on their feet: The Spanish team looked tired in the second half, and were outrun against Chile . Then there is Costa. Chelsea are, for some unbeknown reason, spending £32million on a striker whose two shots off target are the only contributions to a dismal week. Yes, he lacks match practice – much like Casillas – but if the Brazilian-born forward was deemed sharp enough to start then questions must be asked about what he actually brings. His first touch was heavy, body language non-existent and pace laughable. Twenty-one touches all evening and not a single one in the six-yard box; Fernando Torres replaced him in the 64th minute and managed just two fewer. There is more than a slight argument for Del Bosque repaying some faith in Torres, who – while awful at Stamford Bridge - has played his best football at major tournaments. Eighteen-goal Fernando Llorente missed out on the 23-man squad and they’ve gone into it without a striker capable of finding the net. And having players going into the . tournament in indifferent form, with fitness issues or just a poor . season has been right at the heart of their problems. That, coupled with . the fact that plan B was to continue with A. The like-for-like . substitutions in both defeats were bizarre and had no impact on changing . the course of the games. Glum: Xavi (centre) could only watch on as his Spain side were utterly humiliated at the Maracana . They can't believe it! Spanish supporters watched on distraught as they were taught a footballing lesson . Tiki-taka wasn’t their eventual undoing, far from it. No matter what Spain played this summer - 4-4-2, 3-4-3, 4-6-0 - they’d have gone out. They weren’t good enough in possession, were disgustingly fragile without it and had no inclination to battle for the cause. The shrugs after defeat against Holland were testament to that. These giants of the game are now growing used to not winning games. Of Barcelona and Real Madrid’s combined final 20 games of the league season, eight of them ended in draw or defeat. Even though there were only two players over the age of 30 in their starting XI against Chile, the perception is that they are now finished. Del Bosque - while not ruling out staying in charge – definitely is. This is the end, my friend.","The world champions lost 2-0 against Chile at the Maracana .

"Daniel Sturridge will spearhead England’s attack in Manaus on Saturday night with his position as Roy Hodgson’s No 9 beyond doubt. I played and trained with him at Liverpool and watched him develop further this season under Brendan Rodgers. Here’s why Italy may have a problem on Saturday night. He was, in my opinion, the finest finisher in the Barclays Premier League last season. He only had the seventh best conversion rate (24.7 shots per goal) of the 18 players who scored more than 10 — Rickie Lambert was top with 16.1 — but Daniel was electric. He's electric: Daniel Sturridge (second right) celebrates scoring for England against Peru last month . The biggest compliment I could pay him is that whenever he got a sight of goal, I had no doubt he would finish it off. There were all kinds of finishes, ranging from the spectacular — think of his chip against West Brom at Anfield last October — to the tap-ins all strikers thrive on. Only against Arsenal in the FA Cup did he miss chances you’d expect him to put away. He was off-target against Honduras in the final warm-up game but he is a forward with confidence and belief. The value that adds to a team is huge. He’ll relish this stage. If England go  far, he could be an outside bet for the Golden Boot. Chipping in: Sturridge scored all kinds of goals for Liverpool last season, including this dink against West Brom . Dancing to his tune: Sturridge's celebration was seen more than a few times last season . When he signed for Liverpool in January 2013, we knew there were questions about his attitude. If that hadn’t been the case, we wouldn’t have got him for £12million. Had his reputation been good, Liverpool would have paid £30m for a striker of his quality. But I was happy Brendan Rodgers was prepared to give him a chance, as he was what we were looking for — a young, English lad with pace and ability. I honestly couldn’t fault him during the six months that I worked with him. He was always a good lad in the dressing room and took his job seriously. Even now when I watch from afar, he comes across well in the interviews he gives and says the right things about wanting to improve. Good attitude: Sturridge has been happy and a breath of fresh air under Brendan Rodgers (right) at Liverpool . There used to be ‘arguments’ between him and Raheem Sterling at Melwood over who was quickest and I’m sure they are continuing in training with England. What isn’t up for debate is the fact that Daniel has pace to burn. Speed frightens defenders more than anything and, if Daniel uses his properly, it could be a potent weapon for England. He has a change of a gear to get in behind top defences, as he showed when racing on to a Philippe Coutinho pass to score against Arsenal in February. He is quick off the mark and can leave people trailing. I felt at times he was conservative about how and when he made runs. If he is aggressive, it will give him another edge. Pace to burn: The speed of Sturridge (left) could be a potent weapon for England . If he had Wayne Rooney’s mentality, Daniel would be almost unstoppable. Wayne is the type of player who will play through the pain barrier and won’t let a niggle keep him out of the action. Luis Suarez is another who stays away from the treatment room at all costs. There was a feeling with Daniel that everything had to be right for him to play. If a knock played on his mind, he would want it assessed to be sure he could play but in a World Cup you don’t have time to stop and think. You must play when you are not 100 per cent fit, you have to carry the bumps and bruises and put yourself on the line. If he can do this in the years to come, you could see him blossoming into one of Europe’s best strikers. Carry on regardless: Sturridge has to learn to play when he is not 100 per cent fit . His goal record is outstanding — of players at the World Cup only Luis Suarez, Cristiano Ronaldo, Diego Costa, Lionel Messi and Saturday’s opponent Ciro Immobile bettered his tally of 21 league strikes last season. But there is much more to him. I knew from his early days in training he was a class act. It was the way he opened up his body to receive a pass, how he transferred his weight from one foot to another and moved quickly into position that struck a chord. Some may say he is one-footed but left-footed players tend to be the ones with most natural ability. No question he has ability, now Daniel must make the most of the opportunity in front of him. Goal stars: Luis Suarez (left), Lionel Messi (right) and Cristiano Ronaldo (below) bettered Sturridge's tally . New pretenders: Diego Costa (left) and Ciro Immobile were the only other players to score more than Sturridge .","Sturridge was the finest finisher in the Premier League last season .

"A unique movie film of the 1924 World Series triumph of the Washington Senators over the New York Yankees has just been released by the Library of Congress. The 90-year-old film lay undiscovered in the rafters of the garage of a home in Worcester, Massachusetts until an elderly woman died. The four-minute long video was recorded on highly flammable nitrate film stock and stored in cans in the elderly woman's house. The unique footage was captured on highly flammable nitrate stock film which can spontaneously combust . The footage shows short excepts of action interlaced with captions explaining to the viewer what's happening . Despite only having one camera, the operator captures several thrilling pieces of action for the viewer . The executor of the woman's estate was the mother of Lynanne Schweighofer, who is a Moving Image Preservation Specialist at the Library of Congress' Packard Campus. According to Mike Mashon of the Library of Congress: 'While preparing the neighbor’s house for sale, Lynanne’s father found eight cans of film in the rafters of the detached and not climate-controlled garage, a space we archivists would not normally recommend for long term storage of motion picture film…especially since these reels were labeled as nitrate film stock. 'Now, nitrate film is flammable, creates its own oxygen when it burns, and we have 124 individual vaults at the Packard Campus, each at 39° F / 30% RH, to store the nearly 140 million feet of nitrate we have in our collection. 'Once it starts to deteriorate, the degradation proceeds rather rapidly and given the temperature fluctuations to which these reels had been subjected for years, we weren’t optimistic about their condition.' The camera man recognised the chap second from left as 30th President of the US Calvin Coolidge . Experts believe the amazing footage was left in the garage and forgotten . He wrote on his blog: 'So, we contacted Liz Coffey at the Harvard Film Archive, who retrieved the reels on our behalf. She confirmed the film as nitrate and arranged with a certified hazmat shipper at the HFA to send the batch to Culpeper. 'They were in astonishingly good shape; only a couple evidenced any sign of slight mold or mildew. Many of the reels were printed on Bay State nitrate stock. Bay State was a Kodak competitor back in the day and its nitrate film has proven notoriously unstable, but miraculously not in this instance. The oldest film was from 1919 and the newest from 1926. 'The house had been sold a couple of times over the years; we expect the first owners placed the film in the garage, although we have no idea why. It seems very likely no one knew they existed until their discovery a few months ago.' Experts made a digital copy of the film while the original nitrate film stock was photochemically preserved on safety film stock. A period appropriate musical score was even added to increase the atmosphere. The house changed owners several times over the past 90 years but no one had spotted the film cans . Luckily the person clearing the house was related to an expert in old film stock at the Library of Congress .","Unique footage lay hidden in a Massachusetts garage for the past 90 years .

"A restaurant down the road from Camp David, where Winston Churchill once visited to see how a jukebox worked, auctioned off its collection of memorabilia on Monday. The Cozy Restaurant, Maryland's oldest family-owned restaurant before it closed in June, was selling historical artifacts and oddities from presidential visitors and high-profile guests to cover hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes. The items up for sale included the a bearskin rug, a gift from President Herbert Hoover's secretary that was by the president himself, and the inn's jukebox, NBC reports. Scroll down for video . Quaint: Located on the way to Camp David, the Cozy Restaurant became a stop for visiting dignitaries and presidents' families in the quiet town of Thurmont . According to 78-year-old owner Jerry Freeze, whose father Wilbur opened the inn in 1929, Churchill visited the restaurant as World War II was being fought. The British Prime Minister was riding with FDR to the presidential compound and was curious to see what a jukebox looked like. Churchill popped into the restaurant while Roosevelt stayed in the car. At the time, the restaurant was still a rough place, the scene of wild parties and fights that Wilbur constantly had to break up. During the Eisenhower administration, the camp's name was changed from Shangri-La to Camp David, after the president's father and grandfather, and members of the family visited to grab a bite. The presidential compound later took on increased significance, as presidents received foreign dignitaries, which in turn attracted the press. From Margaret Thatcher visiting Ronald Reagan to President Carter hosting the Camp David accords, White House reporters took a break from Washington to stay at the Cozy Inn. Fine dining: Though the family restaurant developed a quieter atmosphere in later years, early on it was the scene of raucous parties and fights . Cozy: Herbert Hoover's secretary made a gift of a bearskin rug to the Freeze family, saying Hoover shot the bear himself . 'We had all the press here,' Freeze said. 'The Walters, the Cronkites, the Brinkleys, the Donaldsons,' Freeze told the Washington Post. Some of the most frequent visitors during official stays at Camp David, however, were the security details, and the restaurant often served Secret Service agents. The restaurant was in trouble in recent years, and Freeze says the business owes $180,000 in state and federal taxes, which the auction was meant to partially cover. Summit: Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (left) and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat (right) hammered out a peace agreement for Israel and Palestine mediated by Jimmy Carter in the cabins of Camp David .

The crowd on Monday was mostly locals, coming to say goodbye as well as get a deal on a bust of George W Bush. 'It's a bit of history going away, and it's kind of sad to see,"" said Thurmont resident Clive Rowley, who expressed interest in the railroad caboose Freeze had brought into the restaurant. 'Now would be another time to make a transition,' said Freeze about keeping the inn open. 'I'm just getting up there in years a little bit. I'd never thought I'd run out of energy, but I have.'","The Cozy Restaurant in Thurmont, located about six miles from Camp David in Maryland, had a small museum in honor of the presidential compound .

"There is too much acceptance, too much tolerance, there are too many people shrugging their shoulders. They seem to be saying: England are out, but we didn’t expect much from them anyway. Why not?

OK, Sven’s England had a  better central defence but was the midfield superior to Roy Hodgson’s? Tactics have changed but that team is not better than Hodgson’s. So are we prepared to accept he is not in the same league as Sven? We have good players. Fred and Jo are Brazil’s main strikers but could they get in the England team? Joel Campbell was loaned out by Arsenal but he will be in the last 16 with Costa Rica. So don’t tell me England’s players aren’t good enough. I love the Premier League: Liverpool’s title charge, Manchester City’s title win, the story of change at Manchester United, the emerging talent of Roberto Martinez at Everton and yes, the new fixture list is out and Louis van Gaal is coming. But he’s not thinking about next season yet and we shouldn’t be either! England went to Brazil expecting to slug it out in a three-team group. It turned out that group doesn’t include England.

Germany: Exiting Euro 2000, beaten 3-0 by Portugal’s second string, was their worst performance in a major competition since the war. National coach Erich Ribbeck quit and an overhaul was launched, with Bundesliga clubs and the German FA working towards developing more technically able homegrown players. A programme focused on children aged eight to 14 served by 1,000 part-time German FA coaches. Under 21 players were promoted to senior level.France: The side was so poisonous four years ago in South Africa that the players went on strike before bombing out with defeats by Mexico and the host nation.Huge cleansing was required. Raymond Domenech was sacked, the entire 23-man squad was suspended and federation president  Jean-Pierre Escalettes resigned. Laurent Blanc repaired the team before Didier Deschamps (left) was installed after Euro 2012 to complete the job. He comes with the aura of a World Cup winner and will not hesitate to omit star players for the sake of squad unity, as Samir Nasri can testify.Holland: They were dumped out of Euro 2012 without a point — the first time for more than two decades they  had lost three games running. Manager Bert Van Marwijk did the honourable thing and offered his resignation. He found no resistance. In his place came Louis van Gaal, an experienced and highly successful manager at elite club level with a pedigree for developing youth. By Laurie Whitwell . And that is a team with Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard at its core, with exciting talent such as Ross Barkley and Raheem Sterling — forget their age — as well as Jack Wilshere, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge. Hodgson talked about the young squad making progress, but the average age of the starting lineup was 27. Uruguay’s was the same and Italy’s 27.7 — not exactly a fountain of youth. Throwing on Barkley only when the game is going against England is poor. He has some way to go before he can be compared to Paul Gascoigne, but would England have made it to the last four in 1990 if Robson had shown a similar lack of faith? I’ve written before that I would have started with Barkley. He could be England’s Gareth Bale but when he came on against Uruguay he was put out on the right. He doesn’t play there for Everton so why should he for England? Teams in this World Cup have been rewarded for playing with freedom. Were Ghana scared of Germany? Did Iran sit back against Argentina? Have Costa Rica accepted their ranking as the worst team in the group? They trailed Uruguay 1-0 at half-time and beat them 3-1. They beat Italy with a goal from Bryan Ruiz, who can’t get in the team at relegated Fulham. Andrea . Pirlo is Italy’s most influential player but he must have thought it was . his birthday when he played against England. He made 103 passes in that . match and only 81 against Costa Rica. They disrupted his game, but are . Costa Rica really better prepared than England? England have been too predictable when they had the chance to be unpredictable. When . England lost 2-1 to Italy, I worried that was as good as we’ve got and . so it proved against Uruguay, but why does it have to be this way? If . we all just nod as excuses are trotted out — it was too hot, we went . out to Suarez, we played in the jungle  — then we are condoning the . acceptance of failure.There are no excuses, no harsh red cards, or . unlucky penalty shootout defeats. Exit strategy: Roy Hodgson is facing questions about his future following England's poor performance . Head-scratcher: Redknapp was not impressed when Wayne Rooney was played on the left . Baffling: Mario Balotelli scored Italy's winner against England and Redknapp does not understand why the performance of Hodgson's side was celebrated so much . Pass master: Redknapp says Italy's Andrea Pirlo had it far too easy against England . The Italy loss was celebrated in some places as the best England have played in a decade. But they lost, to Italy!  Is that where we stand now? Championing defeats? I’m not calling for a change of  manager. And before anyone comments, this is not an attempt to get my dad, Harry Redknapp, a job. That ship has sailed. The FA have got exactly what they should have expected when they appointed Hodgson. Roy was a very safe option and that approach has transmitted to the performances on the pitch. But going out in the group stage of the World Cup with only two games played should not be swept under the carpet. Last year, the FA decided it was more important for young players to sit on the bench for a friendly in Brazil than gain tournament experience with the Under 21s. That is one place to start putting it right. Another is tournament mentality. After a gruelling game against Italy, England were unchanged against Uruguay. There wasn’t the same sharpness. France left out Paul Pogba and Antoine Griezmann — two of their best players — for their second match and breezed past Switzerland. You must show imagination with selection. Rooney out on the wing in the first game... he may as well not have been there. He’s our best player. Managing England is not an impossible job but people are trying to make it look hard. There is a lot to do. One of the biggest problems is England are falling — and too many people are accepting that fact.","Roy Hodgson's side eliminated at group stage for first time since 1958 .

"Baby food maker Gerber is being sued by the U.S. government after allegedly claiming falsely that its Good Start Gentle formula can prevent or reduce allergies in children. In a complaint filed on Thursday in court, the Federal Trade Commission said the New Jersey-based firm put labels on the product saying it would 'reduce the risk of developing allergies'. It claims these stickers contained bogus information, including the suggestion that the formula was the first to meet government approval for reducing the risk of allergies. One label, released by the FTC, shows a youngster staring wide-eyed at the camera, with the caption: 'I love mommy's eyes, not her allergies'. Lawsuit: This label from Gerber's Good Start Gentle formula, released by the Federal Trade Commission, shows a baby staring wide-eyed at the camera, with the caption: 'I love mommy's eyes, not her allergies' The Commission says it wants Gerber Products Co - which is also doing business as Nestlé Infant Nutrition - to pull its claim from formula labels and advertisements. At some point, it may even ask the court to require that Gerber issue refunds to consumers for the $20-plus packages sold since 2011. However, in a statement, Gerber said it had not violated the law. 'We are defending our position because we believe we have met, and will continue to meet, all legal requirements to make these product claims,' Kevin Goldberg, Gerber's vice president and general counsel, said. Claims: The U.S. government says Gerber has falsely claimed that its Good Start Gentle formula (pictured) can prevent or reduce allergies in children . The main issue in the case is how far Gerber went when claiming that its formula could prevent atopic dermatitis, a skin rash known as baby eczema that can be caused by allergies. According to the FTC, Gerber had petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2009 for permission to connect its use of partially hydrolyzed whey proteins to reducing atopic dermatitis. The FDA agreed, but only if Gerber qualified its statement by making clear that there was 'little scientific evidence' for the relationship. Instead, packages of Good Start Gentle in 2011 suggested it was the first formula approved by the FDA to reduce the risk that a baby would develop allergies in general. No qualifier was included, and the labels could easily be interpreted to mean that the formula could prevent a child from developing life-threatening food or environmental allergies, the FTC said. 'Parents trusted Gerber to tell the truth about the health benefits of its formula, and the company's ads failed to live up to that trust,' said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection. 'Gerber didn't have evidence to back up its claim that Good Start Gentle formula reduces the risk of babies developing their parents' allergies.' In its statement, released on Thursday, Gerber reiterated the claim that its formula can help prevent baby eczema, and said the company had been authorized by the FDA to feature that claim. 'Gerber always has and will continue to treat its mission of delivering nutrition and benefits to infants as its top priority,' Mr Goldberg wrote. Dispute: 'Parents trusted Gerber to tell the truth about the health benefits of its formula, and the company's ads failed to live up to that trust,' said Jessica Rich (left), director of the FTC's bureau of consumer protection . 'We believe the information conveyed in our marketing is important for parents who have children at risk for atopic dermatitis, the most common allergy in infancy.' With Gerber suggesting that it refuses to settle, the case will likely be decided by a district court in New Jersey, where the firm's headquarters is located. The FTC has not yet determined  whether consumer refunds may be necessary. Nestle shares closed up 0.4 percent in Swiss trading.","Gerber  put labels on its formula saying it would 'reduce risk of allergies'

"The world's most expensive cocktail went on sale in London yesterday - costing the same as a new family car at almost £9,000. Called Gigi's (pronounced 'gee-gees') the cocktail is aimed at the loaded frequenters of Mayfair, where properties regularly fetch more than £40million. It was created especially for singer Grace Jones at the star-studded opening of Gigi's restaurant as the owners wanted to give her special thanks for attending. Scroll down for video . A flute is filled with a vintage Champagne and an ultra-rare Armagnac to create the 'liquid god' Gigi's cocktail . It was created for Grace Jones, pictured with Boy George, at the star-studded opening of Gigi's restaurant . A flute is filled with a vintage Champagne and an ultra-rare Armagnac that pre-dates the Boer War with the result described as 'liquid gold'. The price is £8,888, which is equivalent to a brand new Mitsubishi Mirage, a Rolex Submariner, or renting a private jet to fly a family of five to the Mediterranean and back. A  regular Champagne glass holds 150mls, so even if they fill it to the brim that's £60 per 1ml. Due to the fact it contains some of the most expensive Champagnes and cognacs on the open market, the drink 'must be paid for in advance' to prevent the 'rather embarrassing' situation where a patron's debit or credit card is declined. Gigi's manager adds a sliver of gold leaf to the cocktail with an eye-watering price tag . The ingredients  include 1990 vintage Cristal and 1888 Samalens Vieille Relique Vintage Bas Armagnac . Makers claim the Gigi's drink tops the world's most expensive tipples - beating Melbourne's £8,167 Winston into second place. Restaurant manager Cesare Papagna said he wanted to give the iconic film star something 'truly special' to mark the occasion and used two of his most expensive drinks. The Gigi's has the appearance of a traditional Champagne cocktail which usually includes bubbly laced with cognac and bitters. But unlike them it is made with a bottle of 1990 vintage Cristal and a bottle of 1888 Samalens Vieille Relique Vintage Bas Armagnac. It also has 'lashings' of gold leaf to give it extra bling. Only the Angostura Bitters and sugar are bought 'off the shelf'. The cocktail's hefty price tag includes the market value of each full bottle of alcohol, which will produce approximately 12 flute servings worth £708 per glass - or about £177 per glug based on four large mouthfuls. Cesare said: 'We did not set out to create a cocktail for the fabulously rich but rather to give Ms Jones something memorable to thank her for coming. 'The taste was magnificent, as you would imagine.' He said the Gigi's - described as tasting 'like liquid gold' - will not be added to the restaurant's drinks menu but will be available to other 'discerning' guests from today. He added: 'The Gigi's isn't the kind of cocktail that you display on a blackboard - if you have to ask the price, you won't be able to afford it.' The price is £8,888, which is equivalent to a brand new Mitsubishi Mirage or a Rolex Submariner . It held the crown for world's most expensive cocktail for little over 18 months, but it's now been beaten to the top spot. With a dash of Grand Marnier, a soupçon of Chartreuse, a hefty dose of cognac and a dash of Angostura Bitters, the Winston cocktail at Melbourne's Club 23 sounds like a delicious treat for liqueur fans. But there's a catch that might just make patrons choke on their drink: it costs a staggering £8,167. The Winston cocktail at Melbourne's Club 23  costs a staggering £8,167 . The hefty price tag is thanks to the ultra-luxe ingredients, which include Grand Marnier Quintessence and Chartreuse Vieillissement Exceptionnellement Prolonge. Most expensive of the lot is the 1858 Croizet cognac, which costs £99,000 a bottle. The cocktail is served with garnishes that include chocolate nutmeg dust, poppy seed essence, rose essence and a little coconut. Along with deep pockets, those who wish to sample the cocktail will need to place their orders well before they arrive, as the drink takes two days to make, thanks to the labour intensive garnish.","The Gigi's was unveiled last night at opening of Gigi's restaurant in Mayfair .

"Councils are pursuing poll tax cheats who voted for the first time in two decades in Scotland's independence referendum. Officials have been ordered to comb the electoral roll to catch non-payers who dropped off the radar before re-registering ahead of September 18. Scots still owe more than £300million on the controversial Community Charge, introduced north of the Border by Margaret Thatcher in 1989 - one year before England. Councils are pursuing poll tax cheats who voted for the first time in two decades in Scotland's independence referendum . The historic vote on Scotland's future saw a surge in registrations, with 120,000 in the final six weeks alone, as people formed unprecedented queues outside town halls. By September 18, 97 per cent of people aged 16 and over had registered. Council chiefs believe some were returning to the electoral roll for the first time in a quarter of a century, after dropping off in a bid to avoid paying poll tax. Councillor Willie Young, of Aberdeen, said: 'For the last number of years we have been looking to see how we can claw back poll tax arrears. Officials have been ordered to comb the electoral roll to catch non-payers who dropped off the radar before re-registering ahead of September 18 . The historic vote on Scotland's future saw a surge in registrations, with 120,000 in the final six weeks alone, as people formed unprecedented queues outside town halls . We've still got approximately £1.8million to recover. The referendum gives us an opportunity to see how much money is due and how we can pursue it.' Councillor Jim Gifford, leader of Aberdeenshire Council, said officers were already scrutinising the updated voters' roll to see if records tallied up with their own books. 'If they don't, we will go after them for that money,' he said. 'We don't ever give up on money owed.' A spokesman for City of Edinburgh Council confirmed it would also pursue debtors through the electoral roll. 'The council uses all the data available to it to collect outstanding debts,' she said. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla), an umbrella group for councils, backed the steps. A spokesman said: 'Councils are within their rights to use whatever sources of information are available legally to pursue unpaid debt. 'Scotland's councils take collection of debt very seriously and place great emphasis on it for a number of reasons. 'Firstly, every pound of debt collected is a pound for frontline services, and secondly, they feel a moral obligation on those people who do diligently pay tax.' The deeply unpopular poll tax was introduced in Scotland before the rest of the country, in 1989, and led to widespread rioting . The poll tax was abolished in 1993 but over the four years, councils billed Scots households for £3.678billion - of which just over £3.35billion was paid, leaving £324.4million still to be collected. Arrears from the abolished tax in England and Wales were pursued through the court system. A six-year time limit was placed within which to collect debts. But under Scottish law debts can be chased for 20 years. The deeply unpopular poll tax was introduced in Scotland before the rest of the country, in 1989. Replacing the Rates system, the Poll Tax led to the biggest protests since the Miners' Strike. It was introduced by the Thatcher government to replace the property-rates system, with a simpler, individual local tax. Mass protests in Scotland were followed the year later in central London, and around the country, with violent scenes, looting, smashed shop fronts and mounted police battling to control rioters. The poll tax, officially known as the community charge, was eventually scrapped  and was integral to the fall of Margaret Thatcher. It was eventually replaced by the council tax in 1993. And, if some effort has been made to recover the debt since 1993, the clock is then reset to 20 years since the last attempt was made. Nationalists were also keen for councils to pursue poll tax arrears - but split on whether they should use voter registration to do it. Ian Brown, an SNP councillor in Highland, said: 'If people deliberately did not pay, and can afford to pay, then they should do. I would not be surprised if some councils are now potentially going after people who have suddenly popped up on their computer.' But Councillor Callum McCaig, SNP leader in Aberdeen, said: 'Clearly, there is a duty on local authorities to pursue debts through means available to them but the fear that will be there for some folk, keeping them from exercising their vote, is bad for democracy and ultimately bad for government at all levels.' Glasgow has the largest unpaid debt, with £125million outstand-ing. The council uses the electoral roll to trace debtors but is understood to be sceptical about how helpful the surge in registered voters will prove to be. A spokesman said: 'We have a debt management partner that works with us to recover arrears, including Community Charge. 'However, it becomes increasingly difficult to secure payments from historic accounts as time passes. In many cases, it is impossible as a substantial number of people will now have passed away.' Meanwhile, Alex Johnstone MSP, the welfare reform spokesman for the Scottish Tories said: 'Councils should do everything in their power to detect those who are evading council tax payments. If that means going through the electoral roll with a fine tooth comb, so be it.' 'Referendum gives us the opportunity' 'Fear may keep some from vote'","Scots referendum saw a surge in registrations with 120,000 in final six weeks .

"German football legend Franz Beckenbauer was banned for 90 days from all football activity by FIFA on Friday night after failing to co-operate with the inquiry into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Such a crackdown on one of the world’s best known figures in football, a World Cup winning player and coach and the force behind the 2006 World Cup in Germany, is the strongest possible sign that New York lawyer Michael Garcia means business with his investigation. Garcia had warned of severe penalties at the FIFA Congress this week for those who had purposely avoided being interviewed by his team and Beckenbauer, the most high profile of the refuseniks, is the first to be punished. Banned: FIFA have suspended former Executive Committee member Franz Beckenbauer from football activities for 90 days after he refused to co-operate into an investigation into the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid . Associates: Beckenbauer pictured with FIFA President Sepp Blatter. The German was on the world governing body's executive committee when the 2022 World Cup vote was held . Top of the world: Beckenbauer captained West Germany to the World Cup on home territory in 1974 . 'I really do not know why,"" Beckenbauer told Sky Television in Germany, when asked why he had been banned. 'First thing I did was look at the date as I thought it was an April Fool's joke.' 'I am the Bayern Munich honorary president. Even if I cannot do this for 90 days it is something the honorary president can survive.' Beckenbauer surprisingly stepped down . from the FIFA ExCo after being part of the committee who voted to give . the 2018 World Cup to Russia and the 2022 edition to Qatar with the . Qatari bid mired in allegations of vote buying. A . FIFA statement said: ‘The apparent breach relates to Mr Beckenabauer’s . failure to co-operate with an Ethics Committee investigation despite . repeated requests for his assistance.’ There . has been speculation that Garcia, who is due to deliver his report to . FIFA after the World Cup, had discovered some wrongdoing connected with . all bidding countries and would not single one out in his findings. But . the decision to discipline Beckenbauer suggests that Garcia will not be . afraid to recommend severe punishment – even a revote – if he finds . sufficient evidence. Request: Beckenbauer's 90-day ban was demanded by Michael Garcia, the ethics prosecutor leading the FIFA investigation into how the 2022 World Cup was awarded to Qatar . Inquiry: Michael Garcia is leading the probe into whether Qatar bribed its way to the 2022 World Cup . In . an exclusive interview with Sportsmail’s Jeff Powell earlier this month, . Beckenbauer had revealed that Garcia had sent him a questionnaire in . English rather than German. Beckenbauer told Powell: ‘It contained some . complex legal issues that I wasn’t comfortable about responding to in . anything but German.’ Beckenbauer . then went public last weeked with his reasons for swerving an interview . with Garcia, who had sent him two letters, the second of which had . angered the Kaiser. Beckenbauer . said: ‘I must say that I am seriously surprised about Mr Garcia’s . approach. I am no longer actively involved in football and he has . therefore no power whatsoever to interview me. ‘Fact . is also that Mr Garcia, who is probably used to calling the shots, . reacted unpleasantly to my response and tried the limits of my patience . in his second missive, both in tone and content. I believe that the . gentleman should try and understand that we like to maintain a certain . form in Europe.’ He . added: ‘Look everybody knows whose side I was on .The German Football . Association had a gentlemen’s agreement with the Australian FA and this I . had a mandate. I had made my views clear on several occasions.’ In an exclusive interview with Sportsmail's Jeff Powell earlier this month, Beckenbauer raised worrying doubts about the efficiency of the probe into the Qatar 2022 World Cup bribery allegations. The German icon confirmed he was contacted by the commission led by lawyer Michael Garcia, who is due to report after the World Cup in Brazil. Beckenbauer said: ‘They sent me a questionnaire but it was in English and it contained some complex legal issues. So I asked them to re-send it to me in German. ‘I have heard nothing from them since.’ The Kaiser is a good English speaker but added: ‘I wasn’t comfortable about responding to such technical questions in anything but German.’ Those most actively opposed to Qatar being awarded the 2022 Finals may not have welcome one answer Beckenbauer would have given. Of the allegations that disgraced former FIFA executive Mohammad Bin Hamman paid cash for votes, Beckenbauer said: ‘As usual the ballot was secret. ‘I am not revealing which country I voted should host those Finals. Nor do I know who Bin Hamman voted for. We worked together on the FIFA executive for four years and I regarded him as a friend. ‘But I can assure that I was never approached about my vote, nor was I ever offered anything. ‘If any allegations of corruption are proved then there is an argument for a re-vote. ‘One benefit of the Qatar bid is that that in complying with FIFA’s requirements they are constructing 12 stadia. They don’t need 12 grounds near each other. ‘They only need one new stadium so they are constructing in a way that 11 of them can be taken down after the World Cup, sent to countries in need around the world, where they be reassembled.’ Beckenbauer is also on the record as saying the Qatar World Cup would have to be played in winter.

"Elijah, eight, from Los Angeles, is tired. He's also in tears thanks to the weight of the heavy plank he's been asked to carry but Keith 'Sarge' Gibbs has no sympathy. 'You feel that pain son?' he thunders. 'That's what your mother feels when you decide to disrespect her!' Like thousands of other American children, Elijah has been enrolled in what has been dubbed an 'extreme brat camp' because of his poor behaviour. Scroll down for video . Tough love: Keith 'Sarge' Gibbs (centre) with two of his young charges during one of his Drill Weekends . Designed to tackle bad attitudes, defiance and what Sarge describes as 'deviant behaviour' (think lying and cheating), the camps are based on harsh military discipline and tough physical exercise. At Sarge's 'Drill Weekends', children aged between five and 14 are put through a series of military drills, often running late into the night, followed by lengthy hikes conducted to a marching beat of 'Dis-cip-line, Res-pect'. Harsh though it might sound, Sarge's camps, the majority of which involve children from Los Angeles' poorest and most dangerous neighbourhoods, do get results. And with endorsements from the LA Sheriff's Office, local councillors and California's Child and Family Department ringing in his ears, Sarge is proud of what his boot camps achieve. 'When we first started the programme, we dealt with 14 to 18 year old kids,' he explains. 'But then we realised that 16 and 17 year old kids... they've already dropped out of school and got gang tattoos. 'They're doing drugs and turning around more money in a month than I do in a year. It was then that I realised that I needed to start them at an earlier age and we dropped our age from five to 14. You've got to catch these kids young.' Discipline: According to Sarge, many of his young charges are at risk of joining one of LA's notorious gangs . No messing around: Sarge says discipline is missing from many of his young charge's lives . The majority of his recruits come, like Elijah, from single parent families and are frequently without a male role model - Elijah's father is in prison. This, says Sarge, is one of the key causes of bad behaviour. 'In today's society, when the male parent is absent, kids lean towards that gang member, who has that authority, who has that strength, who has that lifestyle.' It's a lifestyle that once mirrored Sarge's own. The part-time security guard and former Marine grew up in the Bronx, a tough part of New York, before finding salvation in the military. Now he hopes to replicate that success with the 17 new recruits that arrive at his camps each weekend, while also providing them with the male authority figure that they lack. 'Discipline, that's something these kids are missing,' he explains. 'If I was the President of the United States of America, every kid would go through boot camp. Tough stuff: Sarge leads a drill during one of his weekend boot camp courses in Pasadena . Hard work: Along with military drills and long hikes, a weekend with Sarge involves a spot of hard labour . What's more, he adds, satisfied, 'of the 10,000 kids that have come through my life, I'm blessed to say that many now want to be like me'. So popular have boot camps like the one run by Sarge become, the 'child intervention' industry is now worth in excess of $2bn a year and has spawned an offshoot in the form of companies that specialise in collecting unwilling children and carting them off to camp. 'Families hire me who have out of control teenagers to extract them and transport them to a treatment facility or boarding school that the families have chosen for their child,' explains LA-based Evan 'Bullet' James. 'Between 500 and 1000 families contact us a month. Our operation is nationwide across the USA.' One such destination is the institution run by former Marine Glenn Ellison, Camp Consequence in Jacksonville, Florida. Like Sarge, he operates a regime that is high on the discipline and exercise and low on the creature comforts and sympathy. His programmes last for up to 30 days, with children cared for by Ellison and his team of crack instructors, although for shorter weekend stints, the youngsters involved must be accompanied by their parents. Tough love: Evan 'Bullet' James specialises in carting unwilling children off to the camp of their parents' choice . Harsh: According to Mr James, between 500 and 1000 families contact him in desperation each month . A weekend at Camp Consequence starts with what Ellison dubs 'shock and awe' and involves a series of military style drills in order to tire the children out so 'I can see what their personality is really like'. That completed, the children are put to bed in military style tents in a field surrounded by razor wire that butts up against the local prison. Any whisper of dissent and the boys - and Ellison's camps do attract an overwhelmingly male clientèle - are put to work shovelling piles of dirt. 'We laughingly call these kids Al Kidda,' he says, smiling. 'When the enemy is in your house, it's a scary place to be and that's what I deal with every single day. 'The behaviours we deal with are mostly rebellion. They just don't want to be told what to do. My kids are good kids making bad choices,' he continues. 'But they will be treated like juvenile delinquents. That's kind of scary but that's what we want.' Among them is Bryce, 10, from Florida, whose mother Jennifer has reached the end of her tether with his recalcitrant behaviour and constant swearing. 'The main issues with Bryce are disrespect and defiance,' she says. 'It got to a point where I was getting calls from his school, he was being suspended, and I didn't want it to progress. 'We recently went on vacation and he was yelling F-words from across the pool and we were kicked out of the hotel.' Does she think Ellison's military methods are too much? 'I think it's extreme that a 10-year-old rules my house,' she says, firmly. 'That's extreme. These people are not touching my children, they have not said anything demeaning to them and they have not physically harmed them at all.' These are sentiments with which Ellison wholeheartedly agrees. 'I'm not about punishment at all,' he explains. 'What I'm about is making kids understand that in every society, if there's no rules, there is chaos. And that's just about where we are today in the world. The kids are running the world. Not parents.' Children might be running the world outside of Camp Consequence but inside, Ellison is most definitely in charge. Listen up! Both Sarge and Ellison are fond of motivational pep talks, although discipline comes top of the list . Plaudits: Both Sarge's and Ellison's camps have won plaudits from local councils and law enforcement . Give me twenty! Sarge's Drill Weekends and Camp Consequence involve plenty of physical exercise . During the 30 day course, children spend their days picking up spent cartridges on the local sheriff's gun range, picking up litter on the highway and mowing the grass verges. Privileges have to be earned, among them hot suppers, while any infractions are punished with a trip to the dirt pile or the threat of an extension of your time at Camp Consequence. 'Just because your mum signed a contract for 30 days, it doesn't mean you're going home in 30 days,' thunders Ellison. 'I can pull that plug in a heartbeat and I will. I will tell them [parents] that he doesn't deserve it and he hasn't earned it.' Parents also have to commit to Ellison's boot camps and attend parenting classes both before and after Camp Consequence. Ellison says this is key to getting results and says it stops people from giving up on their delinquent children without at least attempting to help them. 'I truly believe that the kids are worth saving,' he adds. 'A lot of people give up on kids way too soon.' For her part, Jennifer is thrilled with the changes the camp has wrought on her son Bryce. 'Oh, him and 10 of his friends, heck yeah,' she exclaims when asked whether she would consider sending her child back to Camp Consequence. 'Even if I have to get a dirt pile delivered to my house, I'll do it.'","Camps such as Camp Consequence in Florida specialise in tough discipline .

"Few men are better placed to judge the duel between Liverpool strikers Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez Thursday night in the Corinthians Arena in Sao Paulo than Sebastian Coates. The giant 23-year-old defender sits next to the England striker in the Liverpool dressing room, or at least did do until he went out on loan to Uruguay’s Nacional in January. That’s Nacional, the former club of Suarez, who took Coates under his wing when he joined Liverpool back in 2011. 'Sturridge is similar to Luis in as much as he’s always looking to score, always trying to force a mistake from the opponent and take advantage of any weakness,' he says of the scorer of England’s goal against Italy on Saturday. In action: Daniel Sturridge impressed up front against Italy in England's 2-1 opening loss . Fighting fit? Luis Suarez missed Uruguay's opening game, but is ready for the England clash . Coates will be on hand to inform Uruguayan first choice centre-backs Diego Godin and Diego Lugano, although after seeing how Arsenal loanee Joel Campbell destroyed the Uruguay defence, many supporters want Coates drafted in ahead of the defender West Brom let go last month. Coates is also well aware of the other threats carried by England. 'Sterling is extremely quick, always looking to get past people and deliver the ball into the box,' he says. 'And [Steven] Gerrard has so much intelligence and quality in that midfield role; we are very aware of how good he is from dead balls, he strikes it so well.' Of course for all that England have Sterling and Sturridge, Uruguay have the real jewel in the Liverpool crown. 'Everyone knows what Luis is like,' says Coates. 'He never gives up on a single loose ball; he chases everything. It doesn’t matter if the team is winning or losing, he always wants more. He is one of the three best players in the world.' Uruguay will need all of Suarez’ quality and determination to turn their World Cup around. Coates says his spirit illustrates perfectly why they have over-achieved so often on the world stage and why they are not about to give up their place at the World Cup lightly. Team-mates: Sebastian Coates (centre) shares a joke with Suarez during Uruguay training . Through his paces: Coates (in red) attempts to block a shot from Cristian Rodriguez in training . 'In Brazil I think there are three million players officially signed up with clubs, and in Uruguay there are only three million people so that puts the size of our country into perspective. But we are passionate about the game; everyone plays from a very young age, and we have the guts and determination that you see reflected in the way Luis plays. He’s the perfect example of how never to give anything up for lost.' Coates showed the same fighting spirit last season to come back from the torn cruciate ligament injury he suffered in August and then ask for a loan move to Nacional that would give him a fighting chance of making Oscar Tabarez’ World Cup squad. He had just been voted Best Young Player of the Copa America which Uruguay won in 2011 when Liverpool signed him that summer. Suarez was in constant contact as the deal went through informing him of Liverpool’s interest and joking that he would ‘represent’ him in England. He helped him settle, but the injury while playing for Uruguay in Japan set back his progress. World stage: Sturridge hits home England's equaliser at the time in Saturday's clash against Italy . Coates' performances at Nacional were enough to convince  Tabarez that he was ready for Brazil. And back home in Uruguay he was able to witness first hand just how Suarez has turned the country into the South American branch of the Liverpool’s supporters club. 'Everyone has been watching every game for the last few months' he says. 'Liverpool may have more fans here in Uruguay than anywhere else. No one wanted the season to end as it did. When you’re so close and it slips away from you like that it is so hard.' He texted ‘animo’ a kind of Spanish ‘chin-up’ to a distraught Suarez after the Crystal Palace game. 'What more can you do in that situation?' he says. Frozen out? Coates has found it hard to cement a first team place at Anfield . He hopes there will be no need for similar messages of support after the Group D game tomorrow night.  And when the tournament ends he wants to return to Liverpool and establish himself as a Premier League starter alongside Suarez or even at another Premier League club if a loan spell becomes the only way of showing the class that made a South American champion three years ago. It would be a shame if he didn’t make it in England; with a name like Coates he has to have British roots after all? 'The family came from Scotland three or four generations back,' he says. 'And the first one who came to Uruguay, the first Coates, came by boat… from Liverpool of course.'","Sebastian Coates plays with both Suarez and Sturridge at Liverpool .

"Almost 90 years after her passing, a New Jersey nun credited with restoring a blind man's sight will be the first person beatified on U.S. soil in a historic honor. Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, of the Sisters of Charity in Convent Station, NJ., will be beatified Saturday in a Mass of Beatification at Newark's Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart. The move is an important step on the road to becoming a saint, following be venerated for heroic virtue but preceding the final step of having a a second miracle attributed to them. Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, of the Sisters of Charity in Convent Station, NJ., will be beatified Saturday in a Mass of Beatification at Newark's Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart . In her case, devotional writings - cut short by her untimely death at the age of 26 in 1927 - became very inspirational to Roman Catholics and were credited with a medical miracle decades after she passed. The Bayonne native was even credited with having opinions that would shape the church as we know it, The Wall Street Journal reported. 'She . brought up what Vatican II was all about: the importance of scripture, . the importance of the trinity, the place of liturgy,' Sister . Kathleen Flanagan, a professor at the College of Saint Elizabeth in . Convent Station, told reporters. Taking place in the early 1960s, Vatican II was an ecumenical council and pivotal moment for a Catholic Church seeking to redefine itself for the modern era, changing the institution's identity with changes such as having the mass spoken in the modern vernacular instead of Latin. Candidates for sainthood must fulfill multiple requirements, including one miracle that could be tied to their intercession which must be confirmed by the Vatican. Demjanovich's first miracle is said to be the sight of Michael Mencer, who as an 8-year-old in Teaneck, N.J., suffered from juvenile macular degeneration, which has no known cure. Now 59, Mencer says his vision was once so poor that Dr. Mary Mazzarrella and his family registered him with the New Jersey Commission for the Blind. Demjanovich's first miracle is said to be the sight of Michael Mencer, pictured here in his late 50s, who as an 8-year-old in Teaneck, N.J., suffered from juvenile macular degeneration . He claims that in 1964 his eyesight was restored after his teacher gave him items relating to Demjanovich. The item was reportedly a prayer card and a strand of Miriam Teresa's hair that had been preserved in plastic. Mencer told NBC News that he decided to walk home alone that day, despite having only peripheral vision. 'I was about two blocks from the house when I think it happened,' he told reporters. 'I looked up at what I thought was the sun, and it didn't hurt my eyes, but I could see an orb, a bright light. And when I looked back down I could see the hair in the memento.' After that, he ran home. He says his affliction never came back. In 1971, his mother wrote a letter about the miraculous cure to the Trenton diocese's newspaper when she spotted a story about Demjanovich. The letter was lost until 1998 when a sister discovered it stuck between two file folders while cleaning out some cabinets. Mazzarrella said she had consulted with 18 other doctors about his condition and a seven-member panel of opthalmologists. The doctors told her the recovery was 'medically unexplainable.' For Demjanovich to be canonized, the church also had to be shown that others had prayed for Demjanovich's intercession before the boy was cured. The move is an important step on the road to becoming a saint, following be venerated for heroic virtue but preceding the final step of having a a second miracle attributed to them . Demjanovich . was the youngest of seven children born to an immigrant family from . what's now known as Slovakia, and was baptized in Byzantine-Ruthenian . Catholic Church before attending public schools in Bayonne. In 1923, she graduated summa cum laude from the College of Saint Elizabeth with a degree in literature. She was first suggested for sainthood in 1945 when her family asked the Bishop of Paterson, N.J., to initiate 'cause.' In Rome, her case was overseen by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which oversees canonization. They interviewed people who knew her as well as poured over her writings, including plays, poems, letters, meditations, and a piece of an autobiography. The meditations were especially important in establishing sainthood. They were published just one year after her death under the title, 'Greater Perfection.' Fewer than a dozen native-born U.S. citizens have been granted beatification by the Catholic Church and of those only three have finally been canonized. For Demjanovich to be canonized, the church also had to be shown that others had prayed for Demjanovich's intercession before the boy was cured . The Vatican's head of Congregation for Saints' Causes will attend Saturday's mass. Having the ceremony in Newark makes 'beatification more personal,' said Jim Goodness, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Newark. 'Here we have a woman who was born in Bayonne and lived in New Jersey,' he said. 'It allows us to really be able to understand there are saints and holy people among us today, and that we're all called to sainthood.'","Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, of the .

"Jose Mourinho has backed Wayne Rooney to take this summer’s World Cup by storm – but warned the England striker this is his last chance to shine. The Manchester United star has failed to score in the last two tournaments but will lead the line for Roy Hodgson’s side in Brazil. Mourinho, who tried to sign Rooney for Chelsea last summer, believes the 28-year-old will cope with having the weight of a nation’s expectations on his shoulders.VIDEO: Scroll down for Rooney: This is the one where I have to show what I can do . Stormer: Wayne Rooney can set the World Cup alight, according to Jose Mourinho . In training: The forward is currently at England's base in Rio de Janeiro as he gears up for the World Cup . Staycation: Jose Mourinho was at Old Trafford on Sunday night, managing the Rest of the World at Soccer aid . ‘He is not a kid anymore, he is not an old player at the end of his career, he is in what I call the best age,’ he told Yahoo. ‘I think it is his World Cup and I think he has also a role as a leader in the team, a little bit similar that he had also in United this season. ‘He is a guy with responsibilities in the national team, I think he is ready to cope with this pressure. ‘ I think that can play a positive role in his ambition, in his anger to succeed. I have faith in him, I have faith that he can do it.’ Mourinho also admitted he has no idea how England will perform in Brazil, given their unpredictable nature. Hodgson’s men reached the quarter-finals at Euro 2012 before losing to Italy on penalties. They will renew hostilities with Cesare Prandelli’s men on Saturday in Manaus. ’England is the kind of team where I am always expecting something good but I am never surprised when things go wrong,’ added Mourinho. ‘When people speak sometimes about not enough quality in the team I always disagree and I remember for example the England team in 2004, it was the European Cup in Portugal which is the year where I come to England for the first time. ‘Even in that time people were already saying that the team was not good enough to win the competition and I remember the England team in 2004, I remember lots of them, it was full of top players from the top teams in the country. Past struggles: Rooney as been out of form and fitness at his past two World Cup appearances . Senior: He currently stands on 39 goals in 91 caps for his country . Smiles: A tally he will be desperate to add to in his next game against Italy on Saturday . ‘You go now and obviously you have some boys who are not playing in the top teams in the country but you have players from Chelsea, from United, City, Arsenal, Liverpool, so the top five all represented in high numbers in the national team so you have quality, you have experience, you have international experience, you have everything so why not be a candidate? ‘If England wins the World Cup for me it is only a surprise because you won only once and you won when I was three years old so only because of that I would say, oh that’s a surprise but because of the players and the experience and the stature that almost all of them have, it wouldn’t be a surprise but at the same time, if they don’t go through the group phase it is not a surprise either to me.’ When asked who he thinks will win the World Cup, Mourinho said he believes the trophy will not be won for the first time. Fan club: Mourinho signs autographs for spectators at Soccer Aid . Trespasser: He also ran onto the pitch in the first half to trip up Olly Murs from behind . ‘I will be very surprised if there is a big surprise,’ he said. ‘I will be very surprised if somebody is going to win the World Cup for the first time. ‘I don’t see a national team with conditions to do that, to break what used to say the stability. In South America, the South Americans think they are going to be strong and they have two or three strong teams. ‘I don't think the Africans, despite fantastic players and much more experience as a team, I don't think they can break the quarter final wall.

"A former staffer for a high-profile congressional candidate claims he was fired for complaining about the politician's aggressive sexual behavior. Todd Bosnich said he last year joined the campaign for former San Diego city councilman Carl DeMaio, an openly gay Republican, who has won acclaim for representing a new generation of American politics. However, it wasn't long before DeMaio started making unwanted advances toward his campaign policy director, Bosnich claims, including allegedly masturbating in front of him. Bosnich also said he was offered a $50,000 bribe to but didn't accept it, CNN reported. Allegations: Republican congressional candidate Carl DeMaio has been accused of displaying aggressive sexual behavior toward former campaign director Todd Bosnich . Claims: Todd Bosnich, a former campaign director for Carl DeMaio, claims the politician masturbated in front of him and touched and kissed him inappropriately . The alleged harassment started after some work drinks, when DeMaio was driving Bosnich back to his car. Bosnich claims DeMaio grabbed his crotch when they pulled up. What followed was a series of innapropriate behavior, Bosnich said, including kissing on the neck and groping. That behavior culminated in April with Bosnich arrived at work earlier and was called into DeMaio's office. 'I came over to his office, door was open,' Bosnich told CNN. 'And he was masturbating,"" Bosnich said. 'I saw his hand, his penis in his hand and he had a smile on his face. 'And as soon as I came over he was looking at me.' Bosnich said he confronted DeMaio about the masturbation a few weeks later. 'It was the very next day, in the morning, that the campaign manager called me into his office and said that Carl lost his trust in me and that he'd terminated me,' Bosnich said. Controversy: Carl DeMaio gives a news conference alongside his partner Jonathan Hale in 2012 . 'He offered me a position in the county Republican Party and also told me to sign a non-disclosure agreement in exchange for $50,000.' Bosnich said he felt like DeMaio was trying to his silence and didn't accept the money. However DeMaio said the claims were 'outrageous'. He told CNN that Bosnich was fired for plagiarism and, days after his termination, broke into the campaign office and damaged computers and phone lines. DeMaio said the San Diego police department were invesitgating the break-in. This is not the first time sexual harassment complaint to have been leveled against DeMaio. Ben Hueso, a fellow city coucilman, said last year that he twice caught Demaio masturbating in a city hall restroom in 2009. The restroom was only accessible by city officials. Hueso did not report the incident.","Rising Republican Carl DeMaio displayed aggressive sexual behavior toward a former campaign director, according to allegations .

"England’s 8,000 fans battled bravely to make their voices heard in the Sao Paulo Arena but this is a South American World Cup and Montevideo is ‘only’ 960 miles from Sao Paulo. Uruguayan fans outnumbered England 3:1.

Loud and proud: England's contingent of fans in Sao Paulo were heavily outnumbered by the Uruguayans . It's not just the England media which is obsessed with Wayne Rooney. When the team line-ups were announced, it was Rooney who antagonised the Uruguayan fans most, with deafening whistles all round. Presumably it’s better to be hated than ignored – it implies a threat.

"Loss: Jessica Mary Hunter passed away three days after taking ecstasy at an Austin music festival . A 21-year-old student has passed away after taking ecstasy for the first time at a music festival. Jessica Mary Hunter, an only child from Fort Worth, Texas, died on October 8, three days after she took the drug with friends at the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Her parents, Alan and Debbie, said they now hope to educate others on the dangers of the drug. Friends said it was the first time Hunter, a Christian and marketing major at Texas State University in San Marcos, had ever taken ecstasy, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported. One of her friends made himself sick after taking the drug because he didn't 'feel right', but Hunter - who has always hated throwing up - did not, her parents said. She suffered a seizure on the sidewalk and went into cardiac arrest. She turned gray, her body was rigid and her arms and legs were flailing, according to reports from the scene, Fox reported. Friends flagged down a passing police officer and paramedics performed CPR on her for eight minutes. She was rushed to Seton Medical Center Austin. Her parents, Alan and Debbie Hunter, told the Star-Telegram that they were asleep when they heard the doorbell ring at 5am on October 6 and saw police lights flashing outside. Loved: Jessica's parents Debbie and Alan, pictured, now hope to educate others on the dangers of the drug . Close: The couple, who have no other children, raced from their home in Fort Worth to Jessica's bedside in Austin after a police officer woke them up just hours after she suffered a seizure . 'As soon as we saw them, we knew it was bad,' Mrs Hunter said. They learned their daughter was in the hospital and they jumped in their car and headed towards Austin, arriving at the hospital a few hours later. They were stunned to see their only daughter surrounded by medical staff and two chaplains. She had been put into a coma as doctors attempted to keep her body temperature down, but she slowly deteriorated. Her parents said she was bleeding from her nose and mouth. Taken: The couple, pictured with Jessica as a baby, said they will never understand why she took the drug . Loved: Mr Hunter hopes to make public service announcements about drugs at next year's music festival . Ecstasy, which is also known as MDMA or Molly, is a synthetic, psychoactive drug that is similar to the stimulant amphetamine and the hallucinogen mescaline, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. After it is taken, it produces feelings of increased energy, euphoria, emotional warmth and empathy, and distortions in sensory and time perception. The effects last for between three and six hours. But effects can also include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure and the inability to regulate the body's temperature, as well as cardiac arrhythmia, which can be deadly. It can also be fatal if the person is taking other medications or if they have an undiagnosed heart problem, Dr. Terence McCarthy of Texas Health told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. But deaths are also caused because the drug is unregulated and can be sold in a variety of make-ups and concentrations, he said. 'You never know if one capsule is 10 times more concentrated than another capsule,' McCarthy said. 'So it really is always a game of Russian roulette.' MDMA users may also experience muscle tension, involuntary teeth clenching, nausea, blurred vision, faintness, and chills or sweating. Then early on October 8, they learned that her brain had suffered hemorrhaging. 'Her eyes were open,' her mother said. 'You could see that there was nothing there.' Her parents told staff to remove her life support and she passed away at 5.25am as her parents sat beside her in prayer, they said. The toxicology reports on her death won't be available for several weeks. Now her parents, who plan to spread awareness of the dangers of the drugs, said they will never know why their daughter decided to take the drug. They plan on going to Keller High School, where their daughter had been a student, and share their experiences with seniors and college students. Mr Hunter also hopes to make public service announcements at next year's music festival. 'We are trying to get as much good out of this as we can,' he said. 'I want people to know that she was real. Maybe if they can make the connection. If we can just stop one from making the same choice.' After her death, friends gathered at a park near to her school's Bobcat Stadium and released balloons in her memory. 'We want everyone to understand that it only takes one time,' her friend Maurah Ruiz told KEYE. 'She was not a drug abuser. These people that sell you these things, they don't care. They don't care about you or your family or the people that you leave behind. All they care about is making money.' Missed: Friends have remembered Jessica, a marketing major at Texas State, as popular and creative . Killed: Test results are still pending but doctors said the biggest danger of the drug is that it is often mixed with other substances that can cause a bad reaction. All of Jessica's friends reacted badly to the drug . Ecstasy, which is also known as MDMA or Molly, can be fatal if the person is taking other medications or if they have an undiagnosed heart problem, Dr. Terence McCarthy of Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Fort Worth told the Star-Telegram. But more often, deaths are caused because the drug is unregulated and can be sold in a variety of make-ups and concentrations, he said. 'You never know if one capsule is 10 times more concentrated than another capsule,' McCarthy said. 'So it really is always a game of Russian roulette.' He said that effects can include increased heart rate, increased blood pressure and the inability to regulate the body's temperature, as well as cardiac arrhythmia, which can be deadly.","Jessica Mary Hunter died on October 8, three days after she took the drug with friends at the Austin City Limits Music Festival .

The comment has already picked up over 100,000 'likes' as the Manchester United striker attempts to ease the discontent amongst England fans. Rooney scored England's equalising during the 2-1 defeat against Uruguay on Thursday night, but  received criticism for his poor display against Italy a week earlier. The 28-year-old played from the left of midfield against the Azzurri and struggled to make an impact on the game despite setting up Daniel Sturridge for his only goal of the tournament so far.

Chance: Rooney's second half goal against Uruguay gave England hope before Luis Suarez scored the winner . Rooney's United team-mate Robin van Persie has moved to defend the England star and even claimed that he is one of the reasons the Dutchman went to Old Trafford. Van Persie said: ‘I watched most of the game against Italy and the whole game against Uruguay, and I think it is a shame. England played quite well and were so unlucky.

"England couldn't get their World Cup campaign off to a winning start as Italy beat Roy Hodgson's men 2-1 in Manaus. Daniel Sturridge's equaliser looked to have given England hope after they went 1-0 down, courtesy of a superb Claudio Marchisio strike, before Mario Balotelli sealed the win with a well-timed header. But how did England fare as individuals? MATT BARLOW gives his ratings. VIDEO Scroll down to hear what Pep Guardiola makes of the England team . England suffered a disappointing night in Manaus as they lost their World Cup opener to Italy in Group D . ENGLAND (4-2-3-1) JOE HART: 6 . A little jittery at times as England flapped in front of him. Kept out a deflected Candreva effort, teased out of goal by Balotelli. No chance with the goals. Conceded: Joe Hart (right) couldn't stop Mario Balotelli (second from left) from giving Italy a 2-1 lead . GLEN JOHNSON: 6 . Usual unsatisfactory mix of athleticism and sloppiness. May have escaped with a handball. PHIL JAGIELKA: 7 . Solid and England’s best defender. Handled Balotelli well in the main and showed good instinct to make the goal line clearance. Saved: Phil Jagielka was solid and England's best defender. He handled Italy well and his goal-line clearance was superb . GARY CAHILL: 6 . Most of the threat for England came from tracking runners from wider and deeper but lost Balotelli for the second Italy goal. LEIGHTON BAINES: 5.5 . Exposed by lack of protection and over-loaded with Darmian and Candreva. Unable to contribute going forward until Italy sat back late on. JORDAN HENDERSON: 6.5 . Could not break up the Italian passers but did what he does well. Covered the yards, forced early save, passed it well and made the right decisions. STEVEN GERRARD: 7 . Strong and disciplined. Passed it as well as ever, and organised the team. Even shielded his centre-halves which is not always his strength. Captain: Steven Gerrard was strong and disciplined, passed it well, and organised the team. It counted for little. DANNY WELBECK: 6.5 . Drifted in and out but fizzed a right-footer wide from 25 yards during his best spell in the first-half. RAHEEM STERLING: 7.5 . Fast, exciting and influential. Didn’t always come off but buzzed with invention and threaded Rooney through for Sturridge’s goal. Chance: Raheem Sterling was fast, exciting and influential. Didn't always come off but gave England a spark . WAYNE ROONEY: 6 . Laboured and looked lost on the left at times, unsure where to be, when to rest. Yet he delivered one perfect cross for Sturridge’s goal and went close in the second half. DANIEL STURRIDGE: 7 . Quiet until he scored, which showcased his nose for goal. More effective afterwards. Worked Sirigu again after the break. Opener: Daniel Sturridge gets England back into the game against Italy on Saturday night . SUBS: . Barkley (for Welbeck) made an instant impact forcing Sirigu into a save. Wilshere (for Henderson) and Lallana (for Sturridge). MANAGER: ROY HODGSON: 6 . Bold selection to go with a very offensive front-four allowed Italy to much time and space in attack. Made for thrills and spills but England were porous. Bold: England manager Roy Hodgson picked an attacking line-up but Italy had too much space and time . ITALY (4-3-2-1) SALVATORE SIRIGU: 6 . Late call up. Made a fine early save from Henderson but does not command like Buffon. MATTEO DARMIAN: 7.5 . Terrific attacking threat with his overlapping runs but opened up by Sterling and Rooney for Sturridge goal. GABRIEL PALETTA: 6 . Summoned amid defensive reshuffle and a soft-spot in the heart of the back-four. Struggled with the movement. Could have been punished for clumsy barge on Gerrard. Helping hand: Gabriel Paletta (right) could have been punished for a clumsy barge on Steven Gerrard (left) ANDREA BARZAGLI: 7 . Made on incredible recovery clearance to keep Welbeck’s cross from Sterling and the best of Italy’s defenders. GIORGIO CHIELLINI: 6 . Rugged and strong but not nimble on the ball and often caught out by Welbeck. MARCO VERRATTI: 6.5 . Tidy and metronomic. Guarded possession and rarely gave it away. Another little Pirlo in the making. Potential: Marco Verratti (right) proved another Andrea Pirlo in the making against England . DANIELE DE ROSSI: 7 . Physical and aggressive, with good delivery, although seemed short of the pace of the game at times. Strong when his team needed to defend late on. ANDREA PIRLO: 7 . Captain in Buffon’s absence. Exquisite caress on each pass whether it goes two yards or 50. Delightful dummy for Marchisio to score. ANTONIO CANDREVA: 8 . Linked well with Darmian and punished England’s left side. Excellent delivery and threatened goal. Hit post and delivered for Balotelli’s header. Antonio Candreva (left) linked well with Darmian and punished Leighton Baines (right) down the left flank . CLAUDIO MARCHISIO: 7 . Quiet start from a player carrying many Italian hopes but produced a crisp and sweet 25-yard strike to opening the scoring. MARIO BALOTELLI: 7 . Mobile and ever dangerous. One shot over, another cleared off the line and a goal. Mario Balotelli was mobile and dangerous as ever, and his goal gave Italy the win . SUBS: . Thiago Motta (for Verratti) to tighten thing up with a lead to protect. Immobile (for Balotelli) and Parolo (for Candreva). MANAGER: CESARE PRANDELLI: 7 . Preparations rocked by injuries at the back.

"Felipe Massa crashed out of the German Grand Prix after a high-speed collision with Kevin Magnussen on the first corner of the Hockenheim circuit on Sunday. The Brazilian and his car were flipped over after Magnussen clipped the rear of Massa's Williams before sliding upside down and flipping back over.

Crash: Massa (left) collides with Danish driver Magnussen on the first corner . Daniel Ricciardo did brilliantly to avoid the danger but his maneuvering caused the Red Bull driver to slip down the field. Speaking shortly after the crash, Massa said: 'I am very frustrated because first of all it is a race where I had a good car. 'I didn’t want to be too aggressive at the first corner and fighting with my team-mate. 'I backed off a little bit and then another car just hit me behind and there is nothing I can do.

Magnussen claimed a commendable fourth place for McLaren, and the Dane was followed by Red Bull's Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel in fifth and sixth.

"The quality of the finishing we have seen before. From Luis Suarez it has become what we expect. But what was utterly remarkable about his performance here in Sao Paulo was the fact that he was even on the pitch when he scored what proved a quite brilliant winner for Uruguay. In the end he left the field with cramp, and understandably so only 28 days after undergoing surgery on an injured knee. But not before accelerating away from a static, stuttering England defence in the 85th minute of this World Cup encounter – 85 minutes for heaven’s sake – and pushing Roy Hodgson’s side perilously close to elimination from the competition. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Suarez's emotional dressing room message to wife and kids . Means so much: Luis Suarez scored twice against England on Thursday night for Uruguay .

At last: Rooney and Ross Barkey celebrate after the crucial strike . Crucial: Luis Suarez scored the opening goal at the Corinthians Arena, putting Uruguay ahead against England . Clinical: Phil Jagielka failed to pick up the Liverpool poacher, who made no mistake . Words of advice: England captain Steven Gerrard whispers in Rooney's ear before the game . Too much for him: Suarez is in tears on the bench after leading Uruguay to victory .

This, of course, was a night when . England wished for something similar from Wayne Rooney, and when he . levelled the score to cancel out Suarez’s first-half strike it seemed he . had at last made an impact. In his 10th game at his third World Cup, . the player who promised so much when he first burst onto the . international stage at Euro 2004 had scored a World Cup goal. A heavy burden of expectation . There . was a reason why Steven Gerrard extended an arm across Rooney’s . shoulders in the tunnel moments before kick-off and whispered into his . ear. England’s captain knew how important an encounter this was for his . international colleague. Just as he knew it was time for England’s . talismanic striker to finally put that considerable talent to use on the . greatest stage of all. Uruguay . were looking to Suarez to provide much the same inspiration after their . opening defeat to Costa Rica, so the burden of expectation was heavy on . both these players on a night when defeat would leave their respective . teams in a most precarious position. Star man: The Uruguay players congratulate the forward, who had just returned from injury . Beaten: Joe Hart didn't have a chance in the England goal, with the ball finding the bottom corner . Dejected: Rooney, Daniel Sturridge and Steven Gerrard watch on after the opener . Central roles . Rooney . was selected, as expected, in that number 10 role he prefers. If he was . a peripheral figure on the left flank against Italy, here was an . opportunity to stamp his authority on the tournament. In . fairness to Rooney, he was far from England’s worst player and only . Gerrard covered more ground than the Manchester United forward. In total . Rooney ran 10.36km. He also went close on two other occasions and . created an excellent chance for Daniel Sturridge. But you have to wonder . if switching Rooney with Raheem Sterling was the right move when the . youngster was so impressive against Italy. Here, on the . right, he created not once chance before being hooked by Hodgson. And . England lacked the drive and ambition they had with Sterling in the . central role. In truth . Rooney might have devoted too much energy running into areas away from . the zone where he needed to be most effective; between Sturridge and the . midfield. Compare that to Suarez. He planted himself between England’s . centre-halves and punished them. Quite simply, the man did his job. Quality of the opposition . If . Rooney took encouragement from Uruguay’s defensive display against . Costa Rica, the changes Oscar Tabarez was forced to make because of . injury and suspension perhaps would have given him further cause for . optimism. There was Alvaro Pereira at left back; once of Porto and Inter . Milan but now at Sao Paulo. But more significantly there was Jose . Gimenez, a 19-year-old centre-half with only one league appearance for . Atletico Madrid after signing for a million Euros last year. He was . certainly nowhere to be seen when Rooney arrived, unopposed, to meet . Glen Johnson’s ball for England’s equaliser. But . Suarez must have fancied his chances as well against defenders he knows . only too well. They also looked fragile in their opening game here in . Brazil and he embarrassed Phil Jagielka much as Mario Balotelli did Gary . Cahill. As Danny Mills observed, ‘if the centre-forward can . see the number on your back you are in trouble’.  A brief add to that: . If a centre-forward is allowed to seize on a long ball and score . unchallenged, the entire defence has failed in its principal  task. Never mind the quality of the finish. That was shocking defending from . England. Fitness concern: But Suarez was full of running on his return from injury, troubling the England defence . Inches: Wayne Rooney went close to opening the scoring with a curling free-kick early on . Not quite: The Manchester United striker thought his World Cup goal would never come . Was fitness an issue? Suarez . might have declared himself 100 per cent fit but, seriously, who was he . kidding? Nobody returns at their best in the first game that kind of . absence. What we saw though, in both the header he scored and the finish . he produced, was the natural skill, agility and athleticism he . possesses. Not to mention that killer instinct. It’s why he so . outrageously outstanding. If . there were fitness concerns about Rooney prior to the tournament, and . one still wonders how disciplined he was in getting himself ready for . the World Cup given his weakness for some of the finer things in life, . he answered his critics here. Opportunities squandered . Suarez wasted one particularly good chance in the 51st minute when he had a clear shot on Joe Hart’s goal. But . let’s just look at the statistics for a moment here. Suarez has now . scored 40 international goals in 78 appearances, 11 of those coming in . qualifying for this World Cup. And the two he scored here came on a . night when he was also taking Uruguay’s free-kicks and corners. For . Rooney, he will reflect on this game with more frustration. He went . mighty close to scoring twice in the first half, first with a free-kick . that whistled just wide and then when meeting a Gerrard free-kick with a . header that crashed against the crossbar. In the second half he also . forced Fernando Muslera to make a stunning close-range save. But that’s . still one goal from four chances, compared to a return of two from three . for Suarez. Says it all really, even if Rooney also delivered one super . ball for Sturridge shortly after Suarez had scored. It was a . defence-splitting ball that sent Sturridge into space, the England . forward forcing Muslera to make a decent save at his near post. Wrong foot: Rooney shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area . Sitter: Wayne Rooney missed a great chance from yards out after a fine cross from a free-kick . Agonising: The England striker had never scored a goal in a World Cup, despite playing in three tournaments . How did they carry themselves? Suarez . might not have been fit but boy was he fired up. After sitting through . that dreadful performance in Fortaleza, he demanded higher standards . from his colleagues. Martin Caceres certainly got an earful when he . delayed delivery of a pass. Rooney used to be like that too, but he seems less influential, less vocal, on the pitch these days. Verdict . It . is in World Cups that world class players shine, and if Rooney could . once claim to stand among the best those days appear to over. Suarez . proved that, essentially on one leg.

"No arguments this time. Nico Rosberg took pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix with a lap so quick and so emphatic that it set the World Championship alight. After inflicting the misery of Monaco on his Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton a fortnight ago, Rosberg finished 0.079sec ahead here. There was no possible deception in this performance. The simpler, faster configuration of this circuit next to the Olympic rowing lake was meant to be more to Hamilton’s liking than Monaco’s tight streets (though he is hardly sluggish there either). He set the fastest times in the first two sessions of qualifying, but then Rosberg struck. VIDEO Scroll down to see how Hamilton and Rosberg's rivalry extends beyond the track . All smiles: Nico Rosberg edged out team-mate Lewis Hamilton to pole position in Montreal . Smiles better: Hamilton was cordial to Rosberg after qualifying in contrast to Monaco a fortnight ago . He . banged a fast lap in in the shoot-out for pole, a banker that he later . beat. Hamilton pushed hard but simply had not got the pace he needed.

Rosberg . said: ‘I know it is a track where Lewis is traditionally very quick and . I am happy it has worked out. All weekend I have progressed well. It’s . very cool. ‘I have been . looking at data, working with my engineers, seeing where I can do . better. Having won the last race brought me some momentum.’ Out in front: Rosberg secured pole position for the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal . Pipped: Hamilton was 0.079 slower than his German team-mate and will start in second place . Clenched fist: Rosberg punches the air . Hamilton . said: ‘Nico did a fantastic job today. Congratulations to him. Sometimes sessions don’t work out. I think it will be a close battle . tomorrow. Overtaking will be very difficult seeing as Nico is in the . same car as mine and is so close in pace.’ Nobody . was likely to challenge Mercedes for pole, though Felipe Massa held the . fastest time during the second session before Hamilton and Rosberg . blitzed their way to the front. Red Bull’s world champion Sebastian . Vettel finally came third – an upturn in his fortunes. Jenson Button of . McLaren ninth, ahead of his team-mate Kevin Magnussesn in 12th. Further . down the grid, Marcus Ericsson caused a red flag to be waved when he . crashed his Caterham towards the end of the first session. The Swede was . not even on a fast lap at the time. Hamilton, . though he says it will be hard to overtake, has great history at this . track. He won here in 2010 and 2012, building on his success in 2007, . his first ever Formula One victory. It . was a markedly different Hamilton back then. He was 22, his father held . his umbrella on the grid, he earned a ‘mere’ £500,000, lived in Woking . and barely counted a rapper among his friends. But even in those . intoxicating days of his nascent career, there were early signs of the . controversy that has stalked his career intermittently since. Close behind: Sebastian Vettel will lead the chasing pack as he starts from third place . Flying high: Valtteri Bottas qualified fourth ahead of his Williams team-mate Felipe Massa . Then, . as now, the preceding race in Monaco was contentious. Hamilton had . stated that he was not a ‘No 2’, implying that McLaren gave his . team-mate Fernando Alonso the better strategy. He . put that aside to take pole here and held his nerve through four safety . car phases, including the one prompted by his karting friend Robert . Kubica’s somersaulting accident, to win. It will take a similar . clearness of thought to prevail here again today. Montreal . is one of Formula One’s minor jewels, conforming to the aphorism that . all the sport’s best venues start with an ‘M’. Melbourne, Monaco, Monza . are the others. Montreal has won its accolade by providing gripping . races and turning its central streets into a carnival city for the . weekend. Trailing: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso could only manage a disappointing seventh place . Mid pack: McLaren driver Jenson Button finished in ninth place in Montreal . So we should . celebrate that the city has agreed a 10-year extension to host the race. The estimated £100million they will pay Bernie Ecclestone for the . privilege is less than most venues, a sign of its value to the sport. Organisers will spend £20million on improving the paddock, which wears a . faded 1970s look. Speaking . of the Seventies, if Hamilton manages to overhaul Rosberg on Sunday he will . equal the 27 career wins of Sir Jackie Stewart. The Scotsman reached his . total in 99 races; Hamilton will have done so in 136. Button . is not writing off his former team-mate. ‘This are two tracks where . Lewis is pretty much unbeatable – Abu Dhabi and here,’ he said.

"It has been revealed that a staggering $428 million has been paid out in settlements for civil-rights lawsuits brought against the NYPD since 2009 . New York City taxpayers have shelled out nearly half a billion dollars in NYPD-related settlements over the past five years. It has been revealed that a staggering $428 million has been paid out in settlements for civil-rights lawsuits brought against the NYPD since 2009. The information was brought to light in response to a Freedom of Information Law request filed by open government news organization MuckRock. The results show not only sheer amount spent on the 12,000 plus settlements but also that the overwhelming majority of these cases end with the NYPD at fault, MuckRock noted. But this is not to say that all the settlements were solely prompted by the police department's actions. As Gothamist pointed out, The largest settlement on the list, $11.5 million, resulted from the case of Google engineer Sasha Blair-Goldensohn, who was hit and partially paralyzed by a falling tree limb in Central Park in 2009. In another case the family of Ronald Spear sued the City after Spear died on Rikers Island after being beaten by Correction officers, receiving $2.75 million in their settlement. The weblog also noted that the $428 million figure may not accurately reflect what New York is actually paying out. It refers to the case of John Gad Alla who won a $2.5 million settlement from a jury after he was beaten by NYPD officers in his home in 2010. But last year a federal judge reduced that amount by $1.5 million and ordered a new trial. The results of the Freedom of Information Law request show not only sheer amount spent on the 12,000 plus settlements but also that the overwhelming majority of these cases end with the NYPD at fault (file pic) The average settlement amount costs  $33,875. The Gothamist last year met protester Jed Meighan, who said he was living off the settlement he obtained from the City after being pushed to the ground by a group of NYPD officers during an Occupy Wall Street protest in 2012. He broke his wrist and later received $55,000. The document also shows that the City paid out $583,024 to a group of 14 Occupy Wall Street protesters who were arrested on New Year's Day in 2012, which is the largest OWS-related settlement to date.

That this brilliant display came four . years to the day since the French squad went on strike in South Africa . throws the result into even sharper relief. This . time everything is clicking and they will win Group E, thus likely . avoiding Argentina in the second round, unless something dramatic . occurs. The only other time France won both their opening games at a . World Cup was in 1998, and we know what happened after that. Switzerland . have long boasted a fine defensive record at World Cups but France tore . them apart with a first half of pace, pressure and poise that left . Hitzfeld’s players looking bewildered. How . much of that was down to Steve Von Bergen’s departure after just eight . minutes with a suspected fractured cheekbone is open to speculation. What is clear is that after he was forced off to hospital, following a . brutal connection with Giroud’s high boot, Switzerland developed more . holes than one of their famous cheeses. New . Aston Villa defender Philippe Senderos arrived to join his ex-Arsenal . team-mate Johan Djourou and both showed why they are no longer in Arsene . Wenger’s ranks. At a corner . in the 17th minute a current resident of north London put France ahead. Yohan Cabaye swung across an out-swinging corner and Giroud rose . unchallenged to power a header at goal. Diego Benaglio got fingers to . the ball but only succeeded in diverting it over the man on the line. Racing away: Blaise Matuidi wheels away after his slick finish for France's second goal . Taking chances: Matuidi picks up the ball on the break from Karim Benzema and finishes with aplomb . Beaten: Swiss keeper Diego Benaglio is too late as Matuidi's shot beats him at his near post . Down and out: Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri's face tells the story as his side go 2-0 down after 18 minutes . It was France's 100th goal at a World Cup finals and reward for Deschamps in restoring Giroud to the starting line-up. Within . 13 seconds of the restart France went had their 101st. Valon Behrami . played a blind pass and Benzema pounced, advancing quickly and releasing . Matuidi down the left channel. The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder . whipped a left-foot shot that beat Benaglio at his near post when it . really shouldn’t have. It . was two goals conceded by Switzerland in 66 seconds, the same amount as . they had allowed in the previous 750 minutes of World Cup action spread . over eight years. In 2006 they were knocked out without letting in one. Hitzfeld’s . team did respond for a brief flicker when Admir Mehmedi ran through . midfield and unleashed a low shot that Hugo LLoris could only palm to . Xherdan Shaqiri. The Liverpool target was denied only by the slenderest . touch by the Tottenham goalkeeper that went undetected by the officials. Stacks on: Matuidi (centre) is swamped by his team-mates as they double their lead within a minute . Tripped: Real Madrid front man Benzema is brought down by Stefan Lichtsteiner in the corner of the penalty area . Picked it: Benaglio goes the right way to save Benzema's spot-kick . Rebound: Yohan Cabaye is first there after the save but his jumping volley only clatters into the crossbar . Dutch . referee Bjorn Kuipers was more alert in the 31st minute when he . correctly awarded France a penalty for a clumsy challenge by Djorou on . Benzema. The Real Madrid striker, who bagged two in the opening game, . stepped up to take the spot-kick but was denied by Benaglio. It seemed . certain Cabaye would put the rebound in as he advanced onto the falling . ball but the ex-Newcastle man curiously chose to volley rather than head . and crashed it against the bar. No . matter, nine minutes later France would have their third in . breath-taking fashion. Switzerland had a corner but 14 seconds and four . passes later the ball was in their net. Benzema . fed Raphael Varane, who produced a sublime pass to the galloping . Giroud. The Arsenal striker squared it to Valbuena at the far post and . the diminutive midfielder applied a finish. It was stunning stuff. Benzema . progress his golden boot chances by scoring midway through the second . half. Paul Pogba, on as a substitute, sliced a lovely ball forward, . Senderos hacked horribly and Benzema fired in his ninth goal in nine . internationals. Body behind it: Benaglio got his whole torso behind the spot kick to avoid going down 3-0, momentarilly . Blood bin: Defender Steve von Bergen (left) goes off bleeding from a wound near his eye . Nightmare start: Von Bergen goes down in the opening minutes of the group E clash after a collision . Piggy-back to last-16?: Mathieu Valbuena (left) jumps on Giroud after extending the lead to 3-0 . Put away: Valbuena latched onto a low cross from Giroud following a slick counter-attack . Gratefully received: Benaglio scrambles but has no chance as France's lead becomes a mountain for the Swiss . On the money: Benzema scored France's fourth with this finish between Benaglio's legs . Another . lovely move 20 minutes from time made it five. Benzema fed Sissoko, . whose first time hit across goal whistled in. Saves from Benaglio and . last-ditch clearances prevented an even bigger rout and Switzerland got . two of their own late on as the French switched off. Nine . minutes from time Blerim Dzemaili fired a low free-kick through a . pathetic French wall to defeat Lloris and then Granit Xhaka got another . back with a superb volley. This group could come down to goal difference . and those strikes could prove important. Benzema . thought he had scored a superb second with the last kick of the game . after curling in from the edge of the area. He ran off celebrating but . Kuipers had already blown up.

"A newlywed bride suffered 'horrific' life-changing injuries after being run down by a car - on her honeymoon. Beautician Joanna Rose was celebrating her marriage to Andrew after jetting off for a relaxing break in Torrevieja, in south-eastern Spain. But after being hit by the car and thrown into the air, she was left fighting for her life in hospital with multiple and serious injuries, including a fractured spine. Scroll down for video . After the accident Mrs Rose was rushed to a hospital in Torrevieja, where she stayed for two weeks before being flown back to receive treatment in Britain. She is pictured above on the flight home . Joanna Rose, pictured, suffered 'horrific' life-changing injuries after being run down by a car - on her honeymoon . Joanna Rose was celebrating her marriage to Andrew by jetting off for a relaxing break in Torrevieja, in south-eastern Spain. The pair are pictured on their wedding day . The 38-year-old beautician also suffered five broken ribs, internal bleeding, cuts and bruising to her face, head and body and, due to the force of the impact, one of her crowns in her mouth became dislodged. After the accident Mrs Rose was rushed to a hospital in Torrevieja, where she stayed for two weeks before being transferred back to the UK to Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield, West Yorkshire. She is now at home in Wakefield and has to wear a full body brace and faces surgery to insert pins in her spine to stabilise it. The mother-of-one  said: 'I feel like I have been to hell and back - my honeymoon was completely ruined as I spent the entire two weeks in hospital battling for my life.' The 38-year-old recalls hearing a screech of tyres and a loud bang, he then turned round to see his new wife flying through the air and hitting the windscreen of the car before she fell to the floor. Mrs Rose said: 'Andrew and I were walking along a road when the accident happened. I remember hearing a loud bang behind us then suddenly landing on the road with a thud and feeling instant and excruciating pain in my back. The 38-year-old (pictured with Andrew) suffered five broken ribs, internal bleeding, cuts and bruising to her face, head and body and, due to the force of the impact, one of her crowns in her mouth became dislodged . The beautician (pictured looking up at her new husband on their wedding day) revealed that the 'happiest time in my life so quickly turned into the worst' 'I was rushed to a local hospital where I was told that I had fractured my spine, over the next few days I realised the full extent of the injuries I had suffered as I was in agony. 'The doctors were concerned that I had a tear in my heart due to the force of the impact and my internal injuries, but thankfully I didn't need to have heart surgery. 'I was terrified, everything happened so quickly and I can just remember being in a tremendous amount of pain. I'm so glad Andrew was there by my side at the hospital to reassure me. 'I have been struggling to cope with what has happened, the happiest time in my life so quickly turned into the worst and now I am faced with the daunting prospect that I have a long way to go before I will have fully recovered.' Mr Rose, 38, recalls hearing a screech of tyres and a loud bang, he then turned round to see his new wife flying through the air and hitting the windscreen of the car before she fell to the floor . The couple have a four-year-old daughter Poppy who was also on holiday with them at the time, but luckily was back at the hotel being looked after by her grandmother. Now Mrs Rose has instructed specialist International Personal Injury lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the accident and help provide funds for her recovery and rehabilitation. Philip Banks, representing her, said: 'This was a horrendous accident which happened on what was meant to be a romantic and carefree holiday for Joanna and Andrew to start their married life together. 'But instead Joanna has been left seriously injured and is facing a long and painful recovery and will be unable to work for the foreseeable future. 'We are currently making investigations as to any criminal proceedings which are being conducted in Spain against the driver and to establish insurance details of the driver to help with Joanna's case.'","Joanna Rose was celebrating marriage to Andrew in Torrevieja, Spain .

"The ability to love and empathise are among humanity’s defining characteristics. But while understanding another person's plight can inspire gentle emotions, under certain circumstances, feelings of tenderness and sympathy can in fact lead to aggressive behaviour, researchers claim. Experts believe the phenomenon exists because certain hormones produced by nerve cells interact that lead to aggression to help those in need, which may explain why humans are prepared to harm others to protect their loved ones. Showing compassion (illustrated by a stock image) and understanding another person's plight can inspire gentle emotions, but under certain circumstances, feelings of tenderness and sympathy can predict aggressive behaviours, researchers claim . ‘It's not about anger or feeling personally threatened,’ said Michael Poulin, associate Professor at University at Buffalo, the state university of New York. He believes that two neurohormones appear to be among the mechanisms contributing to the counterintuitive response. Neurohormones are chemicals produced by nerve cells that act as both hormones in the blood stream and neurotransmitters in the brain. ‘Both oxytocin and vasopressin seem to serve a function leading to increased 'approach behaviours, he said, explaining that people are motivated by getting closer to others. People approach one another for many reasons, including aggression. Certain hormones produced by nerve cells interact to predict aggression (illustrated with a stock image) on behalf of those in need, according to a new study. ‘It's not about anger or feeling personally threatened,’ but acting out of love or compassion, its lead researcher explained . A study in 2012 found that less religious people, atheists and agnostics are more driven by compassion to be generous than people who define themselves as strongly religious. University of California researchers held three experiments into compassion and concluded non-religious people would decide how to act based on emotion, rather than doctrine. In the first experiment, researchers analysed data from a 2004 national survey of more than 1,300 American adults, using statements such as ‘when I see someone being taken advantage of, I feel kind of protective towards them’, to see if there was a connection between religion and compassion. Results showed those who agreed with the statements were also more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. When they looked into how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in ways like giving money or food to a homeless person, non-believers and those who rated low in religious belief had better results than religious people. The authors said: 'These findings indicate that although compassion is associated with pro-sociality among both less religious and more religious individuals, this relationship is particularly robust for less religious individuals.' So it stands to reason that if compassion is linked to the action of these hormones, then they are linked to social approach behaviours that they might help account for the link between compassion and aggression, Professor Poulin explained. He and his team conducted a two-part study consisting of a survey and an experiment. ‘The results of both indicate that the feelings we broadly call empathic concern, or compassion, can predict aggression on behalf of those in need,’ he said. The survey asked people to report on someone close to them and explain how that person was threatened by a third-party. Then, participants described their emotions and reaction to the situation. While previous studies have looked at aggression on behalf of others, Professor Poulin said: ‘the idea that empathy can drive aggression absent of provocation or injustice is quite novel’. In the experiment, participants provided a saliva sample in order to measure their neurohormone levels. They then heard a compassion-evoking story about a stranger who was supposedly set to take part in a study measuring the effects of physical pain by eating hot sauce. The ‘real’ participant under observation for this study had a choice of how much pain would be dished out to a third party, who was competing with the person they felt sorry for in the study. ‘The results of both the survey and the experiment indicate that the feelings we have when other people are in need, what we broadly call empathic concern or compassion, can predict aggression on behalf of those in need,’ Professor Poulin said. The study appears to shed light on soldiers who think more about protecting a comrade than fighting against a broader threat, or parents who are prepared to sabotage a child’s competition attempt so their own child can win, according to the scienstists . ‘In situations where we care about someone very much, as humans, we were motivated to benefit them, but if there is someone else in the way, we may do things to harm that third party.’ That reaction is not because the third party has done anything wrong, but because of love or compassion for those we care about, he explained. The study appears to shed light on soldiers who think more about protecting a comrade than fighting against a broader threat, or parents who are prepared to sabotage a child’s competition attempt so that their own child can win.","Hormones  interact to predict aggression on behalf of those in need .

"Britain must regain control of its borders or quit the European Union, Boris Johnson warned yesterday. The London Mayor said it was a ‘deception’ to claim Britain could control immigration while diktats from Brussels over freedom of movement were in place. His comments were seen as a criticism of the Prime Minister who had said he would cut net migration to the tens of thousands – even though he had no control over the number of EU workers flooding in. Mr Johnson said reclaiming control over our borders should be the ‘number one’ priority in the renegotiation with the EU. Boris Johnson took aim at Labour's Tony Blair for opening Britain's borders to Poland in 2004, but also David Cameron's pre-election pledge to cut immigration to the tens of thousands. He said David Cameron should be brave enough to lead the campaign to walk out of the EU in the 2017 referendum if Brussels fails to cede enough powers. His tough words on immigration come just days after Ukip surged to victory in the Clacton by-election and came close to winning the Labour seat of Heywood and Middleton in the North West. And they came amid claims the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if he loses another seat to Ukip. The mayor told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show that the Tories under Mr Cameron had been guilty of ‘deception’ over immigration because of Europe’s open borders. He said it had been wrong for the party to claim at the last election that it was possible to control immigration from the EU. Challenging Mr Cameron to be tougher in his negotiations with Brussels, he said: ‘It’s obviously axiomatic that if we don’t get the reform that we need in 2016-17 then I think we should campaign to come out. ‘But on the border controls thing; that is critical. That is emerging as the number one thing that we need probably to sort out in this negotiation.’ The London Mayor insisted that if Mr Cameron's plans to claw powers back from Brussels fail, he would back Britain leaving the EU altogether . The Prime Minister has promised to claw back powers over our borders as part of his promised renegotiation of powers ahead of an in/out referendum by the end of 2017. Yesterday Mr Johnson said that if this was not achieved, he would campaign for us to come out of Europe. Asked if Mr Cameron should promise to lead the Out of EU campaign if the negotiations do not go well, the mayor said: ‘Yes, I do think that.’ He said there had been two ‘big deceptions’ over the past decade; the first being Tony Blair’s opening of the borders to Eastern Europeans in 2004 when other countries imposed restrictions. The other, he said, was ‘saying we could control the numbers when we couldn’t’. This was seen as a reference to Mr Cameron’s pledge at the last election to cut migration from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands. While the number of people leaving the UK has remained at around 80,000, the numbers arriving from the EU have risen sharply . Net migration from EU countries has risen sharply in recent years, hitting 131,000 in the 12 months to March 2014, according to data from the Office for National Statistics . Despite the Prime Minister’s immigration pledge, the numbers arriving each year have continued to top 200,000, fuelled mostly by large numbers from the EU. Meanwhile, it emerged that one Cabinet minister believes that Mr Cameron could face a leadership ballot if the Tories lose next month’s Rochester and Strood by-election to Ukip. Former Tory MP Mark Reckless is standing for Ukip there after defecting last month. The minister was quoted as saying: ‘If Reckless wins Rochester, there’ll be 46 names.’ This is a reference to the 46 MPs who would need to sign a motion calling for a Conservative leadership vote under party rules. But he added: ‘Cameron would win. But it would be very damaging.’ Last night a former Tory Cabinet minister said it seemed ‘implausible’ that there would be a ballot so close to an election. ‘I don’t know where the 46 would come from,’ he said. And a party source said everyone was ‘focused on fighting hard to win Rochester and Strood’. One Tory MP tried to dispel rumours of a leadership challenge. Mark Pritchard said: ‘Even if we lose Rochester, which we will not, now is not the time, with 200 plus days to go to the general election, for a change of leader.’","Cameron pledged Tories would cut net migration to the 'tens of thousands'

"It took a year for Hillsong leader Brian Houston to meet with the Pentecostal church about allegations his father had molested a seven-year-old boy. The meeting came 12 months after Pastor Barbara Taylor had raised with state executives of the Assemblies of God the matter of Frank Houston's abuse of the boy in Sydney almost 30 years earlier. It took place at the Qantas Club at Sydney Airport three days before Christmas 1999 and was called by Hillsong pastor Brian Houston who also informed church leaders he had stood his father down, an inquiry has heard on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Hillsong senior pastor Brian Houston (pictured) said his father Frank Houston had confessed to abusing a seven-year-old boy decades earlier . At the time, Brian was national president of the Assemblies of God - a confederation of about 1000 evangelical churches. Keith Ainge, former national secretary of AoG in Australia, has told the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse Brian Houston reported at the meeting his father had admitted to a sexual act with a minor. Pastor Ainge said he and the others 'knew nothing of the complaints against Frank Houston' until the December 1999 meeting. Frank (pictured) asked for forgiveness from the victim and allegedly offered them $10,000 in a McDonald's restaurant . The meeting upheld Brian Houston's decision, and agreed that Frank Houston be suspended from ministry for 12 months and be invited to enter a restorative program. Pastor Ainge said there was not a great deal of information about the complaint except that there was 'one incident' with a minor. Earlier on Wednesday, Pastor Taylor - who is head of a small church in Mount Druitt - said she became concerned AHA was still not getting the counselling he needed and wrote to Brian Houston in June 2000 that people were reporting to her Frank Houston was still preaching. Brian Houston rang her and 'was very angry', she said. Pastor Taylor kept notes from the time and in those she recorded that Brian Houston told her his father was very depressed. He also told her a meeting had taken place between AHA, his father, and an elder of his father's church. AHA has told the commission Frank Houston asked for forgiveness and offered him $10,000 during a meeting at a McDonald's in Thornleigh. He was given a 'food-stained napkin' to sign, AHA said. Pastor Taylor said she thought Brian Houston was angry because 'he had dealt with it'. She also said as a 'village pastor' she was not kept in the loop by the executive. In reply to questions from Mark Higgins, counsel representing Hillsong Church Ltd, she said Brian Houston had asked her that any future contact be by phone, 'because the staff opened his mail'. The inquiry heard Brian Houston had told church leaders in a meeting that Frank Houston had admitted he had engaged in a sexual act with a minor . Outside the hearing, Brian Houston said he welcomed the royal commission process. He reiterated an earlier statement in which he said the pain to him of his father being engaged 'in such horrific acts' was nothing compared with the pain of the victims. He said Hillsong was resilient and there were no allegations against him or the church. The hearing resumes on Thursday when Keith Ainge continues giving evidence. Brian Houston is also expected to give evidence. On Tuesday, AHA told the commission Frank Houston would stay with his family when he came to Sydney from New Zealand in the 1970s. AHA was seven when Frank Houston would come to his room, lie on him, fondle him and masturbate him, the alleged victim told the commission. 'I would wake up petrified and I would stay very still,' he said. He said the abuse left him feeling ashamed, and he now suffered depression. AHA said his family was very involved in the church, and when he eventually told his mother in 1978 she told him he did not 'want to be responsible for turning people from the church and sending them to hell'. He said the Houstons 'were considered to be almost like royalty' in the circles in which his parents moved. The witness said when, in 1998, his mother told another church pastor of the abuse, Frank Houston apologised. He was told if there were any problems to contact Frank or Brian Houston. He said after two months he rang Brian and said: 'What is happening with the money I was promised? I agreed to forgive your father.' AHA said Brian Houston said 'Yes, OK, I'll get the money for you. There's no problem. You know it's your fault all of this happened. You tempted my father'. AHA said he replied: 'Why, did he molest you also?' He said Brian got very angry after that. 'He slammed the phone down with words to the effect ""You'll be getting money"".' While acknowledging AHA's courage in appearing at the commission, Brian Houston rejected the claims that he accused him of tempting his father. 'I disagree with his perception of the phone call with me and I strongly refute that I - at any time - accused him of tempting my father. I would never say this and I do not believe this,' he said in a statement made outside the commission. 'At no stage did I attempt to hide or cover up the allegations against my father.","Meeting with the Pentecostal church was held just before Christmas 1999 .

"It is the type of vegetable a person eats, not gorging on large quantities that helps beat obesity, a new study has found. Eating as little as one or two fist-sized portions of leafy green and orange vegetables has been found to 'significantly' reduce an overweight child's risk of suffering obesity-related diseases including type 2 diabetes, liver and heart disease. Regardless of whether the youngsters taking part in the study lost weight, selecting the right vegetables to eat is a critical part of the puzzle, scientists discovered. The team of researchers at the universities of Texas and Southern California found that boosting levels of spinach and broccoli, as well as carrots, in a child's diet reduced the level of 'bad fats' in the body. A new study has found that eating one or two fist-sized portions of carrots or leafy green vegetables a day can reduce the chance of overweight and obese children suffering type 2 diabetes,  liver disease and other obesity-related diseases . And the findings revealed the insulin levels of the overweight Latino children taking part also improved. Children who regularly ate one or two fist-size portions of the non-starchy vegetables reduced their risk of liver problems, type 2 diabetes and other obesity-related illnesses. While the children, who ranged in age from eight to 18, still failed to eat the recommended daily allowance of nutritious vegetables, as stipulated by the US Department of Agriculture, the scientists noted the improvements to their health were significant. Jaimie Davis, assistant professor at the University of Texas, said: 'For a lot of at-risk children, intake of vegetables is really low. 'We found, though, even eating less than a full serving of these vegetables can really have a pronounced effect on children's health. 'One large leafy green salad as a regular part of lunch is enough to make a difference.' The study noted fewer than six per cent of children in the US eat the USDA-recommended multiple servings of nutrient-rich vegetables most days. Researchers examined the effects of nutrient-rich vegetables in the diets of 175 overweight or obese children in Los Angeles. The research, by a team at the universities of Texas and Southern California, found children who ate carrots, broccoli and spinach were at a reduced risk of suffering a raft of health problems linked to their weight . The study found the leafy green and orange, non-starchy vegetables lowered levels of bad fat in the body and helped regulate insulin levels . They found very small differences - equating to a quarter of a cup or around 30g per day, could be linked to improvements insulin levels and a reduction in bad fats in the body. Visceral fat is deemed 'bad fat' because it lingers around internal organs and masses in the liver. Some types of body fats are more dangerous because they can cause serious health complications, sending the wrong signals to the brain about when and how much to eat. The scientists emphasised it is the type of vegetable that matters, adding that starchier vegetables such as corn and potatoes did not reap the same positive effects of leafy greens and orange-coloured options. The study was published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reports.","Study at the universities of Texas and Southern California found it is type of vegetable not the quantity that makes a difference to health .

"Germany have one job, and one job alone in Salvador, this evening. Stop Ronaldo. With Spain having been humiliated at the hands of the Netherlands, Joachim Low’s team are now seen as the European favourites to win the World Cup, and a good result against Portugal is to be expected. At least it would be, if it weren’t for Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese strikes fear into opposition at the best of times, but for Germany, he is even more terrifying. VIDEO Scroll down to watch All Star XI: Ronaldo . Dangerman: Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo is the player Germany most fear ahead of their Group G clash . Tormentor: Ronaldo scored against Schalke, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich (pictured) last season . After he and his Real Madrid team mates dispatched Schalke, Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in last season’s Champions League, Ronaldo has come to be known as the 'Deutschlandschreck'. It loosely translates as 'Germany’s Tormentor'. As the Tagesspiegel wrote today, 'Germany’s chances of a good start to the World Cup would improve dramatically if they can play Ronaldo out of the game'. That is the popular view, and the reason why every tiny development on Ronaldo’s fitness has been meticulously recorded in the German media. Portugal without Ronaldo are there to be beaten. Portugal with Ronaldo are an equally matched opponent. On the ball: Ronaldo's fitness has been scrutinised closely by the German media ahead of Monday's encounter . Decision time: Germany coach Joachim Low is expected to play without natural full-backs against Portugal . In the zone: Germany squad train at Salvador's Arena Fonte Nova ahead of Monday's clash against Portugal . Dynamic duo: Jerome Boateng (left) and Benedikt Howedes (right) will face the threat of Ronaldo out wide . From the German camp itself, the situation is viewed differently. Low sees the whole Portugal side as 'the World Champions in counter attacking', while Benedikt Howedes said this week that 'It’s not Germany against Ronaldo, it’s Germany against Portugal'. Jerome Boateng was equally quick to play down fears of the Real Madrid man, saying 'I’ve faced him a lot of times in the Champions League and for Germany before. It’s not like I’m sitting in my room all the time watching videos of him. 'Of course I can’t stop him on my own,' Boateng added, 'no defender can do that. We need to work together as a team to stop him'. Put like that, there is room for optimism. History tells us that Germany are one of the most effective teams when it comes to stopping Ronaldo. The Portugese has played against the Germans three times at a major tournament. On each occasion, Germany have won, and Ronaldo has not found the net. OAP: Monday's front page of German newspaper BZ reads 'Tonight we will make Ronaldo look old' Star player: Low's defensive plans will focus around neutralising the threat of Ronaldo (centre) Colossal figure: Germany centre-back Per Mertesacker should start in the heart of their defence on Monday . Up for it: Mats Hummels (centre) should partner Mertesacker at the back in their Group F opener . In some corners, there is optimism that this will happen again. This morning, the Berlin tabloid BZ appeared with a slightly disturbing picture of Ronaldo as an elderly man, with the headline 'Today we will make Ronaldo look old'. Nevertheless, this is a different Ronaldo to the one they have faced before. Germany cannot simply rely on records to make sure his side are not tormented by the Ballon d’Or winner. For all his attempts to play down Ronaldo’s influence, Low knows this. His decision to fill the back line with natural centre backs, and thereby do without marauding full backs should stop spaces opening up behind the midfield for Ronaldo to exploit. Vital man: Philipp Lahm will play a crucial role as Germany's midfield interceptor against Portugal . Phillipp Lahm will also play a key role as a defensive midfielder. As a creative force in that position, he has already proved himself. Against Ronaldo and Portugal’s counter attacking game, the challenge will be to act as an interceptor. The right result this evening could define Germany’s tournament. On paper, the team are certainly among the very best this World Cup has to offer. Their preparations, though, have been plagued by niggling psychological and physical issues. A host of injuries, a shaky defence, and the risk of only bringing one striker have been the main points of worry, and, at least among the public, there is tangible pessimism. Worried: There are German public concerns that Miroslav Klose is the only striker in their World Cup squad . The spirit in the camp is harder to gauge. While players like Lukas Podolski, Phillipp Lahm and Mesut Ozil show nothing but positivity to the watching public, the pressure is extremely high on this Germany team to finally deliver on their promise. It was that pressure, among other things, which saw them falter against Italy at Euro 2012. With favourites such as Brazil, Spain and Argentina all failing to convince in their opening games, Germany can send a message tonight. Make Ronaldo look old, and they will have earned the favourites tag.

"A helicopter tracked a man from 1,300ft so he could be arrested after he repeatedly shone a laser pen into the eyes of a pilot, dazzling him. Chris Vowles targeted the National Police Air Service (NPAS) while he was drinking in his garden below the plane with his friends. The crew were left dazzled by the bright green laser and decided to track Vowles using thermal imaging cameras so that police on the ground could arrest him. Scroll down for video . The laser was shone at the police helicopter four times, creating a 'bloom effect', which momentarily blinded the pilot . The crew on the police helicopter used powerful thermal imaging cameras to track down Chris Vowles so officers could arrest him . Vowles had been with friends in his garden in Birmingham when he shone the laser four times at the helicopter, which was on the way to do surveillance in the city, at about 1.15am on July 31. Birmingham Crown Court previously heard the laser created a 'bloom effect' which momentarily blinded the pilot and could have caused serious catastrophic consequences. After he had dazzled the pilot Vowles then appeared to gesture up at officers and wave beer bottles in apparent celebration. But he was foiled when the helicopter tracked him from 1,300ft (396m) and passed his location onto police who turned up 15 minutes later to arrest him. The thermal imaging cameras managed to pin point Vowles' precise location, so police on the ground could track him down . Vowles tried to cover his tracks by throwing the laser pen over a fence. But his tactic was captured on footage from the helicopter. Officers found the laser pen and, after he was shown the on-board footage, the 23-year-old TK Maxx worker admitted the offence acting reckless in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft. Footage from the helicopter captures Vowles throwing the laser pen over a fence in a bid to cover his tracks . Police arrived at his home in Birmingham and arrested Vowles, who later admitted acting reckless in a manner likely to endanger an aircraft . At a hearing at Birmingham Crown Court he was sentenced to seven months in prison, suspended for two years and 250 hours of unpaid work. Judge Paul Farrer QC said: 'It was conduct that caused real danger. 'The helicopter was over a built-up area. 'That which you did plainly had the potential to lead to catastrophic results both for the occupants of the helicopter and wholly innocent members of the public below who were probably sleeping in their beds.' Martin Knowles, West Midlands region NPAS manager, said: 'This was not accidental... it was a deliberate act. The demeanour of the people in the garden illustrates the attitude of many people - laughing and joking and believing their actions were somehow harmless fun. 'But aiming a laser pen at any aircraft, be it a police helicopter, air ambulance or commercial plane, can have disastrous consequences - it's certainly no laughing matter. 'The police take laser pen incidents very seriously - and of course it's easy for us to identify offenders as the light beam directs us straight to them, whilst high-tech on-board cameras enable us to keep tabs on them should they try to disappear.' The National Police Air Service said shining a laser pen into the eyes of pilots can cause permanent eye damage . Andy Shanks, a pilot with NPAS, said he'd been hit 'countless' times by laser pens during his 33 year flying career. 'When the light bounces off the screen it's like a disco-ball strobe effect in the cabin,' he said. 'It's disorientating, makes it impossible to focus on the instrument panel and is extremely dangerous as even a momentary loss of control can be crucial.' He said that people targeted with laser pens can suffer eye damage. Vowles was also ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge and £300 of costs.","Chris Vowles shone laser pen into pilot's eyes on police helicopter .

"Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions (pictured), has welcomed the ‘transparency’ of filming in court and said it could have 'real benefits' Criminal trials in Britain could appear on TV after the chief prosecutor in England and Wales revealed she could see ‘real benefits’ of allowing cameras into courtrooms. Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, welcomed the ‘transparency’ of filming in court and said it had the potential to allow the public to ‘see justice being done’. Her comments came after senior judges in Britain were left divided over the benefits of airing live criminal trials – a debate sparked by the broadcast of the Oscar Pistorius trial in South Africa. Speaking at an event held by the Howard League for Penal Reform at law firm Clifford Chance in London, Mrs Saunders told The Times: ‘Open justice is about letting the public see justice being done and I can see real benefits of trialling cameras in criminal courts, as long as the right protections and safeguards are in place. ‘I am doing a lot of work to improve the court experience of victims and witnesses and where cameras in the courtroom would not disrupt this, or any other aspect of a trial, I would welcome the transparency, and indeed scrutiny, they could bring.’ A ban on cameras in courtrooms in England and Wales was introduced in 1925, although permission was granted last year to show civil and criminal cases at the Court of Appeal. The rules in Scottish courts differ and a murder trial was allowed to be filmed last year after permission had been sought from all participants, including the defendant. In comparison, in America, 38 of the 50 states allow TV cameras into criminal and civil courts, providing that the judge agrees. The relaxed rules have allowed millions to watch infamous trials like OJ Simpson's in 1995. Sentencing in major trials and criminal appeals, which are heard by senior judges without juries, has the potential for pulling in large audiences. However, while Mrs Saunders and Lord Neuiberger of Abbotsbury, the president of the Supreme Court, have both come out in favour of cameras in courtrooms, other judges have expressed their reservations. Scroll down for videos . The South African trial of Paralympian Oscar Pistorius was broadcast live around the world earlier this year . The athlete's trial (above) was given the go-ahead to be screened live in a ruling by a Pretoria high court judge . Almost a year ago exactly, TV cameras filmed a case in one of the highest courts in the country for the very first time. On October 31 last year, viewers watched the Prime Minister’s brother Alex Cameron, QC, attempt to reduce the sentence of the ringleader of a coin-forging gang at the Court of Appeal. It was the first time cameras had been allowed in the Royal Court of Justice since 1925 and was described as a 'landmark moment for justice and journalism’. The case was broadcast live on BBC and Sky News and screened live on ITV and C4 websites. It came after five courtrooms at the Court of Appeal were given discreet fixed cameras to be operated by a court video journalist who has both legal and journalistic qualifications. Lawyers’ arguments and judges’ summing up, decisions and – in criminal cases – sentencing remarks may be filmed but victims, witnesses and defendants will not be filmed. The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, aired his concerns about the Pistorius trial and ordered a report on it following its broadcast. The South African trial of the Paralympian was given the go-ahead to be broadcast in a televised ruling in a Pretoria high court. Prior to the trial, which saw Pistorius jailed for five years for killing his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, Judge Dustan Mlambo said it was vital that impoverished South Africans who feel ill-treated by the justice system be given a first-hand look at the trial. 'The justice system is still perceived as treating the rich and famous with kid gloves whilst being harsh on the poor and the vulnerable,' he said. 'Enabling a larger South African society to be able to follow first-hand criminal proceedings which involve a celebrity, so to speak, will go a long way into dispelling these negative and unfounded perceptions.' Others who have expressed their concerns about British court cases being televised include the former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Judge. He has previously said filming a sentencing could spark chaos in a courtroom. 'I'm very troubled about having cameras just swanning around,' he said. The 71-year-old has also told how lifting the 90-year-old filming ban could encourage hecklers to yell abuse or even cheer knowing it will be broadcast across the country. He said that while he was ‘perfectly happy’ with cameras being taken into court ‘provided their presence doesn't increase the risk that justice won't be done', he opposed the filming of the actual sentencing. ‘I take a very strong view about sentencing,’ he added. A Scottish murder trial became the first British criminal court case to be aired live on TV in 90 years. In an unprecedented move, a film crew was allowed access to an entire case - including the moment a businessman was convicted of murdering his wife. Cameras have been banned within the precincts of court since 1925, but Channel 4 was granted permission to follow the six-week retrial of Nat Fraser at the High Court in Edinburgh in 2012. After three years of negotiation, the Scottish High Court gave the Channel 4 documentary team permission to film the judge, lawyers, defendant and witnesses during the high-profile retrial of Fraser who was accused of killing his wife Arlene. The two-hour documentary, called The Murder Trial, was broadcast on July 9 last year. A TV crew was allowed to film the re-trial of Nat Fraser (left) who was accused and convicted of murdering his wife Arlene (right). Six cameras were allowed in the Edinburgh courtroom for the first time since 1925 . Bafta-winning filmmaker director Nick Holt, who directed the documentary, said it was right that the public were given greater access to the court system. TV crews used six remotely-controlled cameras to capture all of the unfolding drama within the court room. Fraser was accused of hiring a hitman to murder his estranged wife, who vanished from her home in Elgin, Moray, in April 1998. Her body has never been found, there was no weapon, no crime scene and her husband appeared to have a cast iron alibi for the day she disappeared. He was first brought to trial in 2003 for her murder and was found guilty. However, he argued that the trial was a miscarriage of justice and challenged the verdict in the highest courts in the land. The case became a cause celebre. Eventually, after years of protesting his innocence, the conviction was quashed in 2011. In April 2012, Fraser was sent back to the High Court in Edinburgh for a fresh trial, 14 years after his wife’s disappearance, and was found guilty of murder for a second time.","Director of public prosecutions welcomed 'transparency' of filming in court .

"With their wide, springy gait, ostriches can reach speeds of 40mph (70 km/h), covering up to 16ft (5 metres) in a single stride. As a child, Keahi Seymour was fascinated by what appeared to be the effortless speed and agility of these creatures, making them the fastest running birds on the planet. Now the San Francisco-based inventor has created a prototype gadget that he claims will allow humans to experience what it’s like to reach these incredible speeds. Scroll down for video . Dubbed the ‘Bionic Boot’, the shoes have springs on the back designed to imitate the Achilles tendon of an ostrich or kangaroo, giving the wearer more down force when running. Mr Seymour has been working on the boots for several years, and has already produced dozens of prototypes. Last month, he took his Bionic Boots to the Maker Faire in New York to demonstrate its capabilities. In its current form, the device can reach speeds of up to 25 mph (40 km/h) – or the same speed as a slow-moving car.

Gone are the days of solid rubber prosthetics. From 3D-printed limbs to titanium legs and hands controlled by apps, advances in technology are revolutionising the industry. Earlier this year, a new state-of-the-art centre has opened in Scotland to give specialist treatment to military amputees - taking advantage of these developments, and making the technology more mainstream. The service is based at the WestMARC unit at Southern General Hospital, and at the SMART Centre in Edinburgh. Patients in Aberdeen, Inverness and Dundee will be able to access services via video link-up. The units will run alongside the existing NHS prosthetics service, and use specialist prosthetic training and imaging equipment to manufacture new socket technology. The centre also features a gait laboratory that will study how well patients are walking with their new limbs. Mr Seymour has been working on the boots for several years, and has already produced dozens of prototypes . According to PopSci, Mr Seymour says won’t rest until he can go faster and outrun some of Earth’s fastest land animals. And he isn’t the first to attempt the gait of an ostrich or kangaroo. For instance the £166 ($265) bouncing boots claims to turn anyone into a human kangaroo. The ‘Kangoo Jumps’ are fastened like roller blades or ski boots, with quick-release buckles. Once they’re on, you need to do a little march on the spot to get yourself used to the sensation, which feels rather like jogging on a trampoline. Featuring a spring-loaded sole, the mini-trampolines were initially invented to help people recover from sports injuries by taking away the impact of running on their joints. But now they’re being sold as a way of enjoying all the benefits of a tough gym or aerobics workout.

"FEMAIL writer Marianne Power tried out the latest exercise trend to hit the UK, naked yoga . When I'm stressed I have two recurring dreams. One involves me in an exam hall about to take a paper that I have not revised for. The other features me walking down Oxford Street with no clothes on. I'm trying to hide but then I see someone from work. I wake up in a cold sweat. For most us, being naked in public is the stuff of nightmares. So why is it that here I am, on a Sunday night, about to take my clothes off in front of room full of strangers who have all paid good money to do the same thing? And not only are we going to take our clothes off – we are going to bend and move ourselves into the most compromising of positions. And no, it's not that kind of a get together. It's the latest fitness trend to hit London: naked yoga. Yes, really. The craze started in the New York where naked yoga classes have got a cult following. Matthew McConaughey is said to be a fan, while Lady Gaga featured naked yoga in one of her music videos. Trendsetting magazine Gentlewoman featured a whole naked yoga shoot while a high-end naked yoga retreat in Ibiza sold out this summer. The idea behind it is that it helps people get over body hang-ups – but surely us Brits are too uptight for naked downward dog or sun salutations in the buff? Apparently not. Yoga teacher Annette, founder of Naked Yoga London, says that since she started her naked yoga classes a couple of years ago, the demand has been overwhelming. 'The feedback from the courses was so overwhelmingly positive right from day one. I was blown away, and still am blown away by the messages I receive from people having attended the classes,' she says. Scroll down for video . The craze started in New York and has since progressed to London where classes are in high demand . 'The benefits range from simply feeling great and free, experiencing the liberation of your body free from clothes and moving in contact with the air, and also a sense of psychological liberation in this. 'People say they become more accepting of themselves, they get over weight issues, they become less self-conscious and less judgmental of themselves and others.' That sounds nice. Although I don't actively hate my body, I don't love it either. My bum is fat, my thighs wobble, I have cellulite, I have scars. I try not to think about it because I know that I'm very lucky to have a healthy body that works and as a size 12-14, I'm a very normal size – but the truth is I have a kind of low-grade body-loathing all the time. It's boring and draining. If naked yoga can change that, then I'm willing to try – but I'm terrified. The process is supposed to help participants relax and feel comfortable in their own body . My first fear is that everyone will have perfect yoga bodies so when I arrive at the tiny studio in South London I am relieved that everyone looks quite normal. We are all ages from twenties to sixties and about two thirds men, one-third women. We are all shapes and sizes – from what I can see at least. Once we are in the dimly lit studio everyone keeps their eyes to themselves. The room is warm and there's a smell of incense and the soft sound of plinky plonky music. Mirrors and windows are covered and candles flicker. We're told to find a mat, get 'changed' – ie undressed – and lie down. I won't lie – it's embarrassing. I find a spot in the shadows, remove my leggings and jumper, take a deep breath as I take off my bra and knickers and lie down quickly. I don't look at the two men on either side of me doing the same. It's amazing what you can block out. I work hard telling myself that they were enlightened yogis and not perverts – but the truth is the whole thing feels very strange. We begin. Annette's soothing voice guides us through the postures. Fortunately the mats are arranged in a horseshoe shape and at a diagonal so that we each face Annette but are not looking directly at other people – and nobody is behind you. It is also a relief that most of the class is done lying down with eyes closed. There's lots of deep breathing and gentle stretching and lifting of arms and legs from a lying down position. In the few minutes I manage to forget I'm naked it's surprisingly relaxing. The dim lights and soft red candles make the whole thing feel like being in the womb. When the moves got a bit more dynamic I do get self-conscious. I have moments – when doing the downward dog – where I think, 'What the hell am I doing?' but at no point do I get an eye-full. I try not to think who might be getting an eye-full of me. I treat it all as a mental exercise in not caring what people think. This class is more about being in your own body than looking at other people's. And in that semi-dark studio, with Annette's soft voice telling us to 'inquire' into our breath, something quite miraculous happens. Marianne says that she found the experience very effective and the class left her appreciating her figure . Towards the end of the class, I find that I like being in my own body. I'm not criticising it, hating it, wishing it to be better. Even when my tummy was hanging down it didn't bother me. I marvel at how my body could bend and move, and at my soft droopy skin. In the soft candlelight it doesn't look so bad. Annette says this is exactly the benefit of naked yoga. She says: 'We have such high and unattainable standards of what our bodies should like. People can feel inadequate, insecure and dissatisfied with themselves. Part of the reason I do naked yoga is to react against these ideals of perfection... 'Our bodies are a wonderful miracle granted to us as human beings, and we spend far too much time criticising them, hiding them away in shame and fear. It's time to love, honour and delight in what our bodies have to offer us.' At the end of the class there's a quiet calm as everyone puts on their clothes and walks to the tube. I speak to the lady who was just as nervous as I was, when we walked into class at the beginning. 'That wasn't so bad, was it?' she asks me. 'No, it wasn't – actually I liked it,' I say. 'Me too!' She's grinning now. We both are. I get home and can't quite believe what I've just done. It's like a dream – but not a bad one this time. Weird but not bad. In fact, it was quite beautiful.

The benefits now subject to a cap include: . Mr .

But the legislation was carried in the Commons with a majority of 66. After the vote, the Prime Minister used Twitter to declare the cap was 'fair' and accused Labour of having the wrong priorities. Business . Secretary Vince Cable, meanwhile, made an outspoken attack on his Tory . colleagues for ‘completely unacceptable’ language suggesting the .

He . said there had to be a ‘tightening up’ in the welfare budget, but . added: ‘I’m certainly very uncomfortable with some of the language which . has been used by our Coalition partners attacking people who are out of . work.’ Labour’s work and . pensions spokesman Liam Byrne, who also objected to the ‘tone’ adopted . by Tory MPs, faced acute embarrassment as it emerged that he had . referred to ‘shirkers’ himself at least twice before. Better off on benefits? How each April the rise in state handouts has risen by more than the average annual increase in wages. For the next three years the government will cap rises at one per cent . Labour's Ed Balls (left) and Liam Byrne, claim the benefits bill could be cut by getting more people into work . Traditionally, benefits have . been increased in line with the rate of inflation. That prompted uproar . last year, when the formula meant their value increased by more than 5 . per cent – at a time when many working families have had to contend with . pay freezes or below-inflation rises. The . Coalition’s Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill will peg benefit rises at 1 . per cent a year for three years from next April. An impact assessment . published by the Government suggested single parents would be most . affected by the cap, losing £5 a week. Working . households in receipt of state support in the form of tax credits will . be an average of £3 a week worse off, though the Treasury insists this . will be more than cancelled out by a record increase in the basic rate . income tax allowance which will come into effect in April. Mr . Duncan Smith said Labour had now opposed every single measure the . Coalition has introduced to reduce the welfare bill, which has increased . from £132billion ten years ago to £192billion – a real terms increase . of 45 per cent. Labour had rejected £83billion in . welfare savings, equivalent to £5,000 in extra debt or tax rises for . every working family. ‘They think that helping people is about trapping . more and more people in benefits,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘What a . ridiculous nonsense they have created.’ Mr Byrne insisted seven million . working households, as well as those out of work, will be hit by the . Bill. ‘This is a strivers’ tax, pure and simple. It is going to hit . people on tax credits and we oppose this strivers’ tax,’ he said. Mr . Byrne said he welcomed those questioning ‘the tone of this debate’, . adding: ‘We should not reduce it to a basic division between Britain’s . shirkers and strivers.’ But . it later emerged that in 2011, he had told the Labour conference: ‘Many . people on the doorstep at the last election felt that too often we were . for shirkers not workers.’ And . last year, he told the London School of Economics: ‘We are the Labour .

"Four world-class properties were placed on the market this year in the exclusive Sydney suburb of Point Piper, making one square kilometer the most enviable in the country. The sales of the trophy residences in June, August, and most recently, on Friday, have elevated the North Shore suburb making it a millionaires row for a new set of owners. Three of the properties went under the hammer for over $30 million, and the remaining property, formerly owned by Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch, is expected to fetch a tidy $37 million when it is snatched up later in the year. There are high price hopes for the 110 Wolseley Road property, with anticipation that the residence will topple even the highest sales seen in the area over the past year. Selling agent Bart Doff from Laing+Simmons Double Bay said the property could sell for more than $37 million . The palatial master wing is connected a study, a bar and wine cellar, a butlers pantry, and marble-slab heated floors. The house currently holds three bedrooms, with room to develop a further two, as the levels are connected by a bespoke glass-view elevator. Selling agent Bart Doff from Laing+Simmons Double Bay said the property could sell for more than $37 million, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Property developer and former next door neighbour Ron Medich pocketed the same amount earlier in the year for his 783 square metre Piper Point waterfront mansion. The property is currently owned by Karyn Zamel, wife of mining engineer Gary Zamel, who plan to downsize within the area. The couple bought their home for $20.6 million in 2005, up from the $12 million the Murdoch's paid for the property the year they married, 1999. The three-storey mansion offers direct and panoramic views of the Harbour Bridge, and boasts its own private jetty and in-ground pool. Mr Doff said the home was 'one of the world's most prized private waterfront trophy holdings'.

This next property was built almost 40 years ago by the former property developer and hotelier, Salvatore Paino. The site was bought for $135,000 and was built into a stunning five-storey property with five bedrooms. The sale took three months of negotiations, and sold for over $30 million through Michael Dunn and James Dunn from Richardson & Wrench Double Bay in conjunction with Enza Messina from Enza Messina Real Estate. The new buyers were reportedly deciding whether to renovate the well-loved property, or whether to rebuild on the site.

"Formula One title contender Lewis Hamilton will drop to 20th on Sunday's German Grand Prix grid, and may start from the pitlane, after Mercedes changed the gearbox on his car following a crash in qualifying. The Briton, whose championship-leading team mate Nico Rosberg will be on pole position for his home race, qualified 16th on Saturday despite spinning into the barriers early on. However, he gained a position because Sauber's Mexican Esteban Gutierrez carried over a three-place demotion from the previous race.

"The player who two years ago declared his desire to stay at Arsenal forever is set to become only the seventh to leave the club for Manchester United. Thomas Vermaelen is expected to put pen to paper on a transfer that is almost as curious as it is rare. It is understood that the Belgian defender has agreed verbally to terms worth £100,000-a-week to join Louis van Gaal at Old Trafford, with a fee of less than £10million mooted for the 28-year-old. The passage for such a move – not as contentious as Robin van Persie’s a couple of years back but surprising nonetheless – has been partially cleared by Vermaelen sharing an agent with Van Persie and, with only one year remaining on his deal, Vermaelen is believed to want a change. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thomas Vermaelen parades FA Cup and trains with Arsenal . Shock! The injury-prone Thomas Vermaelen is expected to complete a £10m move to Manchester United . On his way! Vermaelen (mocked up in a Manchester United shirt) is ready for a move after the World Cup . All smiles: Any move for Vermaelen wouldn't be as controversial as Van Persie's switch to Old Trafford in 2012 . Off he went: Nemanja Vidic was allowed to leave for Inter Milan by former United manager David Moyes . After five rather up and down years at Arsenal, he has found himself down the pecking order. Per Mertesacker has emerged into a quality centre-half after initial, significant doubts that he could adapt to the pace of England’s top division. Arsene Wenger has tended to use Laurent Koscielny alongside him, meaning Arsenal’s captain has been in the strange position of commanding respect but not holding a place in the team. Wenger is believed to want to keep him, but the trends for Vermaelen have largely convinced him to make a move. He made 33 Premier League appearances in his first season after joining from Ajax, but missed large chunks of 2010 and 2011 with an Achilles problem. He recovered to reclaim his place in the side, and resumed his threat as a goal-scoring centre-half, but last season played only 14 top-flight games, seven of which were starts, and was often used on the left. First choice: Germany central defender Per Mertesacker has kept Vermaelen out of the side at the Emirates . United no more: Sportsmail columnist Rio Ferdinand also left Old Trafford at the end of last season . On the stretch: Vermaelen is currently away at the World Cup in Brazil with Belgium . All of which might make him seem a curious choice for United, as they look to rebuild the centre of their defence following the fantastic pairing of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand. Ferdinand is currently without a club having apparently come to the end of a long line at the top of the top level, while Vidic has been handed a lucrative deal at Inter Milan. At the time the move was agreed, David Moyes said it was a move that suited both parties, though there are plenty who disagree. Now it looks as though Vermaelen will step into the breach. Van Gaal doesn’t tend to get much wrong, by all accounts, so it will be fascinating to see what kind of impact Vermaelen makes if and when a fee is agreed.","Vermaelen set for £10m move to Old Trafford from the Gunners .

"A 70-year-old American architect who came to the United Arab Emirates to speak at a conference on creative thinking was arrested last month for taking a photograph of a subject deemed off-limits by authorities, his family has revealed today . Robert Alan Black, from Athens, Georgia, is the latest foreigner to be arrested for breaking laws limiting what can be photographed in the oil-rich Gulf country. The country is an important American ally that boasts cutting-edge architecture, including a vertical disc-shaped office building and the world's tallest tower. Black's daughter, Jessica Beasley, said she is concerned about her father's health in jail and believes any inappropriate pictures that the Athens, Georgia, man may have taken were unintentional. Robert Alan Black, 70, has been held in a jail in Abu Dhabi since October 21 after he was arrested for allegedly taking pictures of a restricted building . She said she spoke to him by phone twice briefly since his arrest on October 21. 'He took a photo where he was not supposed to. He's very remorseful,' she said her father told her from al-Wathba prison in the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. Black is an architect by training and is an avid photographer of buildings, said friend Rosemary Rein. She and Black were in Abu Dhabi to speak at the Creative Thinkers Conference. He suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, Beasley said. She said an American consular official has visited him and confirmed he is receiving medical treatment. The US Embassy was unable to comment on the case Monday due to privacy limitations. Abu Dhabi police officials could not immediately be reached for comment. A number of foreigners have been prosecuted by a state security court in recent years for taking pictures of subjects deemed prohibited by Emirati authorities, such as palaces or embassies. Disappeared: Mr Black is being held at l-Wathba prison in the Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. He was snatched off the street without notification given to US authorities or his family . In several cases, the defendants denied knowingly breaking the law or said they were intending to photograph a nearby structure rather than the prohibited facility. Photographing or filming restricted areas can be punishable by fines and jail time under Emirati law. Family and friends don't know what charges Black could face or when his case will be heard, and he has yet to see an attorney, Rein said. An Emirati court last year sentenced eight people, including an American, to up to a year in prison for their role in producing a satirical video about youth culture in Dubai that prosecutors said defamed the country's image. The American, Shezanne Cassim, was released within weeks of the verdict, after having already serving nine months behind bars.","Robert Alan Black was in the United Arab Emirates to speak at a conference on creative thinking .

"The Faraway Tree books by Enid Blyton are to be brought to the big screen by Oscar-winning director, Sam Mendes. The stories about a group of children and their adventures in a gigantic tree in a magical forest captivated generations of British children, and Mendes is hoping a film of their tales will bring Blyton's magic to the cinema. His firm Neal Street Productions, whose credits include Call The Midwife and the Oscar-nominated Revolutionary Road, will make a live action film based on the four books, written between 1939 and 1951. Enid Blyton's much-loved Faraway Tree stories will be made into a film by Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes . Mendes will oversee work on the film of the Faraway Tree books, which Blyton wrote between 1939 and 1951 . Blyton's series of four novels, The Enchanted Wood, The Magic Faraway Tree, The Folk Of The Faraway Tree, and Up The Faraway Tree, are based around the tree, which is tall enough to reach the clouds and home to small houses. Pippa Harris from Neal Street Productions, which last year brought Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory to London's West End, said: 'The Magic Faraway Tree is one of the most loved children's books series from an iconic author whose work has been adored by generations. 'To be able to adapt these for the big screen is incredibly exciting.' Blyton, best known for her Famous Five and Secret Seven books, died in 1968 but her books have remained popular and have sold more than 500 million copies and been translated into more than 40 languages. Marlene Johnson, of the Enid Blyton Estate, said: 'Enid Blyton was a passionate advocate of children's storytelling, and The Magic Faraway Tree is a fantastic example of her creative imagination. 'It's a much loved title, so we're very excited to announce we've signed an option agreement for development of The Magic Faraway Tree film with Neal Street Productions. The James Bond film Skyfall, with Daniel Craig, was directed by Mendes, who's now working on the next one . 'Many generations have grown up with The Magic Faraway Tree and today's news provides a great chance to share the wonder of these stories through a new medium.' Mendes, who was married to Kate Winslet, by whom he has a ten-year-old son, directed the most recent James Bond film, Skyfall, starring Daniel Craig.  He is currently directing the 24th Bond film, which is due for release next year. The British director, who is dating actress Rebecca Hall, won a Best Director Oscar and Golden Globe for American Beauty, which came out in 1999.","Mendes, who won Oscar for American Beauty, has acquired rights to series .

"A widow has claimed doctors put her terminally ill husband on an 'end of life pathway' without telling her, denying her the chance to share his final days with him. Liz Watson, whose husband George was admitted to a Marie Curie Hospice for respite care, hit out at doctors after his condition deteriorated rapidly. She says Mr Watson was the 'love of her live' and 'didn't deserve to die like he did' on the pathway, which sometimes involves depriving patients of food and water. Liz Watson, from Edinburgh said doctors put her husband George - the 'love of her life' - on an end of life pathway without her knowledge . Mrs Watson said she would never have agreed to the care plan, which she likened to a 'concentration camp', and wanted to spend more time with her husband . Mr Watson was diagnosed with a brain tumour 17 months before he was admitted to the hospice from which he never came home . Mr Watson was diagnosed with a brain tumour 17 months before he was admitted to the hospice. from which he never came home. His family said the 64-year-old from Liberton in Edinburgh was going shopping and 'eating three-course meals' before he rapidly declined in the centre in Fairmilehead. Mrs Watson said she only realised George was on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway - which involves withdrawal of medication, food and fluids - when her mother recognised the signs. She said she would never have agreed to the care plan, which she likened to a 'concentration camp', and wanted to spend more time with her husband. She said: 'When I realised what they had done to my husband and put him on that Liverpool Care Pathway, I was hysterical. 'I am not a stupid person but I never put two and two together. They made out that they went through it with me but I would never have let my husband go on anything like that. The Liverpool Care Pathway, originally designed to ensure dignified and pain-free dying, was scrapped last year after a scathing independent inquiry found that it had meant ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ treatment of the most vulnerable hospital patients. In some cases, patients were denied water as they died. Under the Pathway, doctors and nurses decided when a patient was about to die. Commonly, a syringe driver would pump them with sedatives, while tubes giving food and water were detached. Death would follow, typically within 36 hours. The inquiry was called after leading medical figures condemned the system as a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, and thousands of families of patients who had died complained. New rules for the care of patients thought to be near the end of their lives will forbid hospitals from deciding that someone is dying and then speeding their end by drugging them and removing tubes giving them food and water. Instead, there must be regular reviews of treatment in all cases, dying patients and their families must be kept informed and involved in decisions, and treatment will be ‘tailored to the individual’. Hospitals will be told to appoint independent assessors to decide on complaints in ‘serious or untoward incidents’. 'My husband was on it for four days. I called that place a concentration camp, depriving him of food and water. 'I was taking him in some ice lollies and he was so thirsty he nearly ate the stick. 'He couldn't talk but he knew what was happening. 'I would tell him to blink with his eyes when I asked him things like if he was thirsty, he could hear everything that was going on. 'He was crying and I would say,""I'm so sorry George that I didn't get you out of this place"". It was too late by then.' Mr Watson worked as a homeless warden for Edinburgh City Council, while his wife worked in the care industry for 30 years. He was diagnosed with the aggressive tumour in March 2012 before undergoing surgery to remove the growth. He then went through several gruelling sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. A few months later, the couple of 15 years were finally married at the Apex Hotel, on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh. But just six months later doctors delivered the devastating news that the cancer had spread to the other side of his brain. Mrs Watson, who had taken nine months off work to look after him, agreed to respite care, believing he would return home within days. But on August 10, 2013 - three weeks later - he died. Medical notes showed doctors started Mr Watson's end of life treatment at 11am on August 6 and were supposed to discuss it with family at 4pm - which Mrs Watson maintains 'never happened'. She said the standard of nursing he received before that date was 'atrocious', as he even had two falls while staying there. A later inspection by Healthcare Improvement Scotland upheld several complaints about care standards, including poor communication about his worsening condition, and made a list of recommendations. The couple had been together 15 years before they married at the Apex Hotel, on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh . But following a recent unannounced inspection last month, it was found many improvements had still not been carried out. The watchdog made five requirements and 11 recommendations that must be addressed 'as a matter of priority'. Mr Watson's stepdaughter, Kelly Macmillan, 33, who also worked in residential care, said the experience had left her mother 'shattered'. She said: 'It was so distressing to see how quickly he deteriorated in there.' Marie Curie said it was unable to comment on care relating to an individual patient. A spokeswoman for NHS Lothian said: 'Like every health board in Scotland, NHS Lothian is following Scottish Government guidance on the Liverpool Care Pathway and phasing it out.' But Mrs Watson said the changes were too late for her husband, adding: 'He didn't deserve to die like he did. 'He was the love of my life. I don't think it's something I will ever be able to get over.' Mr Watson was treated at the Marie Curie Hospice in Edinburgh.

"A 13-year-old schoolboy raped his eight-year-old sister after watching pornography on an X-Box computer console, a court has heard. The teenager told police he used the games console to view explicit material before he 'decided to try it out'. The boy said he targeted his younger sister because she was small and 'couldn't remember stuff'. Pornography: The boy used his X-Box console to view adult material before 'deciding to try it out' on his sister because she was small and 'couldn't remember stuff' (file picture) At Blackburn Magistrates Court yesterday the boy admitted rape, indecent assault and inciting his sister to perform a sexual act on him. The youngster, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, has been bailed to live with relatives away from his sister while a pre-sentence report is being prepared. Fiona Elvines, from the Rape Crisis Charity, said that children accessing pornography was a ‘growing concern’. She said: 'This is going to completely destabilise this little girl’s life. 'It will take her a very long time to try and work through. It will have put her life on a different track and I do not want that to happen to anybody else.' Ms Elvines told the Lancashire Telegraph 'For a long time, people have been sitting on the fence and saying we do not have the evidence to say porn is harmful, but now we are starting to have some evidence around young people’s exposure. 'How much evidence do you need? It shows that the government’s measures are extremely important and that we need to start acting. 'When children see porn, they have no context for what it is used for. There is pressure on children to be sexualised, particularly on younger boys, to start having sex. 'It is coming from peers and porn.' Ban: The Government has said that by the end of 2014 users of all internet devices - including games consoles and computers - will be automatically blocked from viewing adult content . The youngster has now been sent to live with relatives away from his sister before he is sentenced at Blackburn Magistrates Court (pictured) The government has said that by the end of 2014 all devices with access to the internet will be blocked from accessing pornography, with users forced to opt in. The X-Box customer support website says explicit content and internet access can be restricted using parental controls. Microsoft, the company which makes the console, said: 'We have the greatest sympathy for all involved in this case. 'At Microsoft we have some of the most robust systems that allow parents to control what their children play and watch online. 'For example, access to the internet is switched off automatically for all child accounts on X-box, and we urge parents to review the settings on their children’s consoles.' In November last year a 12-year-old boy admitted three charges of rape against his sister, aged under 10, after he watched pornography at school and went home to copy what he had seen. The abuse took place over the course of a year and was only discovered after the girl confided in a family member. The boy was given a three-year youth rehabilitation order and will continue to live at the family home. He was ordered to register as a sex offender for two-and-a-half years.","Boy, 13, chose sister because she was small and 'couldn't remember stuff'
