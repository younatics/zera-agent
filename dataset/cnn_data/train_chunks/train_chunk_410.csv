"Moments after breastfeeding her baby, Didiatou Hassam was shot in the head. Packed into a truck with about 60 other men, women and children, she was on her way to long hoped-for safety when the militants emerged, guns spitting bullets, from the thick jungle of the Central African Republic. Hers wasn't the only life lost to the attackers. A man named Issa Lumbi, traveling with his wife, brother and son, was also shot and killed in a separate ambush. Our truck was No. 9 in a convoy of 20 carrying some 1,300 Muslims fleeing the ethnic violence tearing the country apart. The convoy had set off from the capital, Bangui, two days earlier. Its passengers, many carrying amulets intended to protect the wearer from danger, perched atop piles of mats, sacks and pieces of wood, the sides of the truck festooned with brightly colored water containers. The long line of trucks was headed up north, snaking its way 375 miles across the country on a hard, dangerous journey from the tropical Central African forest to the open savannah bordering Chad. The journey was not made by choice. Bitter fighting between Muslim and Christian militia groups since a coup last year has claimed many lives and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. But after four months trapped in a 500-meter stretch of road by a mosque in Bangui, under threat from the militia groups roaming nearby, it offered these families a chance at freedom from what had become an open-air prison. Riding on the truck with them promised to give a close-up view of the dangers they faced en route. Too risky to stop . As the bullets crack through the air, all of us on truck No. 9 duck down, trying to cover our heads. A man with blood on his shirt stands up after the shooting. He is calling for help -- some of the people are injured. But for a while the huge convoy keeps on going. It is simply too risky to stop. The breastfeeding mother is now dying at the man's feet. The convoy eventually halts. About 10 minutes after it stops, a military doctor finally reaches her. He has been traveling with the Rwandan military escort provided by the African-led International Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA). Its vehicles are scattered through the convoy but cannot cover the whole strung-out line of trucks as it rumbles along the red dirt road. The attackers, meanwhile, have melted back into the forest. The Rwandan flag carried by the MISCA soldiers is a reminder of the slaughter that scarred their homeland two decades ago. Now they witness another African nation collapsing amid ethnic division. The doctor tends to several people who were injured but Didiatou, although still breathing, is mortally wounded. Someone removes the amulet she has attached to her waist. When they bundle her onto a mat and move her from one side of the truck to the other, the women, children and an old man nearby cover their faces and let out cries. In addition to the baby, she was traveling with another daughter, aged perhaps seven or eight. The other women on the truck, heads covered and dressed in bold, printed fabrics, take over the care of the two children. The ambush came around midday. Didiatou's body remains in the truck for the next six hours and is buried when the convoy stops for the night in Kaga-Bandoro.  Also buried is Issa Lumba, who was killed in front of his family in a second attack, presumably by the same militiamen, on a vehicle further back in the convoy. Only in Kaga-Bandoro, where the convoy can move into a MISCA compound, can all the passengers climb down from the trucks for the first time in two days. Joy turns to shock . The ambush was all the crueler because just a few minutes earlier, the convoy had reached Dekoa -- the first area controlled by the Seleka, a predominantly Muslim group. As the convoy of displaced Muslims passed through, the first Muslim militiamen appeared, welcoming them with cheers and waves. ""We are safe now, no more worries,"" Mohamad said, smiling, as he greeted the militiamen from his perch on top of truck No. 9. ""The worst is behind,"" he said, meaning the 185 miles of road dotted with hostile anti-balaka, as the Christian militia are known, in our wake. But the joy didn't last long. Dekoa is currently one of the ""hot areas"" in the country's savage inter-communal conflict -- and the Christian militia were lying in wait for the convoy outside the town. After the shock of the ambush lay more long miles of travel fraught with hardship and peril. The convoy spent a third night in Kabo, where some passengers left to join family members or to settle in a newly created camp for internally displaced persons. The last day ended at another such camp near the town of Moyen Sido, just shy of the border with Chad. Five babies were born en route, including two sets of twins. After four days on the road, there was no food to greet the new arrivals. Genocide fears . The country began its descent into chaos in March 2013, after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels known as Seleka ousted President Francois Bozize. They have since been forced from power, but Christian and Muslim militias have continued to battle for control. To counter attacks on Christian communities by Seleka groups, the vigilante groups known as the anti-balaka, which translates to ""anti-machete,"" fought back. As the situation has spiraled out of control, life in an already dirt-poor, unstable country has only become more hazardous. At least 2,000 people have died in the fighting, and 2.2 million others -- about half the country's population -- need humanitarian aid, according to the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced both within the country and beyond its borders. The continuing violence has raised the specter of genocide, as occurred 20 years ago in Rwanda. ""Do not repeat the mistakes of the past -- heed the lessons,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said last month on a visit to Bangui. As communities have fractured, Christian and Muslim minorities have become increasingly threatened. Aid workers have also been caught up in the violence. The medical charity Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, said this week it is reducing its operations in the country for at least a week after an attack on staff, patients and local authorities in one of its hospitals left 16 civilians dead. 'They will regret it' The 1,300-strong group that left Bangui on April 27 had been trapped in an area of the capital known as PK12 for the previous four months. Surrounded by anti-balaka militia members, they couldn't venture out to seek food or medical help, and were killed if they were caught leaving the area. Even within the enclave, they were subject to grenade attacks and shootings. In response to their pleas for help, the convoy to the north was organized by the International Organization for Migration and other NGOs. Now only one Muslim enclave remains in Bangui: PK5, where clashes, incidents and violence occur almost every day. The capital is not the only place where isolated ethnic groups now live in fear. While Muslims are under threat in the south-west, in the north-east it's Muslim militias who rule and the Christians who are targeted. The mayor of Bangui, Catherine Samba-Panza, was installed as interim president earlier this year. But the prospect of restoring peace to the country seems to be receding with each new attack. While international peacekeeping forces are in the country -- some 6,000 African Union troops and 2,000 French forces, as well as the first contingent of 1,600 European Union troops -- their ability to police remote communities is limited. The United Nations has promised as many as 10,000 military personnel by September 15, which may help expand their operations. But the challenge is great and it may be too late. As a local journalist said, troops may be deployed but the real issue is that of reconciliation among communities. The conflict cannot heal without the now-divided society coming together. Even as the convoy of Muslims traveled north toward Sido Moyen, many of the men and young people packed onto the trucks spoke freely of their anger and desire for revenge. ""We will be back and they will regret it. We will finish with them. They will regret to have been treating us as animals and have kicked us out of our own country,"" said one 17-year-old civilian. Perhaps he, like others before him, will soon be a Seleka fighter too. The string of terrible atrocities carried out by both Muslim and Christian militias as this violent divorce between communities plays out makes it hard to see a road back.","Some 1,300 Muslims undertake a 375-mile journey from the capital, Bangui, to the north .

"One thing appeared certain when Barnes & Noble announced Thursday how much money its Nook e-readers brought in over the past three months: The news would be lousy. And it was. Revenue from the company's Nook division for its fiscal 2013 third quarter declined 26% from the same period a year ago, primarily as a result of slumping sales of the devices. Is the bookseller just losing ground to rival Amazon and its market-leading line of Kindles? Perhaps. But many tech analysts see something else happening: the booming market for tablet computers is starting to make the dedicated e-reader obsolete. ""It's not that the Nook failed,"" said James McQuivey, a digital analyst at Forrester Research. ""It's that the world of tablets exploded, going faster than anyone expected, putting us in a place where tablets are now a fundamental part of our computing and lifestyle entourage, not just a handy device to consume a bit of media."" Apple rocked the computing world in 2010 with the release of the iPad, introducing the world to the concept of user-friendly tablets. While they already existed in some form, tablets were pretty much unknown to all but the most tech-savvy among us. Since then, all Apple has done is sell more than 120 million of them. Competitors struggled to come up with a worthy alternative until late the next year, when Amazon -- already a leader in the e-reader market -- rolled out its simpler, smaller Kindle Fire, priced at $199, far lower than the iPad. Its relative success not only inspired the launch of devices such as the Google Nexus 7, but it likely nudged Apple into the new midsize tablet market with the iPad Mini. The net effect? Anyone interested in a tablet now probably has a price point with which they'll be comfortable. And tablets, which are priced similarly to top e-readers, also work well for reading e-books. Throw in Internet, apps and e-mail -- all on a full-color tablet screen -- and e-readers suffer by comparison. This trend has been particularly unkind to the Nook. During the quarter that included last year's holiday season, Barnes & Noble's Nook business, which includes e-readers and e-books, suffered a 12.6% sales decline over 2011, bringing in just $311 million. Earlier this month, the company said the Nook-related losses they'll announce Thursday would be even bigger than previously expected. The bad news came despite Barnes & Noble slashing the price of its Nook Simple Touch e-reader in December to $79. Amazon doesn't release detailed sales figures. But the Kindle clearly emerged as the market leader in the past couple of years, after doing neck-and-neck battle with the Nook early on. In the last quarter of 2012, the company said it increased its sale of e-books and other content for Kindles and similar devices by 22% over the same quarter in 2011. But analysts expect that even Amazon's success with dedicated e-readers will fade. ""It's a rough market to compete,"" said Michael Gartenberg, a tech-industry analyst with research firm Gartner Inc. ""On one hand, devices like the iPad dominate the consumer tablet experience which includes reading. On the other hand, less demand for dedicated devices had helped Amazon, which already established a strong brand presence with Kindle as part of a much larger personal-cloud ecosystem."" Amazon has transitioned well into that new world. This holiday season, the new Kindle Fire HD was Amazon's top-selling device in the Kindle line, the company announced. Second? The older, and price-reduced, Kindle Fire. Hands-on with the new Kindles . And unlike Barnes & Noble, which is strongly branded as a bookstore, Amazon has created its own online universe of sales, McQuivey said. ""As part of Barnes & Noble, the Nook is stuck as a media device offered to media consumers when in reality the tablet business is poised for much more than this,"" he said. Many reviewers actually liked Barnes & Noble's response, the Nook Tablet, better than the first-generation Kindle Fire. But, as McQuivey notes, its lack of an expansive ecosystem hurt it. When the first wave of tablets hit the market, three years after the first Kindle and a year after the Nook, e-readers could still boast a significantly better reading experience. E-ink felt significantly more like printed text than a sometimes glare-prone tablet screen, which was difficult to read in bright sunlight. But now, every one of the major tablet makers boasts high-definition screens that ratchet up not just the quality of video and snazzy graphics but the way text appears in reading apps. The general consensus among observers is that they haven't caught up to the dedicated e-readers in text quality quite yet, but give them time. ""If you love reading and are looking to invest a chunk of money into a device as a dedicated e-reader, then the iPad is not your best bet,"" Cesar Torres, of CNN content partner ArsTechnica, wrote last year in a review comparing the third-generation iPad to e-readers such as the third-generation Kindle. (That iPad has the same screen as the most recent one). ""The value you can get from devices like the Kindle (or several other competitors like the Sony Reader or Kobo), will allow you to save money to spend on what is presumably your main passion: books."" But for folks wanting a more complete computing experience, he wrote, the difference was already negligible. ""The trouble comes when you start to think of your e-reader as more than an e-reader,"" he wrote. ""E-ink Kindles are abysmal at Web browsing, for example, and they don't run popular apps and games like the iPad and other tablets on the market today. ""There are other types of reading, like webpages and magazines, that matter just as much as books to many readers, too. For those needs, an iPad's retina display will display images and text like a champ."" So, is there any future for dedicated e-readers? McQuivey says that as Amazon continues to establish itself as an Internet clearinghouse for all sorts of goods (both physical and digital), the Nook, which got a $300 million infusion from Microsoft last year, could look to selling textbooks and other educational tools. A rumored plan to split the e-book division off from Barnes & Noble's brick-and-mortar stores could come as early as Thursday and would be a perfect jumping-off point, he said. ""All the more reason for Nook to separate from Barnes & Noble, turning to its investment partners like Microsoft and Pearson and saying, 'Let's see how far we can take this platform into productivity and education,' "" he said. ""Of course there's risk there, but there was risk in getting into the tablet business.""","As tablet sales skyrocket, dedicated e-readers have suffered .

"The Rijksmuseum, home to one of the world's most celebrated collections of art and historical artifacts reopened Saturday after a 10-year, $489 million rebuilding project which saw many of its treasures travel the world while the gallery was closed. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands performed the opening ceremony in Amsterdam, one of her final official duties before she abdicates at the end of the month. Once open, the Rijksmuseum will welcome visitors 365 days a year. Thousands attended the ceremony and poured into the museum, eager to reacquaint themselves with old favorites including Rembrandt's ""Night Watch,"" Vermeer's ""Milkmaid,"" and Frans Hals' ""Merry Drinker,"" or to catch a glimpse of new highlights: An Yves Saint Laurent ""Mondrian"" dress, a 16th Century sculpture of the ""Mater Dolorosa,"" or a war plane dating to 1917. Interactive: Explore Rembrandt's 'Night Watch' ""It is the beginning of a new era, an exciting new future for a new museum, the museum of the Netherlands,"" says Rijksmuseum director Wim Pijbes. ""Everything is new. ""Everything has changed, the only thing that hasn't is 'The Night Watch'. It is the altarpiece of the Rijksmuseum, and the whole place is arranged around this beautiful masterpiece."" The new chronological displays place paintings and historical objects alongside each other ""to give context,"" says Pieter Roelofs, curator of 17th century art at the museum. The aim, he says, is ""to tell stories, to tell the story of Dutch history and culture."" ""We want to give visitors a sense of time, and a sense of beauty,"" says Taco Dibbets, director of collections. ""When you enter the Rijksmuseum, you are transported into another world -- the world of Rembrandt, of Vermeer and of Mondrian."" The renovation has seen some parts of the gallery, designed by Pierre Cuypers, restored to their former glory. The original entrance hall's opulent stained glass and wall paintings, considered so cathedral-like they sparked protests in fiercely Protestant Amsterdam in 1885, are back. The four-story library, featuring ornate ironwork, a vertiginous spiral staircase and 5.4km (3 miles) of bookshelves, is open to the public for the first time. But huge swathes of the gallery have been radically modernized -- Spanish architects Cruz y Ortiz have stripped out the makeshift galleries installed in the museum's courtyards over the decades. In their place is a huge, bright and airy atrium. Interior architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte has overseen the removal of all potentially distracting elements from the galleries: Gone are the colored walls, heavy drapes and gloomy display cabinets. Instead the jewel-like paintings are hung on minimalist gray walls, priceless items are displayed in ultra-clear glass boxess. If glass boxes are not absolutely necessary, we don't use them,"" insists Roelofs. The whole collection is illuminated with the latest LED lighting. But while the displays themselves are the height of modernity, there is one 21st Century touch missing from the galleries: ""There are no video screens and no computer screens in the galleries,"" says Dibbits. ""We believe the works of art should speak for themselves."" In any case, the experts say, most visitors interested in a high-tech view of the collection will have smartphones or tablets with which to access the Rijksmuseum's new website. While the main museum was under reconstruction, some of its best-known artworks, including ""The Night Watch"" were kept on display in a small annexe. Others were lent to exhibitions around the world, from Los Angeles and Vancouver, to Sao Paulo, and to Sendai, after the 2011 Japanese earthquake.","Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum reopens after a 10-year, $489 million rebuilding project .

"It's something you don't often hear from the leaders of a terrorist group known for violence: We're sorry. But that's just what the head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula said in a video message Sunday, apologizing for a hospital attack in Sanaa earlier this month that left dozens of people dead. The attackers were directed not to assault the hospital or mosque in an attack against a Yemeni Ministry of Defense compound on December 5, but one fighter made a mistake and attacked the hospital, leader Qassim Al-Raimi says in the video. ""We confess to this mistake and fault. We offer our apologies and condolences to the families of the victims,"" Raimi said in the video, which was published by al Qaeda media outlet Al-Malahim. ""We did not want your lost ones; we did not target them on purpose. This is not of our religion or our morals."" It's unusual to see ""such a direct, fast, public apology"" from al Qaeda, CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said. ""Al Qaeda leaders seem to be waking up to the fact that if they position themselves as the defenders of Muslims, their large-scale killing of Muslim civilians needs to stop,"" Bergen said. The apology comes after Yemeni government officials released surveillance video showing the hospital under attack. The surveillance footage showed patients nervously looking out of the hospital windows, then running after an explosion. In another clip, patients and staff huddle in a hallway. They watch as an attacker walks calmly toward them, activates an explosive and lobs it in their direction. ""We saw what the Yemeni channel broadcast: a gunman entering a hospital . ... We did not order him to do so, and we are not pleased with what he did,"" Raimi said. ""Moreover, it wronged us and pained us, because we do not fight in this manner."" The U.S. government has designated al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula as a foreign terrorist organization and says the group has orchestrated ""numerous high-profile terrorist attacks."" Sunday's apology, though rare, isn't the first time al Qaeda or its affiliates have apologized. In November, Syrian rebels with al Qaeda ties apologized for mistakenly beheading a wounded rebel fighter after assuming he supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. In 2009, an al Qaeda spokesman released a video message offering condolences to ""unintended Muslim victims"" killed in attacks. And in 2007, Bergen said, former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden said that Muslim victims killed by al Qaeda in Iraq ""are not the intended targets."" Behind the scenes, Bergen said, leaders of the group have expressed concerns about the impact such attacks would have on the group's reputation. ""We know from the documents recovered at the bin Laden compound in Abbottabad by U.S. Navy SEALS in May 2011, al Qaeda's leaders were often writing to each other privately and also to groups they are associated with about the need to minimize civilian (Muslim) casualties and often wrote about the damage to the al Qaeda brand that killing civilians had achieved by al Qaeda operations in Iraq,"" Bergen said. ""But the straightforward public apology ... is a new development."" In Sunday's message, Raimi said the group would financially compensate families of victims in the hospital attack. But the militant leader also stressed that the group's fighters wouldn't shy away from going after targets that have ties to American drones. That's why they hit the Defense Ministry compound that day, he said. Since the attack, Yemeni government officials have repeatedly stated there are no drone operations based at the compound. Raimi said places that help American drones by spying, providing information or offering intelligence are legitimate targets. ""We have a long list of these places. In case they continue, we will continue. We will reach them, because we defend ourselves,"" he said. ""We made a mistake. We accept responsibility and we are continuing with our Jihad.""","The head of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula apologizes for a hospital attack .

"An 11-year-old boy's rendition of the national anthem at Game 3 of the NBA finals brought the usual appreciative applause Tuesday, but outside AT&T Center in San Antonio, his performance brought a darker reaction from some posters on social media -- and eventually an online backlash against their racist comments. See the performance by Sebastien De La Cruz . Here's a sampling of some of the unkind tweets that went flying around the Internet about Sebastien de la Cruz: . -- ""Why they got a Mexican kid singing the national anthem -___-"" from Daniel Gilmore. -- ""How you singing the national anthem looking like an illegal immigrant"" from Andre Lacey, proud father and firefighter from Augusta, Georgia. -- ""Why is a foreigner singing the national anthem. I realize that's San Antonio but that still ain't Mexico"" from Lewie Groh. -- ""Who let this illegal alien sing our national anthem?"" from Matt Cyrus. And the list went on and on. As for Sebastien, he said the racist comments have not fazed him. ""For those that said something bad about me, I understand it's your opinion,"" said Sebastien to CNN. ""I'm a proud American and live in a free country. It's not hurting me. It's just your opinion."" Sebastien has been singing since he was 5 but gained fame in 2012 after being on NBC's ""America's Got Talent"" for singing his mariachi ballads with hopes of winning to help his younger brother get surgery for his hearing problem. Juan de la Cruz, Sebastien's father, hasn't taken the negative comments personally at all. ""When he was on 'America's Got Talent,' he faced racism there, too. You can't satisfy everyone,"" said de la Cruz to CNN. ""I think people reacted the way they did because Sebastien was wearing his mariachi outfit,"" said de la Cruz, ""But, it doesn't make sense to listen to those people when most of the feedback we have gotten is positive. San Antonio supports Sebastien."" A collection of the negative tweets was posted on Public Shaming, a Tumblr blog dedicated to outing and shaming racists' social media  posts. Other media outlets used that post as the foundation for the story, and the story took off from there. The blog highlighted 28 tweets from NBA fans who came off as offended and ashamed that the Spurs would allow the boy, who happened to have been born and raised in San Antonio, to sing the nation's anthem. However, Public Shaming must have suspected what would happen once the racist tweets were posted because most of the Twitter handles have been deactivated or the tweet has been removed. The blog posted screen shots of the tweets so it could continue to display the public microbloggers' rants. After the harsh reaction spread across the Internet, tweets supporting and defending Sebastien and vociferously denouncing his critics started to take over: . -- ""That little 10 year old mariachi National Anthem singer has more talent and grace than the combined racist pig idiots on Twitter,"" from Mexican-American cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz . -- ""Racist scumbag says Chicano kid singing nat'l anthem just ""snuck into the country."" This idiot's apparently of color too. @A2daO,"" from Laura Gonzalez, a Chicana Santa Rosa City Schools board member and middle school teacher. -- ""Why are ppl so upset over a Hispanic singing the national anthem. He's probably got more roots in here than most 'Americans',"" said Amanda Aguirre on Twitter. -- And, from the American Latino Museum, ""We're proud of the 11-year old San Anto-native Sebastien de la Cruz for his amazing performance last night!"" San Antonio is a multicultural city with more than 55% of the population being Hispanic and 90% of those people identifying themselves as Mexican according to the Pew Hispanic Center. For some Mexican-Americans, the incident was just the latest sign of a persistent problem they face: being treated as outsiders in their own country. ""To see people acting this way doesn't make sense anymore. It's a demographic fact that the country is changing and Latinos are going to be behind that economic push that moves everyone forward,"" said Chon Noriega, director of the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, to CNN. ""Cities like San Antonio are defining a trend of a nation."" That the word ""Mexican"" is being used as a derogatory term is part of the problem, said Noriega, ""It's become the N-word of Mexican descent. Yet it's also the name of a group of people in a neighboring country."" It will take a lot more than some racist tweets to bring Sebastien down. The ""boy with the golden voice"" tweeted earlier today: ""Please do not pay attention to the negative people. I am an American living the American Dream. This is part of the American life."" Sebastien said today was like any other day, but he's always grateful to wake up to yet another day able to sing. He said he owes his positive outlook to his parents, family and everyone in San Antonio. See how Sebastien is handling the reaction . Follow Cindy Y.

"When you think of refugees, you may think of huddled masses, tired and poor. But those aren't the only types of people fleeing Syria.

Syrians have fled their homeland in droves since its civil war began nearly two years ago.

""We do not know when it will stop,"" Andrew Harper, the UNHCR chief in Jordan said Thursday. ""We are seeing quadruple the numbers we were seeing two weeks ago.""

The Anadolu news agency said Turkey delivered new toys Thursday to 4,500 children living in a tent city in Nizip. And the state-run news agency TRT reported that, in addition to public and private groups sending food to displaced Syrians, some secondary school students have been donating ""part of their allowances.""

Syrian state television said Thursday the Assad regime was trying to help the refugees as well. The TV station flashed an ""urgent"" banner, which translates as, ""Based on the political program to resolve the crisis in Syria, the Interior Ministry is calling on the Syrian citizens who crossed the border illegally or legally to come back to the country, and all the necessary measures to resolve their situation will be available to them.""

"(CNN) -- Two unmanned NASA spacecraft reached the moon's orbit Tuesday morning and began the process of mapping its surface for future missions. An unmanned NASA spacecraft captured this image of the moon from about 5,000 miles away Tuesday. The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a satellite whose instruments will help scientists compile high resolution, three-dimensional maps of the moon's surface, entered lunar orbit at 6:27 a.m. ET. About two hours later, the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Spacecraft (LCROSS) swung past the moon on its way into an elongated Earth orbit. The spacecraft sent streaming video back to Earth, shown on a NASA Web site, for an hour as it passed the moon. The two spacecraft lifted off June 18 atop the same Atlas V rocket. The mission is the first in NASA's plan to return to the moon, then travel to Mars and beyond, the space agency said. During the mission, the agency will collect all sorts of data, including day-night temperature maps, NASA said. There is particular emphasis on the polar areas of the moon, where sunlight is more plentiful and where water might exist. The LCROSS is scheduled to crash land on the moon Oct. 9 to search for the presence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater at the moon's South Pole. The data that the LRO collects and sends to Earth also will be used in planning an eventual lunar outpost, the agency said. During its mission, the orbiter also will spend at least a year looking for potential landing sites for astronauts.","Two unmanned NASA space probes reach the moon's orbit Tuesday morning .

"The headlines and blogs are all abuzz with the latest news:   If a driver who's texting gets in an accident and you sent the text, you can be arrested! Terrible, right? Actually, it's not true, despite what you may have been told by people who have seen two episodes of some lawyer show and think they are qualified to be legal analysts. Such ignorance about the law feeds misinformation that grows on itself, doubles back and makes us all dumber. For people like me, lawyers, that is a wonderful thing.  Why? Because people who have no idea what they are talking about wind up making simple legal situations complicated, ramping up the billable hours for all of us. Remember the McDonald's hot-coffee lawsuit? That case, maligned from coast to coast, stands in the public mind as the one that says, ""If you are stupid enough to spill hot coffee on yourself, you deserve hundreds of millions of dollars."" Anyone who knows anything about the law will tell you that the real ruling came down for the plaintiff because McDonald's had been warned time and again that it was going to hurt somebody if it didn't do something about the  scalding temperature at which it served its coffee. But, in the name of more profits, it ignored the warnings. Even thereafter, McDonalds had the opportunity to pay the 81-year-old woman's medical bills -- she was seriously injured, with third-degree burns -- but it acted arrogantly. McDonald's did something wrong. When it was called to task for it, the punishment had to fit the defendant. Fining McDonalds $1,000 just wasn't going to do it. Hitting McDonalds with a huge multimillion-dollar settlement? That did it. (The injured woman's $2.86 million jury award was later reduced, however, by a judge to $640,000.) So what has that  to do with the New Jersey texting case? The New Jersey texting case will likely lead to more boneheads who get their legal acumen from ""My Cousin Vinny"" expounding on its meaning. This chorus shrieks that the New Jersey decision makes you liable for sending a text.  But the court actually held that the person doing the texting was not liable in this instance. The court held that theoretically, someone could be held liable for sending a text to a driver. But the ruling was very clear, and very, very limited: . ""We hold that the sender of a text message could potentially be liable if an accident is caused by texting but only if the sender knew or had special reason to know that the recipient would view the text while driving and thus be distracted."" In other words, yes, you can be held responsible if you cause an accident by sending a text message. But only if you knew that the recipient would look at the text message while driving. If you had any reason to have any doubt in your mind, then you will likely not be held liable. So if you send a text message to someone, you don't need to call your lawyer or your insurance company. But if you send someone a text message and they respond back ""driving, leave me alone"" and then you keep sending text messages, perhaps you might be found liable. The only thing that is certain is that this case, which makes plenty of sense, will serve to continue to allow the common law to grow, while those who would like to bring ignorance to our knowledge of the legal system will continue to succeed.","Marc Randazza: Buzz on New Jersey texting ruling leaves wrong impression .

"A massacre. A kid. A videotaped ""manifesto."" As the news broke, inevitably, the discussion turned to the Second Amendment. But as I watched the killer's video, questions about the First Amendment began to rise. What are Elliot Rodger's post-mortem First Amendment rights? Does his screed belong in the marketplace of ideas? What about those who capitalized on it? Where does the First Amendment leave off and ethics begin? The video was initially on YouTube, which immediately -- and presumably automatically -- used it as an opportunity to sell adwords. That struck some people as distasteful. After all, Google -- which owns YouTube -- has the unofficial credo ""Don't be evil."" Profiting from the hateful ravings of a mass murderer might easily be described as evil. Let's cut the Internet giant some slack -- it places such ads automatically on all videos. But one would hope that Google, realizing it was profiting from the words of a mass murderer, might decide the ad sales weren't worth it. On the other hand, Google isn't a public service, it is a business, and if we want that video to be on the Internet, someone has to pay for the bandwidth. That raises the question whether the video should be on the Internet at all. Some credible scholars say that making mass murderers famous motivates other mass murderers. (One might even argue that this article is part of the problem). Elliot Rodger sent his lengthy diatribe to the media before he went on his killing spree -- correctly predicting that his actions would propel his ideas (such as they were) into the marketplace of ideas on a digital billboard larger than he could ever have enjoyed had he not amplified them with his psychotic rampage. Accordingly, should we not silence him? Wipe his words from the Internet forever? Let him be forgotten? There is a counter-argument -- let's let everyone see him for what he was -- a pathetic figure, worthy of no respect or pity.  Let him stand as a negative example. We allow ""Mein Kampf"" to be published and even study it. But what of those who believe Rodger is a positive example? Sickeningly enough, some expressed admiration for what he did, as there will always be people who glorify the worst among us. While the overwhelming view is one of horror and disgust, some people put up a Facebook page praising him. As much as I disagree with that view, my beliefs are strong enough that I can tolerate theirs. Some might say that such a perspective must be purged. The First Amendment would find such a purge to be intolerable -- if enforced by the government or force of law. The First Amendment is there to protect unpopular beliefs, and the marketplace of ideas should be open to this -- and I would hope that none would visit the stall in the marketplace to buy them. That, however, ignores the issue of ethics. I have a blog. If someone wanted to glorify Rodger on my blog, I would say ""my blog, my rules,"" and I would not tolerate it. That would not be a First Amendment violation. In fact, the right not to speak is as precious as the right to speak. Let's say that Rodger's supporters went from website to website and were met with rejection at every corner. Their ideas would, theoretically, die out -- but they would die a natural death, condemned by a lack of nourishment in the marketplace of ideas. Facebook initially was confronted with this dilemma; when people began to protest about the pro-Rodger page, the company allegedly took the all-too-common position we hear from arrogant tech companies: They didn't have to take it down, so they wouldn't. Facebook was completely within its legal rights to take that position -- but what an ethically bankrupt decision! Only when pressure became too great did Facebook seem to cave in to public opinion. The apparently belated reversal of position was hypocritical at best. If Facebook wants to be an anything-goes-and-we-don't-care company, then it should have let the page be. Otherwise, the company could have taken the position that it would not allow such filth on its digital real estate. Either position would have been completely within its rights. But braying ""free speech"" only until it couldn't stand the heat from that decision? Shame on Facebook. What this story shows us is not so much that our notions of free speech should be strong, but there is room for free speech and ethics. The First Amendment allows us to publish Elliot Rodger's rant and his video. The First Amendment protects our right to criticize him, to pity him, to hate him, or even to declare him a hero. But, just as with any rights, what we can do and what we should do may not be the same thing. I would hope that we will not forget that, and that the online giants might begin to learn it.","Marc Randazza: Shooter's video rant is legal to post, but is it ethical?

"(CNN) -- Humberto Leal Garcia Jr., a Mexican national convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl in 1994, was executed by lethal injection Thursday evening in Texas. The case's flurry of legal appeals and pleas for clemency were prompted by an international dispute over the rights of the foreign-born on American death rows. The Supreme Court earlier denied a stay of execution for the convicted killer, despite opposition from the Obama administration and the Mexican government. Leal was pronounced dead at 6:21 p.m. CT (7:21 p.m. ET), according to a corrections spokeswoman. ""I am sorry for everything I have done,"" Leal said at the Huntsville facility before he was executed. ""I have hurt a lot of people. Let this be final and be done. I take the full blame for this."" Leal then shouted ""Viva Mexico,"" followed by ""I'm ready warden, let's get the show on the road."" His last meal consisted of fried chicken, pico de gallo, tacos, two colas and a bowl of fried okra. What made Leal's conviction unusual was that he was not informed about his right to contact the Mexican consulate upon his arrest -- a right guaranteed under a binding international treaty. Leal's appellate lawyers argued such access could at the very least have kept Leal off death row. Mexico strongly condemned the execution, saying it violated an International Court of Justice ruling ordering the United States to review capital convictions of Mexican nationals. Leal, 38, was convicted of raping Adria Sauceda, a 16-year-old girl in San Antonio, and then fatally strangling and bludgeoning her with a 35-pound piece of asphalt in 1994. The Supreme Court justices split 5-4 along conservative-liberal lines in denying a stay of execution. In an unsigned opinion by the majority, the court refused to delay the execution until Congress could pass pending legislation giving federal courts the authority to hear similar claims from foreign inmates. ""We decline to follow the United States' suggestion of granting a stay to allow Leal to bring a claim based on hypothetical legislation when it cannot even bring itself to say that his attempt to overturn his conviction has any prospect of success,"" said the majority. In dissent, four justices led by Stephen Breyer urged a delay in moving ahead with Leal's execution. ""It is difficult to see how the State's interest in the immediate execution of an individual convicted of capital murder 16 years ago can outweigh the considerations that support additional delay, perhaps only until the end of the summer,"" said Breyer, who was supported by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Sandra Babcock, lead appellate attorney, said, ""it is shameful that Mr. Leal will pay the price for our inaction. The need for congressional action to restore our reputation and protect our citizens is more urgent than ever."" ""This case was not just about one Mexican national on death row in Texas,"" Babcock said in a statement. ""The execution of Mr. Leal violates the United States' treaty commitments, threatens the nation's foreign policy interests, and undermines the safety of all Americans abroad."" The state's Board of Pardons and Parole ruled that Leal did not deserve to have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole. The victim's mother, Rachel Terry, had called for the execution. ""A technicality doesn't give anyone a right to come to this country and rape, torture and murder anyone, in this case my daughter,"" she told CNN affiliate KSAT in San Antonio. Terry described her daughter as ""a beautiful, bright, vibrant young woman, full of hope and aspirations."" ""It's been difficult for myself and her family members,"" she added. ""She certainly was taken away from us at a very young age. We just want closure."" Leal's lawyers argued the consulate access violation was more than a technicality. Babcock told CNN that Mexican officials would have ensured Leal had the most competent trial defense possible, if they had been able to speak with him right after his felony arrest. ""I think in most of these cases it was not a deliberate thing. Local police lack training"" on the Vienna Convention, Babcock said, referring to the international agreement that includes consular access. Leal's backers say he had learning disabilities and brain damage, and suffered from sexual abuse at the hands of his parish priest, and that consul officials would have assisted in such a defense. They say those factors should have been considered at the sentencing phase of the trial. Leal claimed he did not learn of his consular access right until two years after his capital conviction. He said he learned of the right not from any official, but from a fellow prisoner. Eventually, between 2010 and 2011, Leal was visited by a representative of the Mexican government more than 10 times, said Judy Garces, press relations spokeswoman with the Mexican Consulate in San Antonio. The state argued that Leal -- who has lived in the United States since age 2 -- never revealed his Mexican citizenship at the time of arrest, and his defense team never raised the consular access issue at or before trial. Prosecutors also said the evidence against him was indisputable. The victim was tortured, and a bite mark on her body was matched to Leal. A bloody shirt belonging to Sauceda was discovered at the suspect's home. The two had attended a party separately earlier that evening. The girl's nude body was found on a dirt road. Leal was one of 40 Mexican citizens awaiting lethal injection in U.S. prisons. The issue turned on what role each branch of government plays in giving force to international treaty obligations. Three years ago, the Supreme Court justices concluded Texas could execute another Mexican man sentenced to death for murder. Jose Medellin was given a lethal injection by the state a few months later. The question then and now is whether the state has to give in to a demand by the president that the prisoner be allowed new hearings and sentencing. In the 2008 case, President George W. Bush made that demand reluctantly after an international court concluded Medellin was improperly denied access to his consulate before his original prosecution, a violation of the treaty signed by the United States decades ago. The Mexican government filed a supporting appeal with the high court in Washington this past week, asking the justices to block Leal's execution, citing Bush's previous executive action. On Friday, the Obama administration asked Texas to delay the execution. ""This case implicates United States foreign policy interests of the highest order,"" including protecting U.S. citizens abroad and promoting good relations with other countries, new Solicitor General Donald Verrilli Jr. said. Congress has also stepped in. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, introduced a bill in June to formally grant federal courts the power to review these kinds of appeals. ""This case is not an isolated instance; the issue of consular notification remains a serious diplomatic and legal concern,"" Leahy said Thursday. Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry's office countered that a federal appeals court had already given Leal the judicial scrutiny the Obama administration and the United Nations seek, ultimately rejecting his claims. ""If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas, you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws,"" Katherine Cesinger, spokeswoman for the governor, told CNN. ""Congress has had the opportunity to consider and pass legislation for the federal courts' review of such cases since 2008, and has not done so each time a bill was filed."" Ted Cruz, the state's former solicitor general who argued the 2008 Supreme Court case for Texas, said Leal waited too long to raise these issues. ""The question is not should a foreign national have the right to contact their consulate,"" Cruz told CNN. ""The question is, years later, after they have been tried, after they have been convicted, after it has been clear like Humberto Leal that they are a vicious child rapist and murderer, should you come in and set aside that conviction. You can't come back years later and try and set aside your trial with some additional claim you wish you had raised."" Cruz is now running for the U.S. Senate as a Republican candidate. The Supreme Court appeal is Leal v. Texas (11-5001). Journalist Jocelyn Lane contributed to this report.","NEW: Mexico condemns execution of Humberto Leal Garcia Jr. in Texas .

"(CNN) -- April 27, 1994, was the crowning moment in the life of Nelson Mandela -- the day South Africa held its first elections open to citizens of every race. His African National Congress party swept to power with 63% of the vote. F.W. de Klerk's National Party got 20% and the Inkatha party netted 10%. In his victory speech, Mandela said: ""Now is the time for celebration, for South Africans to join together to celebrate the birth of democracy. ""I raise a glass to you all for working so hard to achieve what can only be called a small miracle."" Many agreed it was a miracle -- from world leaders to ordinary South African voters -- considering the turmoil and segregation entrenched in South Africa just a few years before. Mandela's compassion and political shrewdness helped bring about this change. But most of all, it was the complete lack of bitterness he displayed for the 27 years he was imprisoned by the apartheid regime that enabled him to win over his divided nation and charm the world with his statesmanship. Mandela and his government inherited a country devastated by decades of apartheid -- a policy of segregation and discrimination that aimed to keep black and white apart in every sphere of life -- as well as a black majority coming to terms with the fact that voting did not guarantee social and economic equality. He introduced housing, education and economic development initiatives designed to improve the living standards of blacks. He also made his mark on the international stage. During his five-year presidency, he received 73 heads of state or government and made 83 state visits outside the country. Mandela worked to broker peace in neighboring African nations, including Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He was involved in restoring order in Lesotho after its May 1998 elections triggered severe unrest, sending in South African troops who stabilized the situation and created a favorable climate for negotiations. Mandela led the call for sanctions against Nigeria following the 1995 execution of writer and activist Ken Saro Wiwa and a number of other political prisoners. And he played a leading role in resolving the impasse between the United States, the United Kingdom and Libya over securing the surrender of the two men charged in the Lockerbie bombing. But Mandela often cut a lonely figure on his travels as his marriage to wife Winnie foundered. They divorced in 1996. He was to find love again, with Graca Machel, the widow of former Mozambique President Samora Machel. They married on his 80th birthday in 1998. In September of that year, he was awarded at a ceremony in Washington the U.S. Congressional Gold Medal, becoming the first African to receive the honor. President Bill Clinton said Mandela was awarded the medal not only because of his ""10,000 long days"" spent in prison but also for his ""shining example"" as a political leader since his release. The last three years of Mandela's presidency were largely in the role of elder statesman as he gradually handed over the day-to-day governing of the country to his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded him in 1999. In his speech at a farewell banquet, Mandela again referred to the miracle of South Africa. ""South Africans from every sector had reached out across the divisions of the centuries and averted a bloodbath which most observers believed inevitable, so much so that our smooth transition was hailed widely as a miracle,"" he said. ""Our people have therefore confounded the prophets of doom. We are confident they will do it over and over again.""","Mandela helped bring about country's first multiracial elections .

"All signs indicate Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer will likely veto politically-charged legislation that supporters say promotes religious freedom and opponents contend discriminates against gays and lesbians. Brewer did not signal her intention either way in an exclusive interview with CNN on Monday at the National Governors Association meeting in Washington. ""I can assure you, as always, I will do the right thing for the state of Arizona,"" she said. But some Arizona Republicans who know her well say they are confident those comments mean Brewer will almost surely reject the bill that is generating nationwide controversy. The Republican-led measure would allow Arizona business owners to deny service to gay and lesbian customers as long as they assert their religious beliefs. Brewer is scheduled to return to Arizona on Tuesday, and a  source tells CNN those familiar with her thinking say she will likely spend at least one full business day in the state before acting. ""I'm going to go home, and when I receive the bill, I'm going to read it and I'm going to be briefed on it. We have been following it. And I will make my decision in the near future,"" Brewer told CNN. She has until Saturday to sign or veto the bill. If she does nothing, it automatically becomes law. Arizona GOP sources say Brewer considers herself a pro-business governor -- someone who above all else wants to protect and promote Arizona's economic interests. They say she knows full well there will be economic consequences for the state if it has a law on the books perceived to effectively codify discrimination. ""I have a history of deliberating and having an open dialogue on bills that are controversial, to listen to both sides of those issues, and I welcome the input, and information that they can provide to me. And certainly I am pro-business, and that is what's turning our economy around, so I appreciate their input, as I appreciate the other side,"" Brewer said. Business leaders in Arizona and around the country, including the chief executive of American Airlines, have urged Brewer publicly and privately to veto the bill. Approval also is likely to trigger lawsuits. The bill was pushed by the Center for Arizona Policy, a conservative group opposed to abortion and same-sex marriage. The group argues the proposal protects people against increasingly activist federal courts. Brewer vetoed a similar bill last year, arguing that the state legislature should focus on more pressing issues, such as a Medicaid expansion plan she was promoting. Sources say she is concerned about this bill taking away from other issues she is now pressing, such as overhauling Arizona's child protective services system. Freedom or oppression? That's the question for Arizona's SB1062 .","Bill would allow business owners to deny service to gay and lesbians based on religious objections .

"(CNN) -- A Russian boy who was sent back to Moscow, Russia, by his adoptive mother in the United States has been returned to an orphanage, an attorney of the World Association for Children and Parents said Friday. Larry Crain said the National Council for Adoption will be traveling to Russia next week to meet with adoption authorities there. The delegation will evaluate the child, 8-year-old Artyem Saveliev, and provide information to a U.S. circuit court in Tennessee. World Association for Children and Parents had coordinated the adoption. In April, Artyem, then 7, was put on a trans-Atlantic flight from the United States to Moscow. He had been adopted by an American family in Tennessee, which arranged for a Russian driver to deliver the boy from the Moscow airport to the Russian Ministry of Education. Artyem carried with him a letter signed by his adoptive mother, Torry Hansen of Shelbyville, Tennessee. In it, she said the boy was ""mentally unstable"" with violent tendencies, and that she had been misled about his mental condition. ""I am sorry to say that for the safety of my family, friends and myself, I no longer wish to parent this child,"" the letter read. ""As he is a Russian national, I am returning him to your guardianship and would like the adoption (annulled)."" Artyem is a U.S. citizen by virtue of an international adoption treaty, Crain said. Hansen's parental rights have not been severed, and she still is legally responsible for the boy. Crain said that a local teacher has petitioned to serve as Artyem's guardian, meaning she would serve as a representative for him in court. According to the Shelbyville Times-Gazette, the court will rule on whether a petition filed by the adoption agency to be appointed as a temporary guardian for Artyem will be moved to juvenile court. A motion by the agency last week asks the court to transfer the matter to juvenile court ""for all further proceedings herein,"" the newspaper reported. An August 12 hearing in the case had been scheduled, but has been postponed. The case sparked an international uproar and led to a series of meetings between U.S. and Russian negotiators over a proposed agreement on international adoptions between their two countries. The proposed agreement calls for a reduction in the number of U.S. adoption agencies accredited to operate in Russia, . Moscow's children's rights commissioner, Pavel Astakhov, has said. ""Independent adoptions"" will be abolished, and there will be a new Russian-American agency that will inspect any U.S. family adopting a Russian child, he said. A senior State Department official has indicated that a possible provision of the new agreement would allow earlier and more frequent sharing of information both before and after adoptions. He said some American couples don't see details of a child's medical and psychological condition until a court appearance for final adoption approval. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: August 12 U.S. hearing in case postponed .

"Here's what you need to do: take a break from your career and travel the world for an extended period of time. How does that sound? If your response is ""Sounds fantastic, but there's absolutely no way I can do that,"" you're not alone. But people do take career breaks, and quite successfully -- so what's the secret? To cut through the many myths and fears surrounding the concept of leaving your job to travel, I spoke with Sherry Ott, a self-described ""corporate IT refugee"" who writes the popular travel blog ""Ottsworld: Travel and Life Experiences of a Corporate America Runaway."" Sherry's initial career break trip inspired even more traveling, which she has been doing nearly continuously for the last 4½ years. Eventually (and somewhat ironically) career break travel turned into a career itself when she co-founded Meet, Plan, Go!, which offers resources, workshops, and general inspiration for aspiring career break travelers. Sherry spoke to us from Beirut earlier this year about her experiences and what she's learned from other career break travelers. Lonely Planet: How to travel like a kid . What were your major worries when first setting out? It's easier to answer what I wasn't worried about ...because I was worried about everything!  However the main worries were: . I was worried that for the first time in my adult life, I would no longer have a paycheck coming into my account.  There would only be money going out for the next year-plus. That was scary to me. I was worried that I wouldn't like being on the road, as I had never traveled for more than 2 weeks before and it was always a vacation. I was really worried that I had to find a place to sleep every night for a year -- 365 days of lodging. When I was in the planning stages, I was all of a sudden very aware of my own room and bed and that I took it for granted that I could just come sleep in my bed every night without thinking about it. Not a one turned out to be a big issue at all. I loved being on the road, and at some point I was worried that I would never be able to be satisfied with standing still again (which is the case with my life now!). The money issue I had to adjust to, but pretty soon the idea of only watching money go out instead of in became normal. I had a certain threshold and I knew when my balance got down to a certain amount it meant I had to go home.  As far as lodging, that turned out to be pretty simple too. I had no problem finding places to sleep nor did it bother me after I was on the road. It loved the benefit of meeting new people every night! Lonely Planet: The world's greatest historical journeys . What are common leaving (and returning) worries you hear from others? 1. General fear of travel . I think there's sometimes an element of fear of traveling in general -- people don't think it's safe to do. If you read the U.S. State Department warnings, you'd never go anywhere. I certainly wouldn't be in Beirut now! They worry about everything that could go wrong and then they talk themselves out of it, which is sad as I feel very safe in most countries.  Even more safe than I do in the U.S.! 2. Family/friends won't understand, will be judgmental . I find that people were quite accepting of my plans and the most common phrase I heard was ""I wish I could do that."" However I do believe that the people who may push back and be judgmental are people who are quite frankly jealous and really are upset you aren't fitting the mold of what you are ""supposed to do.""  They are stuck doing what they are ""supposed to do"" and most likely unhappy about it. 3. There's never a good time to go . This sometimes feeds into people thinking their kids are too young or too old.  Or maybe they are the age that they ""should be"" getting married and be responsible.  There's all kinds of excuses we make for ourselves.  What people forget is that your life goes on while you are on the road...you can still meet people, your kids can still learn, you may even fall in love and get married.  For some reason we think that our possibilities end or our lives stop if we take off and do long-term traveling! 4. Stuff: what to do with all of it . I recommend to start this early -- start downsizing a room at a time.  I like the book ""The Joy of Less"" by Francine Jay.  It helps you goes through your stuff and downsize each room.  Also, start looking into options of where you can store things.  Ask landlords if you can sublet. 5. Money: travel is really expensive . Tripping yourself up with the ""travel is expensive"" myth is a sure-fire way to defeat the dream before you even give it a chance to breathe. Consider this: A vacation is different from traveling. On average, a vacation that includes a flight, hotel stays, and eating out for every meal can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,000 per person per week. Plus when you go on vacation, all of your other monthly expenses don't go away. You still have to pay for your mortgage or rent, car, electricity, water, magazine subscriptions -- this all continues while you are on vacation. However, when you travel, monthly expenses go away -- no more electricity, water, heating, gas, car insurance, rent, cable, internet, gym memberships, etc.  Plus you stretch your airfare dollar further when you fly and stay somewhere for a month as opposed to five days.  The airfare is spread across 30 days instead of five. Before you know it, your monthly expenses disappear and the amount you will need to simply travel becomes ""reasonable."" So don't think about your budget in terms of a vacation budget; extended travel is much different! 6. Going back to work: the résumé/CV gap . You don't have to hide your career break, you should address it. Include a short section about your career break and if you did any work related activities during that time (volunteering, teaching ESL, freelancing, ran a blog). Include an area/continent that you focused on especially if it has ties to your work in some way. Soft skills: most every career breaker will return with better soft skills acquired from their time on the road. Key areas involve risk assessment, negotiation skills, flexibility, patience, adapting quickly to changing environments, and enhanced decision making. List your travel website if you feel it's professional enough to mention. Look over it with a critical business eye before touting it on your résumé. However, be careful not to let your sabbatical sound like an extended holiday. Tell your potential employers that you wanted to improve your skills, take your volunteering/teaching English/diving/skiing/whatever ability to a new level to challenge yourself. If you describe your time in a focused manner it will help highlight your ability to push yourself. Keep in mind some companies may think that taking a career break is irresponsible and means you could leave them at a moment's notice too; therefore, be prepared to explain how loyal and committed you are. And consider if you really want to work for a company that can't understand or appreciate the values of world travel. Any unexpected benefits of taking a career break? For me personally there have been a ton of unexpected benefits: an increased patience level and confidence that my future is on solid ground. I never felt confident about my skills before and my ability to simply survive...but now I'm super confident in those areas. I have picked up an immense amount of technical skills thanks to blogging. I have awakened my creative side in photography and writing. I have completely built new skill sets, while I was doing something I loved. But I think the biggest benefit is that you learn not to sweat the small stuff. No issue seems as big as before you left. Do you still have worries about what happens next? I might be a special case.  For me -- no -- I don't worry about what happens next. I can't even begin to predict the possibilities that will come my way from day to day.  I'm so used to uncertainty that I'm now afraid of things that are concrete.  However, I feel like after 4½ years of travel I have developed this attitude. When I first came back from my career break of 1½ years, I was worried about what my next steps would be. I didn't feel like I could fit back into the corporate world and it took a while to simply fit back into the U.S. At this point, my life has completely changed. I sit here writing this from a family's apartment in Beirut Lebanon. I have a place to sleep tonight, I have adventure waiting tomorrow -- that's all I need.

"After football player Ray Rice was caught on video dragging his unconscious fiancee out of an elevator, his attorney called the incident a ""very minor physical altercation.""  Where I'm from, when one combatant in a fight gets knocked out, that is no longer ""minor."" Once the incident made the news, it was inevitable that there would be a ""minor"" kerfuffle over the story.  I am not interested in discussing the incident itself.  What I am interested in discussing is how this incident shows us that when emotional issues are involved, fair debate and discussion get knocked out, too. ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith was nowhere near the elevator that day, but he just got knocked out by a chorus of voices and a spineless employer.  When Smith commented on the issue, he clearly stated his position that Rice was dead wrong and deserved punishment.  Without excusing it, Smith gave his opinion that, in general, when there is violence, sometimes it might be worth asking questions about provocation.  He made it clear that there should never be violence, especially by a man against a woman. For even suggesting that there could be provocation before a fight, Smith is now off the air.  Mind you, Smith never tried to justify Rice's actions. Once the outcry began, Smith rushed to apologize. I don't believe that Smith owed anyone an apology.  If you listen to his entire statement, he said nothing to suggest that Rice's now-wife, Janay, ""had it coming,"" nor did he make any excuses for Rice's behavior.  The only offense he committed was that he blathered so incoherently that he made it hard to see how he managed to get a TV show in the first place. So, if ESPN wants to take him off the air and replace him with a better commentator, I'm all for it.  But I'm disgusted at the rancorous, politically correct swarm that descended upon Smith, and the spineless reaction of the management at ESPN. And once the swarm gets into ""beast mode,"" there is no recovery. Why?  Plain and simple: sexism. Recall that a few months ago, Solange Knowles attacked Jay-Z. When that happened, the feminist site Jezebel had this take: ""The real tea isn't the fight itself, but what could have possibly gone down between the two to make Solange kick her sister's husband in the balls.""  In other words, ""if she hit him, he must have done something to have it coming.""  And this was not an outlier view. Nobody's outrage meter spiked there. No, it was ""funny."" I'm not defending Ray Rice. But there's definitely a ""sit down and shut up"" double standard among those who seek to promote one side of this issue -- and this is less about Smith's comments being inappropriate.  The gleeful rush to call for Smith's head is far more inappropriate. Yes, there's a difference between a physically huge NFL player beating up his fiancee  and a wisp of a woman kicking Jay-Z in the crotch.  But what's really going on here? What's really going on here is that one side of the debate wants to make it impermissible for the other to speak.  At all. Take this in the context of how gender issues are presented when there are voices that dare to deviate from the feminist narrative. Here's an example: Recently, there was a conference in Detroit for the ""A Voice For Men"" blog and its readers.  That controversial website has the audacity to question certain issues from a man's perspective.  As a result, according to news reports, this political meeting was the target of threats of violence that, in any other context, would have been called ""terrorism."" Organizers said the conference moved from the hotel where it was to be held.   Did you hear about that?  It didn't get very much press coverage.  Nobody called for a candlelight vigil. Could you imagine if this had been the annual meeting of the National Organization for Women? Perhaps Smith is a complete ignoramus.  Or, perhaps he was misunderstood.   And next to that, we must concede that there was very little criticism of those who said that Jay-Z must have done something to provoke violence against him.  There was no real outcry when A Voice For Men was the victim of what would be called ""terroristic threats"" if it was any other viewpoint. Listen to comedian Bill Burr. In a routine, he discusses the statement ""there's no reason to hit a woman.""  He's doing comedy, but he makes a really cogent point -- perhaps there is no justification for it, but why is it so taboo to ask about what happened before the violence? ""When you say there's no reason, that kills any sort of examination as to how two people ended up at that place. If you say there's no reason, you cut out the build-up, you're just left with the act. How are you going to solve it if you don't figure it out?"" he said. ""You can only ask questions about what the guy did, you can never ask about the woman, why is that?"" Why, indeed?  Maybe Burr was on to something? Neither Burr, nor I, want to defend Rice beating up his fiancee.  I'm appalled that Rice only got a two-game suspension. But I'm just as appalled that free discourse has become such a victim of the politically correct police that nobody can even ask a question, or raise any other viewpoint except to fall over themselves with condemnation. Well, nobody except Bill Burr.","Marc Randazza: Uproar over video of Ray Rice dragging unconscious fiancee from elevator .

"This past week, my inbox blew up with e-mails asking whether Donald Sterling's First Amendment rights were violated in the uproar over the Los Angeles Clippers owner's racist remarks about black people. After all, he was simply expressing his views, however unpopular. While he did have some rights violated, his First Amendment rights remain intact. The First Amendment protects you from the government punishing you because of your speech. The NBA is a private club, and it can discipline Sterling all it wants. What about the chorus of criticism? Are we all violating his First Amendment rights by criticizing him? We are punishing him for his speech. Nope. The First Amendment does not insulate you from criticism. In fact, that's the First Amendment in action. That is how the marketplace of ideas works. We float our ideas in the marketplace, and we see which idea sells. Most everyone would agree that Sterling's ideas fail in the marketplace of ideas. Nevertheless, I reluctantly stand on Sterling's side today. What happened to him may have been illegal and was morally wrong. Start with illegal. In California, you can't record a conversation without the knowledge or consent of both parties. The recording featuring Sterling and V. Stiviano may be the result of a crime. Once she gathered this information, someone leaked it (she denies it was her) -- and it went viral. This is where I think things went morally wrong. We all say things in private that we might not say in public. Sometimes we have ideas that are not fully developed -- we try them out with our closest friends. Consider it our test-marketplace of ideas. As our ideas develop, we consider whether to make them public. Should we not all have the freedom to make that choice on our own? The Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made his own stupid and bigoted statements, and he's been nationally pilloried, too -- but he chose to make those statements to the world. He deserves every ounce of obloquy heaped upon him. But does Sterling? Think about what his public character execution means. It means that we now live in a world where if you have any views that are unpopular, you now not only need to fear saying them in public, but you need to fear saying them at all -- even to your intimate friends. They might be recording you, and then that recording may be spread across the Internet for everyone to hear. Isn't it bad enough that the National Security Agency can spy on all of us? How can we complain when we condone giving our closest friends the ability to do worse -- perhaps just to try and destroy us. In the novel ""1984,"" George Orwell wrote of the Telescreen, a device that beamed information into the home but that also spied on people constantly. Even if we were to stop the NSA in its tracks, would we still now live in a world where the Telescreen watches us? Only instead of an oppressive government installing it in our apartments, it is conveniently placed in the hands of our dear friends. The Sterling story is not that we found a bigot and dragged him to the gallows in the middle of the marketplace of ideas.  The Sterling story is about how there is no more privacy. We live in a world where you can share your intimate photos with your lover, and they will wind up on a ""revenge porn"" website. We live in a world where our intimate conversations will be recorded and blasted to billions of listeners. We live in a world where, say a gold digger can spy on her sugar daddy, and the world says that the creepy old guy is the bad guy. Don't get me wrong. Sterling does seem to be a bad person. But sometimes the bad person is also the victim, and he stands in for us. As you applaud Stiviano for bringing the racist old man's views to light, consider if it were you speaking to a woman friend in what you thought was a private conversation. Do we now live in a world where we can trust nobody? Where there is no privacy? In this story, there are two villains. Sterling represents the bad old days. But Stiviano's behavior represents the horrifying future. Shouldn't we condemn the complete breakdown of privacy and trust at least as loudly as we condemn some old man's racist blathering?","Marc J.

"North Korea is one of the world's poorest countries, seen as well behind most everyone when it comes to most technologies and much more. Hacking may not be one of them. Scant resources or not, a defector who once worked as a computer expert for the North Korean government says that it has a vast network of hackers devoted to cyberwarfare against perceived enemies of the Stalinist state. Jang Se-yul, who defected from North Korea seven years ago, told CNN that he thinks there are 1,800 cyberwarriors in the agency stationed around the world. But he says even the agents themselves don't know how many others work for the secretive group, called Bureau 121, whose mission is to ""conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states."" The South Korean government thinks Bureau 121 is the agency at the heart of numerous cyberattacks from North Korea against elements in foreign countries, a government official who requested to be anonymous told CNN on Thursday. North Korea's hacking capabilities have become a global talking point recently, after a massive hack of Sony Pictures -- the studio behind ""The Interview,"" a comedy depicting the assassination of Pyongyang's leader, Kim Jong Un. That was followed by warnings that the movie not be shown in theaters, something that's a nonissue, for now, after Sony called off its planned release Wednesday. Washington outraged over Sony decision . U.S. investigators say an announcement blaming Pyongyang for this could come as soon as Thursday. North Korea's government has denied responsibility for the crippling hack, even as its state news agency applauded it. ""The hacking into the SONY Pictures might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers with the DPRK,"" KCNA reported. Commenting generally on the North Korean government's hacking arsenal, Jang said he thinks the reclusive East Asian nation's cyberwarfare is more real and more dangerous than the regime's ability to launch a nuclear offensive -- even if it is the latter that has contributed to expansive sanctions, other penalties and the country's isolation on the world stage. Said Jang, ""This silent war -- the cyberwar -- has already begun without a single bullet fired."" 'Dark Seoul' hacks of banks, media companies . Whether or not it's behind the Sony hack, South Korean intelligence thinks Bureau 121 has struck before, according to the government official. South Korea has repeatedly accused the North of hacking attacks, including incidents in 2010 and 2012 that targeted banks and media organizations. Pyongyang has rejected the allegations. The biggest case became known as ""Dark Seoul,"" a series of hacks between March and June 2013 that targeted South Korean banks and media companies. More than 48,000 computers were hit, infecting the companies' computer networks with a malicious program, or malware, that slowed or shut down systems. Analyst: We underestimated North Korea . Seoul's military ratcheted up its cyber-alert level in response, and an official South Korean investigation later pinned the blame for this attack on its northern neighbor, finding that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used by Pyongyang previously, said Lee Seung-won, an official at the South Korean Science Ministry. A spokesman for the general staff of North Korea's military called these allegations, which came at a time of heightened tensions between the two longtime rivals, ""groundless"" and ""a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase,"" according to KCNA. Analyst: North Korea 'probably popping the champagne' Assuming some of the allegations are well-founded, some might question how or why a country that's so poor, with so few resources, would devote so much to cyberwarfare. Jang, who says he is still in contact with at least one of Bureau 121's members, says the answer is simple: ""Raising cyberagents is fairly cheap."" ""The world has the wrong view of the North Korean state,"" he adds. ""With that incorrect world view, North Korea was able to increase its ability to launch cyberattacks."" Jang attended North Korea's military college for computer science, the University of Automation, and worked in information services for the government before defecting. He showed CNN reams of information he says was stolen by North Korean operatives from Bureau 121. The information taken from South Korean financial institutions, which Jang says he got from a Bureau 121 operation, appeared to list bank accounts, names and financial data. Celebrities criticize decision to pull 'The Interview' The ""Dark Seoul"" hacks were harmful, but one analyst thinks that the Sony attack -- if it's indeed linked to North Korea -- represents an escalation of tactics. ""I think we underestimated North Korea's cybercapabilities,"" said Victor Cha, director of Asian studies at Georgetown University. ""They certainly didn't evidence this sort of capability in the previous attacks."" He called the Sony hack, and the studio's decision to pull ""The Interview,"" ""a big win"" for Pyongyang. ""They got the U.S. government to admit that North Korea was the source of this, and there's no (public) action plan ... in response to it,"" Cha said. ""I think, from their perspective in Pyongyang, they're probably popping the champagne corks.""

"Another day, another fight about reclining seats on a U.S. airline flight. In the third serious airline legroom incident in two weeks, an angry passenger caused yet another flight to divert Monday night. Delta Air Lines Flight 2370 from New York's LaGuardia Airport to West Palm Beach, Florida, was rerouted to Jacksonville, Florida. A passenger became irate about the traveler in front of her trying to recline her seat, a fellow passenger told CNN affiliate WPTV. ""This woman who was sitting next to me knitting actually just tried reclining her seat back,"" passenger Aaron Klipin said. ""The woman behind her started screaming and swearing and then a flight attendant came over and that just exacerbated what was going on and then she demanded that the flight land."" Delta confirmed the diversion. ""Delta flight 2370 from New York-LaGuardia to West Palm Beach was re-routed to Jacksonville International Airport due to a passenger disruption,"" Delta said in a statement. ""Out of an abundance of caution, the Captain elected to divert to the closest airport."" Local law enforcement removed the passenger and the flight continued to West Palm Beach, Delta said. It's been a tense couple of weeks for passengers on both sides of the right-to-recline debate. Another reportedly irate passenger caused a flight from Miami to Paris to divert to Boston on August 27 after someone allegedly tried to recline in front of him. Paris resident Edmund Alexandre, 60, was charged in U.S. federal court August 28 with interfering with an airline flight crew. Interfering with flight crew members is a violation of federal law and carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. (The passenger's name has also been spelled ""Edmond"" Alexandre in court documents.) A United Airlines flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Denver was diverted on August 24 after two passengers argued over one passenger's use of a ""Knee Defender,"" a device that blocks reclining. Should the Knee Defender be banned? Water was thrown and the passengers, both 48, were removed from the flight in Chicago, according to a federal law enforcement source, speaking on background. The passengers were not arrested. It seems at least one of the passengers was not completely satisfied with the extra space in the Economy Plus section where they were seated, which provides United passengers up to 5 inches of extra legroom compared with standard coach seats. Aviation blogger Benet Wilson is surprised there haven't been more incidents in the air as travelers face long security checkpoint lines at more crowded airports as well as less space and fewer amenities on planes. ""As airlines try and squeeze as many seats into economy as possible, that decreases seat pitch which can be uncomfortable for someone like me, who is 5'3"","" wrote Wilson via e-mail. ""But imagine being a foot taller squeezed into that same space. It doesn't help that the (Federal Aviation Administration) doesn't have an official rule on using (seat-blocking devices), instead deferring to passengers and airlines. So I feel the situation will get worse before it gets better."" The core problem is definitely the airlines packing too many seats too close together into a tight space, said veteran flight attendant Heather Poole, author of ""Cruising Attitude: Tales of Crashpads, Crew Drama, and Crazy Passengers at 35,000 Feet."" ""That said, this doesn't give anyone the right to act childish,"" Poole wrote via e-mail. ""To react in such a way that the crew feels the need to divert a flight to have a passenger removed is a really big deal."" What do you think of this recent spate of airline seat recline incidents?

"American Kenneth Bae, who is being held in North Korea, has been moved from a hospital to a labor camp, the State Department said on Friday. Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement that the United States was ""deeply concerned"" by the development. ""We also remain gravely concerned about Mr. Bae's health"" and again urge Pyongyang to grant him ""special  amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds,"" she said. Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. A devout Christian and father of three, Bae operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website that friends set up to promote his release. The North Korean government accused Bae of planning to bring down the government through religious activities. Last month, he told reporters that he had committed a ""serious crime"" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime. Any statement by Bae in captivity would be sanctioned by the North Korean government. Choson Sinbo -- a pro-North Korean publication with offices in Tokyo and Pyongyang that has claimed to have interviewed Bae in the past -- indicated in a report on its website Saturday that it had talked to him again. According to the site, Bae said he'd been at a labor camp for about three weeks, during which time he works and also has some time to watch television and read books. Choson Sinbo claims that Bae has been told to expect a visit from Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, as early as this coming Monday. Psaki said late last month that the United States is ""prepared to send Ambassador King"" to North Korea to discuss Bae. ""There isn't a plan right now for Ambassador King to travel there,"" she said on January 29.","Pro-North Korean publication: Bae expects a visit from U.S. diplomat soon .

"The European High Court ruled that a person has a ""right to be forgotten.""  In response, some think that the sky is falling.  I say the opposite. Mario Gonzalez, a Spanish citizen, was displeased that any Google search for his name turned up a 16-year-old report on a real estate auction connected with some old debts.  Gonzalez believed that this was out-of-date and irrelevant information with respect to him today.  The European High Court agreed and ruled that the EU's right to privacy guarantees include a ""right to be forgotten."" The court ordered Google to remove links to archived newspaper pages that contained the old information after Gonzalez sued Google and the newspaper in 2010. The European Court ruled that a European's right to privacy includes the right to say, ""This is really old information, and it no longer reflects who I am."" The court held that someone's right to privacy overrides Google's economic interest and even the public's right to old and irrelevant information. We should be jealous of our friends in Europe.  As Europe protects individual rights, America persists in its belief that rights are for big corporations, people be damned. Until recently, humans had comfort in knowing that mistakes were rarely forever. But the Internet has brought us a ""mistakes are forever"" society. Now, even a financial hiccup 16 years ago remained as prominent for Gonzalez, as if it happened yesterday.  Now, a revenge porn picture will remain on a victim's Google results forever, victimizing the subject every day.  Even deserved criticism, like an old criminal record, will remain forever -- as if it happened yesterday.  Time is no longer linear for us. Is this how we want to live?  Should we not have a right to be forgotten?   During the Cold War, we despised totalitarian regimes that kept a dossier on every citizen, holding compromising information in store for the day that it served to discredit him or her.  I remember learning that the FBI kept files on dissidents in the '60s and '70s.  I remember learning a few months ago, thanks to Edward Snowden, that the NSA is spying on us.  Nobody thinks that is a good thing. Big Data's reaction, like anything that reins in companies' rights to abuse us, was a shriek of little  substance. Google doesn't like being told what to do, and critics raised an outcry about First Amendment rights. Google could have instituted a responsible policy like this on its own. But Google's position is like that of a petulant child:  ""You're not the boss of me!""  And that is why we can't have nice things. Well, isn't there a little bad in this ruling? Theoretically, yes.  This could be abused to get rid of important truthful information.  That is a bad thing, and I would find that intolerable if someone tried to abuse it to suppress legitimate criticism or information that the public has a right to know. But the ruling does not say that old information must be deleted.  It doesn't even say that Google has to comply with requests.  It just says that if a European requests that information come down, Google must respect the request but can refuse if it has good cause. And that good cause is where free expression and freedom of information remains intact.  One critic asked whether ex-Nazis could use this ruling to hide their participation in the Holocaust. The answer to that is a resounding no. The ruling ends with an admonishment. The ""right to be forgotten"" does not apply if it appears for ""particular reasons"": if there is good cause to interfere with the citizen's right to privacy, including ""the role played by the data subject in public life,"" and if a majority of the evidence shows that the general public has a right to that information. Sorry, old Nazis, you can't use this to hide your involvement in the Holocaust.  In fact, public figures and public events will never be erased.

"As major airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration relax their rules on using electronic devices during takeoff and landing, one important question lingers: . What will become of Airplane mode? The common smartphone feature, which disables cellular, wireless, Bluetooth, and GPS connections so you can use your mobile device while in the air, may be outgrowing its name. Airlines quick to ease electronics rules . The Internet is having fun coming up with new names for Airplane mode that reflect broader uses for the feature. Alexis Madrigal at The Atlantic offers Zen mode. Other suggestions include Freedom mode, Focus mode, Brick mode or Hermit mode. Airplane mode is more than just a necessity at 30,000 feet -- it's become a tool for severing ourselves from the demands of constant connectiveness. And with some enhancements, Airplane mode could help us all put some much needed boundaries between our online and offline lives, our work and personal time. Despite the FAA rule changes, Airplane mode isn't actually going anywhere. It still serves its original purpose, because making calls will continue to be forbidden (and probably impossible) while in flight. The new rules just mean you can play games or use an e-reader during takeoff instead of having to flip through the in-flight magazine, chat with the person next to you or be alone with your thoughts. Can your cell phone bring down a plane? Outside of flying, people have found many creative uses for Airplane mode. They use it to quickly disconnect before movies, meetings, dinners and other events where silent mode isn't enough. When traveling internationally, keeping a phone on Airplane mode and turning on Wi-Fi can prevent cellular bills bloated with roaming charges. People who use their tablets for work can employ Airplane Mode to avoid distractions like surfing the web or checking Twitter. Toggling Airplane mode on and off can even act as a quick fix for connection problems. The setting is also used by people who want to rein in their own smartphone use, say to tune out the outside world without actually parting with their precious handheld computers. With smartphones, people check and send work e-mails at all hours. According to Expedia's annual ""Vacation Deprivation"" survey, 67% of American adults stay connected while on vacation and 76% check their e-mail and voice mail. A recent Microsoft ad campaign for Office 365 uses the need to work remotely and around the clock as a selling point. ""Office workers want technology to help them get things done anywhere, sunrise to sunset,"" reads the tagline. Illustrations show people working on mobile devices while on a date, during a kid's soccer game, and during a stroll through a national park. There's been lots of talk around ""unplugging"" for parts of every day or week, but this all-or-nothing approach doesn't sit well with a generation of smartphone users who are dependent on their devices. Willpower clearly isn't working. Airplane mode offers a partial solution, but it's still too simple. So how about this: What if phones offered parental control-like settings that could be scheduled and set for individual apps and features? Access to work e-mail could be cut off at 7 p.m. Social networking apps, games and other time-sucks could be banned on weekends. Someone on vacation could limit access so only the phone's camera, maps, restaurant reviews, translation apps and travel e-books were available. In its new iOS 7, Apple added a Do Not Disturb feature that gives some control but mostly applies to phone calls. It can automatically silence incoming calls and alerts, either during prescheduled times or on demand. A reverse do-not-disturb feature that only allows phone calls and texts (let's call it a Dumb Phone mode) could be a refreshing break. Many people want to disconnect -- they just need a little help. So future smartphones might include even more options for reclaiming personal time and restoring some of the work/life balance. 10 ways to improve the travel industry .","Airplane mode isn't just for cutting off cellular and Internet connections on airplanes .

"An Ohio man is set to be put to death Thursday by a two-drug cocktail never before used in a U.S. execution. Dennis McGuire was convicted in 1994 of the aggravated murder of Joy Stewart in Preble County, according to the state's governor, who has denied a request for clemency. Like many states, Ohio has been forced to find new drug protocols after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions -- among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. Ohio ran out of pentobarbital in September, according to JoEllen Smith, spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. In response to that shortage, the department amended its execution policy to allow for the use of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, she said. Death penalty states scramble for lethal injection drugs . The combination has never before been used in a U.S. execution. ""Lawyers for McGuire contend that he will suffocate to death in agony and terror. The state disagrees. But the truth is that no one knows exactly how McGuire will die, how long it will take or what he will experience in the process,"" Elisabeth A. Semel, clinic professor of law and director of the Death Penalty Clinic at U.C. Berkeley School of Law, wrote in an opinion piece for CNN this week. The state was set to execute Ron Phillips using the two-drug cocktail last year, but Ohio Gov. John Kasich granted the convicted killer a stay of execution pending a review of possible organ donation to his family members. Unless there is court action or a reprieve, McGuire will be executed at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville.

"(CNN) -- Business leaders, heads of government, entrepreneurs and even the odd celebrity are rubbing fur and down-quilted shoulders at Europe's highest altitude town, Davos, for the World Economic Forum's annual meeting. Here's all you need to know about the meeting, the town and those lucky enough to be invited. The town . At 1,560 meters Davos is the highest town in Europe, its population is more than 11,000. Its average temperature is -5°C/23°F in January and 17°C/62°F in July. The meeting is beneficial to the city: its CO2 levels fall on average up to 30% during the annual meeting, thanks to controls on vehicle emissions and the use of electric transport. Moreover, the annual meeting contributes CHF 45 million ($50M) to the local Davos economy and CHF 70 million ($77M) to Switzerland's economy overall. The attendees . 250 top political leaders and heads of international organizations attend the forum, this year, 40+ of them are current heads of state or government. The security is tight -- although the organizers do not release specific information, it is estimated that around 4,000 Swiss troops, police and security personnel guard the town. Accreditation, which is necessary for anyone attending, costs $20,000. The youngest participant is 21-year-old Umar Anwar Jahangir, a ""Global Shaper"" from Islamabad, who heads Bahria Medics, a student-run social welfare organization. At the other end of the age range is Shimon Peres, President of Israel, at 90. Overall, 2,500 delegates traveled to Davos from more than 100 countries. That's five times as many as the first time the event was held in 1971, when only 444 participated. However, just 15% of this year's guests are female . The meeting . Only once was the annual meeting held outside of Davos: In 2002, in New York, as a gesture of solidarity after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. There are four World Economic Forum bureaus around the world: The headquarters in Geneva, and in New York, Beijing, and Tokyo. This year, the WEF program includes more than 250 events, organized by nearly 500 staff members, and covered by more than 500 journalists, who had to submit their applications nearly three months in advance. CNN itself sent nearly 40 reporters, producers, cameramen and crew. More than 2 million people follow the WEF on Twitter.

"It's a horrifying tale: Three young women are held captive for nearly a decade, spending some of that time in chains. But in the story of their dramatic escape from a Cleveland home last Monday, an Internet star has emerged. Charles Ramsey, the man who, along with fellow neighbor Angel Cordero, helped rescue victim Amanda Berry, has gone from struggling dishwasher to viral sensation overnight. Ramsey's role in the rescue -- he heard Berry screaming and, thinking she was escaping a domestic dispute, kicked open a door for her -- has made him a hero to many. But his straight-shooting retelling of the story, with its colorful asides and sometimes-profane vernacular, is what's captivated a Web where nothing is sacred and front-page news becomes meme-worthy amusement at lightning speed. ""The Internet likes to celebrate our heroes,"" said Ben Huh, CEO of The Cheezburger Network, which includes the site Know Your Meme. A video of Ramsey was the top item on the site Wednesday. ""In our own way, this is our celebration of Charles Ramsey."" Of course, there was the inevitable auto-tune. The Gregory Brothers, known for ""Bed Intruder,"" ""Double Rainbow"" and other Internet-famous, Songify reworkings of Web video, crafted ""Dead Giveaway"" from media interviews with Ramsey. ""My neighbor's got big testicles because we see this dude every day,"" goes one oft-repeated line. ""We eat ribs with this dude."" Several images of Ramsey had popped up by Wednesday on Meme Generator, a site that lets people add presumably humorous text to stock photos. And, in another Web certainty for overnight sensations, he's had several fake (or, if you prefer, parody) accounts created in his name on Twitter. Speaking of Twitter, McDonald's didn't waste any time getting mileage off of the story after Ramsey repeatedly said he was eating food from the chain when he heard Berry's screams. ""We salute the courage of Ohio kidnap victims & respect their privacy,"" the company tweeted Tuesday from its corporate account. Way to go Charles Ramsey- we'll be in touch."" But if much of the online attention was designed to turn Ramsey into entertainment, some of it was just to say ""thank you."" At least two fundraising efforts are under way on GoFundMe, an online fundraising site. One, titled ""Thank You Charles Ramsey,"" had already topped its goal of $10,000 in little over a day early Thursday. Its creator, Robby Russell of Portland, Oregon, promises to deliver the funds to Ramsey and document the donation. ""Thank you for doing what you did ... thank you for the fantastic interviews,"" Russell wrote. ""You made our day. Sincerely, The Internet."" There was another effort on the site but, as of Wednesday morning, it hadn't received any donations. For his part, Ramsey has said that, despite sometimes struggling financially, he would give any reward money he receives to the victims. Praise for Ramsey appeared to only cool off marginally Thursday as reports surfaced that he did prison time in the '90s, and again about a decade ago, on domestic abuse charges and for drug and trespassing arrests. Ramsey himself referenced his past in at least one interview, and many online seemed willing to give him credit for paying for his crimes and perhaps redeeming them, at least in part. ""Ramsey did horrible things 10 years ago. He was a hero on May 6, 2013,"" Kirsten West Savali wrote for News One, a news site ""for black America."" ""He served time for the former; he should be allowed to serve time as the latter."" Mostly, however, the Internet chuckled. It's the sort of mix of appreciation and amusement that can only happen on the modern Web, evoking memories of insta-famous folks, from frustrated flight attendant Steven Slater to NASA ""Mohawk Guy"" Bobak Ferdowsi  to Lydia Callis, the hyper-animated sign-language interpreter for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg who found Web fame during Superstorm Sandy. But some see a more troubling side of the Internet's fascination with Ramsey. These observers say the Ramsey memes are reminiscent of the viral fame foisted upon people like Antoine Dodson (""Hide yo' kids/hide yo' wife"") and Sweet Brown (""Ain't nobody got time for that"") -- in other words, poor, black people in scary situations whose emotional reactions are turned into punchlines. ""It's difficult to watch these videos and not sense that their popularity has something to do with a persistent, if unconscious, desire to see black people perform,"" Aisha Harris wrote Tuesday for Slate. ""Even before the genuinely heroic Ramsey came along, some viewers had expressed concern that the laughter directed at people like Sweet Brown plays into the most basic stereotyping of blacks as simple-minded ramblers living in the 'ghetto,' socially out of step with the rest of educated America."" Huh acknowledged that some viral takes on these instant celebrities are more tasteful than others. But he downplayed the importance of race for most viewers. ""I've seen this happen to every race, every color, every situation,"" he said. ""They love this guy, not because he is some funny black man, but because he did something great and didn't walk away from a bad situation."" That said, Huh predicted that on the Web of 2013, Ramsey's appeal may fade more quickly than, say, that of Mr. Trololo or the ""Double Rainbow"" guy, because much of the reaction has grown predictable. ""It's almost like there's a cottage industry of people now trying to get famous by turning things into a meme,"" he said. ""That kind of takes the fun out of it. ""Charles Ramsey is probably going to have a much shorter shelf life ... but one of the nice things about a story like this is we get to celebrate a person who did something good.""","Online, Cleveland rescuer Charles Ramsey is an instant star .

"Thailand's Constitutional Court has dismissed caretaker Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra from office, ruling that she is guilty of violating the country's constitution for reassigning a senior security official in 2011. ""The defendant has abused her position as prime minister,"" said the judge in the ruling. ""Her prime ministership has ... ended."" The court ruled that nine cabinet ministers who attended a meeting over the decision to transfer the official were also to be removed from office. Deputy PM and Commerce Minister Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan has been nominated by the cabinet as the next caretaker prime minister, Secretary General to the Prime Minister, Suranand Vejjajiva, told CNN. Yingluck's dismissal, which analysts say will only deepen Thailand's protracted political crisis, was brought about by a lawsuit filed by anti-government senators. They accused Yingluck of abusing her power by unlawfully transferring National Security Council chief Thawil Pliensri from his role in September 2011, alleging the move was intended to benefit her Pheu Thai Party and a family member. Thawil was replaced by the then national police chief, whose role in turn was later given to Priewpan Damapong, a relative of Yingluck. In March, Thailand's Supreme Administrative Court ruled the transfer unlawful and Thawil was reinstated. In the wake of the court's ruling, Yingluck thanked her cabinet ministers, government officials and supporters. ""It's been two years, nine months and two days that I worked as prime minister and every day of those two years, nine months and two days was a proud day,"" she said. ""I will always stand by the people."" 'More protests and dysfunction' Analyst Paul Quaglia, director at PQA Associates, a Bangkok-based risk assessment firm, said the development set the scene for ""more protests and more dysfunction in the days ahead."" ""Her supporters will look at this as what they call a judicial coup, which is one of the red lines they've drawn about all of this,"" he said. He said the case against Yingluck were ""pretty weak,"" and that abuse of power was a ""pretty grandiose term to describe what went on."" ""What she is accused of doing is approving the removal of a military officer from a civil servant's job in 2011. This is pretty routine,"" he said. ""Her supporters of course will view this as a technical pretext by the court simply to get rid of her and get rid of this government."" For the ""yellow shirt"" political bloc opposed to Yingluck, who came to office in a landslide win in 2011, her ouster would be a welcome cause for celebration, he said. ""It was the last stop on the track for them -- the army had refused to get into it, to stage a coup. They hadn't won any other battles, so it falls to the judiciary to get the job done to get rid of this elected government."" Yingluck defended herself against the charges in court Tuesday. ""I didn't do anything against the law,"" she said. ""I have performed my duty in the administration with the intention of benefiting the country."" Yingluck had led a caretaker administration since parliament was dissolved in December, ahead of a general election in February that was disrupted by anti-government protesters. The Constitutional Court subsequently ruled the election invalid. The protests had been sparked in November by Yingluck's government's botched attempt to pass an amnesty bill that would have paved the way for the return of her brother -- the polarizing former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- to the political fray in earnest. Military coup . Thaksin, a telecommunications tycoon, was overthrown in a military coup in 2006 and has since lived in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction, which he says is politically motivated. The anti-government protesters, drawn mainly from Bangkok's middle class, royalist establishment, allege that Yingluck is her brother's puppet and seek to rid Thai politics of her family's influence. In contrast, the ""red shirt"" supporters of Yingluck and her brother, many of whom are poor and hail mainly from rural areas in the north of the country, accuse the court of bias against their side. Thaksin's Thai Rak Thai political party was dissolved by the court in 2007. Observers are now watching how both camps, who have large rallies planned in the capital over the coming week, respond to the verdict. Political tensions have occasionally spilled over into deadly violence during the current crisis. ""For the first time in Thailand's history of political discord, we have opposing camps threatening to stage demonstrations in relative proximity to each other in Bangkok,"" said Quaglia. ""We could see some trouble, frankly."" He said the government had been ""dealt a blow, but not a fatal blow"" by the court. Under the caretaker administration, key infrastructure projects and policy decisions had already been placed on hold until after elections scheduled for July 20. ""We are headed one way or another towards elections at some point. I don't know how peaceful those elections will be or what the landscape will look like between now and July 20,"" he said. Yingluck's opponents have campaigned against elections, arguing the alleged corruption of their political rivals meant that widespread reforms were necessary before any meaningful vote could be held, said Quaglia. Anti-government protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister for the Democrat Party, has called for power to be transferred to an unelected ""people's council."" ""The Pheu Thai Party ... want to have elections. They know they will win those elections. Their opponents, the Democrat Party, say 'No, we can't have elections,' because they know they will lose those elections. Therein lies the rub,"" said Quaglia. Yingluck also faces a charge brought by the National Anti-Corruption Commission over a controversial state rice-buying scheme. The commission's ruling is expected this month.","Thailand's prime minister has been ousted from office by a court ruling .

"UEFA will not recognize any Russian soccer matches involving teams from the disputed region of Crimea. The move was announced by European soccer's governing body after the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU) appealed to UEFA and FIFA for their Russian counterparts to be sanctioned over  ""illegally and arbitrarily"" taking three of its teams. ""The UEFA Emergency Panel has today decided that any football matches played by Crimean clubs in the context of competitions organized by the Russian Football Union (RFS) will not be recognized by UEFA until further notice,""  read a statement released Friday. ""In order for football to take place within an organized sporting and legal framework, such participation has to comply with the terms set out in the UEFA Statutes."" Annexation . The status of the three Ukrainian clubs --  Tavriya Simferopol, FC Sevastopol and a lower league team from Yalta -- was thrown into doubt in March when Russia invaded and annexed the region of Crimea, which lies on a Black Sea peninsular in the south east of Ukraine. SC Tavriya and FC Sevastopol both played in the Ukrainian Premier League last season and were allowed to continue until its conclusion. Their home games were hosted outside of Crimea due to security concerns. But when the season finished the three clubs were dissolved. Two were given new names  -- TSK Simferopol, SKChF Sevastopol and Zhemchuzhina Yalta -- and entered in to Russian competition by the Russian Football Union, sparking protests from Ukraine. UEFA's statutes does outlaw ""combinations and alliances"" of clubs from different associations but FIFA would only allow any such move if both the Russians and Ukrainians agreed to it. ""Our strong position is that Ukrainian teams have to be in Ukrainian competition and there is no right for them to take part in Russia,"" said Anatoliy Konkov, a former USSR national team who is now the president of the FFU, in an interview with the New York Times. ""The clubs are still Ukrainian. Nobody gave them to Russia,"" he added before explaining that the FFU had given no such permission for the move to take place."" Fall out . The geopolitical fall out from both the conflict in Ukraine and the MH17 plane disaster had already begun to engulf soccer. Several politicians, including British deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, had called on Russia to be stripped of the right to host the 2018 World Cup finals over its alleged role in supplying and arming the Russian speaking insurgents currently fighting government forces in the east of Ukraine. Crimea was also raised when FIFA president Sepp Blatter met Russian president Vladimir Putin last weekend to discuss preparations for the 2018 finals. ""FIFA President Blatter also reiterated that FIFA will handle the ongoing matter concerning Crimean football clubs based on the relevant processes that should be overseen by the respective confederation (UEFA) in the first instance,"" FIFA said in a statement. Russian fears . Leading figures in Russian soccer had allegedly voiced fears that the annexation of Crimea's teams could lead to just such a political fallout. Last week Russian investigative magazine Novaya Gazeta published a transcript of a leaked recording from a meeting between top Russian soccer executives. The transcript of the meeting, which took place in July and lead to the vote which admitted the three Crimean teams into the Russian third division, appears to show discussions revealing how the vote may impact on Russian clubs playing in the UEFA Champions League. Others raise fears that the vote might even harm Russia's hosting of the 2018 World Cup finals. ""I have a club to support, "" Evgeny Giner, the president of CSKA Moscow, is alleged to have said. ""And tomorrow they'll pull us from 2018."" Forced hand . The objections of the Ukrainian federation has forced UEFA to make the temporary sanction against Russia whilst working out what to do next. In the statement UEFA, rather hopefully, believes the two sides can come to an agreement on the status of Crimea's soccer clubs. ""The UEFA Emergency Panel has also requested that the UEFA administration, together with FIFA, facilitate discussions with the representatives of the RFS and the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU) in order to find a common solution to this situation,"" concluded UEFA's statement. But any agreement would likely be seen as a huge PR coup for Russia's annexation of Crimea, and appear highly unlikely. Both the Football Federation of Ukraine and the Russian Football Union have not replied to a request for comment by the time of publication.","UEFA will not recognize matches involving Crimean teams .

"Hundreds of people are dead as the worst Ebola virus outbreak in history sweeps through West Africa. It began as a handful of cases in Guinea in March but quickly spread to neighboring Sierra Leone and Liberia. Here are nine things to know about what the World Health Organization calls ""one of the world's most virulent diseases."" Why does Ebola generate such fear? Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" ""It is a highly infectious virus that can kill up to 90% of the people who catch it, causing terror among infected communities,"" it says. There is also no vaccination against it. Of Ebola's five subtypes, the Zaire strain -- the first to be identified -- is considered the most deadly. The WHO said preliminary tests on the Ebola virus in Guinea in March suggested that the outbreak there was this strain, though that has not been confirmed. What is Ebola? The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. The virus is named after the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), where one of the first outbreaks occurred in 1976. The same year there was another outbreak in Sudan. The WHO says there are five different strains of the virus -- named after the areas they originated in. Three of these have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Africa. These are the Bundibugyo -- an area of Uganda where the virus was discovered in 2007 -- Sudan and Zaire sub-types. There has been a solitary case of Ivory Coast Ebola. This subtype was discovered when a researcher studying wild chimpanzees became ill in 1994 after an autopsy on one of the animals. The researcher recovered. Finally, Reston Ebola is named after Reston in the U.S. state of Virginia, where this fifth strain of the Ebola virus was identified in monkeys imported from the Philippines. The CDC says while humans have been infected with Ebola Reston, there have been no cases of human illness or death from this sub-type. What are Ebola's symptoms? Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. These symptoms can appear two to 21 days after infection. The WHO says these nonspecific early symptoms can be mistaken for signs of diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis or even the plague. MSF says some patients may also develop a rash, red eyes, hiccups, chest pains and difficulty breathing and swallowing. The early symptoms progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function and sometimes internal and external bleeding. Ebola can only be definitively confirmed by five different laboratory tests. How is it treated? There are no specific treatments for Ebola. MSF says patients are isolated and then supported by health care workers. ""This consists of hydrating the patient, maintaining their oxygen status and blood pressure and treating them for any complicating infections,"" it says. There have been cases of health care workers contracting the virus from patients, and the WHO has issued guidance for dealing with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus. Caregivers are advised to wear impermeable gowns and gloves and to wear facial protection such as goggles or a medical mask to prevent splashes to the nose, mouth and eyes. MSF says it contained a 2012 outbreak in Uganda by placing a control area around its treatment center. An outbreak is considered over once 42 days -- double the incubation period of the disease -- have passed without any new cases. What drugs exist to combat the disease? Two American missionary workers infected with Ebola were given an experimental drug called ZMapp, which seems to have saved their lives. The drug, developed by a San Diego firm, had never been tried before on humans, but it showed promise in small experiments on monkeys. But rolling out an untested drug during a massive outbreak would also be very difficult, according to MSF. Experimental drugs are typically not mass-produced, and tracking the success of such a drug if used would require extra medical staff where resources are already scarce. ZMapp's maker says it has very few doses ready for patient use. There are other experimental drugs. Tekmira, a Vancouver-based company that has a $140 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop an Ebola drug, began Phase 1 trials with its drug in January. But the FDA recently halted the trial, asking for more information. At least one potential Ebola vaccine has been tested in healthy human volunteers, according to Thomas Geisbert, a leading researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch. And last week, the NIH announced that a safety trial of another Ebola vaccine will start as early as September. And in March, the U.S. National Institutes of Health awarded a five-year, $28 million grant to establish a collaboration between researchers from 15 institutions who were working to fight Ebola. ""A whole menu of antibodies have been identified as potentially therapeutic, and researchers are eager to figure out which combinations are most effective and why,"" a news release about the grant said. How does Ebola virus spread? The WHO says it is believed that fruit bats may be the natural host of the Ebola virus in Africa, passing on the virus to other animals. Humans contract Ebola through contact with the bodily fluids of infected animals or the bodily fluids of infected humans. MSF says that while the virus is believed to be able to survive for some days in liquid outside an infected organism, chlorine disinfection, heat, direct sunlight, soaps and detergents can kill it. MSF epidemiologist Kamiliny Kalahne said outbreaks usually spread in areas where hospitals have poor infection control and limited access to resources such as running water. ""People who become sick with it almost always know how they got sick: because they looked after someone in their family who was very sick -- who had diarrhea, vomiting and bleeding -- or because they were health staff who had a lot of contact with a sick patient,"" she said. Can plane passengers become infected? While the CDC acknowledges it's possible a person infected with Ebola in West Africa could get on a plane and arrive in another country, the chances of the virus spreading during the journey are low. ""It's very unlikely that they would be able to spread the disease to fellow passengers,"" said Stephen Monroe, deputy director of CDC's National Center for Emerging Zoonotic and Infectious Diseases. ""The Ebola virus spreads through direct contact with the blood, secretions, or other body fluids of ill people, and indirect contact -- for example with needles and other things that may be contaminated with these fluids."" He added that most people who have become infected with Ebola lived with or cared for an ill patient. ""This is not an airborne transmission,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. ""There needs to be direct contact frequently with body fluids or blood."" Travelers should take precautions by avoiding areas experiencing outbreaks and avoid contact with Ebola patients. ""It is highly unlikely that someone suffering such symptoms would feel well enough to travel,"" IATA said in a statement. ""In the rare event that a person infected with the Ebola virus was unknowingly transported by air, WHO advises that the risks to other passengers are low. Nonetheless, WHO does advise public health authorities to carry out contact tracing in such instances."" This means determining who had contact with the affected person. What should flight crew do if Ebola infection is suspected? The CDC has issued guidance for airline crews on Ebola virus infections. ""As with many other global infectious disease outbreaks, airline carriers, crew members, airports can be very important partners in that front line,"" said Cetron. ""Being educated, knowing the symptoms, recognizing what to do, having a response protocol, knowing who to call, those are really, really important parts of the global containment strategy to deal with threats like this."" The CDC advises that when flight crew members encounter a passenger with symptoms that they suspect could be Ebola, such as fever and bleeding, that they keep the sick person away from other passengers. They've been instructed to wear disposable gloves and to provide the sickened person with a surgical mask to prevent fluids from spreading through talking, sneezing or coughing. The airline cleaning crew are also instructed to wear disposable gloves, wipe down surfaces including armrests, seat backs, trays and light switches. The CDC says that packages and cargo should not pose a risk, unless the items have been soiled with blood or bodily fluids. When someone becomes ill on a flight, the captain is required by aviation regulations to report the suspected case to air traffic control, according to IATA. What is the risk of catching Ebola on a plane? How many cases have there been? The CDC estimates there have been more than 3,000 cases of Ebola and more than 2,000 deaths since 1976. The last recorded outbreaks before the current one in Guinea were in 2012 -- in Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo. The Uganda outbreak involved a total of 24 probable and confirmed cases, and 17 deaths, according to the WHO, which declared it had ended in October 2012. MSF said the Uganda outbreak had been the Sudan strain, while the virus found in DRC was the Bundibugyo sub-type. Before 2014, the most deadly outbreak was the 1976 outbreak in then Zaire, when 280 of 318 infected people died, according to the CDC. In 2000, there were 425 cases of Ebola Sudan in Uganda, which resulted in 224 fatalities.","Ebola causes viral hemorrhagic fever and kills up to 90% of people who catch it .

"An arrest has been made in connection with possibly contaminated letters sent to President Barack Obama and Sen. Roger Wicker, the Department of Justice said Wednesday. Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested by the FBI at his home in Corinth, Mississippi, the department said in a statement. Discovered Tuesday, the letters were addressed to Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and to Obama. The justice department release said a third letter was sent to a Mississippi justice official. The letters to Wicker and Obama were stopped at a government mail-screening facility after initial tests indicated the presence of the deadly poison ricin. Because initial tests can be ""inconsistent,"" the envelopes have been sent off for additional tests, an FBI statement said. The FBI does not expect to receive results from the tests until Thursday, federal law enforcement sources told CNN. The letters read: ""To see a wrong and not expose it, is to become a silent partner to its continuance."" They were signed ""I am KC and I approve this message,"" a source said. Reports of suspicious packages and envelopes also came into two Senate office buildings late Wednesday morning. Capitol Police evacuated the first floor of the Hart Senate Office Building for more than an hour and questioned a man in the area who had a backpack containing sealed envelopes, but the man was not taken into custody. ""It just reminds you that with public service comes the real possibility that you could be a target,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kansas. ""But on the other side of it, we have an excellent police force, and I think they'll get to the bottom of it."" What is ricin? Beyond Washington, suspicious letters spotted . Sadie Holland, a judge in Lee County, Mississippi, told CNN Wednesday night that she received an envelope with a suspicious substance and a letter similar to the ones sent to the offices of Obama and Wicker. Last Wednesday, the judge received and opened a typewritten letter -- postmarked from Memphis, without a return address -- that included ""suspicious content,"" Lee County Sheriff Jim Johnson told reporters. The letter had ""great consistencies and similarities"" to the letters sent to Obama and Wicker, he said. Investigators were testing the contents of the letter to determine whether ricin was inside, he said. Holland told CNN the letter originally tested negative for ricin but was being retested Wednesday. Local authorities were awaiting the test results to determine whether to file state charges, Johnson said. ""The letter was handled, the chemical was handled by several different individuals in our justice court system,"" Johnson said, but added that ""we do not have any reason to believe that anyone's life is in danger."" Investigators are trying to determine whether suspicious letters found at Senate offices elsewhere in the country came from the same source, federal law enforcement sources said. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, said one of his home-state offices received a ""suspicious-looking"" letter and alerted authorities. ""We do not know yet if the mail presented a threat,"" said Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. A staffer for Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake flagged ""suspicious letters"" at the freshman Republican's Phoenix office, Flake spokeswoman Genevieve Rozansky said in a statement, but ""no dangerous material was detected in the letters."" Phoenix Fire Department spokesman Jonathan Jacobs said the envelope contained some type of powder. The person who initially found the envelope is being treated at a Phoenix-area hospital for a pre-existing condition and stress from the event, and others in the immediate vicinity were examined as well. In a statement issued Wednesday, the FBI said it has no indication of a connection between the tainted letters and Monday's bombings at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. But the discoveries further heightened security concerns at a time when Congress is considering politically volatile legislation to toughen gun laws and reform the immigration system. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the president had been briefed on the letters. ""Obviously, he understands and we all understand that there are procedures in place, as the FBI has said. There are -- there is is a process in place that ensures that materials that are suspicious or substances that are found to be suspicious at remote locations are then sent for secondary and more intense testing, and that process is under way now,"" Carney said. A Texas chiropractor's words in the spotlight . While authorities in Washington investigated the letters, the wife of a Texas chiropractor said the wording in them caught her by surprise. The phrase used in the letters is something chiropractor John Raymond Baker once said and has been widely quoted online, his wife, Tammy Bennett Baker, told CNN. On Wednesday, she sounded surprised when told by CNN that the wording was included in the letters under scrutiny in Washington. She said she was not aware of the letters and that the phrase refers to her husband's general philosophy of care. She said their office phone started ringing frequently Wednesday afternoon, and it was ""kind of freaking out our other employee."" A 2006 post on a blog for Baker's office says the comment originally was a criticism of insurance companies. Since then, the site says, it ""has been a quote that has been picked up and quoted (sometimes without attribution) around the net"" and ""people are using it about all kinds of injustices."" The letter sent to Wicker had a Memphis, Tennessee, postmark and no return address, Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Terrance Gainer wrote in an e-mail to senators and aides Tuesday. Wicker has been assigned a protective detail, according to a law enforcement source. A laboratory in Maryland confirmed the presence of ricin on the letter addressed to Wicker after initial field tests also indicated the poison was present, according to Gainer. However, the FBI said additional testing was needed because field and preliminary tests produce inconsistent results. ""Only a full analysis performed at an accredited laboratory can determine the presence of a biological agent such as ricin,"" according to the bureau. A law enforcement source said further tests would be conducted at the Army's biomedical research laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. After the arrest was announced Wednesday night, Wicker released a statement thanking ""the men and women of the FBI and U.S. Capitol Police for their professionalism and decisive action in keeping our family and staff safe from harm."" His offices in Mississippi and Washington ""remain open for business to all Mississippians,"" Wicker said in the statement. Mail for members of Congress and the White House has been handled at offsite postal facilities since the 2001 anthrax attacks, which targeted Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, and then-Majority Leader Tom Daschle, D-South Dakota. Senate mail service shut down . Senators were told Tuesday that the mail facility would be temporarily shut down ""to make sure they get everything squared away,"" Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday afternoon. ""The bottom line is, the process we have in place worked,"" she said. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also praised the postal workers and law enforcement officers for ""preventing this threat before it even reached the Capitol."" ""They proved that the proactive measures we put in place do, in fact, work,"" he said. Ricin is a highly toxic substance derived from castor beans. As little as 500 micrograms -- an amount the size of the head of a pin -- can kill an adult. There is no specific test for exposure and no antidote once exposed. It can be produced easily and cheaply, and authorities in several countries have investigated links between suspect extremists and ricin. But experts say it is more effective on individuals than as a weapon of mass destruction. Ricin was used in the 1978 assassination of Bulgarian dissident Georgi Markov. The author, who had defected nine years earlier, was jabbed by the tip of an umbrella while waiting for a bus in London and died four days later. A previous ricin scare hit the Capitol in 2004, when tests identified it in a letter in a Senate mail room that served then-Majority Leader Bill Frist's office. The discovery forced 16 employees to go through decontamination procedures, but no one reported any ill effects afterward, Frist said.","A Mississippi judge received a similar letter that is also being tested .

"Shortly after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi last September, a phone call was placed from the area. Whoever made the call was excited.  ""Mabruk, Mabruk!"" he repeated, meaning ""Congratulations"" in Arabic. Two sources with high-level access to Western intelligence services have told CNN the call was made to a senior figure in al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM. There is no proof that the call was specifically about the attack, in which U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed, but the sources say that is the assumption among those with knowledge of the call. Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack . One of the sources says the phone call was discovered when a Western intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made in the wake of the attack. That source told CNN that the call  was made specifically to Moktar Belmoktar, leader of an al Qaeda faction based in northern Mali. CIA officials told CNN they had no comment on whether any call had been intercepted. If the call was made and subsequently detected, it could fuel an already partisan debate in Washington over the Obama administration's initial public characterization of the Benghazi attack, and what information U.S. intelligence officials had about who was involved. Read more: Five things we learned from the Benghazi hearings . Critics say initial administration comments did not reflect the true intelligence about the incident, and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism. On Monday, Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, and Kelly Ayotte, R-New Hampshire, issued a statement with more questions about the attack, saying: . ""We do not know what person or persons, representing what executive branch agency or agencies, changed the unclassified talking points to remove references to Al-Qaeda and a terrorist attack in describing the attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi."" Read more: Benghazi tries to escape its ghosts, past and present . The administration says the unclassified talking points were the basis for comments made by the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice, on television talk shows in the immediate aftermath of the attack. The senators added: ""Al-Qaeda, its affiliated groups, and local militias were able to establish sanctuaries almost uncontested in the ungoverned spaces of eastern Libya. Some of these individuals were involved in the attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi."" Belmoktar's links to Libya . A veteran jihadist who had lost an eye while fighting in Afghanistan as a teenager, Belmoktar had established relationships with some of the more radical Libyan militia, and at the time of the Benghazi attack was putting together an elite unit specifically to attack Western interests in the Sahel and North Africa. Read more: What really happened in Benghazi? A few months later, that unit carried out the attack on the In Amenas natural gas facility in southern Algeria in which 33 foreign workers were killed. The group traveled through southern Libya on their way to the plant, according to counterterrorism officials. Chadian officials say that Belmoktar himself is now dead, killed Saturday as French and Chadian special forces penetrated the remote Adrar des Ifoghas mountain range in northeastern Mali. But French Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Monday there was no confirmation that either Belmoktar or another senior figure in AQIM, Abou Zeid, had been killed during the French campaign against Islamist hideouts in northern Mali. ""I have no proof of the deaths of those two men,"" Le Drian said. Nor is there proof that Belmoktar directed or was involved in the Benghazi attack. His group never claimed any responsibility for it. But in the weeks after that attack on September 11, several senior U.S. and Libyan officials suggested that members of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb may have been involved, without offering details. The president of Libya's parliament, Mohammed al-Magarief, asserted that U.S. intelligence had intercepted communications between elements of AQIM and Ansar al-Sharia, a group widely blamed for playing a part in the attack. On September 19 Matthew Olsen, director of the National Counterterrorism Center, told a congressional committee: ""We are looking at indications that individuals involved in the attack may have had connections to al Qaeda or al Qaeda's affiliates; in particular, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb."" And in November, Gen. Carter Ham, commander of U.S. Africa Command, said it was ""very likely that some of the terrorists who participated in the attack in Benghazi have at least some linkages to AQIM."" ""That is not to say that it was AQIM which planned, or organized or led the activity but clearly some of the individuals had some linkages,"" he said. Soon after the Benghazi attack, Belmoktar was relieved of his position as emir of the Sahel and a deputy leader of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. The group's overall leader, Abdelmalek Droukdel, appears to have lost patience with Belmoktar's ""freelance"" kidnapping of Westerners, which are reputed to have netted several million dollars. A written decree demoting Belmoktar was taken to Gao, the city in northern Mali where Belmoktar was based, and read out to the jihadist ranks there. Some counterterrorism experts believe that Droukdel suspected Belmoktar of a role in the Benghazi attack and was anxious that such a high-profile operation would promote a severe backlash from the United States, setting back AQIM's efforts to establish a foothold in Mali and Libya. Belmoktar was one of several leading militants based in Mali who spent time in Libya in the aftermath of Moammar Gadhafi's overthrow, developing relationships with militant Islamist brigades and buying weapons with the proceeds of smuggling and kidnapping operations. According to sources in direct contact with Western intelligence agencies, Belmoktar was in Libya for four months from December 2011. They say his visit was facilitated by the leader of a radical Islamist militia with influence in Benghazi and the East. According to the sources, he met a Libyan veteran of jihad in Afghanistan who had set up camps near Sabha in southern Libya providing training for jihadists from Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and Mali as well as Libyans and ethnic Tuaregs. Western intelligence officials believe the camps may have been used by those who attacked the In Amenas gas facility in January, according to the sources. Across North Africa and as far east as Syria, counterterrorism agencies are seeing a fluid movement of fighters, weapons and expertise among jihadist groups. The New York Times reported in January that several of the militants involved in the Algerian attack had also been in Benghazi in September, citing a senior Algerian official. The official said one of the militants captured had described the Egyptians' role in both assaults, according to the Times. Asked about the report at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on January 23, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said:  ""I cannot confirm it. I can give you the background that I was able to obtain. This information is coming from the Algerian government related to their questioning of certain of the terrorists that they took alive."" She also alluded to links between the attack in Algeria and sources of weapons in Libya. ""The Pandora's box of weapons coming out of these countries in the Middle East and North Africa is the source of one of our biggest threats. There is no doubt that the Algerian terrorists had weapons from Libya. ... So we just have to do a much better job,"" she said. The combination of different jihadist groups and factions, in shifting coalitions of the willing, has become a growing feature of the militant landscape, and one that makes tracking individuals and groups more difficult. Instability in North Africa -- especially in Libya and Mali -- has afforded these groups new space in which to operate.","Sources: A call was made after the Benghazi attack to a senior figure in AQIM .

"(CNN) -- The debate over the controversial practice of child marriage in Saudi Arabia was pushed back into the spotlight this week, with the kingdom's top cleric saying that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. ""It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,"" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks quoted Wednesday in the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. ""A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong and they are being unfair to her."" The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom in recent weeks. Late last month, a Saudi judge refused to annul the marriage of an 8-year-old girl to a 47-year-old man. The judge, Sheikh Habib Abdallah al-Habib, rejected a petition from the girl's mother, whose lawyer said the marriage was arranged by her father to settle a debt with ""a close friend."" The judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty. Al-Sheikh was asked during a Monday lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. ""We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""We should know that Shariah law has not brought injustice to women."" Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, recently told CNN that his organization has heard many other cases of child marriages. ""We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,"" Wilcke said. Wilcke explained that while Saudi ministries may make decisions designed to protect children, ""It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court."" Last month, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. ""The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,"" al-Harithi said. ""Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed."" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN last month that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to ""keep us backward and in the dark ages."" She said the marriages cause girls to ""lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression."" The Saudi Ministry of Justice has made no public comment on the issue. CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom contributed to this report.","Grand mufti speaks out after judge refuses to annul marriage of man, 47, to girl, 8 .

"The leader of anti-government demonstrations in Thailand on Sunday urged Yingluck Shinawatra to resign, the latest move in a relentless campaign to oust the prime minister. Protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister under the previous Democrat-led government, gave Yingluck two days to ""return power to the people unconditionally,"" Suthep's group said. The face-to-face meeting came the same day protesters tried to force their way into the government headquarters and a police club compound, hoping to find Yingluck. Police fired tear gas to disperse them. ""The most violently active areas are around the Government House,"" said Lt. Gen. Paradon Pattanathabut, referring to the government headquarters. The prime minister was not at the police club compound as she was rumored to be when demonstrators stormed the building. The state television station, Thai Public Broadcasting Service, continued with its regular programming. But officials there were in negotiations with the protesters, said to number in the hundreds, said government spokesman Teerat Rattanasevi. Laying siege to Government House would be a symbolic victory for the demonstrators. It's the seat of power. Yingluck moved her offices to another location when the unrest bubbled over. Undeterred, protesters -- with handkerchiefs covering their noses and mouths to ward off the sting of tear gas -- threw rocks across the fence that rings Government House toward the phalanx of riot police on the other side. In response, police lobbed tear gas, causing protesters to scurry. A few minutes later, they returned. So it went for the better part of the day. 10 questions: What's behind the protests in Thailand? Deadly clashes . Yingluck has said authorities will ""absolutely not use violence"" to disperse the demonstrators. But the situation is delicate after Thai police issued an arrest warrant against Suthep, the protest leader. On Saturday, three people were killed and more than 60 wounded in clashes between protesters and Yingluck's supporters in the Thai capital, Bangkok. Each side blamed the other for provoking it. Until Saturday's incident, the monthlong protests had been mostly peaceful and without fatalities. In recent days, the demonstrators have been seeking out increasingly high-profile targets, such as several government ministries. ""We have spread the message to protesters that we are going to retake the government complex and the ministry of finance back,"" Paradon said. On Friday, they jumped over the gate of the army headquarters, demanding the military's help in overthrowing the government. So far, the army has stayed on the sidelines. But the military intervened in 2006 when it ousted Yingluck's brother -- and then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra -- in a bloodless coup. Yingluck's critics accuse her of being Thaksin's puppet and say she's simply a placeholder for her brother until he can return from self-imposed exile. In an interview with CNN's Anna Coren on Friday, Yingluck denied those allegations. Thailand travel warnings issued as thousands of protesters gather . Origins of the protests . The protests started as a response to a government-backed amnesty bill that could have extended a pardon to Thaksin and opened the door for his return. Thaksin can't return home now because he risks a two-year prison sentence on a corruption conviction. The Thai senate rejected the bill on November 11, but opposition demonstrators have called since then for Yingluck's government to be replaced. Yingluck survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday. A spokesman for her Pheu Thai Party said she would not resign or dissolve the parliament. ""She will stay in power,"" Prompong Nopparit said.","Laying siege to Government House would be a symbolic victory .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A daring cross-border raid by one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's associates has -- so far -- yet to sour Sino-Russian relations. According to Chinese state media, Ustin, one of three rescued  Amur tigers released by the Russian leader earlier this year, has attacked a herd of goats on Heixiazi Island in the northern province of Heilongjiang. The region shares a border with Russia's far-eastern Amur region, and it is thought that the tiger crossed the Heilongjiang river to hunt. Russian conservationists rescued five cubs in 2012, and the Russian president was on hand for their release following rehabilitation and hunting training. The animals were fitted with tracking devices and in October, Ustin, along with another released tiger, Kuzya, were found to have made their way to China. A wildlife protection expert from China's Northeast Forestry University, Zhu Shibing, said that footprints and other traces left near the goat's shelter belonged to Ustin. Chinese news agency Xinhua reported that the skulls of the two dead goats were crushed and had puncture wounds the ""size of a human finger"" -- a testament to the power of the tiger's bite. Three further goats remain missing. ""Our monitoring data and this attack all tell that Ustin is in good physical condition, and has a large range of activities on Heixiazi Island,"" Xinhua quoted Zhu as saying. He also warned villagers to keep their distance, should they spot the goat killer, and to not throw food at it. Kuzya, the other tiger known to have crossed into China, was previously blamed for an attack on a Chinese hen-house. The Russian leader has been involved in conservation efforts of the species. He is often photographed with tigers and other wild animals, and takes part in a number of outdoor activities in an apparent effort to bolster his image as a strong, intrepid leader.

"A new French law making it a crime to publicly deny the Ottoman Empire's genocide of Armenians a century ago was ruled unconstitutional Tuesday by France's Constitutional Council. The measure, which triggered condemnation from modern Turkey, was given final passage by the French Senate and signed into law by President Nicolas Sarkozy last month. Sarkozy's office immediately issued a statement calling for a new version of the law ""taking into account the decision of the Constitutional Council."" ""The president believes that genocide denial is intolerable and must be punished in this regard,"" the statement said. The country's highest judicial body reviewed it at the request of National Assembly members and French senators. ""The Council deems the law unconstitutional,"" a short statement from the court said Tuesday. The Turkish government called it ""an example of irresponsibility"" and vowed to ""express our reaction against it in every platform"" when the bill passed the National Assembly -- the lower house of the French parliament -- in December. The Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday that called it ""pleasing that a grave mistake has been corrected by the highest legal authority in France."" ""We hope France will from now on be in a constructive attitude for the dispute between Turkey and Armenia on history to be considered on a fair and scientific basis, and will make contributions that support a solution rather than further deepening the problem,"" the Turkish ministry said.  ""Such an attitude will contribute to the Turkish-French relations to improve in all areas as well."" Armenia's government hailed the passage last month, saying France ""reaffirmed its pivotal role as a genuine defender of universal human values."" It is already illegal in France to deny the Holocaust of World War II, a crime punishable by a year in prison and a fine of 45,000 euros (about $60,000). The same punishment would apply under the Armenian legislation. The Turkish-Armenian controversy over the killings that took place last century has reverberated wherever diaspora communities representing both groups exist. Armenian groups and many scholars argue that Turks committed genocide starting in 1915, when more than a million ethnic Armenians were massacred in the waning days of the Ottoman Empire. Turkey officially denies that a genocide took place, saying hundreds of thousands of Armenian Christians and Turkish Muslims died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of World War I. Sen. Herve Marseille, one of the bill's supporters, argued that since France already recognizes the Ottoman-era killings as genocide, the same standard that applies to Holocaust denial should apply to the Armenian case. ""When we contest the Jewish genocide, we can be punished,"" Marseille said. ""And up until now, when we contest the Armenian genocide, there is no punishment. So we can't have a legal punishment for one and not for the other. Everyone is equal in front of the law."" But Sen. Jacques Mezard, who opposed the legislation, said freedom of expression was at stake. ""It calls into question historical and scientific research. Tomorrow will there be a question of a Vendee genocide?"" he asked, referring to a revolt against the French revolutionary government in 1793. ""Will we put the Spanish and the United States in the stocks for the massacre of Native Americans? We must reject this text and consign it to history books."" After December's vote in the National Assembly, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused France of committing its own ""genocide"" during its war against Algerian independence in the 1950s and 1960s. Erdogan announced that Turkey was reviewing its ties with France. Ankara recalled its ambassador to Paris for consultations, canceled bilateral visits and wouldn't cooperate with France in joint projects within the European Union. The French Foreign Ministry shot back at Erdogan's comments, saying France ""assumes with clarity and transparency its duty to remember the tragedies that have marked its history."" And Sarkozy has said that his country doesn't need an OK from another nation to develop its policies. In addition to being NATO allies, Turkey and France have trade ties valued at $13.5 billion, according to Turkish statistics. The genocide debate is also a source of tension between Turkey and the United States, another NATO ally. The White House, for example, annually beats back efforts in Congress to pass a resolution that would formally recognize the 1915 massacre of Armenians as genocide.","""A grave mistake has been corrected,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry says .

"(CNN)The Obama administration hopes to transfer dozens of detainees from Guantanamo Bay in the next six months as part of a stepped-up effort to reduce the population there, according to a U.S. official. As many as five detainees are expected to be moved from the detention facility in the next few days, with several more transfers anticipated in early 2015, the official said on condition of anonymity. The news comes less than a week after the United States announced it had repatriated four detainees from Guantanamo to Afghanistan, leaving 132 detainees at the U.S. naval base in southeastern Cuba. President Barack Obama hinted at the intensified effort in an exclusive interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday, saying, ""I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it."" ""It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being held,"" Obama said. ""It is contrary to our values and it is wildly expensive. We're spending millions for each individual there. And we have drawn down the population there significantly."" Once a detainee is deemed no longer a risk, they are either transferred back to their country of origin, or a third country that is willing to take them. Sixty-four of the 132 remaining detainees have been ruled eligible for transfer. Of the 64 eligible, 54 are from Yemen. But the United States is not willing, at this point, to send them back to Yemen because of concerns that the government -- under pressure from al Qaeda and Houthi militants -- cannot ensure they do not join al Qaeda elements there. The administration for the last several months has been trying to find a country that will take the Yemenis and provide security and human rights assurances for them. The official said there are ongoing talks to try to find countries to take all 64 detainees approved for transfer. An additional 20 detainees from Yemen still are considered too dangerous to be transferred, as are several detainees accused of involvement in the 9/11 attacks, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The number of remaining detainees is down significantly from the nearly 800 that had been held there after Guantanamo was repurposed to hold detainees from the United States' war on terror. The administration of then-President George W. Bush claimed that, since Gitmo detainees weren't held on American soil, they could be considered ""enemy combatants"" and be denied some legal protections. Almost all of the 800 detainees were held without charges. This legal limbo, as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment, spurred criticism of the facility popularly known as Gitmo. Obama pledged to shut it down as part of his 2008 campaign, but saw his plans thwarted by opposition from Congress, which among other things prevented him from transferring remaining detainees to U.S. prisons.","As many as 5 detainees are expected to be moved in the next few days, official says .

"Few question that there was a major chemical attack in Syria last week, and the United States has made clear that it blames the government of President Bashar al-Assad. Now, the question is how President Barack Obama will respond. For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces. However, last week's attack on a Damascus suburb that reportedly killed and wounded more than 3,000 people obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama was evaluating ""a response to the clear use on a mass scale with repugnant results of chemical weapons,"" adding that ""there is very little doubt that the Syrian regime ... used those weapons."" Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the attack ""inexcusable"" and ""undeniable,"" and said there was ""a clear reason that the world has banned entirely chemical weapons."" He said that evidence ""strongly indicates"" chemical weapons were used in Syria and that ""we know the Syrian regime maintains custody"" of such weapons and has the rockets to use them. Read Kerry's remarks . Obama ""will be making an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use"" of chemical weapons, Kerry added, saying the president ""believes there must be accountability"" for those who use them. Options available to Obama range from ordering limited missile strikes to continued diplomatic efforts labeled by critics as a ""do-nothing"" approach. Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday. Assuming the president decides to go ahead with a military response, any action could come as early as mid-week, though it could be later, the official cautioned. Factors weighing into the timing of any action include a desire to get it done before the president leaves for Russia next week and before the administration has to make a decision on whether to suspend aid to Egypt because of the ongoing political turmoil there, the official explained. The administration also wants it to be a quick response to the use of chemical weapons, the senior administration official said. American officials are consulting with allies to ensure they are supportive of any U.S. action, which the senior administration official said would be very limited in scope and a direct reaction to the use of chemical weapons. And three representatives of allied governments involved in those top-level consultations said the goal is to reach a consensus as soon as possible. ""No one is talking about a long process,"" one European diplomat told CNN. Marie Harf, a State Department spokeswoman, said any U.S. response would be ""a determination on how to respond to a blatant use of chemical weapons, and it's not necessarily to change the entire situation on the ground in Syria."" That might be a mistake, said Michael Doran, an analyst at the Brookings Institution's Saban Center for  Middle East Policy. A U.S. strike ""can't just be one and done,"" but should be part of a plan to remove al-Assad, he told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""The president has been very reulctant to get involved. Public opinion has been against it. There's not a lot of support on the Hill,"" Doran said. ""And yet, here we are again. Time and time again, we get dragged further and further in."" The result could be ""a Vietnam-type problem, where we kind of back our way into this, if we don't come up with a plan about how to win."" Kerry spoke with his British, Jordanian, Qatari and Saudi counterparts Monday and with the secretary-general of the Arab League, Harf said. ""Obviously, the intelligence assessment is ongoing,"" she said. ""But he reiterated that the president is studying the facts and will be making an informed decision about how to respond going forward."" The Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's chemical weapons attack, another senior administration official said. The declassification would happen before any U.S. military action would take place. A senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told CNN that the evidence ""includes but is not limited to"" satellite images of activity at Syrian military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots. Earlier Monday, a White House official ruled out sending ground troops to Syria or implementing a no-fly zone to blunt al-Assad's aerial superiority over rebels fighting to oust his regime. The official insisted that all other options were under consideration by Obama but put no time frame on a decision. Meanwhile, a senior Defense Department official told CNN's Chris Lawrence Monday that four U.S. Navy destroyers ""maintain readiness and, if required, could execute a mission within hours"" of being ordered to do so. But the official added that the U.S. military remained ""in a holding pattern"" as Obama considers both military and nonmilitary options. Opinion: How Al-Assad used chemical weapons to poison debate on Syria . Also, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said while visiting Indonesia that any U.S. action ""will be in concert with the international community and within the framework of legal justification."" While U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that the use of chemical weapons was a crime against humanity and must be punished, certain opposition by Syrian ally Russia and possibly China undermined the possibility that the Security Council would support a military mission. Instead, a limited coalition of NATO partners such as Germany, France and Britain -- all of which have called for action against Syria -- and some Arab League members appeared more likely to provide the political backing needed by Obama to order U.S. missile strikes. A senior administration official told CNN on Monday that the goals of any coalition military action would be to punish al-Assad and show him that there was a cost for using chemical weapons while preventing him from doing so again. In addition, a military strike would seek to degrade the Syrian regime's capabilities enough to weaken it without causing it to fall to an opposition considered unprepared to assume power, the official said. Possible coalition partners include NATO allies Britain, France, Germany and Canada, as well as regional powers Qatar, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Last month, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey provided Congress with a list of declassified U.S. military options for Syria that emphasized the high costs and risks of what he said would amount to ""an act of war"" at a time of deep budget cuts. U.S. official: Almost no doubt al-Assad regime used chemical weapons . Dempsey's letter, dated July 19, listed U.S. assets in the region including Patriot missile defense batteries in Turkey and Jordan, as well as F-16 jet fighters positioned to defend Jordan from possible cross-border trouble. In addition, the Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region. According to U.S. officials, updated options offered the president in recent days included: . â€¢ Cruise missiles fired from one of four Navy destroyers deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. The missiles would be used to strike ""command and control"" facilities such as command bunkers, or the Syrian regime's means of delivering chemical weapons: artillery batteries and launchers. There is no indication that the missiles would strike at actual chemical weapons stockpiles. â€¢ Military jets firings weapons from outside Syrian airspace. This option carries additional risks and is considered less likely. ""They have to be careful to do this in concert with our allies,"" Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN on Sunday, adding that ""I don't think the White House is going to want to risk American lives by sending pilots over Syria, so that really limits our options to cruise strikes and think that's probably where the White House is going to go."" U.N. chemical weapons inspectors reach alleged attack site . Cruise missile strikes could be ""very punishing"" on al-Assad's missile supplies and aircraft without going after the chemical weapons stockpiles to risk dispersing them, Schiff said. To Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, the situation is forcing Obama to shift from being an ""avoider-in-chief"" regarding military involvement in Syria. ""It's almost inevitable that the president will authorize some form of military action,"" Miller told National Public Radio in an interview broadcast Monday. He said he expected a significant response that amounts to ""a warning that lays down this time a red line that the president intends to enforce, not one that turns pink."" ""It cannot simply be a couple of cruise missiles into a storage shed somewhere,"" Miller said, adding that the goal was to deter al-Assad rather than topple him or radically shift the balance in Syria at this time. ""The president's not on the verge of becoming the cavalry to rescue the country."" Schiff agreed that Obama has little choice but to respond strongly. ""In terms of the credibility of the White House,"" he said, ""the cost of not acting now, I think, exceeds the cost of acting.""","U.S. evidence includes satellite imagery, official says .

"(CNN) -- We all understand that the closer Congress gets to an election, the more risk-averse it becomes. Members just want to get re-elected and aren't looking to take any chances. That's why lame-duck, post-election sessions are sadly often the most productive: Once members feel safe (or are even on their way out of office), they can actually do some real work. So the aerodynamics of Congress as it gets close to an election are this: Stop. Go home. Avoid real votes. Par for the course. Except for this: Republicans have recently made a fetish of complaining that President Barack Obama won't let them vote on things. He does too much without us, they say. Too many executive actions. Too many new regulations. They even voted to sue him over his so-called abuse of power. ""Are you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change?"" House Speaker John Boehner intoned mightily on the House floor. ""Are you willing to let anyone tear apart what our founders have built?"" But wait. Are these the same people who now are, um, ducking a vote on congressional authorization for action against ISIS? While Boehner told CNN's Dana Bash that while ""it would be in the nation's interest"" to ""speak"" on this question, he said it was up to the President to request it. ""We've not gotten that."" So, does the White House intend to send something wide-ranging to Boehner? Not exactly. Instead there will be a vote to authorize the arming of the Syrian rebels. While the President would ""welcome"" further congressional action, a senior administration official says, ""we believe we have the authority that is necessary"" to wage war against ISIS. Alphonse, meet Gaston. Hagel: If ISIS allowed to continue it will be threat to 'homeland' Not that it's a surprise. We all know that in the world in which we live, Congress -- with an approval rating of 14% -- wants to take responsibility for things that are good and avoid responsibility for things that are risky. But here's where each party makes us scratch our heads. In the past, Republicans have believed -- strongly -- in the thesis that the chief executive has strong unilateral war-making authority. (George W. Bush went to Congress to approve the Iraq war, but only after much debate and pressure -- and even his vice president opposed the idea.) So Boehner's position has historical precedent. Except when you consider it in terms of the recent domestic debate: Obama can't issue a domestic regulation, but he can unilaterally decide to go to war? Huh? The Democrats take the exact opposite posture. The President can issue strong policy regulations and orders when it comes to health care and the environment, but he shouldn't act without Congress when it comes to war. Ah, except in this case, because a Democrat is President. And because Democrats are worried a vote on the use of force could hurt them with their base in the election, which already looks perilous for their party. Some unendangered Democrats have publicly called for a vote, but their leaders are much more sheepish. ""Right now we believe, as the President has stated, that he has the authority he needs,"" says House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. For now, at least. So case closed? Not quite. There are plans this week to vote on the narrower proposition that has bipartisan support: arming the Syrian rebels. But what about the larger issue of voting to authorize war against ISIS? Yea or nay? Check back -- after the election. That's when politicians vote.","Borger: In topsy-turvy world of Washington, parties doing their best to avoid Congress vote on ISIS .

"China launched its first lunar probe early Monday, which, if all goes well, will make it only the third nation -- after the United States and the Soviet Union -- to soft-land on the moon. The launch of the unmanned probe took place at 1:30 a.m. Monday (12:30 p.m. ET Sunday), state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The Chang'e-3 blasted off from a Long March 3B rocket in Sichuan province located in southwest China and is expected to land on the moon's surface in mid-December. The new space effort comes just over a decade after the country first sent an astronaut into space. Unlike the soft-landing of the U.S. and the Soviet Union's unmanned spacecraft, Chang'e-3 will be able to survey the landscape first and determine the safest spot. Researchers say an impact crater named Sinus Iridum, or Bay of Rainbows, is its likely destination. In 2010, China's previous lunar mission captured images of the crater while scouting potential landing sites for the 2013 probe. China sets course for lunar landing this year . On landing, the spacecraft will release Jade Rabbit (called Yutu in Chinese) -- a six-wheeled lunar rover equipped with four cameras and two mechanical legs that can dig up soil samples, a designer for the rover told Xinhua last month. A public poll determined the the solar-powered robot's name, which comes from the white pet rabbit of the Chinese moon godess Chang'e. The slow-moving rover will patrol the moon's surface for at least three months, according to Xinhua. Timeline: China's race into space . In the United States, scientists are concerned the Chinese mission could interfere with a NASA study of the moon's dust environment. Chang'e-3's descent is likely to create a noticeable plume on the moon's surface that could skew the results of research already being carried out by NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE), Jeff Plescia, chair of NASA's Lunar Exploration Analysis Group told Space.com, a space news site.

"Bill Cosby is returning to NBC with a new sitcom, a network representative told CNN on Wednesday night. The comedian will play the patriarch of a multigenerational family. The show brings the 76-year-old comedian back to the same network where his groundbreaking 1980s sitcom ""The Cosby Show"" had an eight-year run. ""The Cosby Show"" portrayed an upper-middle-class African-American family, and it's credited with helping revive NBC's fortunes and blazing a path for other shows featuring African-Americans. Cosby played Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, the patriarch of that TV family.  Phylicia Rashad played his wife, Clair. She would play his wife for a second time on the 1990s CBS sitcom, simply called ""Cosby."" Cosby's career is in its fifth decade. He started out performing stand-up comedy in small clubs in Greenwich Village in New York. He eventually landed a pivotal co-starring role in the 1960s television series ""I Spy,"" where he was the first-ever African-American lead in a weekly dramatic series. He won three best actor Emmy Awards for the role of undercover CIA Agent Alexander Scott. Cosby received Kennedy Center Honors in 1998 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. He most recently received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, which is awarded to performers who use comedy to influence American society.

"What's good for the heart may not be so healthy for other organs, says the latest study that links omega-3 fatty acids to an elevated risk of prostate cancer. It's not just an apple a day that keeps the doctor away anymore — recently, fish oils found in species like salmon, trout and tuna have been associated with a lower risk of heart disease and even Alzheimer's. In fact, the most recent revisions to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans in 2010 recommended consumers substitute high-fat protein sources with more seafood, including fatty fish. Not surprisingly, fish oil has since skyrocketed to be the most popular supplement in the United States. A new study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, however, shows that these fish fats may not be improving everyone's health — in the trial, those with high concentrations of marine-derived omega-3s in their blood showed a 43% higher risk of developing prostate cancer than those with the lowest levels. TIME.com: Omega-3s as study aid? Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and while the latest statistics show that most men will eventually develop prostate cancer if they live long enough, only a specific type of cancer, known as high-grade, carries high risk of serious health problems. While a quarter of a million Americans are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year, only about 30,000 of those cases are fatal, and almost all of them involve high-grade cancer. The latest research found that the association between omega-3s and prostate cancer held for both high- and low-grade prostate cancers. It's not that omega-3s are harmful, but that the fatty acids may have more complex effects on the body than previously thought. ""We have this tendency to talk about good foods and bad foods, good nutrients and bad nutrients,"" says Doctor Theodore Brasky, a research assistant professor at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and the study's head author. The nutrients commonly found in fish fight potentially damaging inflammation, but they may also increase oxidative damage to the DNA in cells, similar to the effects of stress, that can create fertile ground for cancers to grow. TIME.com: Omega-3 supplements don't lower heart disease risk . The study measured omega-3 blood levels in the participating men, and did not include information on the volunteers' eating habits, so researchers could not differentiate between the effects of fatty acids from fish from those of supplements. However, the overwhelming majority of the participants did not take fish oil supplements. Based on the results, Brasky says that men with a family history of prostate cancer should discuss with their doctor whether fish oil supplements are safe for them, since these pills tend to contain concentrated doses of omega-3 — supplements contain between 30% to 60% of a serving of fish, and if a fish oil supplement is taken everyday, that adds up to a lot of daily fish oil. Brasky also suggested that men cut down on their fatty fish intake, though not eliminate it entirely. Andrew Vickers, a statistician specializing in prostate cancer at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, agrees, saying that fish oil supplements may pose a relatively higher risk for prostate cancer than fish in the diet. ""The problem comes when you take components of a diet and put it in a pill,"" Vickers says. While the omega-3 fatty acids may increase oxidative damage to prostate cells, for example, anti-oxidants, which might be part of an overall healthy diet that includes fish as well as fruits and vegetables, might counteract these effects. Because the study did not query the men about their diets, it's difficult to tell whether the men were consuming other healthy foods as well. TIME.com: Omega-3s may not protect brain health after all . Most health experts recommend that people try to eat a healthy, balanced diet to protect against diseases and most cancers, and turn to supplements only if that's not possible, since supplements may provide only partial benefits. That's why the American Cancer Society does not currently recommend that men take fish oil supplements, according to Marjorie McCullough, the society's strategic director of nutritional epidemiology. Brasky's work isn't the first to suggest that omega-3 fatty acids may have both positive and negative effects on the body. In a September 2012 article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers found that omega-3 supplements were not associated with lower risks of stroke or cardiac death. Those results were confirmed by another study in the New England Journal of Medicine that showed omega-3 supplements did not reduce risk of dying from a heart event among a group of people at high risk of heart disease. Researchers involved in those studies, however, acknowledged that they were not able to account for the effect of other medications to treat heart problems, such as cholesterol-lowering drugs and blood pressure medications, in keeping death rates down. In the same way, more research will have to tease apart how other nutrients in a balanced diet — including antioxidants — work together to influence the effect of individual nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids.

"What do you get when you combine a cryptocurrency, 752 left turns and a 16-year-old Reddit user? For NASCAR Sprint Cup driver Josh Wise, it all adds up to sponsorship for one of the most exciting races of the year and a new bunch of tech-savvy fans. The story begins with a teenage racing fan from Niles, Illinois. Reddit user Denis Pavel was watching some of the early races in the 2014 NASCAR season and noticed a black Ford Fusion with no sponsorship and a driver ""racing the wheels off the car."" Pavel was also a member of the subreddit /r/NASCAR and had seen the online community rally behind other drivers and the various fundraising and other campaigns they endorsed. His idea was grander. The teenager wanted to get the No. 98 car sponsored at one of the fastest tracks on the circuit: the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Drivers race side-by-side on the 2.66-mile track, sometimes reaching speeds of more than 200 mph. Enter the cryptocurrency. Introduced in late 2013 and named for a silly Internet meme, Dogecoin is digital currency like Bitcoin -- basically cash for the Internet. Money can be transferred nearly anywhere in the world for less than a penny per transaction and has been used prominently for charitable and notable causes. Related: Man selling home for $135,000 in Dogecoins . ""I knew that Dogecoin had done some significant fundraisers, like sending the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics,"" Pavel said. ""I was thinking what kind of response I would get if I did ask the (Reddit) community about sponsoring a Sprint Cup car. They were all with it."" Armed with support, Pavel reached out to the owner of the No. 98 car, Phil Parsons, through Twitter. After exchanging telephone numbers, Pavel told Parsons about the plan to sponsor the car and how it was going to happen. ""I asked if he knew about Reddit or Dogecoin. He said no,"" Pavel said. ""He told me the pricing of a full wrap and just a logo on the quarter panel. I don't know if he thought I was pulling his leg."" Parsons told Pavel that a full wrap, meaning main sponsorship all over the car, would cost $50,000. Pavel felt confident the /r/NASCAR community would get there with the help of Dogecoin. Within a week, the community raised more than $55,000, or 67 million Dogecoins, to sponsor the car and put the Dogecoin Ford Fusion in the Aaron's 499 race in May. Wise, who admits he had not been very active on the Internet, has been pumped up by the online support. ""The more we've walked through this (fundraising effort), it has really been special to us,"" Wise said. ""People are noticing our effort. We're a tiny little team with 7 or 8 employees. The amount of support we're getting from the Reddit community ... we're just trying to do the best job we can."" For his part, Wise promoted the effort on Twitter and also did an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on /r/dogecoin. He even claimed the Reddit user name ""dogedriver"" to keep the momentum going. Ben Doernberg, a board member at the Dogecoin Foundation, said that raising the money for the sponsorship was done in record time. Beyond sports ventures, Dogecoin has raised money to build clean water wells in Kenya and for a charity that trains service animals to work with children with autism and other disabilities. ""We are all about fun and goofiness,"" Doernberg said. ""At the same time, we want to make sure that digital currency is really giving back to the world. We do feel like this is a technology that can make the world a better place, and we want to put that into practice by doing fundraisers."" Doernberg said the NASCAR sponsorship is one of the largest fundraisers they've done to date. Since the money was raised on the Internet, it was only fair that the color scheme of the car be chosen there as well. A poll posted on /r/dogecoin asked users to choose between gold, silver or black as the main color. Black garnered more than 57% of the vote, and the design was finalized.  Reddit users also helped develop the fire suits that will be worn by the team on race day. Wise said users asked him during his AMA what he wanted the design to look like. He told them just have fun with it. ""I wasn't going to hold them back on anything they wanted,"" he said. ""It actually a little more conservative than I probably expected -- something wild and off the wall, but they kept it pretty tame, actually."" The car and suits prominently feature the Shiba Inu dog face commonly associated with the ""doge"" Internet meme, along with a rocket ship and the phrase ""To the Moon,"" commonly used for the popularity of Dogecoin. But Wise and Parsons weren't done with Dogecoin after just one race. The Sprint Cup Series All-Star race at the Charlotte Motor Speedway on May 17 pits the previous year's race winners and two top qualifiers in a winner-take-all race. One driver voted in by the fans gets to participate as well. Wise and Parsons said they would race the Dogecoin car if Reddit users vote Wise into the race. The Dogecoin car is also likely to be made into a die-cast 1:24 scale car as part of a NASCAR deal with Lionel Racing Collectibles. Fans of the NASCAR '14 video game will also get the chance to race the Dogecoin car for themselves when it is added in an upcoming DLC pack. ""As the company behind the NASCAR video games and mobile games, we love to see more technology-oriented partners getting involved in NASCAR,"" said Ed Martin, executive vice president of Eutechnyx, developer of the video game. ""I think it will bring NASCAR to the attention of a lot of people that haven't been exposed before."" For Pavel, who has loved NASCAR racing all his life, the video game might be the closest he gets to his dream. ""I want to get into NASCAR and want to head to my local tracks like Rockford Speedway. I hopefully one day want to get into a real race car,"" he said. For now, Pavel will cheer on the No. 98 Dogecar and Josh Wise at Talladega on May 4.","Reddit and Dogecoin sponsor NASCAR racer at Talladega .

"A woman told CNN on Monday that Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her 45 years ago, when she was a teenager. Joan Tarshis, a journalist and publicist, said she met Cosby in 1969 in Los Angeles when she was invited to have lunch by some friends of his. They saw each other again and she visited him on the set of ""The Bill Cosby Show."" On one occasion, Cosby invited Tarshis, who had been writing monologues for the comedian Godfrey Cambridge, back to his bungalow to work on some comedy routines. ""I thought, 'That's cool, getting to work with Bill Cosby on jokes,'"" Tarshis told CNN's Don Lemon. She said Cosby made her a drink that he knew she liked, a Bloody Mary topped with beer known as a Red Eye. Tarshis, who was 19 at the time, said that shortly after drinking the Red Eye, she ""passed out."" ""I woke up or came to very groggily with him removing my underwear,"" she said. 'You'll never get me again' Tarshis said that she tried to deter Cosby by saying she had an infection that his wife might catch, but that he then made her have oral sex with him. She said she left, vowing never to see him again. But he subsequently called her home in New York and invited her to watch him perform at the Theater at Westbury. Tarshis said she didn't know how to back out of it because she hadn't told her mother, a big fan of Cosby, what had happened. After accepting drinks at Cosby's hotel and in the limousine, Tarshis said she felt ""very, very, very drugged"" at the theater and asked the chauffeur to take her back to the car. She said she passed out in the car and when she woke up, it was the next morning and she was naked in bed with Cosby. ""I didn't say what I wanted to say"" to Cosby at the time, Tarshis told CNN's Lemon. ""What I said to myself was, 'You old expletive, you finally got me. You'll never get me again.'"" Repeated denials . Tarshis joins a group of women who have accused Cosby, 77, of sexual assault -- claims the comedian denies. ""Over the last several weeks, decade-old, discredited allegations against Mr. Cosby have resurfaced,"" John P. Schmitt, the lawyer, said in a statement Sunday. ""The fact that they are being repeated does not make them true. Mr. Cosby does not intend to dignify these allegations with any comment."" Cosby has repeatedly said the allegations are untrue, and he has never been prosecuted. He did settle a case in 2006, filed by Andrea Constand, a staffer for Temple University's women's basketball team, who accused him of drugging and molesting her at his suburban Philadelphia home. Constand's lawyers said they found 13 Jane Doe witnesses with similar stories, but no witnesses were ever called. The terms of the settlement have never been disclosed. Cosby and Constand's lawyers said in Monday that Schmitt's earlier statement ""was not intended to refer in any way to Andrea Constand."" ""As previously reported, differences between Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand were resolved to the mutual satisfaction of Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand years ago,"" the lawyers said in a joint statement. ""Neither Mr. Cosby nor Ms. Constand intends to comment further on the matter."" Rape allegations haunt Bill Cosby in the digital age . Silence in radio interview . Since 2005, a handful of women have made the claims. This year, the accusations resurfaced, and earlier this month, a seemingly harmless post on Cosby's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm. In its wake, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in the Washington Post and  interviews with CNN. Bowman claims she was drugged then raped, though she said she never saw drugs. ""I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes,"" she said. Bowman said she knew her body had been touched without her permission. This occurred several times in the course of their contact, she said. On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the claims about him. NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just ""shaking his head no."" ""There will be no further statement from Mr. Cosby or any of his representatives,"" Cosby's lawyer said Sunday. 'Who's going to believe me?' Tarshis told CNN she had kept quiet about what happened to her because she felt ""the guilt and the shame of the victim"" -- and because she didn't think anyone would take her word for it. ""Who's going to believe me?"" she said on CNN. ""Bill Cosby, the all-American dad, the all-American husband, 'Mr. Jell-O' that everybody loves. Who would believe me? They'd probably think I was out to get something."" But she said she decided to speak up now in order to support the other women and give them ""some more credibility."" ""I really have nothing to gain by doing this,"" she said. Before appearing on CNN, Tarshis made the allegations against Cosby in an account published on Hollywood Elsewhere on Sunday. On Monday, the Village Voice drew attention to a track on an album by Cosby from 1969 in which he jokes about a drug he heard about when he was a boy, known as ""Spanish Fly,"" that would make girls go crazy when put into their drink. In the routine, he goes on to talk about visiting Spain as an adult with another actor and wanting to get hold of the drug. Village Voice film editor Alan Scherstuhl said even as a child this statement from Cosby puzzled him. ""Even when I heard this bit as a kid, I wondered: Why would famous TV stars need a drug to get women interested in them?"" Scherstuhl wrote in the blog post about Cosby.

"(CNN) -- Justin Sylvester's wife is pregnant. With a baby. I'm told that's how it works. Mind you, this isn't Justin's first baby rodeo. This is the second child for him and Meghan. Another daughter. But it's still a wildly exciting time. Though maybe not quite as wildly exciting as an ACTUAL baby rodeo. Reckless? Perhaps. Quality entertainment? Definitely. Of course, now, Justin and Meghan are at that age (both 31) where your social media feed becomes a shameless, cascading waterfall of friends' baby photos and professional maternity shoots -- these gentle little reminders that maybe we ain't that young anymore. Plus, the occasional Instagram update confirming, yes, your college roommate, Diane, apparently had pasta for dinner. There's still a lot of that, too. ""OMG! Rigatoni! #YOLO"" So, being that this is what people seem to do when there's a bun in the oven, Justin asked Meghan if she was interested in having photos done to commemorate the pregnancy of their soon-to-be daughter, Ruby June Sylvester. Meghan said no. But Justin said yes. ""I was studying for my accounting exam and the idea popped in my head that it would be funny if I took them since she didn't want to."" He laughed about the idea for a couple of days, and finally called up his photographer friend, Kerri Lohmeier. This would be Justin's surprise present to his wife. All he needed were some Superman underpants and maybe a pair of Meghan's Lululemon shorts to achieve the ""full maternity effect."" Plus a few other odds and ends. You know. Props. Lohmeier recalls getting the photo shoot request. ""It was very unusual,"" she says. ""It's never happened."" But, as a true, seasoned professional, she embraced the weirdness, and promptly gathered the aforementioned props. Ice cream and pickles. I don't know much about being pregnant, but I suppose it somehow makes women eat like Jerry Garcia. To be fair, it actually sounds quite nice. Of course, in reality, pregnancy is a grind. And in some very minor way, Justin got a little taste of what it's like. ""By the end of the shoot, my stomach hurt, and my lower back hurt. I feel as if I had a brief glimpse into the sacrifice that women make on their bodies when they become pregnant."" Granted, he was doing a lot of pushing to get that gut out. Despite gaining 15 pounds of ""sympathy weight"" since injuring his shoulder doing CrossFit, Justin swears his belly's not really that big. But there's a fair amount of Abita Strawberry Harvest Lager and Austin's Pizza that says otherwise. Naturally, everyone got a kick out of Justin's photos. And, by this point, it might literally be EVERYONE. Reality kicked in when a friend called him to say he had just seen the photos on the website for Cosmopolitan. Yes, things move pretty fast when you make little hand hearts over your belly. And you're a dude. Still, Meghan is his No. 1 fan. And his dad is right up there, too, having left him a fatherly voice mail that said, ""You are crazy, boy. The world could use a little laughter right now."" And trust me. The world is laughing. I mean -- that belly. It's beautiful. Speaking of which, Justin says his favorite photo is the one where he's kissing his stomach -- that it was the perfect amount of funny and creepy. And the one he's most embarrassed by? That would be the black and white one where he's on the bed. He told me, ""It looks so real."" Justin says the hardest part was actually keeping a straight face. But, he managed, and it's all been worth it. Maybe even REALLY worth it. He says, ""I have publishers calling me for book ideas, people wanting to buy my photos."" But, truthfully, there's just one thing he wants. ""I'm still holding out for an ice cream sponsorship!"" That, or pickles. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"Several Yemeni men belonging to al Qaeda took part in the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi last September, according to several sources who have spoken with CNN. One senior U.S. law enforcement official told CNN that ""three or four members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,"" or AQAP, took part in the attack. Another source briefed on the Benghazi investigation said Western intelligence services suspect the men may have been sent by the group specifically to carry out the attack. But it's not been ruled out that they were already in the city and participated as the opportunity arose. The attack on the compound and subsequently on a ""safe-house"" to which Americans had been evacuated left four U.S. citizens dead, including the ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens. If the AQAP members were dispatched to Benghazi, it would be further evidence of a new level of co-operation among jihadist groups throughout the Middle East and North Africa, counterterrorism analysts say. According to one source, counterterrorism officials learned the identity of the men and established they had spent two nights in Benghazi after the attack. Western intelligence agencies began trying to track the men in the aftermath of the terrorist attack, but were always behind in their manhunt. They were later traced to northern Mali, where they are believed to have connected with a fighting group commanded by Moktar Belmoktar, a prominent jihadist leader, according to a senior law enforcement source. The trail appears to have then gone cold.  In early 2013, jihadists were driven out of many areas of northern Mali in a French-led offensive. Another source briefed on the investigation had previously told CNN that Belmoktar had received a call in the aftermath of the Benghazi attack from someone in or close to the city. Whoever made the call was excited. ""Mabruk, Mabruk!"" he repeated, meaning ""Congratulations"" in Arabic. There is no proof the call was specifically about the attack, but the source says that is the assumption among those with knowledge of the call. One source says the phone call was discovered when a Western intelligence service trawled through intercepts of communications made in the wake of the attack. CIA officials told CNN they had no comment on whether any call had been intercepted. One other source briefed by Western intelligence told CNN a call was intercepted but said only that it was placed to an AQIM commander, not specifically Belmoktar. Belmoktar is an Algerian terrorist operative linked to al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb who claimed responsibility for the attack on the In Amenas gas facility in southern Algeria in January this year. Some 38 people were killed during a three-day siege there. Chadian troops supporting the French intervention in Mali claimed in March that Belmoktar and others in his group had been killed during an operation in the remote Adrar des Ifhogas mountain range. There has never been any confirmation of his death, and one source briefed by Western and regional intelligence officials told CNN that Belmoktar may have started operating in the ""desert triangle"" straddling the borders of Algeria, Niger and Libya. Belmoktar is believed to have moved to the region in late 2012 after signs that an international intervention in Mali was growing more likely. Known as 'the Salvador pass,' the area is a key transit points for drug traffickers and international criminal groups. The FBI released grainy photographs Wednesday of three men said to have been at the Benghazi compound on the night of the attack, saying it was ""seeking information"" on them. It is not known whether any of them are the AQAP individuals. AQAP is regarded as one of the most active and dangerous of al Qaeda franchises. It has tried to launch several  attacks on the U.S. homeland. On Christmas Day 2009, a Nigerian recruited by the group attempted to blow up a plane flying into Detroit but failed because his device malfunctioned. The following October the group attempted to blow up planes heading to the United States with printer bombs disguised as air cargo. The packages were intercepted after a tip from Saudi intelligence. And in April 2012, a British informant working for Saudi counterterrorism thwarted a new plot by the group to bomb a U.S-bound airliner. The informant had infiltrated the group and was selected by them to launch the attack. AQAP was the first al Qaeda affiliate to comment on the Benghazi attack. On September 14 it released a statement arguing the attack was revenge for the death of Abu Yahya al-Libi, a senior al Qaeda operative, in Pakistan in June 2012. It did not claim responsibility for the attack. On September 10 -- at least 18 hours before the attack -- al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, in a video timed for the anniversary of 9/11, called for attacks on Americans in Libya to avenge the death of al-Libi. In March, Libyan authorities detained a man called Faraj al-Shibli in Libya on suspicion of links to the attack, according to several officials. The FBI was able to interview him in the presence of Libyan officials, according to one Libyan source. It appears al-Shibli was detained after returning from a trip to Pakistan, sources said. It remains unclear exactly whether al-Shibli was present at the U.S. compound at the time of the attack. It's also unclear whether his detention is likely to lead to charges in connection with the attack. Investigators have learned that al-Shibli has had contact with the Yemen-based al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula as well as al Qaeda members in Pakistan, sources said. The Libyan Interior Ministry refused to confirm he is still in custody, saying it could not comment on an ongoing investigation. Al-Shibli is the only known suspect in custody in connection with the attack in Benghazi. A 26-year-old Tunisian, Ali Ani al-Harzi, was held in Tunis for several weeks in connection with the assault on the compound after being extradited from Turkey. But he was released by a Tunisian judge in January on grounds on insufficient evidence. In December, a U.S. official with direct knowledge of the investigation said authorities were examining whether the alleged leader of a post-revolution terrorist network in Egypt had played a role in the September 11 attack. Mohammed Jamal Abu Ahmed was released from jail after the downfall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and is believed to be the driving force behind a new militant group, according to two U.S. officials. Abu Ahmed was previously a member of al-Zawahiri's group, Egyptian Islamic Jihad. He is currently in prison in Egypt after being arrested in December, when police raided a Cairo apartment allegedly being used by a jihadist group. An associate of Abu Ahmed's subsequently said that he had not been in Benghazi or anywhere in Libya on the day of the attack on the compound. In the wake of the revolts that have shaken the Arab world, al Qaeda sympathizers have found new space in which to operate, and would-be jihadists have found new causes to embrace. In Syria, the al-Nusra Front has proclaimed its links to the al Qaeda affiliate in Iraq. Militants from Tunisia, Libya and elsewhere have gone to Syria. In west Africa, Nigerian jihadists with Boko Haram have established links with al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and trained in Mali. If AQAP sent members thousands of miles to help launch an attack on U.S. diplomats, it would show that even if al Qaeda central remains under pressure, its fellow travelers are finding new ways to continue its campaign of terror.","""Three or four members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula,"" took part, one source says .
Western intelligence services suspect they may have been sent to carry out the attack .
They were later traced to northern Mali, where the trail appears to have gone cold ."
"A teacher at a Catholic school in Indiana is suing the diocese where she worked after being fired because the in vitro fertilization treatments she received were considered against church teachings. Emily Herx, a former English teacher at St. Vincent de Paul School in Fort Wayne, filed a federal lawsuit against the school and the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend. She says in the suit filed Friday that she was discriminated against in 2011 after the school's pastor found out that she had begun treatments with a fertility doctor, according to the complaint. Herx says the school's priest called her a ""grave, immoral sinner"" and told her she should have kept mum about her fertility treatments because some things are ""better left between the individual and God,"" the complaint said. ""I didn't think I was doing anything wrong,"" Herx told CNN on Thursday. ""I had never had any complaints about me as a teacher."" The diocese responded, saying it ""views the core issue raised in this lawsuit as a challenge to the diocese's right, as a religious employer, to make religious based decisions consistent with its religious standards on an impartial basis."" In its statement, diocese officials said that ""the church promotes treatment of infertility through means that respect the right to life, the unity of marriage, and procreation brought about as the fruit of the conjugal act. There are other infertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization, which are not morally licit according to Catholic teaching."" The statement adds that teachers working in the diocese are required to ""have a knowledge and respect for the Catholic faith, and abide by the tenets of the Catholic Church."" Herx said she underwent her first in vitro fertilization treatment in March 2010, and immediately told her supervisor, the school's principal. ""The first time she was made aware that my husband and I had to go through fertility treatments, she said, 'You are in my prayers,' "" Herx said. ""To me, that was support."" It was after she requested time off for her second treatment more than a year later that the school's pastor, Msgr. John Kuzmich, requested to meet with Herx, according to the complaint. During the meeting, Herx says Kuzmich told her that it would have been better if she hadn't said anything about the treatments because they could cause a scandal. Eleven days later, Herx said, she was notified that her contract at the school would not be renewed because of ""improprieties related to church teachings or law."" Observers say Herx's case bears some of the hallmarks of the case of Cheryl Perich, a former teacher who was fired from a religious school in Michigan after taking a medical leave of absence in 2004. At issue was whether the Americans with Disabilities Act applies to hiring and firing decisions involving ""ministerial employees,"" such as teachers who teach secular subjects. The U.S. Supreme Court decided that Perich -- who taught secular subjects along with a religion class -- was considered a ""minister"" and could in fact be fired based on church doctrine. ""The interest of society in the enforcement of employment discrimination statutes is undoubtedly important,"" Chief Justice John Roberts said at the time. ""But so too is the interest of religious groups in choosing who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith and carry out their mission."" Herx and her lawyer, Kathleen DeLaney, say that since Herx taught only English, she should be exempt from the so-called ministerial exception. Herx noted that after being hired at St. Vincent de Paul School in 2003, she never taught religion and never held an official title within the Catholic Church. But some legal observers say that because Herx worked at a Catholic school, her decision to undergo fertility treatments could be construed as a clash with the school's broader mission. ""The doctrine exists in order to protect the religious institution's right to protect their message,"" said Richard Garnett, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame. But Gregory Lipper, senior litigation counsel at Americans United for Separation of Church and State, disagreed, saying that deeming an English teacher ""a minister"" in a religious school constitutes ""Exhibit A of what goes wrong if the exception becomes too broad."" ""If a teacher of purely secular subjects is considered a minister, then the implication of that is that everyone who works for a Catholic school would be considered a minister,"" he said. ""It becomes an open license to discriminate.""","Emily Herx says she was fired because she received in vitro fertilization treatments .

"(CNN) -- I vaguely recall Pizza Hut's Book It elementary school reading incentive program. Though, to be fair, I vaguely remember what I had for breakfast. I think it was a ginger ale. Book It was a long time ago for me, but I'm pretty sure all I had to do was track my progress every month in school, hit a certain goal, and then I'd win a free erotic massage. Either that or a one-topping personal pan pizza. My memory's a little fuzzy. But it was probably the pizza. Inspired by President Reagan urging corporations to get involved in education (hooray, tax write offs!), Pizza Hut officially started its Book It program in 1984. Right about the time I was at Cherokee Elementary School with a fresh sponge of a brain, perfect for infusing with warm, lifelong memories of big corporations. Oh, if only some cigarette company had started the ""Smoke It"" program. I could see a large poster near the chalkboard with, say, the Marlboro Man using a buck knife to scratch out simple subtractions on an old fencepost. Above him, against a golden setting sun, would be the slogan: ""Let math light up your brain with fun!"" Hell yeah! And if your class had the best test scores in the country? That's right. You got a personal school visit from the old dying cowboy himself. ""Miss Parker, why is this man coughing up blood?"" Fortunately that program didn't happen. Cigarette companies never got to us. But 30 years later, Book It is still going strong. And recently, for just a short time, Pizza Hut celebrated this milestone anniversary with an online-only Book It alumni program for those of us who participated when we were young. I guess it was finally time to start tapping into those aging sponge brains with a little nostalgia. The nerve. How dare they double-dip their delicious, mozzarella-covered corporate hands into my childhood? How dare they lure us into their restaurants with cozy memories from a bygone era? How dare they? Forget it. I'm all in. Or at least I would've been. I missed the deadline. Otherwise, had I signed up as a Book It alumni, I would've received a free one-topping personal pan pizza. Just like the old days. How could I have missed this? Without free pizza my life is meaningless. Sadly, not much has changed for me since I was in elementary school. I'm a little taller now and doctors have long since assigned fancy acronyms to explain why I couldn't sit still in my seat. But, otherwise, I remain an awkward, hairy man-child, easily persuaded to do things in the name of food. ""Jarrett, I need you to start a huge arson fire."" ""But that's destructive and wrong."" ""I'll give you a free one-topping personal pan pizza."" ""Everything must burn."" Now, if your school wasn't a part of the Book It program from back in the day, you sort of have to realize that this was actually a pretty big deal. Because, again, the reward wasn't just any pizza. It was YOUR pizza. And that's important. You see, there's no sharing a personal pan pizza. This isn't communism. We have rules in this country, and rule number one is NEVER TOUCH ANOTHER MAN'S PERSONAL PAN PIZZA! You hear me? Oh, you think this is cute? You think this is a joke? You think I'm breathing heavy and ripped my shirt off over nothing? Listen, pal. You wanna know what happens to people who try to grab just a little taste of another man's personal pan pizza? You wanna know what happens? THEY END UP IN SHALLOW GRAVES! (author shakes his head) Whoa. That was weird. I'm back. Anyway, the point is that it was YOUR pizza. And, even better, it was from PIZZA HUT! When I was young, Pizza Hut was almost fancy. Almost. Back then it was more like a proper sit-down restaurant, and it had that iconic red roof that was totally unmistakable from any other pizza joint. It was actually cool to eat at Pizza Hut. Even cooler if you weren't wearing pants. As are most things. Like square dancing. These days, however, Pizza Huts tend to be just these little delivery outlets -- small depots for the drivers to come and pick up the pies before heading out to your house. And I haven't had it in decades. There's just so much good pizza out there. In fact, in my neighborhood in Atlanta, we have a little punk rock pizza place called Jack's. And I prefer theirs to all others because I wholeheartedly trust any restaurant where the tattoo-to-staff ratio is 60-to-1. Good tattoos make good pizza. Scientific fact. But for old time's sake -- as an alumni -- had I not missed the deadline, I happily would have cheated on my favorite local spot just once for that personal pan pizza. So, happy anniversary, Book It. Look what you almost made me do. The nerve. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter. And prepare to be underwhelmed.

"As televised theater, it was hard to beat. As political prognostication, it was a head-scratching moment. As partisan warfare, it was nothing short of audacious. But Karl Rove's insistence that Barack Obama had not carried Ohio -- despite the call by his own network, Fox News, that the president had done just that -- represented something larger. It captured, for some long and awkward moments, the refusal of some in the media-and-politics game to accept reality. And that has been a recurring pattern this year. We're not talking here about a bad judgment call by a pundit. Everyone in the commentary business, including yours truly, has made those. If failed predictions were a felony, the jails would be filled with media folks. Watch: Karl Rove rejects reality on Fox News . Rove, to be sure, is a smart guy. He wasn't called George W. Bush's architect for nothing. He helped his guy win two presidential elections. He knows polls inside out. But Rove occupies a rather unique perch at Fox, and not just because he jumped from the Bush White House to the role of conservative cable commentator. Rove, who also has a Wall Street Journal column, helped create two political action committees, American Crossroads and Crossroads Grassroots Political Strategies, that raised and spent about $175 million in this campaign, most of it on television ads promoting Mitt Romney or attacking Obama. He was, in every sense of the word, a full-fledged political player. But he was also Fox's most visible contributor, appearing far more often than Sarah Palin, delivering his political insights on shows from morning to night. Watch: Media still go wild for Donald Trump, who drove Romney nuts . Fox isn't the only news channel to employ active partisans -- CNN has a few, too -- and media organizations long ago decided to blur the line between journalism and politics. I know the ties are generally disclosed, but personally, I wouldn't allow anyone who raises money or holds a party position to be on a news organization's payroll. Why should viewers think they're getting anything but one-sided spin? Still, Rove undoubtedly wants to preserve his reputation as a political seer, which is why it was so stunning when he went rogue on Tuesday night. It was a moment of high drama. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC were each in the process of calling Ohio -- and thus the presidential race -- for Obama. But Rove began arguing with his Fox colleagues. ""I don't know what the outcome is gonna be, but you shouldn't, you gotta be careful about calling things when you've got something like 991 votes separating the two candidates and a quarter of the vote left to count,"" he said. ""Even if they had made it on the basis of select precincts, I'd be very cautious about intruding in this process."" Rove was, of course, wrong; Obama won Ohio, and a second term. But what is striking is that he was challenging the decision-desk professionals at his network in a way that looked like he refused to accept the country's judgment. Watch: Blame game -- the knives are out for Romney world . This, unfortunately, has been a recurring theme all year. When Romney was down in the polls, some conservatives complained that media organizations were putting out biased surveys (which led to such sites as unskewedpolls.com). When unemployment dropped in September, even critics as prominent as Jack Welch accused the Obama administration of cooking the books without a scintilla of evidence. And when Nate Silver, The New York Times' number-crunching blogger, predicted Obama had a 90% chance of winning, conservatives accused him of bias. Turns out he called the outcome correctly in every state. Watch: Turns out 'liberal' media were right about Obama . Donald Trump, who hardly distinguished himself in this campaign by pushing the birther nonsense, ranted on Twitter on Election Night that Obama's victory was a ""disgusting injustice."" So he not only doesn't accept that the president was born in Hawaii, he doesn't accept that Obama won the election fair and square. I wouldn't suggest that Rove believes in any of this conspiracy stuff, though he doubled down on Thursday by saying the president won by having ""suppressed the vote,"" which flies in the face of Obama's efforts to boost turnout. But for a brief moment on Election Night, we got a glimpse of pure partisanship in the guise of journalism.","Howard Kurtz: Karl Rove challenged his own network's pros on Election Night .

"(CNN)Former supermodel Janice Dickinson accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault, telling ""Entertainment Tonight"" in an interview aired on Tuesday that the comedian raped her. Dickinson is the latest of a handful of women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault -- allegations the comedian has repeatedly said are untrue. He has never been prosecuted. In the interview, Dickinson claims Cosby assaulted her in 1982 after the two had dinner in Lake Tahoe. She alleges he gave her a pill and a glass of red wine shortly before she passed out. ""The last thing I remember was Bill Cosby in a patchwork robe, dropping his robe and getting on top of me. And I remember a lot of pain,"" she said. Cosby attorney Martin Singer called Dickinson's story ""a lie"" and said it contradicts her own autobiography and a 2002 interview she did with the New York Observer. ""That interview a dozen years ago said, 'she didn't want to go to bed with him and he blew her off,' "" Singer's statement said Wednesday. ""The only story she gave 12 years ago to the media and in her autobiography was that she refused to sleep with Mr. Cosby and he blew her off. Documentary proof and Ms. Dickinson's own words show that her new story about something she now claims happened back in 1982 is a fabricated lie."" Dickinson did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Rape allegations haunt Cosby in the digital age . Since 2005, a handful of women have made the claims. This year, the accusations resurfaced, and earlier this month, a seemingly harmless post on Cosby's Twitter account turned them into a social media storm. In its wake, one of his accusers, Barbara Bowman, turned to the public once more with an article in The Washington Post and interviews with CNN. Bowman claims she was drugged, then raped, though she said she never saw drugs. ""I woke up out of a very confused state not in my clothes,"" she said. Bowman said she knew her body had been touched without her permission. This occurred several times in the course of their contact, she said. On Saturday, NPR broadcast an awkward interview with Cosby in which he didn't utter a word when repeatedly asked about the claims about him. NPR host Scott Simon filled the airtime by saying Cosby was just ""shaking his head no."" CNN's Jethro Mullen and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","Bill Cosby's attorney calls ex-supermodel's claim of being raped ""a fabricated lie""

"(CNN) -- An officer who pointed a semi-automatic assault rifle at a Ferguson, Missouri, protester and threatened to kill him -- a tense episode caught on video and posted online -- is off the job, at least for now. The St. Louis County Police Department announced Wednesday that a police officer from St. Ann, Missouri, ""has been relieved of duty and suspended indefinitely"" over the incident. Police threatening to kill a citizen takes on special significance given what protesters are loudly, passionately demanding: charges against Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for the August 9 fatal shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teen. Grand jury to mull Ferguson case . The county police department laid out its version of the more recent incident, which happened shortly before midnight Tuesday. This account jibed with video later posted to YouTube. In the video, an officer can be seen walking around with his assault rifle raised, then pointing it in the direction of protesters. ""I'm going to f--king kill you,"" he says. ""Get back. Get back."" The St. Louis County Police described the protester involved in what it deemed ""a verbal exchange"" to be ""peaceful."" Another man in the crowd then says out loud, ""Did you threaten to kill him?"" The officer is asked for his name, to which he responds: ""Go f--k yourself."" Protesters proceed to mock the officer before he's led away by another member of law enforcement. A CNN crew also saw the officer point his weapon at those around him as he cursed, shouted and threatened people by saying he'd kill them unless they stayed away. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . The St. Louis County Police said that one of its sergeants ""walked over and immediately took action, forcing the officer to lower the weapon and escorting him away from the area."" ""The unified command strongly feel these actions are inappropriate, and not indicative of the officers who have worked daily to keep the peace,"" the police department said. The county police referred media to the St. Ann Police Department for updates on the unnamed suspended officer's status. Members of the law enforcement force charged with maintaining security have come from many communities, including St. Ann, which is just west of Ferguson. This is not the first time unarmed protesters in Ferguson have accused police of pointing guns at them. CNN staffers have seen some such incidents first-hand that weren't caught on tape. Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who has been a fixture at the demonstrations, said he is not surprised by the video given what he's seen the past two weeks. What is different -- in a good way, from his perspective -- is that authorities responded promptly in disciplining one of their own. ""In this case, we did see something happen to that officer immediately,"" French told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""And that sends a strong message that at least the folks at the top are getting it."" Neil Bruntrager -- general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers Association, though he doesn't represent this specific accused officer -- conceded in an appearance on CNN that these kinds of things are probably happening in Ferguson, though he characterized them as ""isolated incidents."" He defended the officers on the front lines of the protests, saying they have shown ""admirable restraint"" -- a view that's not shared by some activists -- despite being persistently egged on. ""You're asking them to stand there and stare into the faces of people who are spitting on them, who are yelling at them, who are screaming at them, ... who are touching them,"" Bruntrager told CNN's Erin Burnett. ""You're saying: Just take it. And ... by and large, they do."" Sometimes -- as in this particular cases, the lawyer conceded -- a police officer may act improperly. If they do, Bruntrager claimed that it is ""a fatigue issue,"" not ""a training issue,"" related to the psychological wear on being on the streets of Ferguson day after day. ""What happens in a situation like this is that a person is human, they respond, and that's what you saw (on the video),"" Bruntrager said. ""It's unfortunate, it's unpleasant, but it's a human response."" The man in charge of maintaining security in Ferguson, Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, considers this officer's actions an affront to all those who have doing things the right way. Talking to CNN's Don Lemon about the video, Johnson said, ""I was disturbed by it, I was bothered by it, and I was disrespected by it."" Column defending cops in Ferguson spurs online fury .

"Davos (CNN) -- Davos is a stimulating place to be, to discuss and to learn. Hopefully, by coming together, we will find ideas and solutions that will bring the world forward. In my opinion, one of our challenges is that we are about to lose a whole generation of resources because of the growing unemployment of youth. It is dangerous not to let today's youth be a part of the reshaping of the world. In 2013, according to the World Bank, 73% of the labor force between the ages 15 and 24 was without work, but available for and seeking employment. Many of the people I have admired over the last few years have been young people I have met in very different situations. They have become role models for leadership and high ethical standard. Some fantastic young people I have met have shown leadership under such hard conditions that I can picture them taking a leading position within a wide range of fields. I believe today's youth -- the ones you find at almost any school almost anywhere in the world -- are highly competent people with knowledge and experience that would be in the best interests of established leaders to utilize. Youth today live in an extreme world regarding diversity, conflict, opportunities and technical means of connecting with others. The global networks of youth are far ahead what established leaders of today had when they were young. Since 2006 I have been visiting schools and talking to students all around the world together with my fellow Young Global Leaders John Hope Bryant and Pekka Himanen. We have arranged so called Dignity Days -- which is the main activity of our organization Global Dignity. We have three goals: To spur a global conversation on dignity, to arrange Global Dignity Days at schools and promote dignity-based leadership. This year, Dignity Day will be held for more than half of the Norwegian first year high school pupils -- and in around 50 countries world wide. What strikes me during my very diverse meetings with youth around the world is how similarly they define dignity -- and how relevant it feels for most young people to discuss this issue as a core value of our time. These are some of the dignity stories we have been told: . In Jordan, a girl stood up and told how annoyed she had been when she got a visually impaired teacher. The girl was very ambitious, and thought she would get less quality training because of the teacher's disability. When the teacher later became the first visually impaired person in Jordan to earn her PhD, the student completely shifted her perspective. She realized that she was proud that this had been her teacher and that she had learned something more important from her than from any of her other teachers. In South Africa a girl told how, during the riots in 2009, her grandmother covered and hide some of the immigrants in her home, who were targets of the riots. In Norway, a Muslim student told how her friend had started to walk to and from school together with a Jewish boy who was being bullied -- to support and protect him. I particularly like this third story. It shows the genius of youth in beautiful simplicity. It hits the core of what the world's leaders have been struggling so hard over so many years to achieve. I believe youth is an important target group for positive change -- indeed the real driver of positive change. Youth find it incredibly easy to grasp the idea of dignity -- and even better: how it can be operationalized into practical action. They are truly Champions of Global Dignity. So what do we need to do to create positive change? It is not enough to merely accept the inherent dignity of all human beings. Our actions must reflect the dignity of others. In my view dignity consists of two main parts: Firstly, inherent dignity and secondly, perceived dignity -- a sort of dignity capital. We all have the ability to increase other people's dignity capital -- and thus increase our own. This is about doing all we can to become our best selves -- by making conscious decisions -- and making the best out of our resources. Take action, see potential, and give unemployed youth the opportunity to use their resources as a response to this both current and emerging challenge.

"(CNN) -- The other day I saw a death metal band hanging out by their tour van in the parking lot behind a club. They were all dressed in black, and may or may not have been working on lyrics to a new song about fire and lamb meat. ""What rhymes with 'charred remains?'"" Now, I can't say for certain that they were actually death metal. But that's what I'm going with. Admittedly, I'm not very up to date on the various sub-genres of growling into a microphone. Thus, when I don't know any better, I find it's always best to make assumptions. For instance, this morning I assumed I wore pants to work. The people in line at Starbucks assumed differently. But there they were, this supposed death metal band, all dressed in black, minding their own business on a lovely sunny afternoon in Atlanta. And I just stared at them with intrigue until I uttered the most old-man thing I've ever uttered: . ""They'd be so much happier if they just wore a little color."" Which is a completely insane thing to think. They were probably loads of happy. And they seemed perfectly reasonable. In fact, maybe they were discussing how, if they pooled all their collective happiness and reason, they could open up a combination orphanage and puppy day care center called Unicorn Land. Shame on me for judging. Just because they wear all black and their music probably sounds like a horse choking on a watermelon doesn't mean they're angry people who eat children and worship Satan. Besides, that's so Simon and Garfunkel. The point is, they have their thing. And I have mine. And just because I don't understand or particularly enjoy death metal, doesn't mean it's not good music and, dare I say ... art. Because art is exactly what was being celebrated recently in London when a local death metal band called Unfathomable Ruination decided to lock themselves in an airtight, soundproof cube and play until they ran out of oxygen. The plan is to do it three nights a week, Wednesday through Friday, at 6 p.m. throughout the month of July. Or at least until they all forget the safe word and suffocate. ""I ... should've ... gone ... to law school."" The actual cube was designed by a Portuguese artist named JoÃ£o Onofre, and he calls it ""Box Sized Die."" But what does it all mean? Interestingly, the death metal art cube sits right outside the famous London office building known as ""The Gherken."" That's the one that looks like a giant suppository in the heart of the Insurance District. And the cube is supposed to represent the cold, dark working spaces within the surrounding office buildings. Onofre says, ""In this corporate architecture you don't really see what's going on inside. The same happens here in the work. You see it but, then again, you don't see it when the performance starts."" Look, I only barely get this. I now have five functioning brain cells, and I'm not prepared to burn four of them trying to digest all the deep meaning from a weird public art display. So, I trust that whatever Onofre says makes sense. I'm more interested in the music. Or, I suppose, the lack thereof. Being that the box is airtight and soundproof, all the music is completely inaudible to the public. They can only feel it. Which is actually kind of cool. Presumably, though, inside the box it sounds like your grandfather passing a kidney stone the size of a Chicken McNugget. But only for a short while. Ben Wright, the band's lead vocalist, explained, ""We did 14 minutes the first time on the run through. And then we did 19 minutes today."" So, it's kind of like musical CrossFit, except this box is actually ... a box. And you don't have to tell your Facebook friends about the sand bag you just lifted over your head. But, hopefully, as the month carries on, Unfathomable Ruination will keep playing for longer and longer. This, despite the fact that it doesn't look very pleasurable. Really, they'd be so much happier if they just wore a little color. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"Militants with black masks stand by as 15-year-old Mohammed watches a video of fighters cutting off a man's head. ""This is jihad for the sake of God,"" the men with Kalashnikov rifles say. Mohammed begins to feel lost, confused. ""Does God want me to do jihad?"" he wonders. This is Mohammed's eyewitness account, told to CNN on Wednesday in a telephone interview. He was one of the more than 140 Kurdish schoolboys kidnapped in Syria last month by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and forced to take daily lessons in radical Islamic theology, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based monitoring group, and local activists say. Mohammed's account provides insight into the workings of an organization that has the stated goal of creating a single caliphate across Syria and neighboring Iraq. Armed fighters in pickup trucks on May 29 stopped buses driving children back to their hometown of Ayn al-Arab from their junior high final exams in Aleppo. ""How can you sit with the girls? It is forbidden!"" the men, many with foreign accents, yelled as they separated the female students and took only the boys. The convoy of fighters then forcibly escorted the all-male group to the ISIS-controlled city of Manbij in northern Syria, Mohammed told CNN. Nearly a month later, all the boys, ranging in age from 14 to 16, remain hostages, except for Mohammed and three others who made a harrowing escape. ""We were all so scared. On the way back, we were celebrating that we had finished our tests. We were excited to go home and see our families. We didn't know why they took us,"" says Mohammed, who asked his full name not be used for fear of his safety. After five days in captivity, Mohammed and a friend asked their classmates to create a diversion. The boys slipped out a back door, climbed a fence and started running to safety. The pair went from shop to shop, asking for help, but several locals, frightened by possible retaliation, turned the teenagers away. One resident gave the boys money to take public transportation to the border town of Jarablus, where they contacted their families from an Internet cafe. ""I was so happy when I got home. My mother had no idea that I had escaped. I was so excited to see her,"" says Mohammed. He says he is now wanted for fleeing and fears he will be executed if ISIS captures him. Life under ISIS' iron thumb . The boy recalled their first morning in captivity, which began at a mosque in Manbij. ""If you try to leave,"" the militants said, according to Mohammed, ""we will cut your heads off."" ISIS issued blankets and assigned a single room for every 17 boys to share. Almost immediately the radical schooling began, Mohammed says. Every day, local sheiks woke the boys up at dawn for prayer then held the students for several hours of Sharia lessons, said Mohammed. At night, ISIS fighters spent about five hours preaching jihad and showing graphic videos of executions and suicide operations. ""ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra have targeted children for recruitment by providing military training in school settings or as part of broader education programs run by the groups,"" said a report this week from Human Rights Watch. ""Former recruits described how leaders gave children particularly difficult or dangerous tasks and encouraged them to volunteer for suicide attacks."" While ISIS has not commented publicly about the mass abduction, it and other armed militia groups often recruit children for combat and battlefield support. A Syrian doctor told Human Rights Watch he treated a boy no older than 12 whose job was to whip prisoners in ISIS detention centers. ""They are trying to brainwash them,"" a man identified as the father of one of the Kurdish boys told CNN in a telephone interview. ""We have raised our children well, but we are worried how this will affect them psychologically."" the man said on condition of anonymity. The father, a well-known Kurdish leader living outside Syria, asked his identity be kept secret for fear ISIS may punish his 14-year-old son, who is still being held in Manbij. ISIS totally isolates the children, even threatening local residents for peering at the boys from their balconies, he says. ""My friends would cry quietly at night,"" Mohammed says, ""Now I try to comfort their parents and tell them, 'No they were happy and playing,' but all of us were depressed."" The Syrian government refused to set up testing centers in the Kurdish-controlled city of Ayn al-Arab, forcing nearly 1,500 students to travel through treacherous territory to the government-controlled suburbs of Aleppo for yearend exams, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The Syrian government has not commented on the claim or the abduction of the boys. ""These children have nothing to do with the political crisis. They just wanted to take their exams. They are innocent of all this,"" the father says. Syrian Kurds threatened . The People's Protection Unit (YPG), a Kurdish militia, rules the border city of Ayn al-Arab, but ISIS controls much of the surrounding area, effectively imposing a siege on residents. ""You go into Ayan al-Arab and there are no youths. All my friends are taken. I feel I cannot smile. My whole life and all my days were with my classmates and now there is nothing,"" Mohammed told CNN. Anguish plagues the homes of many families worried about the safety of their youngsters and the fate of the Kurdish enclave -- now that ISIS has acquired heavy weaponry, American-made Humvees and advanced military technology from its rampage on neighboring Iraq. ""It is painful for our community. If the boys had been captured in a battle then we can justify it. This is completely unjust."" Mostafa Baly, a Kurdish activist inside Ayn al-Arab, told CNN. ISIS demands Kurdish troops release its fighters in exchange for the release of the children, but with a lack of direct communication and distrust between the two parties, some are calling on the international community to intervene. ""We as the families, we call on any entity that could help put pressure on ISIS to free the children to please help us,"" Baly, whose nephew is among the abducted, told CNN. The Democratic Union Party (PYD), which controls Ayn al-Arab, is accused of committing violations against children and those held in its custody. The local Kurdish authority failed to provide due process, committed arbitrary arrests and used children within its ranks, Human Rights Watch said last week. ""The Kurdish-run areas of Syria are quieter than war-torn parts of the country, but serious abuses are still taking place,"" said Nadim Houry, deputy Middle East and North Africa director for the group. Syria's scattered and long-oppressed Kurdish community fought and won its local autonomy during the country's protracted civil war but distanced itself from the armed rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad. A call for the world to pay heed . The People's Protection Unit (YPG), which defends and administers the ethnic minority's strongholds, predominantly in the north, often faces armed attacks by anti-government groups vying for resources and control. ""ISIS want to take over the world by killing, terrorizing and hurting children,"" Baly told CNN. ""The Kurdish people will insist on defending themselves, but the world must watch and be careful."" ISIS has not issued any official statement on the incident or the alleged request for a prisoner swap. The group, so radical that al Qaeda's central command disowned it earlier this year, controls several towns and cities in northern Syria and recently captured much of Iraq's Sunni heartland including the country's second largest city, Mosul.

"(CNN)With one 4½-hour flight Friday, the new spacecraft series that NASA hopes will take astronauts to Mars passed its first test above Earth. NASA's Orion capsule -- part of America's bid to take crews beyond low-Earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo missions -- splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Friday morning after lapping the planet twice on an uncrewed test flight. The cone-shaped craft, slowed by a series of parachutes, settled onto the water at 8:29 a.m. PT (11:29 a.m. ET) about 600 miles southwest of San Diego. ""America has driven a golden spike as it crosses a bridge into the future,"" a NASA announcer said as the capsule bobbed on the ocean's surface during the agency's TV broadcast of the event. The flight took Orion farther from Earth than any craft designed for human flight since the Apollo 17 mission to the moon in 1972 -- a confidence builder for a program that NASA hopes will take its first human crew into space in 2021. ""It appears that Orion and the Delta IV Heavy (rocket) were nearly flawless,"" program manager Mark Geyer told reporters. Orion, a crew module designed to carry up to six astronauts, soared into the Florida sky at 7:05 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral atop a Delta IV Heavy rocket. The assembly shed its boosters before the rocket's second stage lifted Orion into low-Earth orbit in minutes. Two hours later, a milestone: The second stage lifted Orion higher for its second orbit, about 3,600 miles above Earth, or 15 times higher than the International Space Station. ""A human-rated system hasn't gone that far since 1972. ... That reminded us that here we are again, now, the United States leading exploration out into the solar system,"" Geyer said. After the splashdown, crews from two Navy recovery ships were working to collect the craft. It was a crucial test for the capsule: NASA wants to prove flight and re-entry abilities before it carries astronauts. Charles Bolden Op Ed: NASA's Mars milestone . Beyond the moon . The Orion crew module, which looks like a throwback to the Apollo era, but roomier, could take astronauts back to the moon, but also far beyond. Related: Thousands of spaceships could colonize Mars . One of Orion's tasks might be to send astronauts to an asteroid -- perhaps one that NASA would first robotically redirect to orbit around the moon.  NASA says it hopes that Orion, pushed by a more powerful rocket system under development, will send astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s. NASA hopes Orion later will send astronauts to Mars' moons, and, eventually, to the Red Planet itself. While NASA focuses on deeper space, private space companies such as SpaceX are expected to take over the space shuttles' old job of ferrying astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station in low-Earth orbit. When it becomes fully operational, Orion's crew module will be able to carry four people on a 21-day mission into deep space, or six astronauts for shorter missions. By comparison, the Apollo crew modules held three astronauts and were in space for six to 12 days. Orion's crew module is 16.5 feet in diameter and Apollo was 12.8 feet in diameter, NASA said. Data to sift . Friday's launch came a day after NASA scrubbed its first attempt because of a failure of some valves in the boosters to close. Those valves, which allow fuel to flow into the boosters before launch, are supposed to close just before liftoff. Engineers and scientists will examine all sorts of data -- including those collected by on-board recorders -- to determine how well the capsule performed Friday. This includes how well the heat shield -- which keeps the capsule from burning up on re-entry -- held up. ""We know it worked,"" Geyer said, ""but the specifics of how well ... will take time to investigate."" Though Orion's first flight didn't have people on it, it didn't go up empty. It carried the names of more than a million people packed on a dime-sized microchip. ""Sesame Street"" sent up some mementos to inspire students about spaceflight, including Cookie Monster's cookie and Ernie's rubber ducky. Also aboard: an oxygen hose from an Apollo 11 lunar spacesuit and a small sample of lunar soil. A Tyrannosaurus rex fossil from the Denver Science Museum made the trip, and lockers were filled with flags, coins, patches, poetry and music.

"The U.S. Justice Department will seek a federal court order forcing Texas to resume ""preclearing"" any changes to its voting laws, the first enforcement action by the Obama administration since the Supreme Court tossed out a key provision of the landmark Voting Rights Act. Attorney General Holder made the announcement Thursday in a speech before the Urban League. ""My colleagues and I are determined to use every tool at our disposal to stand against discrimination wherever it is found,"" Holder said in Philadelphia. ""Even as Congress considers updates to the Voting Rights Act in light of the court's ruling, we plan, in the meantime, to fully utilize the law's remaining sections to ensure that the voting rights of all American citizens are protected."" A divided 5-4 Supreme Court last month invalidated the formula used to determine which states or local jurisdictions -- mostly in the South -- could remain under special federal oversight, requiring them to get approval from Washington before making any changes in voting procedures. Conservatives fume when Holder talks race and law . That blunts much of the federal government's enforcement power in states and localities with a history of discrimination at the polls. The ruling does not change the fact it remains illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting. But it does change how some governments have been singled out. Holder said the Obama administration will use a different section of the Voting Rights Act that allows federal authorities to ask a judge to order a state to be put under the preclearance regime. To do so the Justice Department must prove ""purposeful"" discrimination. Texas will be test case of the tactic. The state is the subject of two ongoing court fights over its voter identification law and the voting boundaries created by the legislature. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott had indicated after the high court ruling that both the state voter identification law and its redistricting maps would go into effect immediately. Republican Gov. Rick Perry criticized Holder's remarks and defended the Texas ""voter integrity"" laws. ""Once again, the Obama administration is demonstrating utter contempt for our country's system of checks and balances, not to mention the U.S. Constitution,"" Perry said in a prepared statement. ""This end-run around the Supreme Court undermines the will of the people of Texas, and casts unfair aspersions on our state's common-sense efforts to preserve the integrity of our elections process."" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, was also defiant. ""Texans should not -- and will not -- stand for the continued bullying of our state by the Obama administration,"" he said in a news release Thursday. Lawmakers in Congress have begun considering proposals to update the Voting Rights Act to ensure continued federal oversight. Holder said that while his department could act unilaterally, updating current laws is the real key. ""It is the duty of today's Justice Department to continue monitoring jurisdictions around the country for changes that may hamper these voting rights -- to keep taking appropriately aggressive action against any jurisdiction that attempts to hinder free and fair access to the franchise,"" he said. ""And to keep refining and refocusing current enforcement efforts while we work with Congress to craft stronger tools for protecting voting rights."" Holder called the high court ruling ""deeply disappointing and flawed."" Under the section of the Voting Rights Act invalidated by the high court, any changes in voting laws and procedures in all or parts of 15 covered states -- including Texas -- were subject to federal oversight. That meant the Justice Department or a federal court had to sign off on all aspects, including something as simple as moving a polling place temporarily across the street. The provision was reauthorized by Congress in 2006 for another 25 years. Officials in Shelby County, Alabama, subsequently filed suit, saying the monitoring was overly burdensome and unwarranted. Chief Justice John Roberts, in his majority opinion, for the Supreme Court, said the decades-old formula still being used had ""no logical relation to the present day."" ""While any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy the problem speaks to the current conditions,"" he said. President Obama had characterized the ruling as a ""setback,"" even as he vowed his ""administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process."" Texas will not be the first state the Justice Department has sought to ""bail in"" under a different enforcement regime from the Voting Rights Act, which would still be allowed in the wake of the high court decision. Parts of New Mexico and Arkansas also were subject to that special federal oversight, but the provision requires the Justice Department to establish a new, comprehensive record of alleged ""intentional"" discrimination. That means the burden of proof would initially be on Washington to show a state like Texas deserves continued special scrutiny. If that oversight is granted, the burden of proof would then shift to the state, when justifying any future changes in its voting laws.","Gov. Perry: This ""undermines the will of the people of Texas""

"In a David vs. Goliath battle that pitted the Federal Aviation Administration against the operator of a small model airplane, a federal administrative judge has sided with the aircraft's pilot. The judge has dismissed a proposed $10,000 fine against businessman Raphael Pirker, who used a remotely operated 56-inch foam glider to take aerial video for an advertisement for the University of Virginia Medical Center. The FAA alleged that since Pirker was using the aircraft for profit, he ran afoul of regulations requiring commercial operators of ""Unmanned Aircraft Systems"" -- sometimes called UAS or drones -- to obtain FAA authorization. But a judge on Thursday agreed with Pirker that the FAA overreached by applying regulations for aircraft to model aircraft, and said no FAA rule prohibited Pirker's radio-controlled flight. Thursday's ruling is believed to be the first to address the issue, but it was not immediately clear whether the FAA would appeal, or what impact it would have on others hoping to use drones for profit. As recently as last week, the FAA had publicized its restrictions on commercial use of drones. In a press release headlined ""Busting Myths about the FAA and Unmanned Aircraft,"" it stressed that UAS enthusiasts could not use drones for commercial purposes. ""A commercial flight requires a certified aircraft, a licensed pilot and operating approval. To date, only one operation has met these criteria, using Insitu's ScanEagle, and authorization was limited to the Arctic,"" the FAA's Busting Myths release said. ""There are no shades of gray in FAA regulations,"" the FAA continued. ""Anyone who wants to fly an aircraft-manned or unmanned-in U.S. airspace needs some level of FAA approval."" The FAA could not be reached Thursday night for comment on the Pirker ruling. Pirker's attorney, Brendan Schulman, called it ""a tremendously significant decision for model aircraft and commercial drone operators."" ""As a general matter, the decision finds that the FAA's 2007 policy statement banning the commercial use of model aircraft is not enforceable. It would appear to me to have a very significant impact on other operators,"" Schulman said. Share your best remote aerial footage on iReport . Pirker's flight occurred Oct. 17, 2011, when he remotely piloted a $130 RiteWing Zephyr II aircraft at the campus medical center. The FAA investigated, and the following April it proposed a $10,000 civil penalty, saying that Pirker operated the plane ""in a careless or reckless manner so as to endanger the life or property of another."" Pirker operated the aircraft within about 50 feet of numerous individuals, about 20 feet of a crowded street, and within approximately 100 feet of an active heliport at UVA, the FAA alleged. One person had to take ""evasive measures"" to avoid being struck by the aircraft, the agency said. Pirker appealed the case to the National Transportation Safety Board, where Judge Patrick Geraghty ruled Thursday, dismissing the FAA order. Schulman said Thursday night that his client had not yet learned of the ruling. ""I think he's still asleep. He lives in Hong Kong and they're 12 hours off,"" Schulman said, adding, ""I'm sure he'd be happy about it.""","Raphael Pirker remotely piloted model plane for commercial purposes .

"If you're using a fake name on your Facebook account, maintaining a personal profile for your beloved pet or have a second profile you use just for logging in to other sites, you have one of the 83.09 million fake accounts Facebook wants to disable. In an updated regulatory filing released Wednesday, the social media company said that 8.7 percent of its 955 million monthly active users worldwide are actually duplicate or false accounts. ""On Facebook we have a really large commitment in general to finding and disabling false accounts,"" Facebook's chief security officer Joe Sullivan told CNN in a recent interview. ""Our entire platform is based on people using their real identities."" Facebook inspires status envy . So what are those 83 million undesired accounts doing? They're a mixture of innocent and malicious, and Facebook has divvied them up into three categories: duplicate accounts, misclassified accounts and ""undesirable"" accounts. Duplicate accounts make up 4.8% (45.8 million) of Facebook's total active member tally. According to the network's terms of service, users are not allowed to have more than one Facebook personal account or make accounts on behalf of other people. Parents creating Facebook accounts for their young kids are violating two rules, since people under 13 are not allowed to have Facebook profiles. Misclassified accounts are personal profiles that have been made for companies, groups or pets. Those types of profiles (22.9 million) are allowed on Facebook, but they need to be created as Pages. Facebook estimates that 2.4% of its active accounts are these non-human personal accounts. These accounts can be converted into approved pages without losing information. Pets such as Boo, the self-anointed ""world's cutest dog,"" are typically classified as Public Figures. The third group is the smallest -- just 1.5% of all active accounts -- but most troublesome. There are 14.3 million undesirable accounts that Facebook believes have been created specifically for purposes that violate the companies terms, like spamming. Face it, Facebook: Sometimes you suck . ""We believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the United States or Australia and higher in developing markets such as Indonesia and Turkey,"" the company said in the filing. The tallies were based on an internal sampling of accounts done by reviewers, and Facebook says the numbers may represent the actual number. Facebook disables any false accounts it finds, and while it wipes all the information associated with the name from public view, it doesn't delete the account from its servers ""for safety and security"" reasons. The disabled account goes into a sort of Facebook limbo, where the owner of the account can't get their hands on any of the content -- photos, posts, videos -- not even by requesting a copy of the data, according to Facebook. If Facebook does shut down your account, it says you can't create a new one without permission from the company.

"(CNN) -- It all started with a gift from a friend. In the 1980s, actress and singer Josephine Premice was well-aware of fashion designer Koos van den Akker's eye-catching work and asked whether he could make a sweater for one of her friends, Bill Cosby. Van den Akker delivered a sweater to the studio where Cosby was working on his NBC sitcom, ""The Cosby Show,"" early on in its eight-season run. Cosby loved the sweater so much, he wore it when he portrayed Dr. Cliff Huxtable on the show. Fans began writing in, asking where Cosby got the sweater, van den Akker recalled. ""So we made a bunch of them, and it's history."" ""Cosby sweaters,"" with their unique, bold mix of colors, became a fixture on the beloved series, which began 30 years ago this week. ""The Cosby Show"" was taped in front of a live audience (each episode would be shot twice). The sweaters made it easier to shoot the show, explained costume designer Sarah Lemire. ""We ended up doing close-ups of (Cosby) so you could cut between the first and second show. The sweater became an easy way to control that."" The sweaters would also provide a contrast from the other characters onscreen. ""With Bill, you can put something bold on him, and he would overpower it,"" Lemire said. Over the years, the sweaters would become even more creative: Someone from Scandinavia created a sweater with a baby-feet design to reflect Dr. Huxtable's occupation as an obstetrician. Another memorable sweater showed men running around, as both Cosby and his character loved to run relays. Lemire said she would get the occasional call from viewers, asking where something came from. In addition to van den Akker, some sweaters were from the fashion house Missoni and others from Perry Ellis. (They were not designed by Coogi, as some believed.) ""I was told there was a run on sweaters at one point,"" she said. The iconic sweaters would find a new life years after the show was in syndication. ""They were not all that popular"" at first, van den Akker said, ""but they became more popular later on, because suddenly people would watch the show and say 'What the f*** was that?' "" Young people have adopted the sweaters over the past decade. There's even a band called Cosby Sweater. Bill Cosby: The influence continues . Duke University student Kahsa Teum discovered early on that her father's Cosby-like sweaters were more comfortable than almost anything else. ""As a child in the early '90s, I enjoyed playing dress-up using my parents' clothes,"" she said, adding that she preferred the sweaters more than her mother's dresses. Now in her 20s, not much has changed for Teum. ""When I grew up, I found the Cosby sweaters to still be more comfortable (and, in my opinion, more aesthetically pleasing) than anything else that I owned, and they've been a staple in my wardrobe ever since!"" Teum wrote in an email. Freelance illustrator Kelly Tucker started a Tumblr in 2011 dedicated to Cosby's iconic sweaters. She called the site The Cosby Sweater Project. Each post summarizes episodes, showing off Cosby's best sweaters, with close-ups of each pattern. 'Cosby Show': Our 10 favorite moments . Tucker was blown away by the blog's popularity. She had no idea how much of a fan base the show had. More than three years later, she is still chronicling the show's sweaters. ""Watching (""The Cosby Show"") as an adult, I realized how many amazing patterns were incorporated into the wardrobes of all of the characters,"" Tucker said. ""As an illustrator and pattern designer, I found them to be very inspiring."" But what does the Cos himself think about all of this interest in the sweaters, 30 years later? ""I think youthful people have a long time to live, so they can waste some time on something like that,"" Cosby told Collectors Weekly in 2013. He is set to return in a new NBC show next year, but it's unlikely van den Akker will be called upon to make more sweaters. ""Silliness,"" van den Akker responded when asked whether he might revive the fashions. But if by some chance, Cosby were to ask him, of course he'd do it.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Navy SEAL team that fought its way upstairs at Osama bin Laden's compound killed him with rapid-fire shots to his chest and forehead, according to a U.S. official who has seen military reports of the raid. The unarmed bin Laden, who the White House said put up some form of resistance, was moving when he was first shot, the official on Wednesday told CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told CNN that weapons were near bin Laden, who died on an upper floor of the compound toward the end of the nearly 40-minute raid. ""He was right there and going to get those arms. You really can't take a chance."" The official who had seen the report -- and other sources -- provided new details on the nighttime operation and bin Laden's gruesome wounds, which were photographed. President Barack Obama, not wanting to inflame passions or appear to gloat, decided not to release a photo of bin Laden's corpse, the White House said Wednesday. ""There's a long history of images like that being used to rally opinion against people, to turn people into heroes,"" White House press secretary Jay Carney said. A senior Democratic official close to the White House told CNN that Obama was ""never in favor"" of releasing a photo. The photo decision -- following intense debate within the administration and by the public -- came as the United States continued pressing the Pakistani government on how it could not have known the al Qaeda leader was living near a military academy in Abbottabad when he was killed by U.S. special forces early Monday. The SEAL team is back on American soil, a senior U.S. official today CNN Wednesday night. Investigators, meanwhile, continued poring over materials gathered at bin Laden's hideout. The haul includes 10 hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices, such as disks, DVDs and thumb drives, a senior U.S. official told CNN. The materials might provide clues on al Qaeda members and potential plots for future attacks. The commandos also recovered five cell phones, audio and video equipment, ""lots"" of paper documents and some five guns, including AK-47s and pistols, a U.S. official told CNN homeland security correspondent Jeanne Meserve. The objects were ""hiding in plain sight,"" according to the official, who described the material as a treasure trove of information. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Wednesday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said of evidence taken from the residence, ""As we glean information from that material, we will make appropriate decisions with regard to who might we add to the terrorist watch list, the no-fly list, all those things."" A U.S. official told CNN in the afternoon that no names have been added to the watch list. It appeared bin Laden had contingency plans while he stayed at the fenced compound. Bin Laden had 500 euros (about $745) in cash and two telephone numbers sewn into his clothing when he was killed, a congressional source present at a classified briefing on the operation Tuesday told CNN Wednesday. Photos taken shortly after the raid show three men lying dead in pools of blood and the wreckage of a U.S. helicopter abandoned during the assault. One of the dead men bears a family resemblance to bin Laden, but there was no confirmation of his identity. The al Qaeda leader's adult son was among those killed in Monday's attack by U.S. commandos, according to American officials. The pictures were published Wednesday by Reuters. The news agency says they were taken by a Pakistani security official about an hour after U.S. forces left bin Laden's compound and that it is confident of the authenticity of the purchased images. The commandos took bin Laden's body with them, U.S. officials have said. CIA Director Leon Panetta and Carney on Tuesday said the commandos fought their way up to the third floor of the compound, moving room to room. Bin Laden and his family lived on the second and third floors, Carney said. The U.S. official who described bin Laden's last moments said the al Qaeda leader was ""moving"" at the time he was initially shot. The official declined to describe those movements. Previously, another U.S. official said bin Laden was shot when he made a threatening move. When asked if bin Laden tried to grab a weapon or physically attack a commando, the official would only say, ""He didn't hold up his hands and surrender."" The first shot hit bin Laden in the chest and the second struck him in the forehead just above the left eye, the official told CNN. A photo shows a gunshot wound to the head above the left eye, with the skull partially blown away, according to two sources who have seen a photograph of bin Laden's body. SEAL teams are trained, if at all possible, to take the first ""hit to kill"" shot by aiming dead center between the eyes, and then with a chest shot, according to a military officer familiar with their tactics and techniques. If Bin Laden was moving, that first shot might not have been possible. The shots occurred so rapidly they were nearly simultaneous. One of bin Laden's daughters has told Pakistani interrogators that she saw her father shot, a senior Pakistani intelligence source said Wednesday. The daughter, believed to be 12 or 13 years old, was among those left behind at the compound after Monday's U.S. raid, the source said. U.S. officials said bin Laden's wife was in the room with him and rushed at U.S. special operations forces, who then shot her in the leg. The Pakistani intelligence source told CNN Wednesday that four men at the compound were killed in addition to bin Laden: bin Laden's son, two men who were brothers, and an unknown man. That conflicts with information provided by the White House, which said Tuesday that three men and one woman were killed in the operation, in addition to bin Laden. Because bin Laden was killed and buried at sea, the administration has been under some pressure to release a photo proving he was dead. The president noted that few credible people have questioned the death and that conspiracy theorists would not be satisfied with a photo, the senior Democratic official said. That position was supported by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic official said. ""We don't trot out this stuff as trophies,"" Carney quoted Obama as saying in an interview earlier Wednesday with the CBS News program ""60 Minutes."" ""This is somebody who was deserving of the justice he received,"" Obama said in the interview. ""But we don't need to spike the football."" Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-South Carolina, called Obama's decision a ""mistake."" ""I know bin Laden is dead. But the best way to protect and defend our interests overseas is to prove that fact to the rest of the world,"" he said in a written statement. Questions are mounting, meanwhile, about why Pakistan failed to locate or bring bin Laden to justice. According to two sources at a briefing Tuesday, Panetta told lawmakers that Pakistani officials either ""were involved or incompetent. Neither place is a good place to be."" The United States is asking Pakistan for information on who built and owned the compound where bin Laden lived, two senior U.S. officials said Wednesday. Pakistani government officials have insisted that they did not know bin Laden's whereabouts. ""What worse statement can come than that we heard from Panetta?"" a senior Pakistani intelligence official said. ""I am afraid this statement is totally regrettable. (Panetta) of all people knows how much we have been doing."" The official, who did not want to be named, said his country had been generously sharing intelligence with its American counterparts. Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, said his government will conduct an inquiry to find out how bin Laden managed to maintain residency there. The government was not complicit with bin Laden because having him there was harmful, Haqqani told PBS' Charlie Rose. Any official who was aware of the fugitive's presence and failed to act will be held accountable, he added. Obama, meanwhile, planned a visit Thursday to New York's ground zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Center once stood. The towers fell in September 11, 2001, when al Qaeda hijackers flew commercial planes into them. Obama will take part in a wreath-laying ceremony and will meet with families of victims and first responders, but will not make remarks, White House spokesman Carney said. He characterized the event as ""bittersweet."" CNN's Nick Paton Walsh, Nic Robertson, Dana Bash, Ted Barrett, Elise Labott, Tom Cohen, Jeanne Meserve, Pam Benson, Barbara Starr, Suzanne Kelly, Chris Lawrence, Jessica Yellin, John King, Ed Hornick, Shawna Shepherd and Dan Gilgoff contributed to this report.","NEW: Pakistan ambassador vows inquiry .

""The export of products of the coffee-cocoa sector is carried out by the State, by any legal person mandated by the State or holder of an exporter license,"" the government announced. ""Approved exporters get their cocoa beans and green coffee from the State or any legal person mandated by the State."" The Ivory Coast is the world's largest supplier of cocoa beans. Gbagbo, the incumbent, has refused to give up power since an electoral commission declared challenger Alassane Ouattara the winner of the November presidential election. Gbagbo's refusal to step down has sparked violent clashes between supporters of the two rivals, resulting in the deaths of 365 people since December. Ouattara's ""New Forces"" loyalists claimed on the group's website to have taken the west Ivory Coast city of Toulepleu after intense fighting with Gbagbo forces on Sunday. Gbagbo's ability to maintain control over the nation's coffee and cocoa industry could be key to his staying in power. Coffee and cocoa experts have provided the embattled leader with a lucrative revenue source to pay loyal civil servants and military officers. In January, Ouattara called for a ban on cocoa and coffee exports in an effort to shut down that revenue stream and force Gbagbo out of office.","Opponent has called for a ban on cocoa exports to force Gbagbo out of power .

"At age 16, Rob McCullough walked into an LA Boxing gym for the first time. The teen had left home, moving from one friend's couch to another, and now finally felt like he found a place where he belonged. ""I went to the gym and worked out, and worked out my stuff,"" he says. ""That was kind of my safe haven."" After taking his first class and leaving with a compliment from the instructor, McCullough was hooked. ""It built self-confidence,"" he recalls. ""At the end of the day, I felt great about it."" Life was difficult at times for McCullough and his seven siblings who were raised by a single mother. Constantly relocating, he remembers how other kids were not always welcoming when the family moved to a new neighborhood. ""I dealt with bullying growing up as a kid because I was always the new guy at the school,"" he says. By the time he reached high school, a new challenge would shape his future. ""Going to a school with a lot of gangs at one point was kind of one of the things that got me to start and think, 'If I learned how to fight really well, people won't want to bother me at all,' "" he says. McCullough, known to his fans as ""the Razor,"" didn't just learn to fight. He went on to become a World Extreme Cagefighting and five-time United World Muay Thai Association champion, making a successful career taking down opponents in the ring. From a childhood with such challenges, McCullough found both a passion and an occupation. ""I found sports.  I found mixed martial arts; it was like therapy,"" he says. Now McCullough, together with LA Boxing, said he wants other children who face bullying to have the same opportunity. ""I would like to share with other kids that maybe if they are going through issues of being bullied, or they are a bully, it's a place that they can go to to work that stuff out,"" he says. Through the anti-bullying campaign, McCullough said he is sending a message to kids. ""We are going to schools in neighboring areas that we have gyms, so that these kids know there is a safe haven that they can go to."" The campaign reaches out to children by holding interactive assemblies at schools nationwide, promoting gyms as a positive resource for building self-confidence. He isn't doing it alone. Big names in the martial arts arena, such as Ultimate Fighting Championship President Dana White and former light heavyweight champion Tito Ortiz, have joined in to help stop bullying and promote their sport. ""We are guys that fight for a living, and we could obviously be mistaken for bullies, but we are nothing of the sort,"" McCullough says. ""We fight for many reasons, but we don't fight to be bullies."" For some of these fighters, the struggle with bullying is personal.  ""I have interesting stories from guys that are current active fighters,"" McCullough says. "" I had one guy say, 'I would love to be a part of this campaign because I used to stutter and I got made fun of all through high school.' "" McCullough now has another reason to get involved. ""I have a 2-year-old son, and I started to think about it,"" he says. ""What if my kid gets picked on?"" Martial arts may not appeal to all the children in the campaign's assemblies, but McCullough said he is sure the message is true for everyone.  ""I think at the end of the day it's respect,"" he says. ""Sports did it for me, and it did it for a lot of my friends that are professional athletes. It gives you something to focus on.""","Rob ""the Razor"" McCullough is a top fighter in mixed martial arts .

"The ""world's most wanted man"" may be holed up in Russia, but Edward Snowden's story will soon be available -- as they say -- everywhere books are sold. ""The Snowden Files: The Inside Story Of The World's Most Wanted Man,"" by reporter Luke Harding, from the British newspaper The Guardian, comes out in the UK this week, with a U.S. release date of February 11. The Guardian is a key player in the Snowden saga, having provided an outlet for the former NSA contractor-turned-whistle-blower to expose what he knew about the U.S. government's mass surveillance programs. Harding accessed a wealth of inside information, such as this story about how Snowden first connected via e-mail with Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald. Harding writes in the book: ""This mystery correspondent asked Greenwald to install PGP encryption software on his laptop. Once up and running, it guarantees privacy (the initials stand for Pretty Good Privacy) for an online chat. Greenwald had no objections. But there were two problems. 'I'm basically technically illiterate,' he admits. Greenwald also had a lingering sense that the kind of person who insisted on encryption might turn out to be slightly crazy."" Greenwald and Snowden eventually built a mutual trust, and the former IT contractor divulged many of the top secret documents in his possession. At that point, The Guardian's U.S. Editor Janine Gibson drew up plan before publishing, including seeking legal advice and working out a strategy for approaching the White House. She had some tough decisions to make. Harding wrote: ""Gibson decided to give the NSA a four-hour window to comment, so the agency had an opportunity to disavow the story. By British standards, the deadline was fair: long enough to make a few calls, agree a line. But for Washington, where journalist-administration relations sometimes resemble a country club, this was nothing short of outrageous."" Harding said Gibson's tough decisions meant she'd have to face down some tough people, including FBI deputy director Sean M. Joyce, NSA deputy director Chris Inglis, and  Robert S. Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The author writes: ""By fielding heavyweights, the White House had perhaps reckoned it could flatter, and if necessary bully, the Guardian into delaying publication. Gibson explained that the editor-in-chief -- in the air halfway across the Atlantic -- was unavailable. She said: 'I'm the final decision-maker.' After 20 minutes, the White House was frustrated. The conversation was going in circles. Finally, one of the team could take no more. Losing his temper, he shouted, 'You don't need to publish this! No serious news organisation would publish this!' Gibson replied, 'With the greatest respect, we will take the decisions about what we publish.'"" The newspaper ran the story and, soon thereafter, Snowden disappeared. He's currently in Russia, where he has asylum. ""I think ... he's achieved far more than he could have possibly imagined when he was sitting in Hawaii planning this leak,"" Harding told CNN on Sunday. He described Snowden's transformation from contractor to leaker. ""He got hardened. In other words, the more information he saw about what he viewed as ... mass surveillance, the more disillusioned he became. He says quite explicitly that he thought that (President Barack) Obama would roll back some of these programs when he came into the White House, and when this didn't happen, essentially Snowden decided he would take things into his own hands, and become a whistle-blower,"" he author said. ""There's no doubt that he's changed history by what he's done.""","The book, by Guardian reporter Luke Harding, will be released in the UK this week .
It details the unlikely journey of intelligence leaker Edward Snowden .

"(CNN) -- Enterovirus D68 has swept through 30 states since mid-August. What sets the virus apart from many others in the same family is its vicious symptoms: Instead of just causing a summer cold, it sends children to the hospital -- where they often end up in the intensive care unit, struggling to breathe. David Nash from Tucker, Georgia, is one of those children. At first his parents, Rachel and Rodney Nash, weren't too alarmed when David came down with a cough, runny nose and low-grade fever. But then the 3-year-old got sick very quickly. David was in the first wave of children hit with Enterovirus D68. The virus struck early in states such as Georgia, where children headed back to school last month, but it then spread to states such as New York and Connecticut, where school began after Labor Day. ""There's no doubt the opening of schools has facilitated the transmission of Enterovirus D68,"" says Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. What parents should know . The Nashes shared with CNN the day-to-day story of their son's illness, hoping it might help families whose children have been recently diagnosed with what one pediatrician calls a ""frightening"" virus. August 11 . A healthy David and his big brother, Benjamin, start school. August 24 . David develops a cough, runny nose and low-grade fever. His parents aren't too worried as it seems like a regular cold. August 25 . The Nashes become more concerned. Their little ball of energy who loves flying around the house as Batman doesn't want to play. That night, he wheezes as he sleeps. His parents wake him to give him puffs from an inhaler prescribed for his seasonal allergies. August 26 . David's breathing gets worse. ""You could see him trying to pull the air in,"" Rachel Nash recalls. ""His nostrils flared as he inhaled, and you could see the muscles in his neck and collarbone working extra hard."" Rodney Nash adds, ""I remember as a kid my goldfish jumped out of the bowl. That's how he looked to me -- like a goldfish gasping for breath."" The Nashes take David to the emergency room at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. His oxygen saturation rate is 86%. Healthy children's oxygen saturation is around 97%. The doctors give David oxygen through his nose. Every two hours he gets nebulizer treatments, which are commonly used to treat asthma, to try to unclog his airways. David hates the mask and isn't cooperative. David's saturation rate goes up to 88%, but that's not enough. He's admitted to the hospital. August 27 . In addition to the oxygen and breathing treatments, David gets an oral steroid to help shrink the swelling in his airways. Even then, David is still wheezing. ""It sounded like air going through a balloon -- where you pinch the balloon and hear the squeaking sounds,"" his father says. Doctors try a ""shaker vest."" Blasts of air shake the vest, which loosens up mucus caught in the lungs. David does the shaker vest treatment every three hours, but he's still not better. August 28 . At 4 a.m., a nurse says David is finally responding to the treatments. His breathing, which had been quick and shallow, is slowing down. The nebulizer treatments go from every two hours to every four. He still doesn't like them, but he doesn't protest as much as he did before. At 8 a.m., David is taken off the oxygen and allowed to play. Nurses watch to see if he can breathe OK while riding a bike. If he can't, it means more time in the hospital. David does fine on the bike, and his oxygen saturation level reaches 94% around lunchtime. He's discharged from the hospital. August 29-31 . For the first two days back at home, David does inhaler treatments every four hours. He wheezes a bit, but he's pretty much back to his old self -- energetic and playful. September 16 . David has an appointment with his pediatrician, Dr. Betsy John. She gives him a clean bill of health. David's journey with Enterovirus D68 is fairly typical, says Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, division director of infectious diseases at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. Many children, however, get sick even faster. David was ill for about two days before he had to be hospitalized, but many of Jackson's patients have gone from healthy to severely ill in just a day, and they arrive at the hospital barely able to breathe. ""These kids were really struggling. Many can't even speak a sentence,"" she says. ""It's frightening."" Her advice: If D68 has made its way to your community, and your child has asthma, or even, like David, just a history of allergies or occasional breathing difficulties, call your pediatrician and ask if there's anything you can do to protect your child.","Enterovirus D68 is sending children with breathing problems to the hospital .

"Michael Sam, an All-American defensive lineman from the University of Missouri, publicly revealed that he's gay Sunday, creating the possibility he'll be the first openly gay player drafted by the National Football League. ""I came to tell the world I'm an openly proud gay man,"" he said in an interview with ESPN. He said he told his Missouri teammates in August and suffered no repercussions. He said he was surprised to discover many people in the media already knew he was gay. ""I understand how big this is,"" Sam said in the ESPN interview. ""It's a big deal. No one has done this before. And it's kind of a nervous process, but I know what I want to be ... I want to be a football player in the NFL."" Sam also spoke about his sexual orientation Sunday to The New York Times, saying: ""I just want to make sure I could tell my story the way I want to tell it. I just want to own my truth."" Sam, at 6-foot-2 and 260 pounds, starred in college football last season. Besides being first team All-American, he was named the top defensive player in the Southeastern Conference, considered the nation's best league. Teammates named him the team's most valuable player. With those credentials, he's expected to be picked in the NFL draft in May. The Bleacher Report mock draft projected him to go in the late rounds because ""athletic limitations including a lack of flexibility and a lack of optimal size are concerning."" His agent said Monday that he does not think Sam's decision to acknowledge his sexual orientation will hurt his draft prospects. ""I think, if anything, teams will look at it and see a guy who was honest and upfront instead of waiting until after the draft to potentially make his announcement,"" Joe Barkett told CNN. ""Mike was forward, and he wants the team who drafts him to accept him for who he is."" The NFL issued a statement on Twitter on Sunday: ""We admire Michael Sam's honesty and courage. Michael is a football player. Any player with ability and determination can succeed in the NFL. We look forward to welcoming and supporting Michael Sam in 2014."" However, the NFL has made headlines on the issue of sexual orientation in the past. Last year, a University of Colorado player said an NFL team asked him if he liked girls and had a girlfriend. The NFL quickly said, ""Any team or employee that inquires about impermissible subjects or makes an employment decision based on such factors is subject to league discipline."" Sam issued his own Tweet: ""I want to thank everybody for their support and encouragement, especially @espn, @nytimes and @nfl. I am proud to tell my story to the world!"" Sam's announcement comes as the federal government expands its recognition of same-sex marriages. Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department will issue a memo Monday that extends the federal government's recognition of same-sex marriages, even in the 34 states that don't consider it legal. Other athletes have come out as gay, but they didn't have Sam's profile. GLAAD, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender media advocacy group, said Sam is  ""the latest high-profile athlete to come out as LGBT. Others include the NBA's Jason Collins, the WNBA's Brittney Griner, WWE's Darren Young, UFC's Liz Carmouche, MMA's Fallon Fox and Major League Soccer's Robbie Rogers."" Of those athletes, Collins made the biggest media splash. He's not playing in the NBA this season. Praise poured in for Sam, who overcame a rough childhood in which one of his brothers was killed and others ended up in prison. Sam's head football coach at Missouri, Gary Pinkel, said: ""We're really happy for Michael that he's made the decision to announce this, and we're proud of him and how he represents Mizzou. Michael is a great example of just how important it is to be respectful of others, he's taught a lot of people here first-hand that it doesn't matter what your background is, or your personal orientation, we're all on the same team and we all support each other."" GLAAD President Sarah Kate Ellis said in a prepared statement: ""By rewriting the script for countless young athletes, Michael has demonstrated the leadership that, along with his impressive skills on the field, makes him a natural fit for the NFL. With acceptance of LGBT people rising across our coasts -- in our schools, churches, and workplaces -- it's clear that America is ready for an openly gay football star.""","His agent says Sam's revelation will not hurt his draft prospects .

"By 2030, the top cancer killers in the United States will be lung, pancreas and liver, according to a new report published Monday in the American Association for Cancer Research's journal. Lung cancer is already the top killer overall, but pancreatic and liver cancer will surpass the cancers currently considered the second and third leading causes of death, researchers say. Right now, second most dangerous is breast cancer for women and prostate cancer for men; and third is colorectal cancer for both men and women. Researchers looked at trends in cancer incidence and death rates between 2006 and 2010, and used that data -- combined with expected U.S. demographic changes -- to predict numbers for 2030. Overall, the cancer-related death rate has been decreasing, researchers say, as a result of improved screening and treatment options. Yet while deaths from breast, prostate and colon cancers are projected to drop, deaths caused by liver, pancreatic, bladder and leukemia cancers are expected to increase. In fact, liver and pancreatic cancers will surpass breast and prostate to become the second and third-leading causes of cancer-related deaths, the researchers say. ""We've been able to turn the tide in other cancers, with an investment in (research),"" said lead author Lynn Matrisian, vice president of scientific and medical affairs at the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, which funded the study. ""We're hoping that with increased effort ... we will be able to impact and change those projections."" The rate of pancreatic cancer has been slowly increasing for the past 15 years, says Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Some of that rise can be attributed to the prevalence of obesity and diabetes. ""Many Americans are not aware that the combination of obesity, high-caloric intake and lack of physical activity is the second-leading cause of cancer in the U.S.,"" Brawley said. ""It is linked to at least 12 types of cancer, of which these are two. This is an American problem ... the rise in pancreatic cancer is not as severe as in Europe where obesity is less of an issue."" Obesity may affect cancer patients' outcomes . Overall, the number of cancer cases is expected to increase over the next 16 years, due to the rapidly aging population. In 2010, the United States had about 1.5 million cases of cancer; in 2030, researchers expect that number to reach 2.1 million. ""We're living much longer in the United States, so the number of people 65 age and older will be much greater,"" Matrisian said. ""And that's, of course, one of the biggest risk factors for cancer: Age."" Lung, breast, prostate and colorectal cancers are currently the most common in the United States. Known as the ""big four,"" these cancers have the highest incidence rates and receive the most research funding from the National Cancer Institute. This is unlikely to change by 2030, the researchers say, except for colorectal cancer, which is expected to be surpassed by thyroid, melanoma and uterine cancers in total number of cases. ""The decrease in colorectal cancer, falling from the top four incidence and top two in deaths, seems to be primarily the result of advances in colorectal cancer screening,"" the report authors write. The dramatic increase in thyroid cases is not a new epidemic, they say, but simply an increase in the number of cases being diagnosed. And while thyroid cancer has a 98% five-year survival rate, only 6% of pancreatic cancer patients are alive five years after diagnosis. The pancreas is difficult to scan with current imaging technologies, Matrisian says, because of its location in the body. And pancreatic tumors are often surrounded by dense tissue that render drugs useless. Surgery is the only treatment known to cure pancreatic cancer, but less than 20% of cases are operable, the report says. ""If we want to change the death rate for these diseases, it is necessary to increase the investment in understanding them and identifying early detection strategies,"" the report says.","Liver, pancreatic cancers to surpass breast, prostate as leading causes of death .
Rate of pancreatic cancer has been increasing steadily, in part because of obesity .

"Health officials are looking for the cause of a neurologic illness that's affected 10 children in Colorado. The children were hospitalized between August 9 and September 28 with muscle weakness in their limbs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Something is affecting the children's motor nerves, causing weakness primarily in their shoulders, triceps, biceps and hips, says Dr. Joyce Oleszek, a pediatric rehabilitation specialist at Children's Hospital Colorado. Doctors are also seeing some weakness in the neck and facial muscles in these patients. ""It seems to be attacking the spinal cord and brain stem,"" Oleszek said at a press conference Monday. MRI tests spotted abnormalities in the children's spinal gray matter. Most of the children experienced a respiratory illness before being admitted to the hospital, although only two had a history of asthma. The latest case was a girl who arrived at Children's Hospital Colorado over the weekend. She and three of the other patients are still at the hospital. The rest have been discharged, said Dr. Sam Dominguez, a microbial epidemiologist at the hospital. Doctors do not know if the neurological damage will be permanent. The CDC is investigating the cause of these symptoms. Health officials do not believe that the cases were caused by polio, as at least eight of the 10 children are up to date on their polio vaccinations. ""We don't know, at this point, if there is any association between the enterovirus EV-D68 that's circulating and the paralytic conditions some of the children in Colorado are experiencing,"" CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said. Tests of the children's cerebrospinal fluid came back negative for enteroviruses and West Nile virus. But a test of their nasal passages found enterovirus in six out of eight patients who were tested. Of those six, four tested positive for enterovirus D68, which has been sending children across North America to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. The other two test results are pending. ""It could be something else. That doesn't prove cause and effect, but it's circumstantial evidence,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The cause ""still remains a puzzle."" Enterovirus: My son was 'like a goldfish gasping for breath' A cluster of children with similar paralysis symptoms was identified in California last year. Samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus D68. Enterovirus D68 is part of the Picornaviridae family, which also includes the poliovirus, other enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Enteroviruses are very common, especially in late summer and early fall. The CDC estimates that 10 million to 15 million infections occur in the United States each year. These viruses usually appear like the common cold; symptoms include sneezing, a runny nose and a cough. Most people recover without any treatment. But some types of enterovirus are more serious. These can cause hand, foot and mouth disease; viral meningitis; encephalitis (inflammation of the brain); an infection of the heart; and paralysis in some patients. This year, enterovirus D68 seems to be exacerbating breathing problems in children who have asthma. The virus has infected at least 277 people in 40 states, according to the CDC. Cases have also been reported in Canada. Children's Hospital Colorado has treated over 4,000 children with severe respiratory illness since August 18, said Dr. Chris Nyquist, medical director for Infection Prevention and Control. About 10% were admitted. CNN affiliate WCBS reported Friday that a New Jersey toddler died last week from a severe respiratory illness and that the CDC will be testing samples to see whether he had enterovirus D68. The CDC is asking other hospitals across the country to be on the lookout for similar cases and to send in information on any patients with these symptoms. ""Parents shouldn't panic,"" Nyquist says. ""This is very, very uncommon. "" Common-sense things, like frequent hand-washing and avoiding sick people, can help protect kids from becoming infected, she said.","""It seems to be attacking the spinal cord and brain stem,"" doctor says .

"This week, as the Senate decides whether to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and Valentine's Day approaches, it's worth noting that most domestic violence victims don't ask for roses, chocolate or federal funding. Instead, we have one simple wish: We want the abuse to end. We don't want the relationship to end. This fact about ""crazy love"" surprises many people. How could you still love someone who has hurt you? The answer is as complicated as love itself. We victims tend to be hope junkies, open-hearted and optimistic. We believe that our loved ones are capable of change. Some would say we are naïve. Others say we are too kind or too forgiving.  Often we cannot find the courage to leave an abusive relationship until our life (or our children's safety) has been threatened. When victims end an abusive relationship, the first thing we need is shelter. This is the No. 1 request made by victims who call the National Domestic Violence Hotline, the federally funded national helpline (1.800.799.SAFE). It is a practical request -- a roof over our heads. But it is also an emotional one -- the deep need to seek safety and to protect our children from danger. Watch Leslie Steiner's TEDx Talk . Many victims know instinctively what friends and family usually don't: The most lethal time in an abusive relationship is after you leave. More than 70% of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has gotten out. Like 20-year-old Selina Brown, who was shot in the face last year as she and her toddler daughter tried to board a bus. So safe shelter is, naturally, our biggest priority. The second most common request also surprises people -- even in a town like Washington, D.C., with nearly 100,000 lawyers.  Victims say that after immediate shelter, what we need most is legal advice and representation.  Any woman who is going to turn herself from domestic violence victim to a domestic violence survivor needs this service. TED.com: Unlock the intelligence, passion, greatness of girls . I should know. I come from a family of Harvard-educated lawyers. Yet, when I left my abusive ex-husband -- an Ivy League Wall Street trader who kept three loaded guns in our house -- I had no one to accompany me to family court to get my temporary restraining order made permanent, and no one to help me begin divorce proceedings. So I went to court alone. Fortunately, a young legal aid attorney from a local women's shelter showed up.  She spoke to my husband and the judge.  She pointed me in the direction of the bullet-proof glass window where my new restraining order awaited. She recommended a divorce lawyer I could hire immediately. Thanks to her, and dozens of other strangers who helped me, I left my ex-husband. Today I'm happily remarried and the mother of three wonderful children. I have a black lab and drive a Honda Odyssey minivan. I couldn't have left and rebuilt such an ordinary, happy life without the kindness of others. TED.com: Poems of war, peace, women, power . Here in Washington, 700 registered pro bono lawyers have joined forces with a new nonprofit, the D.C. Volunteer Lawyers Project. It now has more attorneys than Washington's largest law firm. The lawyers are typically stay-at-home moms craving volunteer work that puts their legal training to good use. TED.com: Tales of passion . The volunteer lawyers' group provides mentoring, training, court appearance scheduling and malpractice insurance, all within a $350,000 annual budget, which is tiny considering it serves a city of more than 600,000 people. Since its founding, it has helped more than 2,000 family violence survivors. In 2012, its lawyers donated more than 14,000 pro bono legal hours. I call that true love. This Valentine's Day, I'd like to call on all lawyers in Washington and elsewhere to consider helping stop domestic violence for good. The D.C. Volunteer Lawyers Project model can be replicated in any small town or big city. By giving victims a little pro bono assistance, lawyers can help make our nation's dinner tables, homes and families the safe and peaceful oases they should be. By giving a small amount of time, like the advocate who helped me so many years ago, we can all help victims of domestic violence. Now that's a Valentine's Day present we can all get mushy about.","Leslie Steiner: Victims of domestic violence just want the abuse to end for good .

"The war on terror. Same-sex marriage. Voting rights. Financial scandals. Fast and Furious. Attorney General Eric Holder's six-year tenure as the nation's chief law enforcement officer has been marked by an activist agenda and political confrontations on a range of legal, policy, and criminal matters. ""I've always liked this job. I've had some days that have been better than others,"" Holder told CNN's Justice Correspondent  Evan Perez last November. He hinted then that his remaining time in office would give him ""the ability to focus on issues now that really matter to me."" Some of those things were sentencing reform for drug offenders and community policing outreach in the wake of the recent shooting of unarmed Missouri teenager Michael Brown. For the 63-year-old Bronx native, it was his way to carve out a modern civil rights legacy that had the blessing of his good friend and confidante, President Barack Obama.

Holder's response to the August shooting of Brown, an African-American, in the St. Louis suburb of Ferguson may be the lasting memory many Americans will have of this attorney general. He ordered a broad federal civil rights probe of that city's mostly white police department, and this week spoke in personal tones about the level of mistrust many racial minorities have toward police. ""Will we yet again turn a blind eye to the hard truths that Ferguson exposed?"" he said Tuesday. ""Or will we finally accept this mandate for open and honest dialogue?"" The nation's first African-American attorney general has offered both unqualified support for local law enforcement while suggesting a ""remake"" of how it deals with many citizens of color.

Obama and Holder hone their messages on race-tinged issues . Critics: 'Good riddance' But critics of the Holder Justice Department have their own bitter memories of his tenure, especially on Fast and Furious, the gun trafficking controversy that led to him becoming the first sitting Cabinet member to be held in contempt of Congress. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives launched Operation Fast and Furious out of Arizona to track weapon purchases by Mexican drug cartels. However, it lost track of more than 1,000 firearms that the agency had allowed straw buyers to carry across the border, and two of those lost weapons turned up at the scene of the 2010 killing of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry. Republican lawmakers had long demanded documents on the operation that Holder refused to turn over, launching a major fight over executive privilege. ""Good riddance Eric Holder,"" tweeted Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-South Carolina, after the Thursday announcement. ""Your disregard for the Constitution of the United States will not be missed."" Who might replace Eric Holder? Long-lasting legacy . Holder's legacy will be felt for years. In the coming months, the Supreme Court is poised to decide the constitutionality of same-sex marriage, an issue that was largely driven on a national scale by the attorney general. He has repeatedly cited the Obama administration decision in 2011 to quit defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which eventually led to the June 2013 Supreme Court ruling striking down parts of the law requiring the federal government to deny recognition of legal same-sex marriages. That strategy has led to state bans being toppled in rapid succession in the past year. Gay rights groups say Holder's leadership to make it easier for gays and lesbians to legally wed across the United States is seen by many activists as the civil rights issue of the new millennium. ""I believe we must be suspicious of legal classifications based solely on sexual orientation,"" Holder said this spring. ""And we must endeavor -- in all of our efforts -- to uphold and advance the values that once led our forebears to declare unequivocally that all are created equal and entitled to equal opportunity."" Voting restriction laws . Holder also recently made a public push to fight what he calls ""restrictive state laws"" over the ability of voters -- especially minorities -- to cast ballots. The Justice Department has sued Texas over its voter identification regulations, and a federal appeals court is hearing oral arguments Thursday over North Carolina's law limiting same-day registration and early voting. Such an approach made Holder arguably one of the most controversial attorney generals in recent memory. ""With Eric Holder's departure, the nation can begin to heal. His was the most divisive tenure of any attorney general I can recall, tearing the country apart on racial and partisan lines,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""By not just pushing but breaking through the envelope of plausible legal argument, Attorney General Holder has done his all to expand federal (especially executive) power and contract individual liberty beyond any constitutional recognition. Eric Holder will not be missed by those who support the rule of law."" Changes in sentencing guidelines . Perhaps the issue closest to the attorney general's heart was working to change sentencing guidelines to give prosecutors more flexibility in certain non-violent criminal cases. He and his aides have been pushing for rehabilitation instead of warehousing of prisoners, and getting rid of the disparity in the way the justice system deals with defendants charged in cocaine and crack cocaine crimes. He is joined in that effort by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, and other conservatives who have similar views on expanded individual rights. But Holder's moves to use administrative memos to make effective changes before Congress passes new laws have also generated criticism. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey told CNN's Jake Tapper recently that he generally agreed with ""the goal of getting rid of mandatory minimums... But the way to do that is to pass a law, not to say you're going to disregard the law."" Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee and a frequent Holder critic, has similarly criticized the Obama administration for taking action without waiting for Congress. Holder endorses shorter sentences for drug offenders . Efforts on national security . On the national security front, Holder has been unsuccessful in his desire to close the Guantanamo military prison, where mostly Muslim terror suspects and other ""enemy combatants"" are being held, over the strong objections of many nations and  international human rights groups. His department cites the successful prosecution of dozens of terror suspects in the civilian criminal justice system. Holder this month also announced a program to try to thwart recruitment by extremist groups such as ISIS, attempting to involve social and mental health workers as well as religious leaders and police to spot radicalization early. It was an effort to blend community outreach programs with stepped-up government surveillance, especially toward young Americans who would be willing to go overseas and join terror groups, including in Syria. Despite those efforts, authorities say more than 100 Americans have traveled in recent years to join groups involved in the Syrian civil war. More than a dozen are believed to have joined ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State. ""I think it's just a matter of time before they start looking outward and start looking at the West and at the United States in particular,"" Holder warned this summer, referring to ISIS recruitment efforts. Balancing security and freedom . Many legal and security experts see a mixed record for the administration's efforts to balance security and freedom in a post-9/11 era. There has been criticism over the failure to prevent the leak of sensitive national security information by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who disclosed a secret, sweeping government program to gather millions of Americans' phone ""metadata"" records without their permission or knowledge. When discussing his civil rights efforts, Holder often mentions his sister-in-law, who in 1963 made history as one of the two black students who integrated the University of Alabama under federal armed guard. A portrait of a Justice Department prosecutor who stood watch on the university steps that day hangs in Holder's personal office in a fifth-floor corner of the Justice Department headquarters -- named for Robert F. Kennedy, another one of his heroes. In a May speech, Holder talked about his role as both a defender of justice and a guardian of safety and security -- and how he approached that often-competing challenge. ""In recent years, thousands of Americans, the pride of our nation, have given their lives -- and deal even today with the scars of war -- so that hopeful, striving people who live continents away could proudly hold up their purple fingers after voting in a truly democratic process,"" he said. ""America is now 50 years from Freedom Summer. And we must not countenance, within our own borders, practices that would make it difficult or impossible to exercise the right for which so many have given so much.""","Eric Holder served as attorney general for six years .
Critics are happy to see him go, say he disregarded Constitution .
Supporters say he advanced civil rights ."
"The father of Edward J. Snowden has offered federal authorities a deal that he says would likely lead the accused leaker to return voluntarily to the United States to face espionage charges. The proposal was laid out in a letter, dated Thursday and obtained Friday by CNN's ""Amanpour,"" addressed to Attorney General Eric Holder and written by Bruce Fein, a Washington-based lawyer for Snowden's father, Lonnie G. Snowden. It demands that the former National Security Agency computer contractor who exposed details about U.S. surveillance programs remain free prior to trial; not be subject to a gag order; and be tried in a place of his choosing. It further demands that, if any of those promises is broken, the prosecution would be dismissed. Read the letter . ""With these written representations and guarantee, Mr. Snowden is reasonably confident that his son could be persuaded to surrender voluntarily to the jurisdiction of the United States to face trial,"" Fein wrote. The Justice Department has no immediate comment. In comments Friday to NBC News' ""Today,"" the elder Snowden said he had not spoken with his son since April. ""I love him, I would like to have the opportunity to communicate with him. I don't want to put him in peril, but I am concerned about those who surround him,"" he said. Though the 30-year-old man may have betrayed his government, ""I don't believe he has betrayed the people of the United States,"" he said. He expressed concern that his son might have been manipulated by WikiLeaks. ""Their focus isn't necessarily the Constitution of the United States,"" he said. ""It's simply to release as much information as possible."" A day after authorities in Ecuador said they would not bow to U.S. pressure as they weigh Snowden's request for asylum, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell denied any ""bullying"" tactics had been used. ""The point is just that we are making a consistent point to any government that might take him as a final destination that this is somebody wanted on serious felony charges and we would like him returned to the United States,"" Ventrell told reporters Friday in response to a question from CNN's Jill Dougherty. Obama: Pay no attention to that man we can't capture . He was referring to his warning Thursday that Ecuador's economic ties with the United States could be jeopardized. ""What would not be a good thing is them granting Mr. Snowden asylum,"" Ventrell had said. ""That would have grave difficulties for a bilateral relationship."" Ventrell then cited trade agreements the United States has extended to Ecuador. ""They're unilateral trade provisions that provide a benefit to certain Ecuadorian products,"" Ventrell said. ""Whether they're renewed or not is a prerogative of the U.S. Congress."" Asked about that remark, Ventrell said Friday, ""I wouldn't call it a threat.  I'd say that, you know, we are making the same points in public that we are making in private -- that this is somebody accused of serious crimes that we want returned."" The warning sparked a strong response on Thursday from Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, at an event in Quevedo. ""It is outrageous to try to delegitimize a state for receiving a petition of asylum,"" said the left-leaning economist who is known for decrying what he and other Latin American leaders have called U.S. imperialism. And on Friday, the Embassy of Ecuador announced that the country had suspended its support for the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, which provided duty-free treatment for certain products. U.S. asks Ecuador to reject any asylum request from Snowden . ""As we have stated previously, any political or economic consequences of our decision regarding the asylum request are outweighed by our legal and humanitarian obligations,"" an embassy statement said. Last year, Ecuador granted asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who remains in the nation's embassy in Britain. Ecuador's rationale appeared to have won support from former U.S. President Jimmy Carter. If another country wants to give haven to Snowden, ""then that is their right as a sovereign nation,"" he told CNN's Suzanne Malveaux. ""If the United States can acquire custody of him, I'm sure he will be brought to trial, and that's the way the law should be implemented."" Snowden's acts may have some positive impact, Carter said. ""He's obviously violated the laws of America, for which he's responsible, but I think the invasion of human rights and American privacy has gone too far,"" he said. ""I think that the secrecy that has been surrounding this invasion of privacy has been excessive, so I think that the bringing of it to the public notice has probably been, in the long term, beneficial."" Asked to elaborate, he said, ""I think the American people deserve to know what their Congress is doing."" Snowden has been at Moscow's international airport since Sunday, when he arrived from Hong Kong. Europe furious, 'shocked' by report of U.S. spying .","Snowden's father offers Attorney General Holder a deal .
The stipulations include that Snowden remain free until trial .
He must also be allowed to speak freely, his father's lawyer says .
Asylum would be Ecuador's right to offer, Jimmy Carter says ."
"This month, one of the least merciful presidents in the history of the United States granted 13 pardons and eight commutations of sentence. The grants moved President Barack Obama's overall mark past the administrations of John Adams (who served only one term), William H. Harrison (who died of pneumonia after serving only 30 days), James Garfield (who was fatally wounded by an assassin after serving only four months) and George Washington. The New York Times complained that, when it came to the pardon power, there was just ""no excuse"" for Obama's ""lack of compassion"" and encouraged him to ""do much more."" The American Civil Liberties Union called the pardons ""a step"" and hoped the President would ""continue to exercise his clemency powers."" Meanwhile, the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, lamented the ""drought"" of pardons in the Obama administration and called the recent grants ""mingy and belated."" Conservative columnist Debra Saunders wrote that it was ""about time"" Obama acted, and even tossed out the possibility/hope that he might ""do it again soon."" While it is true that Obama's grants included no one comparable to Scooter Libby, or Marc Rich, much less President Richard Nixon, the intensity and commonality of reactions is noteworthy. Political executives -- presidents and governors -- may not be quite aware of or in tune with it just yet, but the times, they are a-changing. No one is clamoring for violent criminals to be yanked out of prisons and tossed into the streets to wreak havoc on society. No one is lusting for the considered judgment of judges and juries to be whimsically overturned by politicians leaving office and, in the process, sidestepping accountability. But, increasingly, there is recognition that budgets are tight, and prisons are both overcrowded and expensive. The recidivism of those who spend time in prisons and exit without anything like serious rehabilitation is also costly. Congress' recent recognition of the failure (if not outright unjust nature) of sentencing laws appears, to many, as still yet another indicator that there is consensus regarding the status of the so-called war on drugs: It has not worked out very well. Judges have complained loudly about mandatory minimum and three-strikes laws which have limited their ability to tailor punishments to fit crimes -- a basic notion of justice. Public opinion polls also suggest Americans are increasingly uncomfortable with over-criminalization in the law. The pardon power will always carry an inherent political ""risk,"" because no one can perfectly predict the future behavior of recipients and everyone's judgment can be second-guessed, if not mischaracterized. Informed persons know Mike Huckabee did not ""pardon"" Maurice Clemmons and Michael Dukakis did not ""pardon"" Willie Horton. But, of course, executives cannot always survive political storms with the support and encouragement of informed persons. Nonetheless, the Founding Fathers considered the pardon power an integral part of our system of separation of powers and checks and balances. Its presence in the Constitution is premised on the notion that Congress and the Courts are not always perfect. Anyone care to disagree? It simply follows that, if the pardon power is being neglected or abused, then government is not doing what it was meant to do. Alexander Hamilton furthermore noted, in the Federalist Papers, that the criminal codes of nations have an almost natural tendency toward over-severity. For that reason, he argued, there should be easy access to mercy. Yes, you read that right, ""easy access,"" or, in other words, something very different than what is going on in the Obama administration. The fortunate thing is, presidents and governors can very easily minimize the political ""risk"" of pardoning by granting pardons regularly, consistently, throughout terms, as opposed to, very questionably, at the ""last minute."" While Christmas pardons may make some feel warm and fuzzy, they also send a message that is more counterproductive than anything. They seem to say mercy is an afterthought, or worse, a gift, that may or may not be deserved. The fact of the matter is the majority of individual acts of executive clemency in our lifetime have been pardons, which simply restored the civil rights of the recipients. No one was sprung from jail. Violent criminals were not tossed into the streets. Judges and juries were not overturned. Recipients have typically committed minor offenses, many involving no incarceration whatsoever, and usually, many years if not decades before pardon. FBI background checks documented they had integrated back into society as law-abiding productive members. Their pardons were not ""gifts"" so much as they were well deserved recognition. Have these pardons been high-wire maneuvers? Have they required presidents to spend precious political capital? Not at all. Obama has granted 52 pardons to date. There is a much better than average chance that readers cannot name a single recipient. George W. Bush granted almost 200. So, why can't Obama restore the civil rights of more applicants? Why doesn't he? There is no obvious answer to that question, save lack of care and concern. Where is the President who said his religion teaches him the importance of redemption and second chances? Where is the hope?","President Obama has granted 52 pardons to date; George W. Bush granted almost 200 .
P.S. Ruckman: Obama is one of the least merciful presidents in U.S. history .
He says Christmas pardons may seem warm and fuzzy, but it makes them seem like a gift .

"A mother mourns the deaths of children who slipped from her grasp. A father says he's contemplated suicide. A family prepares to rebuild. A week after Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines, the adrenaline-fueled response to the storm and its aftermath have faded from the streets of Tacloban. Now, the grim realities of daily life have taken its place. Juvelyn Taniega is trying to keep busy. She's collected old dishes and is cleaning them up, crouching on the ground near the spot where her home once stood and the place where she last saw her husband and six children alive. She's found the bodies of three of her children, but three of them are still missing. In days, she said, no one has come to help. ""My children are decomposing,"" she said. In other parts of the storm-ravaged city, help has arrived. Trucks carry food. Crews clean up debris. Workers line up bodies to be identified by families who've been searching for their loved ones. Humanitarian workers and military troops from around the world have converged on the Eastern Philippines, racing against time to rescue and feed those devastated by the storm. The horror is everywhere thanks to what was Super Typhoon Haiyan when it came ashore a week ago ago, packing winds 3.5 times as strong as Hurricane Katrina, pushing in a wall of water 15 feet high and washing away towns on many islands. The official nationwide death toll from the typhoon had increased to 2,360 by Friday morning. Other reports suggested the toll could be far higher, with thousands feared dead in Tacloban alone. The deadly storm left more than 3,850 injured and at least 77 people reported missing across the Philippines, officials said. Reaching all the victims and assisting the survivors -- including more than 2 million people in need of food, according to the Philippines government -- are both priorities now. How to help . A significant sign of stepped up relief efforts was Thursday's arrival of the USS George Washington, an aircraft carrier teeming with 5,500 crew. It's accompanied by eight more ships that, together, have 80 aircraft -- including 21 helicopters -- that can deliver supplies to hard-to-reach areas and conduct search-and-rescue missions for those still holding on six days after the epic storm. Faces of the storm . Supplies running out at hospitals . In Tacloban, the bloated corpses of dogs lie next to body bags filled with human remains. The stench from wreckage hovers all around, as people sift through debris. A line snakes around the airport, filled with those eager to leave. Families huddle inside the city convention center, savoring their first rice in a week but not knowing when their next meal will come. ""We really don't know what we're going to do next,"" said 30-year-old May May Gula, 30, a member of one of eight families sharing what was left of a room on the convention center's ground floor. Emotional extremes for families of typhoon victims . Some typically called upon to help need help themselves. Take First Seaman Ryan Cardenas, a member of the Philippines Navy, who has helped with recovery efforts after two other cyclones in the past two years that left hundreds dead. But when Haiyan slammed into the Tacloban naval station where he's based, he and other sailors clung to rafters in their barracks. Their commanding officer, who was in a separate building almost demolished by the storm, stayed alive by clutching a palm tree's trunk. Afterward, sailors helped retrieve some bodies, according to Cardenas. One found his mother sitting dead against a wall. Now, they're sorting through the wreckage of the naval station and awaiting orders. ""This is the worst,"" Cardenas said, taking a break from fixing a piece of damaged furniture. ""We're both victims and rescuers."" Scenes of devastation, calls for help . Senator concerned about crimes against women . In some cases, it's not that there's not enough food, water and other necessities. It's that they are not being given out, because getting to those in need is so difficult. The danger of violence -- whether out of desperation or confusion -- looms over the relief efforts. Police warned a CNN crew to turn back Wednesday on the road south of Tacloban, saying rebels had been shooting at civilians. ""Maybe they are looking for food,"" a police commander said. U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery, the commander of the USS George Washington's strike group, acknowledged security is an issue. But it's hardly the only one, nor even the biggest. ""Obviously, the conditions are pretty grim right now,"" Montgomery told CNN Thursday. ""But it's not as much security as it is just the inaccessibility of the roads."" A Philippines senator said she's learned of reports of rapes and other crimes against women, some allegedly perpetrated by convicts who escaped prison in the typhoon's aftermath, the state-run Philippines News Agency reported. Sen. Nancy Binay particularly expressed alarm after women said on TV that the situation had become worse, with assailants going so far as to break into people's homes. Debris hampers delivery of aid . International aid has piled up at airports, blocked from distribution to the starving by miles of debris-strewn roads. It is taking a long time to clear them and establish communications in to remote areas, said Philippines Secretary of the Interior Mar Roxas. ""Imagine a situation where from zero, from zero, no power, light, water, communication, nothing, you have to build the social infrastructures as well as the physical infrastructures for 275,000."" Opinion: Childhood in the path of typhoons . In the meantime, U.S. Marines have transformed a sleepy airbase in Cebu into a buzzing center of activity that included cargo aircraft, tilt-rotor Ospreys and camouflaged Marines. The Ospreys can land in remote spots where there are no cleared runways, but crews still find themselves hemmed in by debris. ""Some of those neighborhoods are inundated with water, and some of it's inaccessible,"" Brig. Gen. Paul Kennedy said. Roxas would love to see the assistance getting out faster. Still, he feels it's doubling by the day. Amos, the top U.N. humanitarian official, pointed Thursday morning to a continuing litany of needs -- such as clean water, hygiene kits, hospital supplies, tents and other shelters. The airport can handle more traffic, and roads are getting better and better. At the same time, Amos said, ""We know that much more is required."" 'Immense' need . But can it come soon enough? That's a pressing question in Guiuan, a remote community of about 45,000 people that was among the first areas hit by the full force of the storm. Alexis Moens, a team leader with Doctors Without Borders, described whole areas as ""flattened -- houses, medical facilities, rice fields, fishing boats, all destroyed."" ""People are living out in the open; there are no roofs left standing in the whole of Guiuan,"" Moens said. ""The needs are immense, and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organizations."" In Tacloban, those who survived say they have no choice but to move forward. Jericho, a boy whose mother, aunt and nine cousins were killed in the storm, tells his father he wants to leave the city on one of the planes he's seen flying overhead. His father tells him they have to stay in Tacloban. ""We have no money,"" he says. ""Just each other."" A man whose wife and child died said he can't stop thinking of seeing his family drown in the storm. ""The first one that I saw was my youngest,"" he said. ""She fainted, and then she drowned. The water was so fast. And then my wife, when I tried to grab her, I missed her. Then she drowned, and then I never saw her again."" Over the past week, he admits he's often thought of killing himself. But he hasn't, he said, because he still has one child who needs him.

"It has become a tragically familiar scene in American life: law enforcement officers descending on a packed school where a gunman is on the loose. A procession of students, their hands raised, slowly making their way out of the danger zone. But the handling of Friday's shooting at Arapahoe High School -- just 10 miles from the scene of the 1999 Columbine High School shooting where two students killed 12 classmates and a teacher before fatally shooting themselves -- drew important lessons from the earlier bloodshed. At Arapahoe High School, where senior Claire Davis, 17, was critically injured before the shooter turned the gun on himself, law enforcement officers responded within minutes and immediately entered the school to confront the gunman rather than surrounding the building, authorities said. As the sound of shots reverberated through the corridors, teachers immediately followed procedures put in place after Columbine, locking the doors and moving students to the rear of classrooms. ""That's straight out of Columbine,"" Kenneth Trump, president of National School Safety and Security Services, a Cleveland-based consulting firm, told CNN Saturday. ""The goal is to proceed and neutralize the shooter. Columbine really revolutionized the way law enforcement responds to active shooters."" Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson credited the quick police response time for the fact that student Karl Pierson, the gunman, stopped firing on others and turned his weapon on himself. In fact, Robinson told reporters Saturday, Pierson killed himself less than 1 minute, 20 seconds after entering the school. Robinson said a deputy sheriff assigned as a school resource officer and an unarmed security guard immediately closed in on the shooter. ""That one minute and 20 seconds, in my mind, is extraordinarily relevant,"" he said, noting that Pierson was heavily armed, with ammunition, a knife and three explosives. Authorities knew from research and contact with forensic psychologists that school shooters typically continue firing until confronted by law enforcement, Robinson said. ""We believe that the response from the school resource officer and from the unarmed school security officer was absolutely critical to the fact we did not have additional injury and or death,"" he said. Robinson said the so-called active shooter response protocol, which was developed after Columbine, was put into place. In addition, school staff and students implemented a well-rehearsed lockdown practice. ""The combination of quick response by the resource officer and the implementation of a lockdown protocol caused the children and staff to be safe,"" he said. ""Both protocols came together as they were designed to do."" Friday's shooting came on the eve of the one year anniversary of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre, where Adam Lanza killed 20 first-graders and six adults at the now-demolished elementary school in the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. Newtown marks anniversary of school killings . ""It's very unfortunate that we have to say that there's a textbook response on the way to respond to these, because that textbook was written based on all of the incidents that we've had and the lessons learned,"" Trump said. Trump said both Sandy Hook and the latest shooting in Colorado highlight the importance of ""training and engaging"" school support staff -- from custodians to school secretaries to maintenance and food service workers -- on how to best respond during these incidents. In Sandy Hook, a school custodian's 911 calls provided authorities some of the first information about what was happening. ""Often these people are not getting training in school emergency planning,"" Trump said. ""In a critical incident, they may be the first person to respond."" At Arapahoe High School, a school janitor spotted Pierson, whose intended target was a faculty member, in his tactical gear, he told CNN affiliate KMGH. ""It just looked weird,"" Fabian Llerenas said. ""He went in, and I heard two pops. That's when I knew. I said, 'They are shooting in the school.'"" Llerenas said he called 911 and then escorted the targeted faculty member out of the school. Pierson had fired at the man but missed, Llerenas told KUSA. ""He was so [shaken] up, he felt the wind hit, out of the shotgun just blew his hair, but it didn't hit him. It was that scary for him,"" Llerenas said. ""In my opinion, that was the most important tactical decision that could have been made,"" Robinson said. The faculty member ""left that school in an effort to try to encourage the shooter to also leave the school."" Trump said other lessons learned from Columbine included the controlled evacuations and pat-down searches of students in a secure area. Self evacuations can create chaos for the police. Additionally, schools now have predesignated parent-student ""reunification centers"" to prevent parents from showing up at the scene and interfering with law enforcement, as was the case in Sandy Hook, Trump said. ""The lessons of Columbine are still the best practices,"" Trump said. After Sandy Hook. Trump said, some officials advocated a ""run, hide or fight"" approach developed for workplace shootings in which teachers and students are encouraged to be prepared to throw things at gunmen. Some even suggested that elementary school students use items such as cans of soup to attack gunmen. Trump called it a ""high risk, high liability proposition."" ""The good news is that we're getting better at preventing and responding to these incidents,"" he said. ""The bad news is that there will be cases that slip through the cracks.""","Handling of shooting at Arapahoe High School drew important lessons from Columbine .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- National Guard members were on duty in Ferguson, Missouri, on Thanksgiving but the people who came up to them only wanted to spread goodwill, bringing turkey and other treats. CNN affiliate KSDK reported that dozens of citizens visited one post at a shopping center. ""We just all have to make sure that we are taking care of one another,"" Terry Pimmel told the station. ""That is our mission."" Gov. Jay Nixon also stopped by to see the troops. Other volunteers bundled up and painted boards that cover the holes where windows used to be in buildings trashed during recent protests, according to CNN affiliate KMOV. ""We came out here because we thought that anything would be better than just blank plywood,"" Avi Ryan, 13, told KMOV. Some members of the family of Michael Brown, who was fatally shot in August by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, gathered at his father's place for their first holiday dinner since Brown's death. There was a chair left empty at the dining room table of Michael Brown Sr., a photo posted to Twitter by Ferguson Action showed. A shirt with the words ""Gone (Too) Soon"" was draped over the chair and Brown Sr. wore a shirt that said, ""Justice. Small protests overnight . Perhaps it was the biting cold, or maybe it was because of Thanksgiving. But Ferguson was much calmer early Thursday than it had been the previous two days. A few dozen protesters showed up outside police headquarters in Ferguson late Wednesday night. And standing under a ""Seasons Greetings"" sign stretching over the road, they fired obscenities at National Guard members who stood on watch outside the police department's offices. But there were no incidents, no confrontations between the two sides. Police made two arrests, and no injuries or damages were reported. A protest organizer told CNN that even though the numbers were small early Thursday, demonstrators will return night after night as they have done since the summer when Michael Brown, a black teen, was shot dead by Darren Wilson, a white police officer. Nationwide, protests continued, but they too were peaceful for the most part. In Los Angeles, police arrested 130 protesters on misdemeanor charges of failure to disperse. In Oakland, California, police arrested 35 people for a variety of charges related to protests. At the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York on Thursday morning, seven were arrested after several people broke through barriers near the parade route to protest Monday's grand jury decision not to indict Wilson, New York police said. Wilson's future . For his part, Wilson is in talks to leave the Ferguson Police Department and may give up being an officer altogether. ""It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,"" Wilson's attorney, Neil Bruntrager, told CNN's Don Lemon late Wednesday. ""Realistically, he can't go back to being a police officer. He knows that. There's no illusion about any of this."" Wilson has said he killed the 18-year-old Brown out of fear for his life during their encounter on August 9. He maintains he hasn't done anything wrong. Though he hasn't said much, Wilson sympathizes with Brown's family, his attorney said. ""His remorse and his sadness about what happened is there, and it's real,"" Bruntrager told CNN. ""But in respect to the Browns, he's been very careful to sort of stand back. He knows that whatever he says, it's not going to be read as he means it."" The Browns' dismay . Brown's parents don't believe Wilson's version of events, telling CNN's Sunny Hostin their son would never have taunted the officer nor reached for his weapon . ""He's a murderer,"" Brown's father said, referring to Wilson. ""He understood his actions. He understood exactly what he was doing. You know, he didn't have a second thought, a pushback thought, or nothing. He was intending to kill someone. That's how I look at it,"" Brown said. ""He was going to kill someone at that point."" Michael Brown's mother said hearing that a grand jury had decided not to indict the officer who killed her son felt like getting shot. ""We heard this and it was just like, like I had been shot. Like you shoot me now -- just no respect, no sympathy, nothing,"" Lesley McSpadden told Hostin on Wednesday. ""This could be your child. This could be anybody's child."" Investigation continues . Back in Ferguson, a one-mile stretch of West Florissant Avenue, the site of previous protests, was closed to cars and pedestrians, with authorities saying the burned-out buildings on the route are crime scenes. One of those buildings is Flood Christian Church, where Michael Brown Sr. is a member. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is leading an investigation into the fire that destroyed the church, a spokesman said. Investigators have found that someone broke into the church, and the fire began in a foyer near the doors that were breached, the ATF spokesman said. The church is some distance away from the strip of stores that burned Monday. Other nearby structures were untouched, which is cause for suspicion, the spokesman said. Also Wednesday, Ferguson police were looking for clues as to who stole an AR-15 that was locked in a rack and plucked from a police car torched by rioters this week. ""They took the entire rack from the car,"" St. Louis County police Sgt. Brian Schellman said. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .

"Some call them a secret brotherhood, others refer to them as a spiritual mystery. The Mevlevis -- or ""Whirling Dervishes"" -- themselves acknowledge that their devotion blurs the line between physical and metaphysical worlds. ""To die before actually dying, that is what's important in the world, to kill your ego. That's why we wear white robes, which symbolize what we are wearing when we die. Even our hats look like gravestones,"" says Celaleddin Loras, a Mevlevi Sheikh, or master of the order. The ritual practiced by the Order of the Mevlevi -- a sect of Sufism founded in the 13th century -- attracts both tourists and political debate. Through the practice of ""sema,"" or listening, in a prayer-induced trance, the Dervishes aim to act as a bridge between God and humankind. The Dervishes turn as one arm reaches to the sky ""taking from God"" and the other ""gives life to the earth,"" Loras says. ""We receive from God and we return that light and gift to humanity,"" he explains. Every Sunday, a different Mevlevi order visits Istanbul and worships at the Galata Mevlevihanesi, a Dervish ""Tekke"" or lodge. When CNN visits the lodge, it is the turn of the Mevlana Culture and Arts Foundation from Turkey's capital, Ankara. Two teenage Dervishes are conducting their debut sema ritual in public. The young semazens, aged 14 and 15, wear white felt hats rather than the traditional brown. For them, it's a coming of age moment, the beginning of a long life of spiritual modesty displayed through meditative dance. ""It takes about six months to learn how to whirl. There are some people that can't,"" the ""semazenbasi"" -- leader of the sema -- Sahin Naci Sair says. ""They really need to feel three things. Music, rhythm, and belief."" In 2005, UNESCO declared the sema ceremony a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. But in Turkey the Mevlevis still face restrictions. The sema ritual exists in spite of controversial laws banning Sufism altogether. The Mevlevis' religious association was used as justification to ban the order after the founding of the secular Turkish Republic. In 1925, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, prohibited all Sufi orders, under Law 677 of the constitution on maintaining order. In the 1950s, the government eased the ban, allowing the sema to be performed in public. But it is commonly assumed this move was to boost the tourism industry rather than a sign of religious tolerance and private worship by the order remains officially banned. The tourism industry is the main source of income for the Dervishes, with members of the public giving donations to watch them worship. Each December, there is a huge festival in Konya, where Celaladin Rumi founded the order in the 13th century. At the ""Seb-i-Arus,"" curious observers can watch Mevlevi associations performing the religious ceremony together. Tickets went on sale this month for the ceremony, which runs from December 7-17 every year. At the beginning of each sema ceremony, the disciples stand with their arms closed to their chest and feet pointed inward. Young and old Mevlevis do this out of respect and to signify humility, fighting their ego through a spiritual journey inside and outside of the Dervish lodge. Ilyas Noyan Ozatik, the head of the reed flute players accompanying the Ankara semazens in Istanbul, says the Mevlevis ""are on an inner journey of oneself to where God is."" Music is a unifying force he says, bringing ""our frequencies together leading to a completion of souls."" This passionate inner battle reflects their relationship with the outside world. When asked about the turmoil in the Middle East,  Lora points to an old British saying: ""if you want a clean street, every shop owner must clean the front of their own shop."" Mevlevis strive for universal peace, but believe that peace must begin in the hearts of individuals. As the Dervishes turn, mesmerized and apparently staring into blank space, their spirit takes control and leads them across the age-old prayer space. They glide effortlessly in circles, their white robes rising and falling, thinking all the while of their act as a bridge from God to earth.","The Order of the Mevlevi, a Sufi sect from the 13th century, are known as ""Whirling Dervishes""

"The drama is real for ""Real Housewives of Atlanta"" co-star Phaedra Parks, whose husband faces charges in a fraud scheme that a federal agent says stole millions of dollars. Apollo Nida, who appears on the reality TV series with Parks, was arrested last week following a year-long investigation by the U.S. Secret Service, according to the criminal complaint. Nida, who served five years in a federal prison for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009, allegedly set up several fake collection companies as part of the scheme, Special Agent Alexandre Herrera said in a sworn affidavit. But the only thing the collection companies collected was the personal information of people that Nida used to get fraudulent auto loans, according to the complaint. The break in the case came in September, when federal investigators arrested Gayla St. Julein, a woman who ""described herself as Nida's 'right hand b****' in executing the legwork of his fraud schemes,"" the complaint said. St. Julien, who previously served prison time for identity theft, told agents that Nida ""only paid her 'scraps'"" for her work, compared to the amount of money he made from the fraud schemes,"" the filing said. She turned on him and agreed to let agents record their phone calls, it said. Nida ""knowingly and willfully execute and attempt to execute a scheme to defraud federally insured financial institutions by depositing stolen and fraudulently obtained checks and fraudulently obtained auto loan proceeds into bank accounts opened in the stolen identities of real persons, and conspire with others to do so, and knowingly convert to his use and the use of others stolen and fraudulently obtained United States Treasury Checks,"" Agent Herrera said. Nida's fake companies fraudulently signed up with ""LexisNexis, Equifax, and Mircrobilt databases"" to steal personal information on people. Along with the fraudulent auto loan checks, Nida stole U.S. Treasury checks, ""retirement checks issued to Delta Airlines employees, and checks in the names of real people that were owed unclaimed property from various state and federal government agencies,"" the complaint said. Agents recorded phone calls St. Julien made to Nida during which he discussed details of pending fraudulent auto loans and ""details of future auto loan checks that he was expecting to receive any day now from in the mail,"" the affidavit said.","Apollo Nida appears on the reality TV series with wife Phaedra Parks .

"After his party's losses in the midterm elections, President Barack Obama will wade into a mass of foreign policy challenges during his trip to Asia this week. Obama made America's pivot to Asia a centerpiece of his foreign policy architecture. But some commentators say the President, beset by crises elsewhere, has failed to put words into action. ""The Asia pivot remains more rhetoric than reality,"" CNN's Fareed Zakaria said. ""Having promised a larger U.S. military presence in the Philippines, Singapore and Australia, there is little evidence of any of this on the ground."" Obama arrived Monday in Beijing, where the greater U.S. focus on Asia is viewed with deep suspicion. ""Two prevailing sentiments -- perceived U.S.-led containment of China and the threat posed to America by China's growing economic and military strength -- have set the two major powers on a confrontational course,"" said Cheng Li, a senior foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution. Obama is in Beijing for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings, but he will also hold direct meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where sensitive issues like cybersecurity will be on the agenda. ""To put this crucial bilateral relationship back on track, President Obama and President Xi must use the summit in Beijing to deepen mutual understanding and publicly challenge these misperceptions,"" Li said in comments published by Brookings. ""The United States welcomes the rise of a prosperous, peaceful and stable China,"" Obama said in a speech Monday at the APEC CEO Summit. He announced that the U.S. and China have agreed to extend the maximum length of tourist, business and student visas for each others' citizens. While in Beijing, Obama also spoke about North Korea's release of American detainees Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller over the weekend. He said the release did not involve high-level talks on any pressing issues between North Korea and the United States. ISIS fight in new phase, Obama says . Myanmar reforms 'sliding backwards' After China, Obama will travel to Myanmar, a country where, two years ago, he became the first sitting U.S. President to visit. There was much fanfare then about the introduction of political reforms after decades of oppressive military rule. The opening up of Myanmar, also known as Burma, became held up as a positive example of U.S. engagement in Asia. But concerns are now rife about the halting progress of those changes and the plight of the Muslim minority group, the Rohingya. ""Since the high point of Myanmar's reform process in 2012 and early 2013, the country's political opening has stalled and, in my opinion, slid backwards,"" wrote Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said Obama, who will be attending regional summits in the country, should pressure the Myanmar government to push ahead with political changes and rethink its ""racist"" plan for the Rohingya. But a senior U.S. official cautioned not to expect any major leaps forward any time soon. ""I don't think we're going to see breakthroughs in the short term,"" Tom Malinowski, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for human rights and labor, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last week. ""Burma was an opening to a breakthrough and it's one that we always knew would take years to move from its starting point to its finishing point."" Will Obama and Putin meet? The last country on Obama's itinerary is Australia, where the G-20 summit will take place in Brisbane. He plans to deliver ""a very significant policy address discussing U.S. leadership in the Asia Pacific,"" as well as holding a trilateral meeting with the Australian and Japanese prime ministers, Evan Medeiros, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council, said Friday. But much attention will be focused on how Obama will navigate the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has angered Western leaders with his aggressive actions in Ukraine. They already suspended Russia from the G8, the group of leading industrialized nations, earlier this year. But Putin will be in Brisbane for the G-20, and could even bump into Obama earlier in the week at the APEC meetings in Beijing. U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice didn't rule out the possibility of an encounter in Brisbane. ""I imagine, as in the past, that there will be an opportunity for the G-20 leaders to engage informally on the margins,"" she said at a news briefing Friday. ""There's no formal bilateral meeting scheduled or planned, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if they had some informal communication."" The two leaders had a brief conversation about the Ukraine crisis on the sidelines of the D-Day commemorations in France in June.","Obama: North Korea's release of Americans didn't involve major talks on pressing issues .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley confirmed Monday it is to become the second bank nationalized by the British government since the financial crisis began. In a deal hammered out with Spanish bank Santander, B&B was being taken into public ownership after uncertainty over its future prompted savers to withdraw ""tens of millions of pounds."" British Finance Minister Alistair Darling said B&B assets were sold to Santander's Abbey division for just over £600 million pounds, or about $1.1 billion. ""My priority was to protect savers and depositors, but also to ensure that we got a good deal for the taxpayer,"" Darling said. ""We had to stabilize the situation in order to protect the banking system as a whole."" B&B's mortgage assets will be held by the government for now, but sold in the future, Darling said, once the markets stabilize -- and hopefully at a profit. B&B said it would be ""business as usual"" for its customers. ""Whatever channel they use -- branch, telephone, internet or ATM - they will all be open and operating as normal,"" the statement said. B&B's nationalization follows a similar government rescue of Northern Rock, which faced collapse earlier this year after it suffered heavily from exposure to the so-called credit crunch caused by bad debts. The United States has seen a similar financial crisis. In just the past month, the U.S. federal government has seized control of troubled mortgage finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself to Bank of America. Other failures or consolidations of financial companies are considered likely, according to analysts. Copyright 2008 CNN.

The explosion Wednesday in the village of Nagaan killed 40 people and wounded 74 others, the interior ministry said. The Taliban said it was not responsible for the attack. The International Security Assistance Force confirmed the bombing but did not provide a casualty count. ""This ruthless violence brought to the Afghan people at what should have been a time for celebration demonstrates the Taliban's sickening and indiscriminate tactics to try to intimidate the citizens of Afghanistan,"" said Lt.

"From bombs to drugs, humans have long relied on dogs' astonishing sense of smell to sniff out danger. Now, our four-legged friends are also helping to combat poaching. Meet Lumi and Cooper, two energetic, highly driven and undeniable cute canines that are Gabon's latest recruits in the fight against the illegal wildlife trade. The determined trackers are specially trained to use their nose for odor to detect endangered wildlife and plant species, such as ivory, leopard skin, shark fin, iboga tree products and primate meat. Read this: Drone ranger spies on poachers . Hard-working and obsessed with their tennis ball, which is their reward after a find, the four-legged detectives regularly sweep a number of pinch points in Gabon's capital of Libreville and its surroundings. Accompanied by their trained handlers they search luggage at the international airport and do checks at the train station, they sniff containers at the city port and they are deployed at roadblocks, picking up scents inside vehicles. ""These dogs would work until they drop, they will do anything to get their tennis ball,"" says Ruth Starkey of the Wildlife Conservation Society, which provides technical support  to the Gabonese National Park Agency (ANPN). ""They are extremely energetic and very driven -- making quick work of previously arduous searches. It's the handlers that have to keep up and ensure the dogs' safety."" Read this: Could horn sale end rhino slaughter? World-class sniffers . Louise Wilson, director and head of training at Wagtail UK, the detection dogs company that provided ANPN with Lumi and Cooper, says the sniffer dogs' biggest advantage is their ability to search fast, efficiently and without bias. ""Say you have 300 bags for a human team to search, humans would have to open every single bag and look through every single box or wrapped up item in that bag,"" says Wilson. ""A dog doesn't need to do that; a dog can easily run over each bag and spend three seconds per bag sniffing it to be able to find the illegal item,""  she adds. In addition to speeding up the searches, Guy-Rostan Nteme, the ANPN coordinator for the sniffer dogs unit, says the canines are providing law enforcement agents with valuable information that helps improve park protection. ""During a search operation the dog performs the so-called 'light' (search),"" he says. ""Where it may have found something, agents proceed in more depth."" Rampant poaching . Gabon, a beautiful country on the West African coast, is a haven for a variety of wildlife and plant species. About 75% of the country is covered by a dense and pristine rainforest sheltering elephants, antelopes, gorillas and numerous tropical birds. Yet a recent surge in poaching, fueled by the growing demand for ivory products in Asia, has led to the decimation of many of the animals populating Gabon's national parks. More than 11,000 elephants have been slaughtered by poachers since 2004, according to a recent survey. Read this: Boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts . ""It's not as simple as a poacher killing an elephant, it's bigger than that,"" explains Starkey. ""It's increasingly becoming organized crime, and this makes the ivory trade similar to the drug trade so we need to use similar methodology to combat it,"" she adds. Lumi and Cooper . Faced with this shocking reality, conservations started exploring innovative ways to tackle the problem. In January 2012, the Gabonese authorities invited Wagtail UK to run a feasibility study and gauge whether dogs could improve the detection rate of prohibited products in the country. A few months later, the project was given the green light and Wagtail was handed the hard task of finding two dogs in the UK that would suit Gabon's environment. What followed was an intense eight-week training period. Wilson says it was crucial to find high-energy dogs that could cope with intense heat; the recruits also needed to be non-aggressive looking, since they'd be mainly working in public spaces, and also feel comfortable being around people that might not be used to handling dogs. ""We probably had to work with about 350 dogs, if not more,"" says Wilson. In the end, Lumi, a very enthusiastic, lemon-colored cocker spaniel, and Cooper, a calmer, intelligent, reddish small Labrador, were chosen. ""Cooper likes to work alongside a handler, whereas Lumi is a bit more independent,"" says Wilson. ""Lumi likes to push the handler into the area where he wants to search, rather the other way around,"" she adds. ""Their two characteristics are so different but as a team it works perfectly."" Encouraging results . The government-funded project became operational in late April, following a three-month training course for the dogs' handlers. So far, conservationists say, the results have been very encouraging. ""It's more successful than I imagined,"" says Starkey. ""We've not yet had a big find, for example, whole tusks hidden in shipping containers, but we're continually getting small quantities of worked ivory, dried shark fin and bushmeat,"" she adds. In addition to what the canines are finding, the existence of the sniffer dogs unit has motivated the other law enforcement agents to do their job even more rigorously, says Starkey. ""A friendly competition has been set up between the dog team and the customs team (about) who'll find the most ivory,"" says Starkey. ""It's a nice knock-on effect that was unexpected."" Looking ahead, officials say they plan to gradually build up the unit, deploying 16 dogs over the next five to 10 years. Until then, however, Lumi and Cooper will keep on sniffing to help save Gabon's elephants and other endangered species -- and get to play with their tennis ball.","Gabon has launched a dog unit to fight poaching .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- An Argentine court this week granted an injunction that blocks internet giant Google from ""suggesting"" searches that lead to certain sites that have been deemed anti-Semitic, and removes the sites from the search engine's index. The injunction, filed by DAIA, an umbrella organization of Argentina's Jewish community, also prohibits Google from advertising on the stated websites. The injunction names 76 sites that the organization considers ""highly discriminatory."" Google's suggested searches are a Google algorithm that offers search terms similar to the one the user appears to be typing in. ""The common denominator on these sites is the incitement of hate and the call to violence,"" DAIA said in a statement. ""In none of these cases are there discussions or criticisms from the academic, technological, political or philosophical perspectives."" Google representatives in the United States and Argentina did not immediately respond to calls for comment. Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America. The Jewish community there numbers more than 250,000, with the majority residing in the capital, Buenos Aires. The ruling notes that restrictions on freedom of speech and censorship is illegal under the Argentine constitution, but also notes that the constitution protects people from discrimination. As such, the judge cited previous cases in Argentina that establish that in some restricted cases, it is permissible to prevent the diffusion of certain publications if they infringe on someone's personal rights. Judge Carlos Molina Portela concluded that ""the terms mentioned (in the lawsuit) as well as the results obtained through 'suggested searches' could be described as discriminatory acts and/or at least, incitement and/or encouragement for discrimination."" According to DAIA, the suggested search complaint focused on 13 terms that led to websites that are anti-Semitic, some of which deny that the Holocaust took place. The group did not disclose the 13 terms in question, nor the names of the websites that were blocked. In a statement, the group said that by suggesting these websites, Google is ""inducing and directing traffic to sites with offensive and illegal content."" In Argentina, there have been previous cases in which individuals have sued to have certain websites removed from Google's index, citing invasion of privacy, said Robert Faris, research director for the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard. The court actions in Argentina appear to view Google more as a publisher of information than as an intermediary, he said. ""It seems to reflect a misunderstanding of how the internet works and how search engines work,"" he said. Cynthia Wong, director of the Global Internet Freedom Project at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, said the Argentine court's move was part of a ""problematic trend"" on the part of many governments. ""At the end of the day, enlisting companies to become greater gatekeepers on content online really does shrink the range of speech that we can access. ... It's dangerous to try to shut down speech, because you don't get that kind of robust public debate about what should or should not be acceptable in a democratic society,"" she said. While restrictions on the internet are usually associated with countries such as China or Iran, it is not uncommon for other nations to try to impose some limits on it. Thailand, for example, asked Google to remove YouTube videos that showed the Thai king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, with feet near his head. In Thai culture, it's considered extremely offensive for anyone's feet to be near someone's head.  A national law bans such representations, and Google agreed not to show such videos within Thailand, although they are still available elsewhere in the world. Germany bans neo-Nazi content, and Google has agreed to remove such sites from its Google.de search engine in that country. Turkey, meanwhile, blocks YouTube because the company refused to take down all potentially offensive videos about Ataturk, the Turkish political hero. ""It's a slippery slope. I don't think that the people of Argentina are harmed by the inability to see anti-Semitic content, but I think that the best answer is counter-speech,""said Ryan Calo, a researcher at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. He noted that Google, faced with anti-Semitic search results in the United States, responded by posting an ad with a link to a statement that includes a link to information from the Anti-Defamation League. ""If you recently used Google to search for the word 'Jew,' you may have seen results that were very disturbing. We assure you that the views expressed by the sites in your results are not in any way endorsed by Google,"" Google's policy statement says. It goes on to note that citizens and organizations have urged the company to remove links or adjust search results. ""Although Google reserves the right to address such requests individually, Google views the comprehensiveness of our search results as an extremely important priority,"" the statement says. ""Accordingly, we do not remove a page from our search results simply because its content is unpopular or because we receive complaints concerning it."" CNN's Mariano Castillo and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","NEW: Internet freedom advocates criticize the move, calling it a ""slippery slope""

"Apple has been accused of kowtowing to the Chinese government by pulling from its China App Store a product enabling users to circumvent firewalls and access restricted sites. OpenDoor, a free app that provides users a randomized IP address to keep their browsing habits anonymous and shielded from censors, was removed after the tech giant deemed it contained ""illegal content,"" the app's lead developer told CNN. It remains available in App Stores outside China. The developer -- who wished to remain anonymous, saying that ""as the developers of an app that protects users' privacy and anonymity online, it only makes sense to do the same ourselves"" -- said Apple provided no notification that the app had been pulled, with the developers only learning from consumers. When Apple responded to OpenDoor, they were told only that the app contained content that was illegal in China. Apple requires developers to comply with legal requirements in all locations in which the product is made available. The company did not respond to CNN's request for comment. OpenDoor, a self-described ""small team of programmers spread across the world collaborating over the Internet,"" considers it has reasonable grounds to challenge Apple's move, as its product is a browser app and any content accessed through it is at the discretion of the user. But the developer said there were no plans to try to force the tech giant into a rethink. ""Unfortunately, we're not aware of any app developer ever (successful) in challenging Apple's decision. In fact, we won't be surprised if Apple decides to pull our app from all app stores and/or terminates our account in retaliation (to publicity over the issue)."" The developer said that prior to its removal from Apple's China App Store on July 11, the app was being downloaded about 2,000 times a day in China, accounting for about a third of the app's total downloads. The Chinese government strictly polices Internet access, censoring web users and blocking access to sites deemed sensitive. Chinese social media users were critical of Apple's move, saying the decision diminished the company's moral standing, and comparing it unfavorably to Google as a champion of Internet freedom. ""The fruit is contaminated,"" wrote a user on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo microblog under the handle @XieGov. ""Where's your integrity!"" asked @Shenzhenlangya. ""The only one who doesn't surrender to evil is my great Google!"" wrote @Meihoujiushilaowang. A smaller group were more understanding of the company's position, however, acknowledging that conforming to China's censorship policy was the price to pay to do business in the country. ""Apple is determined to do well in China,"" wrote Sina Weibo user @Mantianyufeihong. ""How can Apple step in to the Chinese market without strict censorship? How can it do business without showing their sincerity (to the government)?""

"(CNN)Conflicting portraits have emerged of the police officer at the center of the controversy surrounding the death of Eric Garner in Staten Island during an attempted arrest in July. Defenders of Officer Daniel Pantaleo say he is an upstanding former Boy Scout with few complaints against him. Critics say he should have been indicted for his role in Garner's death and point to two lawsuits against him as signs that his record as an officer is tarnished. Police union officials describe him in glowing terms, saying he is no hothead. ""He's a model of what we want a police officer to be,"" said Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. ""He's a mature, mature police officer, motivated by serving the community. He literally is an Eagle Scout."" Pantaleo has had ""very few citizen complaints"" against him over the course of more than 300 arrests, according to union spokesman Albert O'Leary. But court records show he has been sued at least twice, both times on allegations of false arrest and unlawful imprisonment. One suit was brought by two men from Staten Island, Darren Collins and Tommy Rice, who alleged that Pantaleo arrested them in 2012 on baseless charges, and humiliated them in public. They claimed that on the street, during an arrest on drug suspicions, Pantaleo and another officer ""pulled down the plaintiffs' pants and underwear, and touched and searched their genital areas, or stood by while this was done in their presence."" Lawyers for the officers denied the charges, saying they acted reasonably and exercised their discretion. But they reached a settlement in the case, for $30,000, according to the plaintiffs' lawyers. The other suit, filed this year, has not yet been resolved. In that case, Rylawn Walker accuses Pantaleo and another police officer of approaching, accosting, falsely arresting and falsely imprisoning him on marijuana possession charges in February 2012. Walker says the charges were later dropped. The arrest, the lawsuit says, was ""part of a pattern of false arrests and civil rights violations against persons of color"" by police. According to the police union, Pantaleo comes from a family of public servants: his father is a retired New York City firefighter, and his uncle was an officer with the NYPD. He went to Monsignor Farrell High School in Staten Island, then got a bachelor's degree from the College of Staten Island. He joined the force in 2006, working his way up from a ""condition unit,"" where he enforced quality-of-life crimes, to assignments in narcotics enforcement and then in an anti-crime unit. He is now 29 and single, with no children. On Wednesday, a grand jury decided not to indict Pantaleo for his role in Garner's death -- a controversial decision that's sparked protests in New York and across the country. Garner died in July after Pantaleo put him in a chokehold. A medical examiner ruled the death of homicide. And after the chokehold, New York's police commissioner announced that officers would undergo a three-day retraining period on the proper use of force when engaging a suspect. ""I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner,"" Pantaleo said Wednesday in a statement. ""My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss."" But the widow of Eric Garner, Esaw Garner, said Wednesday night that Pantaleo should be held accountable for her husband's death.

And Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, told CNN's Erin Burnett Thursday night that Pantaleo ""has no regard for human life, if this is the way he treats suspects."" Pantaleo still faces an internal review by the NYPD, and a federal civil rights investigation, so it is unclear if he will be allowed to return to policing. In the recent high-profile incident in Ferguson Missouri, where teenager Michael Brown was killed during a contentious encounter with a policeman, the officer involved was not indicted but nevertheless resigned from the job, saying he could not be effective after the public controversy. But former New York City police commissioner Howard Safir says Pantaleo does not necessarily have to follow that precedent. Unlike Ferguson, which is a very small department, there are over 35,000 police officers in New York in a city of 8 million people,"" he said. ""I believe that if officer Pantaleo is found to be retained with the Department, he could continue in police work, yes.""

It will always be in the back of his mind.""","Defenders of Officer Daniel Pantaleo say he's an upstanding former Boy Scout .

"For the first time, the U.S. Senate approved legislation that would protect gay, lesbian and transgender employees from discrimination in the workplace. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act, or ENDA, passed the Democratic-led chamber on Thursday, 64 to 32. Ten Republicans joined 52 Democrats and two Independents in supporting the bill. Four Senators did not vote. Arizona Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake became the latest GOP members to support the measure. They joined Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rob Portman of Ohio, Susan Collins of Maine, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, and the bill's co-sponsor, Mark Kirk of Illinois. ""The workplace is simply no place for discrimination,"" Collins said before the vote. Opposition in the Republican-controlled House is strong, minimizing any chance the measure will become law. House Speaker John Boehner also opposes it. Still, President Barack Obama urged the House to take the bill up and said he would sign it. ""One party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do,"" the President said in a statement. ""Now is the time to end this kind of discrimination in the workplace, not enable it. I urge the House Republican leadership to bring this bill to the floor for a vote and send it to my desk so I can sign it into law."" The bill would provide the same protections for LGBT workers as are already guaranteed on the basis of race, gender and religion. It would not be lawful for employers to discriminate based on a person's ""actual or perceived"" sexual orientation or gender identity. Illinois legislature OKs same-sex marriage . ENDA's path began in earnest in 1994, the first time it was introduced in Congress. Two years later, a version that only protected sexual orientation - and not gender identity - nearly passed the Senate but failed by one vote. The issue was not brought up again for a vote until 2007 when the House passed the narrower version. In 2009, an ailing Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Massachusetts, wanted to make sure the issue didn't fall by the wayside. Just months before he died, Kennedy asked newly elected Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, to take the reins. Eventually, Merkley approached Kirk to help him get the measure passed. Sexual orientation and Employment Nondiscrimination Act: How we got here . Kirk voted for it while in the House and has been a co-sponsor. The two lawmakers lobbied colleagues, leading to Thursday's Senate vote. Merkley remembered Kennedy's passion for the legislation, quoting him before final Senate action: ""The promise of America will never be fulfilled as long as justice is denied to even one among us."" But the measure's path could end in the Senate this year as the Republican-led House appears unlikely to take it up. ""The Speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost American jobs, especially small business jobs,"" Boehner's spokesman, Michael Steel, said. Chad Griffin, president of the LGBT activist group Human Rights Campaign, had harsh words for Boehner. ""The Speaker, of all people, should certainly know what it's like to go to work every day afraid of being fired. Instead of letting the far right trample him again, it's time for Speaker Boehner to stand with the majority of everyday Republican voters and support ENDA,"" Griffin said earlier this week. Regardless proponents are applauding  Senate action. ""Equality means equality in the workplace, as much as anywhere else in our lives,"" said Lisa A. Linsky, trial partner and partner-in-charge of LGBT Diversity and Inclusion at international law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP. Opinion: It's 'way past time' for gay rights law . Opponents say ENDA will have ""a chilling effect on free speech as well as religious liberty"" by requiring secular businesses who have a moral objection to LGBT people to not discriminate against them. Efforts to expand the religious protection component of the bill to secular businesses failed. The Traditional Values Coalition says passage of ENDA would ""hurt kids."" ""Young students in some states are already being confused by transgender teachers,"" a fact sheet by the Traditional Values Coalition read. ""If ENDA passes, students and children in daycare centers all across the nation will be subjected to individuals experimenting with their gender identities."" Twenty-one states currently have laws protecting lesbian and gay workers from discrimination and 17 states protect transgender workers, according to the Human Rights Campaign.","Bill would protect gay, lesbian and transgender employees from workplace discrimination .

"Move over Japan. Move over Silicon Valley. Africans are making a bid to turn the continent into the new home of mobile gaming. With more than 700 million mobile broadband subscribers across the continent, it's little wonder a growing number of young entrepreneurs are jumping on the digital bandwagon and creating innovate, interactive content for their home market. One such man is Nigerian Hugo Obi. Earlier this year he launched Maliyo, a gaming firm aimed at creating culturally relevant content that reflects the lives of average Nigerians. ""Nigeria is the largest country in the continent,"" he said. ""It has the fastest growing internet users, fastest growing mobile users and the shared nature of the Nigerian people is how they love to consume. ""They are very keen on new trends and new content. So there is an immense opportunity and you can already see that with loads of other young tech start ups."" Obi took inspiration from the San Francisco-based company Zynga Games, which was founded in 2007. Its development of hugely popular games like Bubble Safari and Farmville introduced gaming to a new and even wider audience. It also gave Obi the determination to tap into the market of around 44 million Nigerian internet users, by offering them a local gaming experience. His firm now creates apps developed by Africans, for the African market, which can be played through websites like Facebook or on mobile devices. ""Okada Ride"" is just one of Maliyo's browser games that has a local narrative, in which the player weaves in and out of Nigeria's pot-holed roads, avoiding oncoming traffic. Play Maliyo Games ""Okada Ride"" Obi said: ""Okadas (motorbikes) are everywhere -- it's insane. Our game allows people to get a local interactive experience. They can drive around pot holes and tuk tuks. We brought in local sounds from busy streets. There is that connectivity."" Obi is not alone in his crusade to turn Africa into a mobile gaming continent. Anne Shongwe founded the digital company Afroes in 2009. ""When I started the company three years ago there was a global market for this, but there wasn't an African market,"" she said. ""The skill set was here, but companies didn't believe it was worth investing. For us we are prioritizing content for Africa."" Afroes now employs nine people in South Africa and Kenya. Its primary focus is educational gaming for teenagers and young adults who use smart phones and basic Nokia or Samsung handsets. ""Our focus is games for change,"" said Shongwe. ""We have developed a game called Moraba. It's part of a partnership with U.N. Women and its aim is to end violence against women. As you play the games you answer questions related to gender-based violence."" The games are available for free, with revenue generated through sponsorship and advertising. Obi also believes games can be educational. He said: ""Our focus is on the interactivity and the fun. But if we can offer another element then we think that could be a way for us to give back. ""In a game of multiple levels the challenge becomes more difficult. We're looking at educating people between levels. You can score extra points if  you answer questions (related to the game's genre) correctly."" Along with providing a fun, interactive and sometimes educational experience, Africa's burgeoning digital industry is also creating jobs. It is estimated that 70% of Africa's young people are jobless but a growing number are capitalizing on the digital market and are setting up their own companies. Obi and his team work alongside other firms at the Co-Creation Hub in Lagos. The hub acts as a business incubator and provides a base of operations for Maliyo and several other start ups. ""In the space you have lots of developers working on independent projects and we're able to leverage and share knowledge and share expertise and share contacts and share experiences,"" he said. ""We have a 12-hour power supply and 12-hour internet supply. We pay a flat rate over a 12-month period and that has significantly reduced our operation costs."" Kalaya Okereke agrees that networking is paramount to building a successful tech industry across the continent. She organizes workshops for the Youth Alliance for Leadership and Development in Africa, aimed at bringing entrepreneurs together. ""It's about creating a network, not only of youth, young students, young professionals, young entrepreneurs, but more experienced professionals,"" she said. ""The captains of industries, the dignitaries, people that have that inside knowledge they can share with them. ""We can't wait around for the government or older generations to do everything for us."" For Obi, waiting around is definitely not an option. He plans to develop his company quickly and release more titles soon. ""It is very, very challenging but the opportunities are immense. You have to continue to be motivated and that motivation has to come from inside,"" he said. ""You have to be persistent. You have to be hungry, you have a good vision and you have to share that with as many people as possible.""","African game developers making mobile games aimed at local market .

"With lingering questions about privacy, game trading and selling, and an ""always-on"" Kinect device, Microsoft has released new details about the new Xbox One console, hoping to address issues that have had some fans in an uproar. The details come a week before the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) next week in Los Angeles and, presumably, are meant to free up the company to focus on games and features, not consumer concerns, during its major showcase there. Among the new details: Up to 10 family members will be able to log in and play purchased Xbox One games from anywhere. The unique proposition addresses concerns from fans about being able to play where they want, and when they want, in an era when game companies worry about protecting digital rights. The games also will be playable by anyone who uses the console at the buyer's house. But what about used games? One blog post emphasizes there will be no fee for transferring or selling games back for cash and credit on Microsoft's part. However, the wording suggests that restrictions could come from game publishers themselves. ""Today, some gamers choose to sell their old disc-based games back for cash and credit. We designed Xbox One so game publishers can enable you to trade in your games at participating retailers,"" the post reads. ""Microsoft does not charge a platform fee to retailers, publishers, or consumers for enabling transfer of these games."" Microsoft uses the same ""game publisher can enable"" language when talking about trading or giving games to your friends. There are two requirements on trading from Microsoft: the recipient must be on your friends list for at least 30 days and each game can only be given away once. What will game publishers do with this new control over used games and trading? And how will retailers, who rely on game trades as part of their business, react? That remains to be seen. In releasing the new details, Microsoft seeks to take the spotlight off of itself and aim it at third-party publishers. At the end of the day, it's those publishers who have the most to lose if games on new consoles like the Xbox One, and Sony's upcoming PlayStation 4, don't have built-in protections that keep them from being resold or shared. But digital-rights management and other protections are unpopular with many gamers, who argue they should be able to do what they like with a game once they've paid for it. It's unclear how Microsoft's own Microsoft Games Studios will address those issues. Sony has been less open about how rights issues will be managed on its own new console. On the Xbox, offline gaming or use of a constant Internet connection has also been an issue for fans. According to another post, while the Xbox One is designed to work best with a constant broadband connection, it is not required. However, the console will need to be connected at least once every 24 hours, or once an hour if you're logged onto a friend's console to access your own game library. A separate blog post addressed the privacy concerns raised by an always-watching Kinect device, which is connected to the Xbox One. Gamers will be able to tailor how responsive the sensor will be and how much or little data gets transferred. The Kinect device can be paused if you don't want to use it. Also, while the Kinect can indeed read your heart rate, facial expressions and more, none of that data leaves the console without explicit permission. The post goes on to say that Microsoft is listening to fan feedback as they refine and develop new policies for the Xbox One. Microsoft's E3 presentation is scheduled for Monday at 12:30p.m. ET.","Ahead of E3, Microsoft answers questions about Xbox One rules .

"An associate of former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez  pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges stemming from the killing of 27-year-old semipro football player Odin Lloyd. Ernest Wallace is charged with being an accessory after the fact in Lloyd's slaying in an industrial park near Hernandez's Massachusetts home. Wallace was ordered held on $500,000 bail, according to Bristol County District Attorney Sam Sutter's Twitter feed. A full bail hearing is scheduled for September 26, ""after the defense has had an opportunity to review the transcripts of the grand jury proceedings,"" Wallace's attorney, David Meier, told CNN. Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated Lloyd's June 17 execution-style shooting. He has been charged with first-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty. Authorities have said that Hernandez, Wallace, and a third man, Carlos Ortiz, picked Lloyd up from his Boston apartment in a rental car shortly before his death. Surveillance cameras then captured the rental car leaving the crime scene and Hernandez carrying a gun as he returned to his home minutes later. He was with two other people. Lloyd was not among them.","Ernest Wallace pleads not guilty to charge linked to slaying of Odin Lloyd in June .

"(CNN) -- Touch technology has come a long way in the last decade. Just six years ago, most phones used traditional keypads; today, almost all smartphones have a touchscreen, and the technology has spread to tablets, handheld consoles and laptops as well. One thing still lacking in touchscreens, though, is any kind of sensory feedback; you cannot feel the keypad on your iPhone, nor the action buttons when you play a game on your Android tablet. You can't feel the icons on your home screen, or the texture of your photos. Over the next decade all this looks set to change with the emergence of new tactile or ""haptic"" devices. One new technology announced this month by the research wing of the Walt Disney Company allows users to feel textures on a touchscreen, pointing to a future where you will be able to use your phone not only to see and hear, but also to feel. Ivan Poupyrev, the Principle Research Scientist at Disney's Interaction Group, told CNN that in his view the future will see ""touch screens on mobile devices, tablets, laptops, tables and walls. Everything will be touch-sensitive in the future and we need tactile feedback to make it more useful and usable."" As well as making screens you can feel, Disney Research is also developing tactile equipment that doesn't require any actual contact at all -- like an Xbox Kinect, but where you feel as though you can touch objects in front of you in thin air. The device is called the ""Aireal"" and in its developers' words it provides ""interactive tactile experiences in free air."" The Aireal works by blowing small rings of air at a user to simulate touch, movement or collisions with objects. Students at the University of Bristol in England are working on a similar project called UltraHaptics, which gives the same sense of mid-air feeling through ultrasound vibrations rather than pulses of air. According to its inventors, UltraHaptics deploys ""ultrasonic transducers"" to produce a variety of different sensations on the skin -- basically using sound waves to simulate touch. Poupyrev says UltraHaptics is an interesting idea that, in his view, points to the future of touch devices: ""I love this work -- (it is) very well done. In general creating tactile feedback in free air is a very important research direction."" Other products under development use tactile feedback in completely different ways. A new sound device called the Woojer aims to immerse users in sound by using low frequency vibrations to create the physical sensation of bass -- rather like being in a loud cinema or standing in front of a speaker at a rock concert. The Tactus takes a different approach to bringing feeling to a touchscreen by creating real, physical buttons that emerge from the screen to emulate a physical keyboard. Another new invention, the Tacit, aims to provide physical feedback to help visually impaired people navigate by ""feeling"" the objects around them. The device attaches to the wrist and uses ultrasound to scan the immediate area, delivering soft pressure to the user's wrist as they get close to objects. If these inventions go into production, then Poupyrev's projected future of tactile devices begins to look so close ... you could almost touch it.

"The West Africa Ebola outbreak is ""a growing threat to regional and global security,"" U.S. President Barack Obama said Thursday, telling a high-level meeting on the deadly epidemic at the U.N. General Assembly that only an international response can prevent ""a humanitarian catastrophe across the region."" ""If ever there were a public health emergency deserving of an urgent, strong and coordinated international response, this is it,"" the President said. Obama has declared the epidemic -- which is centered in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- a national security priority amid fears it could spread farther afield and claim many more lives. ""This is more than a health crisis,"" he said. ""This is a growing threat to regional and global security. In Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, public health systems are near collapse.  Economic growth is slowing dramatically. If this epidemic is not stopped, this disease could cause a humanitarian catastrophe across the region."" The President singled out Sierra Leone, where on Wednesday the government declared a success a three-day nationwide lockdown put in place to help stop the spread of Ebola, saying it had revealed more cases hidden in the community. Under the plan, no one was allowed to leave their homes for three days, from September 19 to 21, allowing volunteers to go door-to-door to educate people about the deadly virus. ""The courageous men and women fighting on the front lines of this disease have told us what they need: more beds, more supplies and more health workers, as fast as possible,"" Obama said. ""Right now, patients are being left to die in the streets. ... One health worker in Sierra Leone compared fighting this outbreak to 'fighting a forest fire with spray bottles.' "" Obama called the outbreak an ""urgent threat to the people of West Africa but also a potential threat to the world."" A rapid global response to the crisis ""could be the difference between tens of thousands of people dying and perhaps a million people dying,"" he said. The President also highlighted United States' efforts to help, including establishing a military command in Liberia to support civilian efforts. But he urged international organizations and businesses to move faster to mobilize partners on the ground, and nations to contribute everything from air transport to health care workers to equipment. ""We are not moving fast enough; we are not doing enough,"" Obama said. ""Right now, everybody has the best of intentions, but people are not putting in the kinds of resources that are necessary to put a stop to this epidemic."" The head of a medical organization at the forefront of fighting the Ebola crisis also appealed to world leaders at the meeting to take immediate action or risk losing the fight to contain the epidemic. ""Generous pledges of aid and unprecedented U.N. resolutions are very welcome. But they will mean little, unless they are translated into immediate action,"" Dr. Joanne Liu, international president of Médecins Sans Frontières, or Doctors Without Borders, said, according to an advance transcript of her speech. ""The reality on the ground today is this: The promised surge has not yet delivered. ""The sick are desperate, their families and caregivers are angry, and aid workers are exhausted. Maintaining quality of care is an extreme challenge."" Liu said fear and panic have set in as infection rates double every three weeks in the worst-affected nations, while growing numbers are dying of other diseases like malaria because health care systems have collapsed. ""Without you, we fall further behind the epidemic's deadly trajectory. Today, Ebola is winning,"" she said. Sierra Leone: Lockdown worked . In Sierra Leone, more than 75% of the targeted 1.5 million households were contacted, according to the Health Ministry. The strategy provided authorities with a ""candid assessment of the situation, household by household,"" said a statement from President Ernest Bai Koroma's office. ""The true picture portrays a situation that is worse than what was being reflected in reports and reveals that there are more infected persons in the community,"" it said. INTERACTIVE: Life inside the Ebola outbreak . Hot spots isolated . Three districts have been identified as emerging hot spots, the government said: Port Loko, Bombali and Moyamba. Given the ""desperate need to step up the response,"" these will be isolated immediately, it said. ""The prognosis is that without additional interventions or changes in community behavior, the numbers will increase exponentially and the situation will rapidly deteriorate."" The country's Kenema and Kailahun districts, which have been epicenters for Ebola in Sierra Leone, remain isolated. Can the world stop Ebola? Deaths rising . The total number of probable, confirmed and suspected cases of Ebola was 6,263, with 2,917 deaths, as of September 21, the World Health Organization said in its latest update released Wednesday. Sierra Leone accounts for 1,940 of those cases and 597 deaths. However, cases and deaths uncovered during the three-day lockdown have not yet been included in the official figures, the WHO said. The other countries at the center of the outbreak are Guinea and Liberia, with a small number of cases reported in Nigeria and one in Senegal. The number of Ebola cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone could rise to between 550,000 and 1.4 million by January if there are no ""additional interventions or changes in community behavior,"" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a report Tuesday. The range of estimated cases is wide because experts suspect the current count is highly under-reported. The estimate was derived from a new forecasting tool developed by the CDC. But the CDC estimates that if 70% of people with Ebola are properly cared for in medical facilities, the epidemic could decrease and eventually end. The virus is spread through contact with bodily fluids, and early symptoms include a sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat.","Obama calls West Africa Ebola outbreak ""a growing threat to regional and global security""

"More American women have had medical help to have their babies than ever, according to the latest annual report from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology. The group represents the greater majority of in vitro fertilization clinics in the United States. Their report showed that doctors at these clinics performed 165,172 procedures, including IVF, with 61,740 babies born as a result of those efforts in 2012. That's about 2,000 more babies born using treatments from IVF clinics than in 2011. That also makes 2012 the year with the highest percentage of babies born through IVF than ever reported previously, according to the society. That upward trend is the opposite of American birth rates overall. Since 2007, the American birth rate has been declining steadily. In 2012, more than 3.95 million babies were born, the Centers for Disease Control reports (PDF). That's below what demographers call the ""replacement level,"" the level at which the generation can replace itself. Of those births, IVF treatments account for about 1.5% of all babies born in the United States that year. This growing trend doesn't necessarily mean Americans are having more trouble having children. It may point to the fact that couples are having babies later. American women are having babies a lot later in life than they used to: In 1980, the average age of a new mom was about 22. Now, the average age of a new mom is closer to 26, according to the CDC (PDF). Although women today are generally healthier, fertility does decline as people age.  A woman's body produces fewer viable eggs when she gets older, and men's sperm doesn't swim as well as they age. Women can't wait too long to seek out treatment, though. That is also clear from the annual report. The IVF success rate was significantly higher for women under the age of 35 compared with those who were older. Looking only at the IVF treatments that used fresh embryos from non-donor eggs, the number of women under the age of 35 who gave birth using IVF was about 40%, compared with only 31% for women between the ages of 35 and 37. Only 3.9% of 42-year-olds got pregnant as a result of IVF treatment. IVF treatment has become more medically successful over the years and is gaining acceptance. It is still, however, cost-prohibitive for a lot of couples. Most assisted reproductive technologies are not covered by insurance, or the reimbursements are capped, according the National Infertility Association. The average cost of one IVF treatment in the United States is $12,400, and that's without the extra medicines the couple may need, according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Often, couples will need more than one treatment to conceive. The number of multiple embryos being transferred in IVF treatments has also declined, according to the report. Doctors prefer that women give birth to a single baby or ""singleton,"" as they are called in medical lingo. That's because even with medical advances, multiple births are still considered risky for mothers and babies. The real reason behind the multiples baby boom .","About 2,000 more in vitro fertilization babies were born in 2012 than 2011 .

"It was around 2:30 a.m. on June 17 when Odin Lloyd climbed into a silver Nissan Altima. He had company. Hours later, Lloyd was dead, shot with a .45-caliber firearm and later found lying in a gravel pit in the southeastern Massachusetts town of North Attleborough. As of Friday afternoon, the three others who had been in the car with Lloyd were in custody, authorities said. ""We believe we have the three individuals ... and we're very pleased about that,"" Bristol County, Massachusetts, District Attorney Sam Sutter said. Foremost among the suspects is Aaron Hernandez. He'd been a star tight end with the New England Patriots, at least until the team released him shortly after his arrest Wednesday. The Bristol, Connecticut, native pleaded not guilty this week to a premeditated murder charge, among others. ""It is a circumstantial case. It is not a strong case,"" his attorney, Michael Fee, said this week in court. The cloud over Hernandez doesn't end there. A law enforcement source told CNN that Boston police are ""very active"" -- and making progress -- in trying to connect the dots that could link Hernandez to an unsolved drive-by shooting that left two people dead last summer in Boston's South End. In a related development, a silver sport utility vehicle owned by Hernandez that police believe is linked to that double homicide was impounded in Bristol, a law enforcement source told CNN. The Boston Globe reports that the unsolved shooting deaths of two men might have played a role in the motive for Lloyd's death. The newspaper quoted two law enforcement officials as saying Lloyd may have had information linking Hernandez to the shooting. ""The motive might have been that the victim knew (Hernandez) might have been involved,"" the paper said, quoting one of the officials, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the investigation. For now, prosecutors contend that something Lloyd may have done or said didn't sit well with the NFL standout. Two days later, they allege, Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the hit, to settle the score. On Wednesday, the same day authorities showed up at Hernandez's door and took him away in a police car, 27-year-old Carlos Ortiz was similarly arrested in Bristol and charged as a fugitive from justice. Ortiz was in a Massachusetts court Friday. According to his attorney, John Connors, Ortiz pleaded not guilty to a single charge of carrying a firearm without a license. The charge was related to an incident that allegedly took place in Massachusetts, though it was not immediately known if it had any connection with Lloyd's killing or the double homicide in 2012. He'll remain behind bars until a July 9 hearing at which time Connors said he plans to press a judge to set bail. ""Mr. Ortiz struck me as being a gentle person who is confused as to how he is in this situation,"" Connors said following his first, brief meeting with his client Friday afternoon. ""... We're going to try and prove he's not guilty."" Meanwhile, Ernest Wallace turned himself in Friday in Miramar, Florida, nearly 1,500 miles away. Police there said Wallace had seen news reports of an arrest warrant being issued for him out of North Attleborough. Wallace appeared before a judge in Broward County, Florida, on Saturday, and is charged with accessory after the fact of murder. Lloyd's last few hours . Prosecutors have alleged Lloyd's killing had something to do with a run-in between him and Hernandez over the weekend. The two met up at the popular Boston dance club, Rumor, according to Lloyd's sister, Olivia Thibou. Who was Odin Lloyd? Then, in the predawn hours of June 17, Hernandez swung by in the rented Altima to pick up Lloyd -- a semipro football player who also worked as a landscaper and was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee -- at the latter's Boston home, prosecutors say. They stopped at a gas station and bought things inside. One purchase may be a potentially key piece of evidence: a pack of blue bubblegum. Prosecutors said that cell phone towers nearby tracked the men's movements. Lloyd had his phone on and texted his sister at 3:23 a.m., likely minutes before his death. ""NFL. Just so you know,"" he texted his sister to let her know who he was with. About 3:25 a.m. -- two minutes after the message -- gunshots shattered the quiet night, according to witnesses. Guns and bubblegum . Not five minutes passed before a surveillance camera captured video of Hernandez carrying a gun as he arrived back at his home, prosecutors said. Police return to Hernandez's home . He was with two other people. Lloyd was not among them. A murder weapon is usually a key piece of evidence in a homicide case, and investigators have not been able to find one. Hernandez at least once had a Glock .45, prosecutors said, entering a cell phone photo into evidence of him posing in the mirror with it. And police have seized .45-caliber ammunition and an ammunition magazine that were in a Hummer SUV he drove and a condo he rented. Hernandez and the other two later took the car back to the rental company. There, the defendant offered an attendant a piece of blue Bubblicious gum, prosecutors said. What appeared to be a piece of chewed blue gum was left lying inside the vehicle, prosecutors said. Next to it was a spent .45-caliber casing. The casing matches the empty shells Investigators recovered near Lloyd's body, prosecutors said. If that gum was in Hernandez's mouth, DNA tests will connect him to the casings, prosecutors said. When investigators inspected Lloyd's body, they found keys in his pockets to a rental car registered in Hernandez's name. Opinion: NFL doesn't have answers on Hernandez . A fallen star . Hernandez had been expected to be one of the keys to the New England Patriots' stellar offense, a vital cog on a team that many expected could contend for a Super Bowl title. Now he's sitting in a Massachusetts jail cell. His stoic expression in videos after his arrest, including when he was in court, gave little indication of angst, sorrow or inner turmoil.

"President Barack Obama on Monday cast this weekend's historic deal with Iran as part of a larger foreign policy agenda he said affirmed his 2008 campaign promises. Citing his vows to end wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and to unfreeze U.S.-Iran relations, Obama said he has ""done what I said."" He also said the ongoing diplomatic effort to turn Syria's chemical weapons over to international control illustrated positions that put greater weight on diplomacy than on force alone. ""We cannot close the door on diplomacy,"" Obama said at the start of remarks dedicated to pushing immigration reform. ""We cannot commit ourselves to an endless cycle of conflict."" Obama was speaking in San Francisco where he was on a political fund-raising swing.

"The birth parents of ""Maria"" stumble out of a studio in the Bulgarian capital, minutes after their first major TV interview. Surrounded by bright lights and state-of-the art technology, Saska Ruseva and her husband Atanas Rusev are a world away from the tumbledown Roma village where they live in central Bulgaria. Back in Nikolaevo, there are no street lights. Their house is made of mud brick and straw. The couple were a world away too from Maria, the blond toddler found during a police raid of a Roma camp in Greece. DNA tests last week showed the Resevs were her biological parents. ""She's my child. I'm her mother. I love her. I gave birth to her. I would tell Maria that I'm your mother. This is your father,"" she told CNN.  ""I will take care of her. She's mine. You can't change that fact."" The Rusevs are being investigated by Bulgarian police on suspicion they sold Maria for illegal adoption. A Greek Roma couple -- Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulo -- who were found looking after the girl are in custody charged with kidnapping. Both couples deny any wrongdoing. Ruseva is adamant she left Maria in Greece because she was too poor to feed her but did not sell her or receive any payment. ""People say I received 400 leva (about $310 dollars) but how could I receive money? They keep saying that on TV. Do you think I would sell my child for 400 leva?"" she told CNN.  ""I'd like to build a house. I don't have a proper house or a proper bed. Nothing. I didn't receive anything. I'm so poor."" Speaking to Ruseva through a Bulgarian interpreter can be a bit complicated.  Ruseva like most of her Roma neighbors from Nikolaevo only speaks a smattering of Bulgarian. Her native language is a Turkish dialect mixed with some Roma and Bulgarian words. But bit by bit she explained the series of events that ended with Maria being abandoned with a stranger in Greece. Ruseva said she and her husband left for Greece in 2009 to look for farm work. She says she left her eldest daughter Katia, now 20-years-old, to care for the family while they were away. Ruseva says she was so thin she did not realize she was even pregnant with Maria. ""I didn't know I was pregnant. I didn't even have a belly,"" she said. Maria -- whom Ruseva originally named Stanka -- was born in a hospital in the Greek town of Lamia, about 70 kilometers from Farsala and the Roma camp where she was discovered earlier this month. Ruseva says she spent three or four days in the hospital. She believes that's where her troubles started. ""The doctors in the hospital didn't give me any papers. If they had given me documents I could have taken her to Bulgaria,"" Ruseva explained. ""I didn't know the language. The doctors said something like 'go away' and I grabbed the baby and got out,"" she said. Ruseva said she took care of her baby for the next seven months, breast-feeding her while her husband picked odd jobs harvesting fruit and vegetables. Times were so hard that the couple said they spent many nights sleeping on the streets of Lamia or bedding down in nearby olive groves, with the newborn. Seven months after Maria was born, the Rusevs were hired to pick oranges for a few days at a farm near the Greek town of Patra. There Sashka Ruseva met a woman who realized she was desperately poor and unable to care for Maria. ""A woman came to me and said she was Bulgarian not Greek. She told me if I wanted she would take care of my baby and that I could come back and collect her later,"" Ruseva said. ""She gave me her phone number and when we got back in Bulgaria we telephoned her. We tried to call but the phone was switched off,"" she added. So far during the investigation, police forces on both sides of the border had suggested Ruseva met personally with the Greek Roma couple -- found caring for her earlier this month -- and passed off the baby directly. Defense lawyers for Greek couple Salis and Dimoupolou say their clients met Ruseva face-to-face.  But when asked about the Greek Romas, Ruseva gave a blank stare. ""Who is this man Christos Salis? I have never met these people,"" she said. Although she denies meeting Salis or Dimoupolou, Ruseva cannot remember many details about the woman to whom she passed off Maria. ""I have no clue what her name was. I did not ask and she did not say. That woman said leave your girl here and I'll take care of like I was her mother. I trusted her,"" Ruseva said. ""The woman looked good. Her skin was not too pale, a bit like us. She was blond. With dyed blond hair,"" she said. Despite the gaps in her story, Ruseva says she clearly remembers the moment she said goodbye to Maria. ""I kissed her. I was crying. I was worried. My heart was breaking,"" she said.","CNN's Karl Penhaul interviews birth parents of ""Maria""

"(CNN) -- In January, Bashar al-Assad sat down for a long interview with the Wall Street Journal. That was noteworthy in itself; the Syrian leader doesn't spend much time with the Western media. He was in confident mood -- saying that Syria would not succumb to the unrest then spreading in Tunisia and Egypt. That same month Vogue ran an effusive feature on Syria's first lady, Asma al-Assad, describing her as a ""rose in the desert."" But in his interview, al-Assad also recognized ""anger and desperation"" in the region and the need for reform in Syria, to ""open up the society,"" as he put it. Change was needed, he said, but ""if you do it just because of what happened in Tunisia and Egypt, then it is going to be a reaction, not an action; and as long as what you are doing is a reaction you are going to fail."" Now, after 10 days of deadly protests in Syria, that ""reaction"" is well and truly under way. The government has responded with a mixture of aggression and appeasement. It has announced a substantial rise in wages for public employees, and has proposed ending the decades-long state of emergency and opening up Syria's cramped political space to other parties. The current Syrian constitution enshrines the leadership of the Baath Party, which both al-Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad, who died in 2000, have led. At the same time, security forces have swamped Daraa and other towns in the south; witnesses speak of a mysterious group of men dressed in black patrolling the streets of Latakia. Amnesty International reports widespread arrests of political activists. But the protests have continued, and one Facebook page following the unrest -- SyrianRevolution -- now has nearly 100,000 followers. The regime's carrot-and-stick approach may work in the short term but the widely respected International Crisis Group says President Assad has two starkly different options. ""One involves an immediate and inevitably risky political initiative that might convince the Syrian people that the regime is willing to undertake dramatic change. The other entails escalating repression, which has every chance of leading to a bloody and ignominious end. "" While it has tinkered with reform over the past 10 years, al-Assad's government is hamstrung by internal disagreement, endemic corruption and competing goals at home and in the region. That at least is the picture that emerges from analyzing the U.S. diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks. The cables acknowledge that al-Assad has allowed greater media freedom since he became president 11 years ago ""with Al Jazeera, the local favorite, and al-Arabiya readily available via satellite."" Local journalists spoke of shifting red lines, adding wryly that ""it was much simpler under Hafez al-Assad; we always knew where the red lines were."" Caution has been the watchword in other spheres, including a tentative ""reset"" of Syria's frosty relationship with the United States since President Barack Obama took office and a gradual reassertion of Syria's role in Lebanon. The younger al-Assad has blamed a rough neighborhood for slow progress at home. ""We are not the only captain,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. ""We were affected by the situation in Iraq or in Lebanon. There are many things that we wanted to do in 2005 we are planning to do in 2012."" The cables shed light on how Syria has been run -- with powerful and often competing cliques dominating economic and political life, and intrigue trumping open debate. Part of the diplomatic traffic is devoted to the power of ""regime financiers"" like telecom magnate Rami Makhluf, al-Assad's cousin. A U.S. contact is quoted in a cable as saying ""most Syrians viewed Rami in a negative light and his strong-arm business tactics had earned him many enemies."" The same cable says corruption ""was rife in Syrian government and society and had undermined the president's credibility with the Syrian people."" There is also evidence of serious rifts within the security apparatus, with one cable from 2008 reporting that ""Syrian Military Intelligence and General Intelligence Directorate officials are currently engaged in an internecine struggle to blame each other for the breach of security"" that occurred in Damascus when Hezbollah's military commander, Imad Mughniyah, was killed by a car bomb. Several months later, a top adviser to al-Assad -- Gen. Mohammed Suleiman -- was shot dead at his vacation home on the Syrian coast. His killers have never been identified, although the Syrians blame Israel. Syria's long-term alliance with Iran and its sponsorship of the Hezbollah militia in neighboring Lebanon are also sensitive issues at home. Some reports from Daraa say protesters have raised their voices against both. Syrian officials quoted in U.S. cables say Hezbollah is a legitimate resistance movement and part of the overall Middle East peace process. In other words -- Syria's (and Iran's) insurance card against Israel. In 2009, the top U.S. diplomat in Damascus sharply criticized Syria's alleged delivery of ballistic missiles to Hezbollah. ""Syria's actions have created a situation in which miscalculation or provocative behavior by Hezbollah could prove disastrous for Syria and the broader region,"" he wrote. Other cables suggest constant juggling by al-Assad as he tries to keep the alliance with Iran intact while not closing the door to negotiations with Israel. Fawaz Gerges at the London School of Economics says Syria is a critical regional player. ""Instability in Syria means there will be instability in Lebanon, which is a divided country along sectarian lines."" Iran, too, would be affected were Assad to go, he said: ""Syria is a critical player that supports a non-Arab state. The West has tried to wean Syria off Iran but has failed."" Barak Seener, a research fellow with the Royal United Services Institute in London, agrees that events in Syria could alter the Middle East landscape. ""A liberal democratic Syria would be more susceptible to peace with Israel, irrespective of the status of the Golan Heights,"" he said. ""In light of the opposition that removed Mubarak, it is questionable whether peace can be made with autocratic leaders that can be removed and not with liberal societies."" Seener says the violence so far does not threaten the regime's existence but ""will embolden the majority-Sunni population and Kurdish minority, who deeply resent the political dominance of the Alawi minority, to protest."" Al-Assad is an Alawite. But so far, none of Syria's major cities has seen the sort of unrest witnessed in Daraa. Some Syria-watchers say al-Assad may even turn the crisis to his advantage by pushing through reform despite the hardliners and bureaucratic inertia. He may also benefit from a fractured opposition. Syrian analyst Murhaf Jouejati at George Washington University says that civil society has been stifled by decades of emergency rule. ""The protesters are not organized. The opposition is fragmented,"" he said. ""Civil society is not developed enough to be a counterweight to the state"" even if intellectuals leading the opposition enjoy a certain amount of moral authority. Other analysts say the sudden announcement of extensive concessions smacks of panic, and that endemic corruption and high unemployment are beyond the government's capacity to fix. In addition, as the International Crisis Group notes, ""as a result of events elsewhere in the region, a new awareness and audacity have materialized over the past several weeks in myriad forms of rebelliousness."" Fear, if not gone, is no longer so pervasive. The International Crisis Group says much hinges on al-Assad, who is due to address the nation in the next couple of days. ""He alone can prove that change is possible and already in the making, restore some sense of clarity and direction to a bewildered power apparatus and put forward a detailed framework for structural change,"" it says. As al-Assad also told the Wall Street Journal in January: ""This is the Middle East, where every week you have something new.""","Despite concern, al-Assad forced to react to opposition .

"Former President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the post-presidential polls. First, the opening of his presidential library produced a spate of positive coverage about his time in office. Now, Gallup has released a survey showing that for the first time since 2005, more people approve than disapprove of Bush. This kind of shift in public opinion is likely to continue, with more upswings as well as downturns ahead. This is the nature of presidential legacies. They are a bit like what Mark Twain once said about the weather in New England: if you don't like it, just wait a second and it will change. Presidential reputations are never fixed in stone. With the exception of a few of our leaders, such as Abraham Lincoln of Franklin Roosevelt, people tend to remember presidents in different ways at different times. Even some of the more unpopular presidents have seen their support rise in the post-presidency period. Why is it the case? The most obvious reason is that the passions for presidents -- both good and bad -- tend to go down after they leave office. Americans turn their attention to the new boss and to new issues, and the focus of their sentiment shifts elsewhere. This is particularly true in our heated political times when voters become so polarized on their feelings about a leader -- feelings that can become most intense as we approach the elections. Another factor has to do with what the successor does in office. Much of the controversy that surrounded Bush had to do with his national security policies. The war in Iraq caused a huge controversy with many Americans feeling the president had gone into an unnecessary war based on false evidence. By the second term, many Americans were also upset with some of the tactics the administration had used to pursue terrorists, such as interrogation. But President Barack Obama, who campaigned as a critic of these policies, ended up leaving many of the programs in place and actually becoming more aggressive on certain fronts, such as the use of drone strikes. Obama has given these controversial policies a certain bipartisan imprimatur that has dulled the anger that existed toward Bush. The ways in which a president's policies unfold over time is also essential. In some ways, Obama did Bush a favor. By bringing Iraq and Afghanistan to an end, he took these issues off the public radar. Without any kind of mass chaos in those countries, as some critics had warned would occur, the issues that caused Bush so much problems faded from the public mind. The flip side is that some policies look better in perspective. Although the TARP program still has many critics, the fact that it stabilized the financial markets and ended up not costing the federal government any money makes one of Bush's most controversial decisions look better in hindsight. Presidential reputations also can be shaped, in the relative short term, by what a president does after leaving office. For example, former President Jimmy Carter has been successful in rehabilitating his image through his extensive post-presidential activities on foreign policy. Former President Bill Clinton has enjoyed strong approval for his work with his international foundation and, among Democrats, through his decision to engage in partisan wars after his time was done. Bush might have helped himself by staying outside of the media spotlight. There is a certain amount of good will that emerges as the structural problems with politics become clear. When a president is in office, they tend to receive all the blame, or credit, for what happens in Washington. When there are problems moving forward a policy, such as in reviving the economy, the public tends to blame the president. But when those problems continue long after a president is gone, as has been the case with the economy, the public tends to gain some perspective (even as they attack the existing president) about how the sources of discontent stem from the structural problems with the government and the economy rather than any individual person. We judge a president based on the political times we are living in -- not simply in the times that they governed. Presidential reputations could improve if the polls are tallied at a moment when a president resonates with the politics of the moment. Finally, and this is not relevant to Bush yet, the opening of archival records from the period a president is in office can dramatically change how we see him. President Dwight Eisenhower, who was once treated as a popular yet bumbling president, was found to have had a firm grip on decision-making in the White House. Discoveries from the Ronald Reagan archives in Simi Valley, California, revealed that he was much more than a former Hollywood actor who moved to the top through charisma and luck. Obama might want to take a close look at these kinds of swings. On the one hand, it might give him some solace that even with all the grief he has faced over issues such as health care and sluggish economic growth, it is easy to see how his record could look much stronger to Americans over time. On the other hand, he might want to be a bit cautious about taking too much comfort from positive approval ratings. After all, it's all relative with respect to time.","Julian Zelizer: President George W. Bush is enjoying another bounce in the polls .

"It was a disappointing week for the women of the Supreme Court. All three -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor -- were on the losing side of rulings involving women's reproductive health. First came the Hobby Lobby decision, in which the high court decided 5-4 that the government cannot force certain for-profit companies to offer contraception coverage under Obamacare. Supreme Court rules against Obama in contraception case . Then another decision emerged late on Thursday in which a Chicago-area evangelical college won a temporary victory over the requirement in the 2010 health care law that religious non-profits provide contraception insurance to their workers. Wheaton College objected to potential fines if it refused to provide coverage or sign a release form, arguing that doing so would be morally wrong. The Supreme Court said the college didn't have to do either for now. Strident dissent . Coming after the Hobby Lobby decision, narrowly defined to the specifics of cases involving two businesses run by families with strong Christian beliefs, the Wheaton ruling rankled the three liberal women justices. Their unusually forceful dissent written by Sotomayor said the Wheaton injunction threatened the credibility of the Hobby Lobby decision. ""Those who are bound by our decisions usually believe they can take us at our word,"" Sotomayor wrote. ""Not so today."" The point of the dissent? ""It is not the business of this court to ensnare itself in the government's ministerial handling of its affairs in the manner it does here,"" Sotomayor wrote. Hobby Lobby ruling much more than abortion . While the Wheaton College ruling only gives the school a pass until the matter is decided by lower courts, it represents an important victory for those objecting to the contraception coverage requirement. The mandate was a negotiated compromise between the Obama administration and religious-based non-profits such as hospitals and faith-based universities that oppose birth control. It made contraceptives available under the Affordable Care Act with no co-pay, but gave those entities a work-around through health plans written by third parties. Legal challenges . Since the law championed by President Barack Obama took effect, the contraceptive coverage requirement has faced several challenges, including a case last year by the religious charity Little Sisters of the Poor. As in Wheaton, the Supreme Court said the government couldn't enforce the contraceptive mandate. Religious-based groups sought delays in the requirement that took effect July 1, saying that signing the form would force them to choose between what the Little Sisters of the Poor-- a Denver-based home for the elderly run by Catholic nuns -- called ""onerous penalties or becoming complicit in a grave moral wrong."" The high court ruling in the Wheaton appeal said those who object only have to inform the government ""in writing that it is a nonprofit organization that holds itself out as religious and has religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services,"" rather than sign government form. What the Supreme Court's Hobby Lobby decision means . The ruling also made clear the high court had yet to decide the larger legal and constitutional issues, but merely acted on the enforcement question. The issue could be presented to the justices in coming months for final review. ""We are grateful to God that the Supreme Court has made a wise decision in protecting our religious liberty-at least until we have an opportunity to make our full case in court,"" said Wheaton College President Philip Ryken. ""We continue to believe that a college community that affirms the sanctity of human life from conception to the grave should not be coerced by the government into facilitating the provision of abortion-inducing drugs."" Wheaton is a private Christian liberal arts school located in a Chicago suburb, and is represented in court by the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty, which also represented Hobby Lobby -- an Oklahoma chain of 572 retail outlets -- and the Little Sisters of the Poor. The Hobby Lobby ruling Monday authored by Justice Samuel Alito suggested the two for-profit companies could sign the same government form as the religious non-profits. ""Unnecessary costs"" In the dissent of Thursday's ruling, Sotomayor expressed concern the court no longer required use of the form by any institution. ""The court's actions in this case create unnecessary costs and layers of bureaucracy, and they ignore a simple truth: The government must be allowed to handle the basic tasks of public administration in a manner that comports with common sense,"" the dissent said. ""The court's grant of an injunction in this case allows Wheaton's beliefs about the effects of its actions to trump the democratic interest in allowing the government to enforce the law,"" it continued. Hobby Lobby: the Bible verses behind the battle . A Mennonite family's fight over Obamacare reaches Supreme Court . The White House previously said the contraceptive coverage requirement in Obamacare was lawful and ""essential to a woman's health,"" and that its rules struck the right balance. There was no immediate reaction about the Thursday court order from the administration. Abortion rights groups expressed disappointment, with the Planned Parenthood Action Fund calling the court order ""alarming"" because it confirmed ""that many more women may lose access to birth control coverage in the coming months and years if Congress does not act soon."" While Democratic members of Congress are proposing fixes to the health care law to address the issue, the chances of such legislation passing in an election year are considered low due to opposition by conservative House Republicans.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor's Bel Air mansion, which offers an expansive -- and expensive -- view of Los Angeles, officially hits the real estate market for sale Tuesday, according to the realtor who is listing the property. The Hollywood Regency-style mansion, built in 1955, carries a listing price of $15 million, Beverly Hills real estate agent Christophe Choo said Monday. It will be officially posted on the multiple listing service Tuesday, Choo said. Gabor's husband, Prince Frederic von Anhalt, announced several months ago that he wanted to sell the house for $28 million because of the high cost of caring for his 94-year-old wife, who has been in poor health for years. The 6,400-square-foot house sits on more than an acre of prime land on a promontory on exclusive Bel Air Road. Music producer Quincy Jones lives next door. Gabor moved into the home about 35 years ago, about 10 years before she married von Anhalt, who is her ninth husband. At least one neighbor may be glad to see the couple move. Von Anhalt, 67, placed two porcelain toilets on his lawn facing the home of an adjacent property owner with whom he had a feud, the prince said in a CNN interview last year. The upper terrace offers a commanding view of downtown Los Angeles, Santa Monica, the ocean and Catalina Island. Gabor has suffered major health problems in the last year, including hip replacement surgery and a leg amputation. She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident. Her husband, when he first disclosed his intention to sell the home, said that he and his wife needed to pare down expenses. Maintaining the large house and paying for its staff, including nurses for his wife, cost about $35,000 a month, he said. He would like to move with his wife into a condo along Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles, closer to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where Gabor has spent much of her time in the past year, he said. Gabor's only child, Francesca Hilton, has questioned her stepfather's legal right to put the house on the market. The couple signed a prenuptial agreement before their wedding 25 years ago giving him no ownership in the property, Hilton said. Hilton, who has not been allowed by von Anhalt to see her mother in several months, said Gabor would never want to leave her house for a condo. The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is famous for her many marriages and strong personality as well as her acting prowess. Her more prominent films include John Huston's Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" in 1952, ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","The 6,400-square-foot house is priced at $15 million, real estate agent Christophe Choo says .

"A hearing on the finances of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez will be held Thursday in connection with a wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family of the man he is accused of killing, according to court documents. The lawsuit, filed Monday in a Massachusetts state court, claims Hernandez ""maliciously, willfully, wantonly, recklessly or by gross negligence"" caused the death of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez, 24, has pleaded not guilty to a charge of first-degree murder in the June shooting of Lloyd, 27, a Boston area semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend. Prosecutors told CNN that Hernandez allegedly planned and carried out the slaying: Lloyd was shot five times with a semi-automatic .45-caliber handgun. A grand jury investigating allegations of gun trafficking against Hernandez is the same one that handed up the murder charge, a source told CNN in October. The victim's estate is seeking unspecified ""compensation for the conscious pain and suffering endured by Odin Lloyd."" Hernandez had a NFL contract worth nearly $40 million, but it was terminated when he was charged with the slaying and firearm offenses. Lloyd's family also seeks a court order prohibiting the Patriots from paying Hernandez more than $3 million he is apparently owed from his contract. An attorney for Hernandez did not immediately return a message left Wednesday by CNN. The attorney representing Lloyd's family did not respond to calls for comment. Lloyd's sister declined comment. Hernandez is named in another civil suit. A witness that sources have described as Hernandez's ""muscle man"" said he was with the ex-Patriot the night of a 2012 Boston double homicide. Police have said that the homicide may be linked to Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation. That witness, Alexander Bradley, has filed a civil lawsuit accusing Hernandez of shooting him in the face during an argument after they left a Florida strip club in February. Bradley lost sight in one eye because of the shooting, according to the lawsuit.","Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez has Thursday hearing on finances .

"Barack Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Myanmar on Monday, praising the courage of fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi while also providing a symbolic nod to initial reforms in a nation once notorious for political repression. Later, Obama traveled to Cambodia for a summit of regional leaders and held what an aide called a ""tense""meeting with the host country's prime minister that emphasized the need for improving human rights there. The president's trip, his first overseas since winning re-election this month, foreshadowed the focus his administration will place on Asia in a second term as part of a strategy to blunt Chinese influence in the region. Cambodia is an ally of China. Monday's highlight was the several hours Obama spent in Myanmar, the formerly secretive country also known as Burma. The president met with Suu Kyi at the lakeside villa where she spent years under house arrest for her pro-democracy activism. Obama called the meeting a new chapter between the two countries. ""Here, through so many difficult years, is where she has displayed such unbreakable courage and determination,"" Obama told reporters, standing next to Suu Kyi. ""It is here where she showed that human freedom and human dignity cannot be denied."" Myanmar was politically and economically isolated from the rest of the world for decades until it ended military rule last year. In a diplomatic show of support, Obama referred to the country by the government's preferred name -- Myanmar -- rather than the colonial name of Burma used by Suu Kyi and democracy activists. Suu Kyi warned that Myanmar's reform process would be difficult. ""The most difficult time in any transition is when we think success is in sight, then we have to be very careful that we are not lured by a mirage of success, and that we are working toward its genuine success for our people and friendship between our two countries,"" she said. Opinion: Myanmar faces unfolding crisis . Before meeting Suu Kyi, Obama spent an hour with Myanmar President Thein Sein, whose reform drive has seen the release of hundreds of political prisoners and steps to open the country's economy. The democratic and economic reforms started by the president could lead to ""incredible development opportunities,"" Obama said. Thein Sein, who wore a long purple sarong and white shirt, told Obama he was committed to strengthening bilateral relations. The name Myanmar was introduced by the former military regime 23 years ago and is preferred by the country's current leaders. Until Monday, the Obama administration had largely stuck to the British colonial name of Burma. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told reporters that Obama exercised  ""diplomatic courtesy"" in referencing Myanmar instead of Burma when meeting with Thein Sein. The official U.S. position continued to be that the country's name is Burma, Rhodes said. As well as meeting Thein Sein and Suu Kyi, Obama delivered a speech at the University of Yangon in which he urged the country to continue its ""remarkable journey."" ""The flickers of progress that we have seen must not be extinguished,"" Obama said. ""Reforms launched from the top of society must meet the aspirations of citizens who form its foundation."" After leaving Myanmar, Obama traveled to Cambodia for a summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations that began with a first round of talks Monday followed by an evening dinner. The president also discussed human rights issues in the host country with Prime Minister Hun Sen, highlighting the case of a Cambodian radio broadcaster sentenced to prison for something he said on air about land seizures, according to Rhodes. He described the meeting as ""tense,"" in keeping with past U.S. efforts to raise human rights issues with Cambodia. Hun Sen offered no promises, but expressed a desire for closer economic ties with the United States, Rhodes said. In essence, Rhodes said, Obama was delivering a similar message in both Cambodia and Myanmar. At the dinner Monday night, Obama and the other regional leaders wore shirts of batik, the colorful cloth that express Southeast Asia's tropical culture. The president sat between Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Hun Sen. The visit to Myanmar created ""Obama fever"" in Yangon, with crowds waving U.S. flags lining the street from the airport to greet the U.S. president. His meeting with Thein Sein took place in the nation's largest city, rather than the isolated capital. Obama's image also featured on T-shirts and mugs for sale in city stores. Before his trip, Obama insisted the visit was ""not an endorsement of the Burmese government."" ""This is an acknowledgment that there is a process under way inside that country that even a year and a half, two years ago, nobody foresaw,"" Obama told reporters in Thailand on Sunday, the first stop on his Asia trip. He added that the country was moving ""in a better direction."" Western governments have responded to Myanmar's progressive efforts by easing sanctions that targeted the military regime. On Friday, the U.S. eased restrictions on imports of most goods from Burma. But the country has also witnessed bouts of turmoil in recent months. Violence between Rohingya Muslims and local Buddhists broke out in the western state of Rakhine. What's behind sectarian violence in Myanmar? During the latest eruption of tensions, the United Nations said at least 89 people were killed over two weeks of violence and 110,000 were displaced. Obama urged Myanmar to use its ""diversity as a strength, not a weakness."" ""I believe deeply that this country can transcend its differences, and that every human being within these borders is a part of your nation's story."" He met briefly with representatives of civil society organizations, including an advocate for Burma's Rohingya population. However, some aid organizations questioned whether now is the right time for Obama to add legitimacy to Thein Sein's government. Burmese exile leaders and human rights advocates have expressed concerns that the visit is too soon, and may not yield the additional reforms that a presidential visit can deliver if it happens at the right time.","President Obama has a ""tense"" meeting with Cambodia's leader .

"New York (CNN) -- The controversial head of a Muslim congregation in New York announced the launch of a ""multinational, multifaith movement"" meant to improve understanding and build trust between ""people of all cultures and faith traditions,"" according to a statement released Tuesday. Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the public face of a recent political firestorm surrounding the construction of an Islamic center in Lower Manhattan, is now spearheading what he calls the Cordoba Movement. The initiative is meant to broaden his groups' work in promoting religious tolerance and ""expand learning among Muslims, Jews, Christians and people of all faiths,"" the statement said. ""We must retake the discourse among religions and cultures from the hands of the extremists around the world who benefit from hatred and violence,"" Rauf said in the statement. ""We must stop this downward spiral of hatred, mistrust and misunderstanding if our world is to have a peaceful future."" It is unclear how the initiative will work to accomplish that goal. Rauf ran into opposition in his efforts on behalf of Park 51, a 13-story Islamic community center that would be two blocks from the former site of the World Trade Center. The center is part of a collaboration between the American Society for Muslim Advancement and the Cordoba Initiative. It is to feature a mosque, performing arts center, a gym, a swimming pool, and other public spaces. Its proximity to the location where two commercial jets hijacked by Muslim extremists crashed into the twin towers of the trade center in 2001 prompted protests that drew the issue into a global debate over Islam's place in the United States. Some six in 10 Catholics and Mormons think another location should be found, according to a recent Gallup survey. Less than a third of Muslims, other non-Christians and non-religious Americans feel the same way, the survey found, and Protestants and other Christians fell in the middle. Last month, organizers said they canceled a Thanksgiving prayer service at the site that was to feature joint appearances by a Christian minister and a rabbi, citing scheduling conflicts. The new project is an effort to counter accusations from congressmen and talk-show hosts that link Muslim terrorism to the broader Islamic religion, Tuesday's statement said. ""The Islam that I have studied all my life, the Islam that I preach, is all about worshipping God and loving your neighbor,"" Rauf said. ""The same core values are common to all the world's cultures and faith traditions. These are the same values of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness on which the United States was founded.""","Feisal Abdul Rauf launches a ""multinational, multifaith movement""

"Aaron Hernandez's fiancee pleaded not guilty to perjury on Tuesday, with prosecutors alleging she lied to those looking into the death of Odin Lloyd, whom Hernandez is accused of killing. A lawyer for Shayanna Jenkins strongly denied the claims in a Fall River, Massachusetts, court, saying her client has been ""fully cooperative other than insisting on her Fifth Amendment rights"" and received immunity for grand jury testimony. Jenkins is among a handful of people charged as investigators look into Lloyd's fatal shooting in June. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in Lloyd's death. ""It seems to me that this is overreaching, the indictment is overreaching, the statement by (the prosecutor) is overreaching, and the request for bail is overreaching,"" said Jenkins' lawyer, Janice Bassil. She spoke after Bristol County Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg presented a case against Jenkins. Who was Odin Lloyd? Among other things, Bomberg alleged Jenkins destroyed evidence --  a box that Hernandez, who until earlier this year was a standout tight end for the New England Patriots, asked her to find in his North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home and ""get rid of."" Jenkins then left her home with a black trash bag and returned sometime later without it, the prosecutor said. ""She told her sister that she was going to the bank, she told her uncle ... she was going to the store, she told the grand jurors that she was going to get baby formula,"" Bomberg said. Asked where she did go, the prosecutor said Jenkins told the grand jury she ""didn't know where she went"" and she couldn't remember what Hernandez asked her to dispose of. Jenkins testified she tossed the trash bag in a Dumpster, though she couldn't say where that Dumpster was,  Bomberg said. Witness says he was with Hernandez before double homicide . Speaking on this point, Jenkins' lawyer said her client ""received immunity on all of these things they are accusing her of"" and, even then, she didn't lie to the grand jury. At that time, Bassil said, Jenkins was subject to ""heavy-handed questioning"" during an ""extremely difficult"" period when Hernandez, the father of her young child, was under arrest for murder. Bassil described the relationship between Hernandez and Jenkins as ""don't ask, don't tell."" ""She could spend her life tracking him down and asking where he was every single minute, or she could choose to say what you do on your own time is your own time,"" the lawyer argued. ""If you didn't do this, you didn't do this. I don't need to know any more detail."" Bomberg, the prosecutor, also said that Jenkins lied to police when she told them Lloyd was a drug dealer. Jenkins ""corrected that in the grand jury"" testimony, Bassil said, stating that while she knew Lloyd provided marijuana to Hernandez, ""she had no other evidence"" that he dealt drugs. After Tuesday's hearing, the judge denied the prosecution's request for $5,000 bail and instead released Jenkins on her own recognizance pending trial. The next hearing in her case is set for November 6.","Shayanna Jenkins, Aaron Hernandez's fiancee, pleads not guilty to perjury .

"(CNN)Chinese railway experts have begun talks on building a record-breaking high-speed rail that would connect Inner Mongolia in the north to Hainan in the south. According to the Shaanxi Development and Reform Commission, the proposed line will operate at a speed of 350 kilometers per hour (217 mph). Beginning in Inner Mongolia's Baotou city and running through southern Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong, its final stop would be in Haikou city on Hainan Island, China's southernmost province. Though the exact length of the proposed route has not been released, it will likely become the world's longest high-speed rail line -- smashing a record already held by China -- as the journey by road between Baotou and Haikou is approximately 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) long. Currently, the world's longest high-speed rail line is almost 2,300 kilometers long (1,429 miles), running from Beijing to the southern metropolis of Guangzhou. The proposed rail is part of China's aim to create a ""Maritime Silk Road of the 21st Century"" and coincides with initiatives to improve the country's comprehensive transportation network while driving land development and urbanization in seven provincial areas. Minority issues . Many of the provinces through which the high-speed trains will travel are near major bodies of water, such as the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi provinces, the Yangtze River in Hubei and the South China Sea, where the line would end. It will also take passengers to popular tourist destinations including Zhangjiajie, Xian, Guilin and minority areas in western Hunan and Hubei. ""The country is now shifting its focus and investing in the western regions and economically underdeveloped areas, making up for China's long debt to these areas,"" Tan Yuzhi, professor of the School of Economics and Management at Hubei University for Nationalities, told local media. ""The project will significantly narrow regional disparities and solve minority issues."" However, Deng Hongbing, director of China University of Geosciences' Center for Regional Economic and Investment Center, said that if the north-to-south railway is to go ahead, there needs to be a sound ecological program in place to ensure the protection of these underdeveloped and ecologically sensitive areas. Officials say the line will connect with existing high-speed routes such as Xuzhou-Lanzhou, Shanghai-Wuhan-Chengdu, Shanghai-Kunming and Guiyang-Guangzhou. Proposal participants say they will push for the train project to be included in China's 13th five-year national development plan (2016-2020).","Proposed high-speed rail would connect Inner Mongolia with Hainan, which are more than 3,000 kilometers apart .

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian security forces have killed an al Qaeda emissary who fought alongside Chechen rebels, officials said Wednesday. Doger Sevdet, also known as Abdulla Kurd, was killed in Russia's northern Caucasus region, according to a statement from the Russian National Anti-Terrorist Committee. Russia says that Sevdet had fought with Chechen rebels in one of several al Qaeda units that were led by Arab field commanders Ibn ul-Khattab, Abu al-Walid and Abu Hafs -- all of whom are now dead as well. Sevdet, a Turkish citizen by birth, moved to the restive Russian region in 1991 after living in neighboring Georgia, the statement said. He later became al Qaeda's point man in the Northern Caucasus, officials say, assuming control of international money transactions for the regional group soon after Yusef Muhammed al Emirat, a native of Saudi Arabia, was killed by Russian security forces in a sting operation last month in the mountainous district of south Chechnya. The current round of the Russia-Chechnya conflict dates back nearly 20 years, with Chechens having laid claim to land in the Caucasus Mountains region. Thousands have been killed and 500,000 Chechen people have been displaced by the fighting. Chechnya is located in the North Caucasus region of Russia between the Black and Caspian seas.","Russian security forces kill al Qaeda emissary .

"Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, detained in Iran since July, has been freed, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency and The Washington Post. Salehi was held with her husband, Washington Post Tehran Bureau Chief Jason Rezaian, and he remains behind bars, The Post reported Sunday after speaking with a family member. Salehi was released on bail last week, The Post said. It's unclear why Salehi and Rezaian were arrested. Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, has been quoted by IRNA as saying that a ""Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue.""

I think there was just not a hint of anything that could cause anyone in any government to find fault,"" Bourdain said on ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

"When the influential cleric Yusuf al Qaradawi recently called on fellow Sunni Muslims to join the rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime, he effectively called for the Sunni-Shia conflict in the Middle East to escalate in some countries and start anew in others. Qaradawi said he was not demonizing all Shia Muslims -- but that is precisely the effect of his inflammatory words. He denounced al-Assad's Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam, as ""more infidel than Christians and Jews."" signaling a broader demonization of all Shia. He also said the Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah (whose name means ""the party of God"") is really ""the party of the devil."" ""How could 100 million Shia (worldwide) defeat 1.7 billion (Sunnis)?"" Qaradawi asked, speaking May 31 in Doha, Qatar, about the two largest Muslim sects. ""Only because they (Sunni) are weak,"" he said, attempting to inspire the Sunnis to go to Syria to fight against al-Assad and prove their strength. ""I call on Muslims everywhere to help their brothers be victorious,"" Qaradawi said in his sermon.  ""Everyone who has the ability and has training to kill ... is required to go"" to Syria. ""We cannot ask our brothers to be killed while we watch."" Such provocative statements are classic Qaradawi, who in 2008 warned of the ""Shiitization"" of the Middle East.  But as a clever operative, he knows this time his statements could escalate the conflict in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon. Qaradawi's rhetoric could also embolden the Sunni majority in Saudi Arabia and the Shia majority in Bahrain, where the Sunni royal family is fighting a Shia-led uprising. In addition, his statements could add legitimacy to the alarm in Egypt, where Sunnis fear a possible, though improbable, infiltration of Shia Islam from Iran. Qaradawi, who is a controversial figure in the West but has millions of Sunni followers, timed his remarks on the heels of a speech a week earlier by Hassan Nasrallah, the Hezbollah leader. Nasrallah acknowledged what had been an open secret -- that Hezbollah fighters are in Syria battling the Sunni opposition and supporting the al-Assad regime. Like Qaradawi, Nasrallah said his condemnation of the Sunnis did not apply to all -- just those fighting al-Assad -- but he too aimed to escalate the sectarian animosity that has already begun to grip the Muslim world. What is striking about the statements by Nasrallah and Qaradawi, and their timing, is that the other open secret -- a deepening sectarian conflict spreading throughout the region -- has now been publicly acknowledged. In the past, both men attempted to talk in fake pleasantries about the other sect. Nasrallah claimed Hezbollah was fighting the ""resistance"" (the war against Israel) for all Muslims, and Qaradawi spoke of closing the divide between Shia and Sunni. On May 31, Qaradawi reiterated this message in his Doha speech and explained why he has had a change of heart. ""I kept calling for years (for efforts) to bridge the gap between sects, and traveled to Iran during the era of former President Mohammad Khatami (but) these fanatics (in Iran) and hard-liners want to disempower the Sunnis. They deceived me and deceived many others like me by saying that they, too, want to bridge the differences,"" Qaradawi said. It is entirely possible that escalation of the sectarian conflict will lead to a profound remapping of some Arab states. This is already a likely possibility in Syria. If a negotiated settlement is not reached between al-Assad's government and the opposition, al-Assad and his minority Alawites could partition the country by forming their own enclave, apart from the Sunni majority. In Iraq, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al Maliki is trying to sustain and consolidate Shia dominance by excluding the Sunni from important institutions and labeling them terrorists. More broadly, the country is witnessing a return of Shia-Sunni clashes at the societal level -- some of the largest since 2006. Even before the Syrian civil war began, sectarian conflict was a major outcome of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. In the tug of war between the Shia and Sunni, Nasrallah's power is likely to diminish while that of Qaradawi is likely to rise. Once a leader who had support among the Sunni for defeating Israel in a battle in 2006, Nasrallah, in fighting for Assad, has transformed himself and his movement into a strictly Shia paramilitary force engaged in a war with an uncertain outcome. Qaradawi, however, is riding a wave of Sunni triumphalism in the region and his sectarian rhetoric is likely to bolster the Sunni ascendancy, no matter what happens in Syria. Both men's words leave little hope for reconciliation between Shia and Sunni, and instead serve as an open invitation for increased sectarian warfare -- now more likely than ever to be the most significant outcome of the recent Arab uprisings.","Geneive Abdo: Sunni-Shia tension has erupted into deepening split in Muslim world .

"Bydgoszcz, Poland (CNN) -- I first visited Poland in 1990, just after the end of communist rule. Back then, the United States meant everything to people here: freedom, protection, opportunity, hope. I worked for The Wall Street Journal at the time. That business card resonating with capitalism opened every door. It even persuaded a border official not to pass my camera through a Soviet-era X-ray machine. Twenty years later, Poland has become a stable democracy. It has joined NATO and the European Union. True, wages remain low by Western standards. And to the eye, Poland still shows the scars of its communist past: Half the population still lives in communist-era high-rise slabs. But things get better every year, visibly better even than during my last visit two years ago: new homes, new stores, improved roads, new stations opened on the Warsaw subway. Poland scored the highest growth in the whole European Union in 2009, suffering not a single quarter of negative growth during the global recession. So that's all good news for the Poles. Now the thought-provoking news for Americans: America's place on the Polish mental map seems to shrink every year. When Poles dream of leaving the country, they think not of Chicago but of London. A Pole can work legally in any large EU country, and an estimated 1 million do, sending home more money than Poland earns from all its U.S. trade. Meanwhile, Poles need a visa even to visit the United States. Polish business is oriented toward Germany, by far the country's largest trading partner and investor. Poland buys and sells less with the United States than it does with the Czech Republic. Theoretically, the United States remains very important to Poland's security. Through NATO, the U.S. has guaranteed defending Poland against Russia, with nuclear weapons if necessary. But Russia is behaving itself well toward Poland these days. When Russia did behave badly -- for example, embargoing Polish meat exports in 2005 -- it was the threat of European economic retaliation that changed Russian minds. The U.S. has opened new military bases in southeastern Europe -- in Bulgaria and Romania, but none in Poland. There are practically no U.S. soldiers stationed here. If anything, Poles might feel that they are doing much more for the United States than the United States does for Poland. Polish troops fought in Iraq, and fight now in Afghanistan. Polish support for U.S. geopolicy has twice ended in humiliation for Polish governments. In 2005, sources inside the U.S. government leaked the news that Poland was permitting the CIA to detain captured al Qaeda terrorists in secret in Polish prisons. Poland was threatened with the loss of its EU voting rights and subjected to an EU investigation. Then in 2009, the new Obama administration abruptly canceled a proposed U.S. missile defense system based in Poland and the Czech Republic. These experiences would cause any future Polish governments to worry that cooperation with the U.S. will horribly backfire on them. Some waning of U.S. prestige in Poland was inevitable. With the end of the Cold War, Poles naturally worry more about earning a living than protecting their security. And of course, next-door Germany offers more economic benefits than faraway America. Of course, too, the U.S. has banked a huge store of goodwill in Poland that will take years to deplete. It was the U.S. that championed Poland's independence from Moscow while anxious Germans urged that the U.S. stop annoying the Soviet Union with talk of freedom. But although inevitable and gradual, the dwindling of American importance, not only in Poland but in other liberated countries in central Europe as well, is a real and large fact of life. That fact might matter less if there were other regions of the world where America's clout was increasing. But where? The opinion expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","David Frum visited post-communist Poland in 1990; nation was eager to connect with U.S.
Now, 20 years later, democratic Poland part of EU, NATO;  U.S. seems less central in importance .
Poland has closer connections in EU, he says, have had awkward political moments with U.S.
Frum: U.S. still key to security, has goodwill history with Poland, but its importance dwindling ."
"Michelle Obama's not just embracing her half-century milestone, she's relishing it. Describing herself as ""50 and fabulous,"" the ""Let's Move"" creator is getting ready to move herself on Saturday -- as in show off some dance moves -- with a big birthday celebration at the White House. ""I have never felt more confident in myself, more clear on who I am as a woman,"" the first lady told Parade magazine last summer when asked about approaching the big 5-0. That confidence was on full display when she recently took on the topic of aging and whether she'd ever consider plastic surgery. ""Women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves,"" Obama said in an interview with People magazine set to release on Friday, her birthday. ""Right now, I don't imagine that I would go that route, but I've also learned to never say never."" And when asked if she has peaked at 50, she joked that first lady is ""pretty high up,"" but said she's always felt her life is ""ever-evolving."" ""I've got to keep figuring out ways to have an impact, whether as a mother or as a professional or as a mentor to other kids,"" said Obama, who has made talking with teens and increasing the college graduation rate among her major issues during her husband's second term as president. Michelle Obama has plenty of fabulous company when it comes to celebrating a milestone birthday in 2014, with a host of amazing women including Sandra Bullock, Elle Macpherson, philanthropist Melinda Gates, California Attorney General Kamala Harris and Susan Rice, President Obama's national security adviser, all turning 50 this year. (Check out the gallery above showcasing 50 women celebrating 50 in 2014!) Some, like Macpherson, are welcoming middle age. ""I rather like the idea of flowing on with life. I have had amazing life experiences and hopefully another 50 years of experiences ahead of me,"" she told Contact Music in May 2012. PHOTOS: Michelle Obama graces magazine covers . Others, like Courteney Cox, aren't so psyched. ""That's gonna be brutal,"" Cox told New You Magazine back in 2012, referring to her 50th birthday in June. ""I'm not that interested in that! That sounds different. It feels different."" So how does 50 feel? Is 50 today a whole lot different than the age 50 of 20 or 30 years ago? We asked women across the country who have already reached the half-century milestone to weigh in, and most agreed with Obama: 50 really is fabulous. '50 is the new 40' Sharon Greenthal, managing partner and editor-in-chief for MidLife Boulevard, an online magazine focusing on the lives of women older than 40, wrote a widely read post back in 2012 titled ""How to turn 50."" ""The way to turn 50 is to embrace it,"" she wrote as she turned 50 that year. In an interview, Greenthal, a former stay-at-home mom with two grown children in Los Angeles who became an editor after turning 50, said 50 today is dramatically different than 50 of a few decades ago. PHOTOS: 50 people who turned 50 last year . ""I think 30 years ago or so, you were moving into the phase of your life where things were really slowing down,"" she said. ""I feel like my life is just really speeding up now ... because I don't have the responsibilities of caring for other people anymore. I can really take care of myself and my husband and we can enjoy being 50-plus. I don't think there's anything old about 50 at all."" Louise Sattler, a mom of two grown children in southern California who hit the big 5-0 in 2009, agrees. ""50 is like the new 40,"" Sattler said. ""I think because we now know octogenarians and we know people well on the cusp of 100 that 50 seems kind of like your second act. It does not seem like a two-thirds point."" For her 50th, Sattler wrote a list of 50 fabulous things she would do in her 50th year, which included eating spicy Indian food for the first time, wearing the ""crazy beaded necklace and earrings"" she bought on Venice Beach and buying new dishes ""just because."" Also on that list, she said, was making an impact. After battling thyroid cancer when she was 51, the psychologist decided to do something new. Already the owner of Signing Families, an organization that specializes in sign language education, she decided to focus her efforts on training first responders to communicate with special needs populations. She now travels the country working with first responders. ""50 was a wake-up call to do something for me that was kind of how I want my legacy to be,"" she said. ""That was one of the things that I said: You've got to start doing things that are important versus just to make a dollar."" 'As cantankerous as I want to be!' But for many, turning 50 is about as welcome as cleaning the bathroom, doing taxes or having a tooth pulled. ""50 sucks ... Everything either hurts or doesn't work,"" said Nancy Rudy, in response to a post on CNN's Facebook page. Sue Scheff, a parenting author and advocate in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, just turned 52. Fifty is ""only a number"" but the experience can be different ""depending on where you are in life,"" she said on Facebook. ""If you are single, finding a date is difficult. Men want women in their 30s,"" Scheff said. ""If you are job hunting, employers want people out of college. ""50 is an age you 'learn' to embrace or it can get you really down since you think, 'Heck, I am halfway through my life. What do I want to do when I grow up?'"" Said Jeanne Rog on CNN's Facebook page, ""The only good thing about hitting my 50s is that I can be as cantankerous as I want to be!"" Whether they're embracing 50 or wishing it would go away, people seem to agree on one thing -- 50 means letting go of caring about what others think. ""I don't question how others are perceiving me,"" said Greenthal, author of the ""How to Turn 50"" blog post. ""I know that I am the best person I can be and that's really the gift of being older is being comfortable with who you are."" And that comfort in your own skin gets even stronger after 50, says Tish Howard, a retired school principal. ""Fifty means testing your wings of independence and some selfish, long-earned indulgence. But at 60, you learn to soar unshackled of anyone else's opinion of what is you but yours,"" said Howard of Fredericksburg, Virginia. The big 5-0 is just a few years away for me, but I'm fully in the ""embrace it"" camp. I'm already telling friends to keep their calendars open for my dance-all-night disco party and not caring what anyone thinks of the idea! How do you feel about turning 50?

"(CNN) -- World leaders reacted with shock and condemnation Thursday to the assassination of former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, some expressing concern about the nation's democratic process.

In India, which has long had a thorny relationship with its neighbors in Pakistan, an Indian Congress Party spokesman told the Press Trust of India, ""... we must express our deep concern at anything that disrupts and disturbs the even keel of democratic governance in Pakistan.""

Russia's Foreign Ministry called Bhutto's death a terror attack. ""We strongly condemn this terrorist act, present our condolences to the family and friends of Benazir Bhutto and hope that Pakistani authorities will provide for national stability,"" said Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin. The Russian Foreign Ministry has repeatedly expressed concern that the Pakistani government ""must do its best to ensure the maximum stability in the election period and prevent terrorist acts against Benazir Bhutto and other political leaders,"" said the Kamynin statement. The rally bombing took place as Bhutto campaigned for a third term as prime minister. It was the second recent attack on Bhutto after she defied death threats and returned to her homeland from eight years of self-imposed exile.

"Turkey is positioned as the geographic, economic and political bridge straddling both Asia and Europe. How Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan performs if he secures a first round victory in Sunday's Presidential election will determine if this sizable emerging market can restore its luster as an engine for growth and a regional political force. The scrappy former mayor of Istanbul came to power promising a new brand of Islam under the party he co-founded, the Justice and Development Party (AKP): One that is pro-business and one that in the recent past juggled good relations with both Israel and Iran. Economically speaking, Erdogan has delivered. Turkey enjoyed growth of 6-8% for the better part of his first decade in power. Gone are the days of hyper-inflation (although the latest reading of 9.3% in July is not low) -- as well as the multiple zeroes at the end of lira notes -- thanks to the currency stability he introduced . The current prime minister became the darling of Fortune 500 companies, which took advantage of the European Union Customs Union offering lower export tariffs, and turned Turkey into a manufacturing hub for Europe. Foreign direct investment surged ten-fold, from just $20 billion in 2001 to over $200 billion today. 3,300 international companies now call Turkey home according to UNCTAD. But many believe this presidential election will not broaden democracy in Turkey, but only help Erdogan consolidate his grip on power in an effort to burnish his legacy. ""Erdogan's 12 month strategy is to engineer, de jure or de facto, as much of a transfer of power from the prime minister's office to the presidential palace as he can,"" wrote Professor Henri Barkey of Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. This strategy could dilute the role of the Turkish parliament and allow the president to hand-pick his successor as prime minister. Those who are close to the current President Abdullah Gul tell me the moderate counter-weight to Erdogan will stay out of the political cross-fire and let this experiment to create a presidential system of government play out. But they say a successful transition is not a given. But after suffering through a year of intense protests, a barrage of accusations and investigations linked to corruption at the top of his government and a challenge from afar by former ally, the Pennsylvania based religious leader Fethullah Gulen, Erdogan not only seems undeterred, but more emboldened than ever. He has grand plans in the works: an expansion of the Istanbul airport to rival Dubai as the international transfer hub, a brand new bridge across the Bosphorus, and a 45 kilometer canal that will run parallel to that Strait. In October last year, Erdogan proudly unveiled the Marmaray Link connecting Asia and Europe with an underground train network. This infrastructure, he says, will also help sustain growth. Total GDP today is hovering at nearly $850 billion after a three-fold increase in ten years. That is projected to nearly double again by 2020 and Erdogan has set a goal for it to cross $2 trillion by 2023, the centennial of the Turkish Republic. If achieved, Turkey would be in the top ten of global economies. Fabled emerging market author Jim O'Neil, when at investment bank Goldman Sachs, selected Turkey as a ""Next 11"" country -- one of the most promising for the next generation of growth. Whether it can live up to those expectations will depend on prudent financial management, but also on how ""Team Erdogan"" conducts relations within the global investment community. He and a few cabinet members have made a reputation for jawboning credit rating agencies when they make moves to downgrade the country's debt rating. Moody's was the latest to suffer the wrath of Ankara for treating the country ""unfairly."" It is not unusual for Erdogan to draw comparisons of his leadership to that of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey.  He wants to secure his place in history. Whether his desire to do so is ultimately good for his country remains the big unknown as Turks go to the polls.","Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is campaigning to become the country's president .

"Despite the recent uptick in gas prices, the last major travel holiday of the summer is expected to be busier. According to AAA's survey of Labor Day travel released Tuesday, 33 million Americans will travel at least 50 miles for the upcoming long weekend, an increase of 2.9% from 2011. Travelers are also expected to spend more on their trips. The median cost of $749 this year is slightly higher than last year's average of $702. The automotive and travel services group says the vast majority of those travelers, 28.2 million of them, will hit the roadways for their trip. The nationwide average cost of a gallon of regular gasoline is 14 cents higher than it was when AAA did its Labor Day forecasting last August, but below the year's peak of $3.94 in April. The survey found nationwide gas prices are not expected to have a major negative impact on travelers' plans, and two-third of those surveyed said their current financial outlook would not impact their Labor Day plans either. Those looking to save money on their travel said they will skip hotels and stay with family or friends, take a shorter trip, use a more economical mode of transportation or spend less on shopping or sightseeing. Air travel for the holiday is expected to rise 3.7%, thanks to a 4% dip in airfares from last year. 2.55 million passengers will fly to their Labor Day destination, while 2.3 million will use other modes of transportation like buses, rail and cruise ships. The average trip will stretch 626 miles, though 54% of those surveyed said their Labor Day excursion will fall between 100 and 400 miles roundtrip. AAA projections saw a 1.2% year-over-year uptick for Memorial Day travel this year, and a 4.9% increase for the Independence Day holiday.

"African Union soldiers stationed in Somalia have raped and sexually exploited women and girls on their military bases, Human Rights Watch says in a new report. The report released Monday accuses soldiers of working through Somali go-betweens to use a variety of ploys, such as humanitarian aid, to force women and girls to have sex as well as to sexually assault women who came to the bases seeking medical help or water. ""Some African Union soldiers have misused their positions of power to exploit Somalia's most vulnerable women and girls,"" said Liesl Gerntholtz, executive director of the women's rights division at Human Rights Watch. The rights group said it interviewed 21 women and girls who recounted being raped or sexually exploited by Ugandan or Burundian troops serving with the African Union Mission in Somalia since 2013. Among the cases described in the report is a 15-year-old girl who was allegedly raped by a Burundian soldier after she went to a military base to try to get medicine for her sick mother. African Union challenges report . The African Union said it was ""concerned"" by the report and would ""thoroughly"" investigate the allegations. But it took issue with much of the content of the document, accusing it of ""imbalance, inaccuracies and partial view."" The regional body said the portrayal of the AU mission and the broad conclusions in the report ""constitute a misrepresentation of the sacrifices, achievements and genuine commitment"" of the mission. AU troops are in Somalia to support Somali forces cracking down on Al-Shabaab, a group fighting the government in hopes of turning the country into a fundamentalist Islamic state. The mission's mandate includes helping with humanitarian assistance in Somalia, which is plagued by war, poverty and famine. Scale of problem unclear . The AU said the Human Rights Watch report ""uses a small number of cases to arrive at a generalized conclusion."" The rights group said it didn't ""assess the scale or prevalence of the abuse"" because of the sensitivity of the subject and the ""profound reluctance"" of victims and witnesses to speak out. ""Nonetheless, the findings raise serious concerns about abuses by AMISOM soldiers against Somali women and girls that suggest a much larger problem,"" the report said. It called on the countries who contribute troops, the AU and donors to the mission to ""urgently address these abuses and strengthen procedures inside Somalia to seek justice."" The AU said in its statement it had developed mechanisms ""to prevent and respond to issues of misconduct and abuse in peace support operations, in accordance with the AU's zero-tolerance policy on this matter.""

"Protests in Missouri around the death of an unarmed teen turned violent late Sunday. A gas station was looted, and police called for additional units to back up officers already on the street, said Brian Schellman, spokesman with the St. Louis County Police Department. Video from the scene showed police in riot gear. No injuries were immediately reported. ""They are sending in more officers to try and get the situation under control,"" Schellman said. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that at least 20 police cars were damaged and that the use of tear gas was a high possibility. A friend and witnesses say Missouri teen Michael Brown was unarmed and had his hands in the air when a Ferguson police officer shot and killed him, but that account is in dispute. ""The genesis of this was a physical confrontation,"" Jon Belmar, chief of the St. Louis County Police Department, said at a Sunday news conference. The officer tried to leave his vehicle just before the shooting on Saturday afternoon, but Brown pushed him back into the car, ""where he physically assaulted the police officer"" and struggled over the officer's weapon, Belmar said. A shot was fired inside the police car, and Brown was eventually shot about 35 feet away from the vehicle, Belmar said, adding few details because he didn't want to ""prejudice"" the case. All shell casings collected at the scene were from the officer's weapon, Belmar said. He further said the medical examiner would issue a ruling on how many times Brown was shot, but ""it was more than just a couple."" The account was in stark contrast to those of witnesses who said Brown did nothing to instigate the shooting and appeared to be surrendering when he was killed. ""My son just turned 18 and graduated high school and he didn't bother nobody,"" the young man's mother, Lesley McSpadden, told CNN affiliate KSDK. Ferguson Police cars do not have dash cameras, the department said. McSpadden was told her son was shot eight times, though witnesses had varying accounts of how many shots were fired. Brown was supposed to start classes at Vatterott College on Monday, she said . Antonio French, the Ward 21 alderman in nearby St. Louis, tweeted numerous photos and videos from the aftermath of the Saturday shooting. Brown was shot shortly after 2 p.m., according to reports. Hundreds of demonstrators -- as many as 1,000 at the height of the protests, according to police -- converged on the scene Saturday, at one point driving away a police squad car, French said on Twitter. Scores of police officers lined the street. One of them held the leash of a barking dog, and French said some officers wielded shotguns. One image showed a riot van on the scene. Demonstrators held their hands in the air and chanted, ""We are Michael Brown."" Others held signs, including one that said, ""No justice, no peace"" and another that read, ""Police stops should not = dead kids."" There were reports that some protesters yelled, ""Kill the police."" Demonstrators at one point set a Dumpster on fire, according to CNN affiliate KMOV, and Ferguson Police Chief Jackson told KSDK, ""It did get a little tense when, twice, several shots were fired."" The Ferguson Police Department called more than 100 officers from 15 jurisdictions to secure the scene, KMOV reported. ""We had what probably bordered on riot conditions,"" Jackson said, explaining that it took hours to process the scene, collect evidence and move Brown's body. Later, according to media reports, about 100 people took their protest to the Police Department in Ferguson, a northern suburb that's about a 20-minute drive from St. Louis. Officers were deployed to ensure the demonstrations were peaceful, the police chief said. McSpadden had pointed words for the officer who shot her son. ""You're not God. You don't decide when you're going to take somebody from here,"" she told KSDK. Jackson said the St. Louis County Police Department was conducting an independent investigation, and during the Sunday news conference, Belmar expressed doubts that Jackson would've called his department so promptly ""if he had something to hide."" The officer who shot Brown is on paid administrative leave during the investigation and will be available to talk to county homicide detectives. The officer has been with the force six years, Belmar said, adding that he is ""unaware of any other issues that he's been involved in."" He will be required to undergo two psychological evaluations before returning to duty, Belmar said. The St. Louis County NAACP is asking the FBI to open an inquiry and said it would conduct its own investigation into the killing. ""We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting,"" local chapter President Esther Haywood said in a statement. A Justice Department spokeswoman said Attorney General Eric Holder has instructed the department's civil rights division to monitor the developments in the case. The FBI said it is assisting police in its investigation and will review the findings. Federal authorities typically await completion of the local investigation before deciding whether federal action is needed. Brown was spending the summer in the neighborhood with his grandmother, Desuirea Harris, she told KMOV. She described him as ""a good kid."" He was walking with at least one other man at the time of the incident, Jackson said. Witnesses told CNN affiliate KTVI that a police officer in a squad car grabbed Brown while he was walking. Dorian Johnson said he was walking with Brown in the middle of the street when a police car pulled up. The officer told the teens to use the sidewalk, according to Johnson. After an exchange of words, the officer shot Brown even after he raised his hands in the air, Johnson said. The officer ""shot again, and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,"" Johnson told KMOV. ""He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots."" The police chief declined to divulge specifics about the case, including what preceded the shooting. Brown enjoyed music and had recently graduated from Normandy High School in Wellston, his uncle Bernard Ewing said.","Police are in riot gear; there are no immediate reports of injuries .

"(CNN)Steven Gerrard has revealed he will move to the U.S. when he leaves Liverpool at the end of the current EPL season. The Reds legend surprised fans and teammates with the announcement late on New Year's Day that he would leave the club he supported as a boy and has represented on the pitch for the past 17 years when his contract expires in June. Rumors quickly surfaced linking the Liverpool captain with a move to Los Angeles Galaxy, formerly home of ex England star David Beckham. Speaking to Liverpool's in-house TV channel Saturday, the player himself confirmed that the U.S. would be his next destination. Gerrard didn't confirm the club he will be signing for but reports late on Saturday suggested that an 18-month deal was close to being agreed with the Galaxy. ""I can tell the supporters at the moment that it will be America,"" said the 34-year-old. ""But I'm not over the line with any team just yet. I'm close and as soon as I know, I'll make the announcement, I'll do the bits and bobs that I need to do. ""Then we try to go and win a trophy and forget about Steven Gerrard for a bit."" Commenting on the difficulty of coming to his decision, Gerrard said he realized it was time to move on when Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers began to discuss how best to make the most of his abilities in the veteran stage of his career and the possibility that he may no longer be an automatic choice. ""There was more than one moment that has made me come to this decision, but I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,"" Gerrard said. ""I'm bright enough to realize it is the right thing for everyone, but when you've been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have with the manager. ""I accept it and I'll continue to give everything I've got, whether I'm starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation that swung me to deciding to come away for a short while. ""I had an idea it was going to come at some time - I'm a human, not a robot. I'm not 24. I wish I was 24, I wish I'd met Brendan when I was 24 because I think I'd be sitting here talking about a lot of titles that we'd won together."" Gerrard made his first-team debut for Liverpool in November 1998 and has scored 180 goals to date in all competitions. He also represented England 114 times -- before retiring after the 2014 World Cup -- and has won eight trophies with Liverpool including two FA Cups, three League Cups and the UEFA Cup in 2001. His greatest achievement came in 2005 when he captained Liverpool to victory in the Champions League final against AC Milan in Istanbul. However, his long-cherished desire to win the Premier League never materialized -- Liverpool came close in 2009 finishing second to Manchester United and last season Brendan Rodgers' side were pipped to the post by Manchester City. Even more distressingly Gerrard's mistake in the 2-0 home defeat by Chelsea near the end of the season gifted the visitors their first goal -- an error opposition supporters continue to remind the Liverpool captain about in a song during games. Despite the teasing from opposition fans and occasional negative reviews of his performances this season from once-admiring pundits, Gerrard said he was taken aback by the support he has received in recent days. Given his long history with the club and the emotional nature of his decision, its a backing he said he feels fortunate to have. ""I've been here a long time. I've been coming to this training ground since I was eight years of age,"" he said. ""I always knew it was going to end one day and it would be an emotional decision. That decision is here. People will have their own opinions on it but for me, come the summer it will be the right time. ""The messages of support I've had from the fans, the players, the staff, the media and people who I've worked with for a long time has blew me away,"" Gerrard continued. ""That's when I've started getting emotional. But I need to be string and hold them back because I'm not going yet."" ""There are still six months to go and I've still got plenty to try to achieve, so I am trying to keep my focus on that. Liverpool currently lie in eighth position in the EPL, six points behind fourth placed Southampton, and are still in contention for a Champions League place. The club are also still competing in the Europa League and FA Cup. Gerrard scored twice from the penalty spot on New Year's Day as Liverpool drew 2-2 with Leicester City and is in contention to play when his side face AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup on Monday.","Steven Gerrard confirms he will move to the U.S. when his Liverpool contract expires .

"The family of disgraced UK TV presenter Jimmy Savile made its first public statement Saturday since a slew of claims of sexual abuse of under-age girls destroyed the reputation of a man they had regarded as a hero. Savile's nephew, Roger Foster, had defended his late uncle -- who hosted shows watched and heard by a generation of young Britons -- in a newspaper interview before the allegations emerged in a TV documentary a month ago. But as those few claims snowballed into hundreds, the family had to face up to the horrific truth: that the man they were so proud of as a media star and indefatigable charity fundraiser had a far darker side to his past. A statement released Saturday by Foster spells out the family's anguish -- and their deep sympathy for as many as 300 victims preyed on by Savile. The documentary made them aware of ""allegations of a darker side to him that we knew nothing about,"" Foster says -- and the claims swiftly began to overwhelm the family. ""I watched the program in horror and could not believe that these allegations were about our uncle. This wasn't the man we knew and loved,"" he says. ""We began to have doubts as to our own feeling towards our uncle. How could the person we thought we knew and loved do such a thing? ""Why would a man who raised so much money for charity, who gave so much of his own time and energy for others risk it all doing indecent criminal acts? How could anyone live their life doing the 'most good and most evil' at the same time?"" Profile: Idolised in life, reviled in death . The family took the ""difficult"" decision to remove Savile's headstone, only placed on his grave a couple of weeks earlier, as they feared it could become a target for spiraling public outrage and so disrupt the peace of the cemetery for others. ""A vilification of his name, his achievements and everything he stood for followed. People are moving as quickly as possible to disassociate themselves from him,"" Foster continues. ""We recognize that even our own despair and sadness does not compare to that felt by the victims. Our thoughts and our prayers are with those who have suffered from every kind of abuse over so many years and we offer our deepest sympathy in what must have been a terrible time for all of them. Ex-Scout tells of abuse . ""We can understand their reluctance to say anything earlier and can appreciate the courage it has taken to speak out now."" Meanwhile, Savile's family waits to see what new horrors may emerge. ""Where will it all end? Who knows? The repercussions of this scandal are enormous. We, as his closest family, have to endure further revelations on a daily basis. Our feelings are in turmoil as we await the next turn of events,"" Foster concludes. In another blow to Savile's legacy, a senior archbishop has urged the Vatican to strip him of his papal knighthood, awarded by Pope John Paul II in 1990. The Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev. Vincent Nichols, wrote to Pope Benedict XVI to ask if the honor could be posthumously removed, ""recognising the deep distress of all those who have suffered abuse and the disquiet at Mr Savile's name remaining on Papal Honours lists,"" a spokesman said. ""While the outcome of the current police investigation is awaited, the allegations of abuse are deeply shocking and our thoughts go first to all those who have been abused,"" said the spokesman for Nichols, who heads the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Police say they are preparing an arrest strategy for ""others,"" still living, against whom allegations have been made in connection with the Savile case. Commander Peter Spindler told reporters Thursday that police investigating the scandal were dealing with about 300 apparent victims, of whom all except two are women. They had spoken to 130 as of Thursday and identified 114 offenses committed, he said. Officers are following more than 400 lines of inquiry in the case, most of them involving Savile, he said, but no one has been arrested or interviewed under caution. ""I have no doubt we are at a watershed moment for child abuse investigations,"" Spindler said. He said he wanted to reassure victims that they will no longer be ""uncredible"" and that they will be given a voice. Many of the allegations date back to the 1960s and '70s, complicating the current investigation. Some police forces also face questions over reports made in the past to police regarding Savile, which did not result in any prosecution. Countless Britons who grew up watching Savile on TV's ""Top of the Pops"" and his children's program ""Jim'll Fix It"" have been left reeling by the slew of claims against him in the past month. The reputation of the British Broadcasting Corporation, for whom he worked, has also been tainted by the scandal amid questions over how his abuse went undetected, and its decision to drop a program investigating allegations him last year. How scandal has rocked BBC . The BBC, on whose premises some of the sexual assaults occurred, has said it is horrified by the revelations and has launched two independent inquiries. Savile died in October 2011 at age 84, soon after being treated in a hospital for pneumonia. His death was followed by a series of glowing tributes, including two BBC Christmas specials.","""This wasn't the man we knew and loved,"" family says of abuse revelations .

"The Late-1980s pop culture relic ""21 Jump Street"" was a primo specimen of a TV police procedural with a catchy hook: A team of fresh-faced cops work undercover as high school kids, reporting back to their tough/earnest boss at the address listed above. The hit series ran for four years, and was notably progressive in its willingness to incorporate newsmaking social issues, including AIDS, homophobia, and child abuse. But 25 years later, ""21 Jump Street"" the TV show is remembered primarily as the career kickstarter of Johnny Depp as a young actor with an obvious something. As it turns out, dim memories and a new generation of pop culture consumers work to the great advantage of ""21 Jump Street"" the movie: What this fast, cheeky, and very funny interpretation of the original premise sacrifices in teachable moments, it makes up for in intelligent giddiness. Shaped by the precocious comedic smarts of talent-on-a-roll Jonah Hill (who not only costars but also developed the story with Michael Bacall and is one of the executive producers), the movie morphs into an action comedy with a tonal complexity that marks it as a very contemporary creative project. It's part homage and part wink at the past. It jokes about high school but is also a sensitive sociological study of those crucial years. It bridges slapstick and action. It's quick-witted with its pop references. Oh, have you heard? Depp makes a delightful cameo appearance! On the surface, ""21 Jump Street"" follows the crime-fighting antics of odd-couple cop partners Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum). Their wonky dynamic is established in a perfectly placed opening flashback to 2005, when the two were real high school students -- Schmidt the klutzy, anxious nerd with a brain; Jenko the athletic, academically challenged coolio. Seven years later, when both police rookies are coincidentally assigned to an undercover--high schooler program, the duo are prepared to play out those same life scripts, until a mix-up alters fate. Schmidt is assigned a class schedule befitting a popular non-Einstein; Jenko is shuffled into advanced-placement chemistry. (''Ap-chemistry,'' he calls it, laboriously reading his course list.) Given a do-over, the two get to reexperience those less than wonder years. They get to work issues out. And by the way they get to bust a drug ring fronted by a smart and popular guy played with oddball charisma by Dave Franco. (The curiosity isn't that he's the brother of James Franco; it's that he's so interestingly weird. Okay, like his brother.) But that, as I say, is on the surface. Underneath, ""21 Jump Street"" is a riot of risks that pay off, the biggest of which might be handing Tatum funny business. And now for the revelation: The guy's got bust-out talents as a really funny, self-aware comic actor. With all appropriate salutes to the busy fellow's famous abs, and with full forgiveness for his participation in ""The Vow,"" I am feeling the Channing charm for the first time. And wow, those scenes where the smart actor, playing a ''dumb'' character who realizes he's not as dumb as he has always believed he is, fakes playing a dumb guy to mess with his smart partner's head are kind of perfect. Also, Tatum can sustain a great, I mean great, Dumb Face. Under the limber direction of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs""), and working from a screenplay by Bacall -- a script jammed, by the way, with so many oinky references to male reproductive equipment that I choose to believe the producers were rising to a dare -- Hill and Tatum play their Mutt-and-Jeff act against a supporting cast equally fast on their feet. A refresher viewing of any old ""Jump Street"" episode may sharpen your appreciation for the kind of earnest '80s-TV police captain that Ice Cube is tweaking in his funky turn as Schmidt and Jenko's boss, but the joke is equally welcome without the historical background. Explaining why he's assigning Schmidt and Jenko to shutting down the school drug ring after the death of one student, the captain tells it true: ''This kid is white, so people actually give a s---.''

"Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdish region has put tight restrictions on the border crossings used by Iraqis fleeing extremist militants and airstrikes in the northern city of Mosul on Saturday, raising fears of a humanitarian crisis as some desperate families may be left with nowhere to go. The Kurdish regional government's decision to first close the border crossings and then reopen them with restrictions came on the same day Iraq's security forces went on the offensive, carrying out airstrikes in Mosul and fighting to take back Tikrit from Islamic State of Iraq and Syria fighters, known as ISIS. The offensive appeared to mark a turn for Iraqi security forces, who were routed by ISIS fighters this month during a lighting advance that saw the al Qaeda offshoot seize large swaths of northern and western Iraq. State media and a local tribal leader reported that Iraqi forces had retaken the city of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. Sheikh Khamis al-Joubouri, a key tribal leader in Tikrit, told CNN that the Iraqi security forces entered the city supported by special forces and fighters from among the local tribes, and had gained control. He said ISIS fighters retreated in the direction of Kirkuk and Nineveh provinces. However, amid claim and counter-claim, a combatant told a CNN freelance reporter that ISIS fighters remained in control of Tikrit, but that there are fierce clashes in an area about 20 kilometers from the city center, toward Samarra. State-run Iraqiya TV reported that the Iraqi army and volunteer militia groups had cleared ISIS fighters from the city, having advanced on the city from four directions. Sabah Numan, a Counter Terrorism Unit spokesman, told the station that 120 militants had been killed and 20 vehicles destroyed in a large-scale operation that began Saturday morning. He did not provide any evidence of the claim, and CNN cannot independently confirm the reports. Sunni tribes wade into fight . Al-Joubouri said that the tribes were not aligned with the government or with ISIS and had stayed out of the fight until now. But, he said, when ISIS fighters who arrived in Tikrit robbed banks and carried out executions, as well as bringing the local economy to a standstill, the tribal leaders offered their help to the Iraqi security forces poised outside the city. The tribal leaders shared their knowledge of the city, including routes and known ISIS positions, he said. On Friday, Human Rights Watch reported that two mass graves believed to contain the bodies of Iraqi soldiers, police and civilians killed by ISIS and their militant allies had been discovered in Tikrit. Iraq's military spokesman, Maj. Gen. Qassim Atta, told a news briefing Saturday that Iraq's forces had regained the upper hand against ISIS and were now being supported by the tribes. ""We are advancing in all our fights,"" he said. As part of that fight, Iraqi security forces broke up a terror cell in the predominantly Sunni neighborhood of al-Amiriya in eastern Baghdad, the Ministry of Defense said. Nine people were arrested following a raid Friday on a Sunni mosque where the ministry claims security forces uncovered cache of weapons and bombs. After being interrogated, those detained admitted they planned to carry out attacks during the holy month of Ramadan, which begins Sunday, the ministry said. Additionally, Iraqi airstrikes targeted ISIS fighters building an earthen dam along the Euphrates River in Anbar province. Families flee . Iraq's air force carried out a series of airstrikes on Mosul, according to a senior Iraqi military official. The airstrikes targeted four locations inside Iraq's second-largest city, including ISIS headquarters, said Mazen al-Safaar, a traffic director in Mosul. But a doctor says the airstrikes also hit Mosul's administration building and the Old City's shopping district. At least seven civilians were killed and two were wounded in the airstrikes, according to Dr. Salaheldin al-Naimi, the director of the health administration. Hundreds of thousands fled when Mosul fell to ISIS  two and a half weeks ago. Many headed for Kurdish-controlled areas. Renewed conflict in the city, located about 420 kilometers (260 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad, forced many more to flee -- but it is unclear what options they have left. They were initially barred Saturday by the Kurdish fighting force -- known as the Peshmerga -- from entering the region through checkpoints. But that was lifted later in the day. The Peshmerga allowed families from Mosul to enter the Kurdish region, but only after undergoing security and background checks, two Kurdish security officials told CNN. They also must have a sponsor who lives in the region, they said. This move comes two days after a suicide car bomb struck a checkpoint manned by Kurdish forces in Kolchali, northeast of Mosul, according to Kurdish security forces in Irbil. At least one Kurdish security officer was killed and 15 other people were wounded in that incident, security forces said. Mass graves, executions . In addition to the alleged executions in Tikrit, reports continue to emerge of atrocities committed by both sides. Human Rights Watch, citing displaced residents and local activists and journalists, said Saturday that ISIS fighters kidnapped at least 40 Shiite Turkmen, dynamited four Shia places of worship, and ransacked homes and farms in two Shia villages just outside Mosul. The few Sunni villagers who remained in Guba and Shireekhan told those who fled that at least some of the kidnapped Turkmen had been killed, the rights group said. However, they had not seen bodies and could not give more information. ISIS destroyed seven Shia places of worship in the predominantly Shia Turkmen city of Tal Afar, about 30 miles west of Mosul, earlier in the week, Human Rights Watch added, citing local sources. ""The ISIS rampage is part of a long pattern of attack by armed Sunni extremists on Turkmen and other minorities,"" said Letta Tayler, senior terrorism and counterterrorism researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The killing, bombing, and pillaging threatens to displace entire communities, possibly forever."" On Friday, Amnesty International said it had gathered evidence pointing to a pattern of ""extrajudicial executions"" of Sunni detainees by government forces and Shiite militias in Tal Afar, Mosul and Baquba. ""Reports of multiple incidents where Sunni detainees have been killed in cold blood while in the custody of Iraqi forces are deeply alarming,"" said Donatella Rovera, Amnesty International's senior crisis response adviser, who is in northern Iraq. ""The killings suggest a worrying pattern of reprisal attacks against Sunnis in retaliation for ISIS."" Maps: Understand the crisis in Iraq . Who is the ISIS?

"""If you can't eliminate injustice, at least tell everyone about it."" The Persian proverb opens a book about the Iranian revolution by Shirin Ebadi, a human rights lawyer who became the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. But there could not be a more appropriate line to sum up Ebadi's own life. ""I am always being faithful to this motto,"" she said Friday from Minneapolis, in the midst of an eight-city speaking tour in the United States. ""And that's why I travel all the time and talk about it."" Forced from her homeland in 2009, after Tehran's crackdown on post-election protesters, Ebadi has lived in Britain and America. She said she has spent too many nights alone in hotel rooms, fearing for the lives of her husband and sister who were jailed and beaten. And, for her own safety. ""The government continuously threatens to kill me,"" she said. ""All of this is in order for me to stop what I am doing, and I am not going to stop."" She has taken up seemingly intractable cases in the Islamic republic's judiciary, defending intellectuals and dissidents and fighting for the rights of abused women and children. ''In my view, there is no difference between Islam and human rights,"" Ebadi said when she accepted her Nobel. ""Therefore, the religious ones should also welcome this award. The prize means you can be a Muslim and at the same time have human rights.'' The accolade did not sit well with Tehran's clerics. The Islamic republic banned her autobiography, confiscated her Nobel medal and diploma, froze her bank accounts and, closed down the Human Rights Defenders Center she founded. ""If they didn't fear me, they wouldn't do what they did,"" she said, ""because they don't want human rights violations to be brought to the attention of the world."" Ebadi remains hopeful that change can come to her homeland -- change that will restore equality for women that vanished after the 1979 revolution. Ebadi was in her early 30s then and Iran's first female judge. But overnight a new penal code reduced the worth of a woman's life to half that of a man's. In her 2006 memoir, ""Iran Awakenening,"" Ebadi wrote how the new laws affected everything in her life, from her job to her marriage. She was demoted to a secretary in the same court over which she once presided and in her relationship with her husband, Javed, she wrote: ""He stayed a person and I became chattel."" Now she looks at the anti-government uprisings in other Middle Eastern nations -- Egypt, Tunisia, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain -- and can't help but think it is too soon to judge the change. ""It's too early to speak about democracy,"" she said. ""They are still in turmoil in these countries. At this time, I don't see a progress in the status of women."" Ebadi fears that talk of Sharia, or Islamic law in Egypt, for instance, could hurtle women backwards in time, in the vein of Iran. ""The possibility is there,"" she said. ""We are concerned about the situation going backward for women."" She remains optimistic as ever that change can come to Iran. In her lifetime? It depends on how long she will live, joked the 64-year-old lawyer. ""Could be one week from now or 10 years."" She feels certain it will be accelerated if President Bashar al-Assad is ousted after months of bloody uprising in next-door Syria. He has been such a puppet of Iran, Ebadi said, that his demise will surely have repercussions. ""If Bashar al-Assad falls that will be the beginning of the fall the Iranian regime,"" she said. The situation within Iran has deteriorated in recent months, she said. A crackdown on the opposition in the months following the 2009 presidential election was followed by a recent series of harsh international measures designed to punish Tehran for its suspected nuclear program. The United States and its allies allege Iran is enriching uranium in order to build a bomb, a claim that Iran vehemently denies. The government also claims that most Iranians are supportive of their nation's nuclear drive and that, said Ebadi, is simply not true. For one, Iranians realize they are sitting on an earthquake fault and maintaining nuclear reactors could trigger a disaster like Fukushima in Japan. They also want to see an end to the sanctions that have made it increasingly hard for ordinary people to make ends meet. ""The situation of people is worsening,"" Ebadi said. ""The sanctions have impacted their lives. Inflation has gone up, the prices have gone up. ""I don't agree with sanctions that hurt people. I agree with sanctions that hurt the government."" Her message to Americans is clear: Never equate the people of Iran with the policies of its government. Ebadi has been separated from family in Iran since June 2009. But there's no trace of self-pity in her words. In the little down time she has, she likes to watch movies and read literature, though there is nothing light on her current list. She watched ""A Separation,"" the Iranian movie that took Western audiences into the home of a Tehran family and won the Oscar for best foreign film this year. Ebadi said she liked that the movie portrayed a woman's desire to leave bad conditions in Iran. And she is reading ""My Share,"" the first novel by Parinush Saniei that tells the story of an Iranian woman forced to marry a man who puts revolutionary ideals over his family responsibilities. The book is, perhaps, symbolic of many Iranian women and raison d'etre for Ebadi. In the years since her Nobel, many words have appeared in the same sentence as her name: pioneering, courageous, troublemaker, stubborn, activist and dissenter. If you ask Ebadi to describe herself, she offers only this before bidding farewell. ""I am a woman.""","Shirin Ebadi was Iran's first female judge but was stripped of her job after the revolution .
She warns that women may not gain from changes sweeping the Arab world .

"Billionaire Petro Poroshenko leads all candidates with 54% of the vote counted in Ukraine's presidential election, the Central Elections Commission reported Monday. He declared victory a day earlier, following preliminary exit polls that suggested he had secured a majority of the vote. His closest challenger, Yulia Tymoshenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister and the leader of the Batkivshchyna party, conceded the election after exit polls showed her with 13% of the vote, which matched Monday's early official tally. Poroshenko, a candy tycoon known as the ""Chocolate King,"" is also a seasoned politician known for his pro-European Union views. At a news conference in Kiev, he reiterated that European integration would be his priority. He added that in Sunday's vote, the President and the whole of Ukraine had changed. He said Russia needs to participate in bringing peace to eastern Ukraine. Voters were picking a successor to the ousted pro-Moscow President, Viktor Yanukovych, in a country torn apart by Russia's takeover of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and a bloody conflict involving pro-Russia factions. The unrest has centered in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where separatists have claimed independence after a disputed referendum this month -- and many there did not get to cast ballots Sunday. Reports from the region indicated that perhaps 75% of polling stations were closed, according to regional officials. More violence was reported overnight as authorities suspended flights at Donetsk airport after separatist gunmen stormed the terminal building, airport spokesman Dmitriy Kosinov said Monday. Ukraine military forces moved in by air and on the ground and gunbattles broke out. From the city, smoke could be seen rising from the airport. Intimidation in Eastern Ukraine . Increasing violence in the east has led the authorities in Kiev to accuse Russia, which they say is backing the armed separatists, of seeking to disrupt the vote. Russia denies having direct influence over the militants, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he will respect Ukrainians' choice in the election. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated that stance Monday during a news conference in Moscow. But Lavrov also said Russia hopes that the new president will put an end to all ""extremist activities"" in eastern Ukraine and end the anti-terrorist operation in the eastern regions. Amid heightened tensions, instances of intimidation in eastern Ukraine appeared widespread. A large separatist rally was held in a central Donetsk city square around lunchtime Sunday. The protesters, who chanted pro-Russia slogans as they were addressed by separatist leaders, were joined by a substantial number of militants on trucks, some firing guns into the air. On the back of some of the trucks were armed men who appeared to be Chechen. Two told a CNN team they were from the Chechen capital, Grozny, and one indicated that he was formerly a policemen in Chechnya and was in Donetsk to serve the Russian Federation. The men, who as Chechens are Russian citizens, said they were there as ""volunteers."" But if their accounts were true, their presence in Donetsk would appear to indicate some kind of acquiescence by the Russian government at the least. Residents of Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol saw new billboards on the streets Sunday urging them not to cast their ballots. The billboards were not at those locations the night before, residents said. Also in Mariupol, people talked on social media about being asked by local Russia supporters to boycott the election. The city is one of several where deadly clashes have erupted in recent weeks. The self-declared mayor of rebel stronghold Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, has said that anyone who tried to vote there would be arrested. Also, an Italian journalist was killed Saturday near the flashpoint town, the Italian Foreign Ministry announced Sunday. The man, named as Andrea Rocchelli, was killed along with a Russian citizen, the ministry said. Reports suggested there had been mortar fire in the Slovyansk area. International monitors . Besides the presidential race, candidates were also running in municipal elections in some cities. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe deployed 900 observers for the election, the largest such mission in its history. At a news conference Monday, OSCE Parliamentary President Joao Soares said the election was fair and represented the will of the Ukrainian people, despite major problems in two eastern provinces. He said the election sent a message to the pro-Russia militants: ""You cannot win by breaking the rules."" Oleksandr Turchynov, Ukraine's acting President, called the polls open and transparent. ""The voting was free, without artificial restrictions and administrative pressure,"" Turchynov said in a statement. U.S. President Barack Obama congratulated Ukrainians for casting their ballots Sunday and criticized Russia-backed separatists, whom he accused of trying to block voting. ""Despite provocations and violence, millions of Ukrainians went to the polls throughout the country, and even in parts of eastern Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist groups sought to disenfranchise entire regions, some courageous Ukrainians still were able to cast their ballots,"" he said in a written statement. ""We commend the resolve of all those who participated, as well as the efforts of the Ukrainian government to conduct these elections in the face of those threats."" But Russia's Lavrov offered a different view Monday, saying that not all candidates were given an equal opportunity to present themselves to the nation and campaign properly. He said many even faced threats to their lives, and others were assaulted. Ukraine's 'Chocolate King' aims for top job . Opinion: Free elections good for Ukraine, but could be bad for Putin .

"Anti-government protesters in Thailand can consider this round of resistance a success, after getting Sunday's national elections delayed in the Bangkok district of Laksi. National security chief Paradorn Pattanathabutr told CNN that Laksi postponed balloting for approximately 87,000 voters because demonstrators were blocking the administration office where the ballot boxes are kept. The make-up voting date is yet to be determined. Laksi, a district of mixed pro- and anti-government sentiment, witnessed violent protests on Saturday, when gunfire erupted during anti-government protests, witnesses said. At least seven people were wounded, Erawan Medical Centre said. The violence came amid high tensions a day ahead of elections. Witnesses saw at least eight gunmen emerge from the ranks of the anti-government protests and open fire for about 30 minutes toward police and pro-government demonstrators. It was not clear whether anyone fired back. Of those injured, one remains in the intensive care unit, the medical center said. In addition, a local journalist was injured by a firecracker hurled by someone in the crowd, according to witnesses. Anti-government demonstrators say they will keep up protests and attempt to shut down Thailand's capital city during elections. They have been campaigning for months against Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, fueling unrest that previously left 10 people dead and hundreds more wounded. Yingluck called the elections in December in a bid to ease mounting tensions on the streets of Bangkok. But the demonstrators and the main opposition party with which they're affiliated have already rejected the vote. Yingluck's party is expected to win comfortably. Her brother Thaksin Shinawatra is a business tycoon, who became Prime Minister before being overthrown in a military coup.  He has since lived in exile, but his opponents accuse him of dominating politics from afar, including through Yingluck. Lead-up to gunfire . Before the gunfire broke out, protesters attempted to foil elections by interfering with preparations, CNN's Saima Mohsin reported from Bangkok. Some of them camped out at a center that is providing ballot boxes for the election and blocked police from entering it to inspect the boxes, a necessary measure before voting may proceed. Police initially were able to coax them away, but afterward, more protesters from both groups converged on the spot, the Laksi intersection, a major traffic spot in the capital. Gunshots rang out and people ducked. Rapid gunfire continued, mixed in with the sound of fireworks. Gun smoke filled the air. ""I could taste it; I could smell it,"" Mohsin said. There were few security forces present to respond. Around 20 police officers and a dozen soldiers crouched behind their vehicles to avoid flying bullets. Authorities have said that 10,000 security personnel are on standby. No further violence erupted overnight, but protesters were able to keep authorities from reaching the ballot boxes on Sunday. Political battles . The political elbowing goes beyond Bangkok's streets and has spread dirty politics into many provinces, where some constituents have no candidates to represent them in the election, Mohsin reported. They were blocked from registering to run for election. Many voters are being blocked from participating in the vote. The lasting political instability has created fears of chaos in Thailand, which was shaken by severe bout of violence four years ago. The concerns have already hurt the country's lucrative tourist industry and undermined investment in one of Southeast Asia's main economies.","Anti-government protesters successfully delayed elections in Bangkok's Laksi district .

"I wasn't always in love with the idea of fitness or being healthy. But it's something that became extremely important after losing one of my best friends, Scott Pollock, in December 2005, and realizing that life was way too short to just be thrown away on junk food and little activity; that wasn't living. When Scott passed, I made a promise to him and myself that I would do everything in my power to keep his dreams of making a difference for people with different abilities in the world of fitness alive. I wasn't quite sure how I was going to do it, but I knew that if I wanted to I would have to get myself in shape first and the rest would soon fall into place. In my freshman year at Lynn University, as I was looking through pictures posted on Facebook, I began to see a person I didn't like, and I knew something needed to be done to change it. By the time I started my sophomore year and was acclimated with the campus, I had made a great deal of friends and was doing well in school, but something was missing. I was going to the gym about three times a week doing as much as I could on my own, but it wasn't always easy to get in and out of machines or to know which exercises would be beneficial. I told my family what I was trying to do and they agreed to support me so I could work with a personal trainer. After meeting with a few different people, I met with Frank Manusky. That's when the transformation began. From my first meeting with Frank, I knew this was going to be successful. He had worked with people of the adaptive population before and had told me that anything was possible, as long I wanted it to be. About four months into our training, I came to Frank with what seemed to be a crazy idea:  After watching athletes compete in hand cycles one weekend I wanted to complete a marathon. Without hesitation, he said, ""OK, let's get to work then."" I finished my first hand-cycling marathon on December 4, 2011, with a time of 4:34:14.  When I looked up at that clock, more exhausted than I have ever been, something inside of me said, ""I have to do this again, but next time do it better."" That was the day my competitive spirit was brought to life. I competed in several races after that and loved every second of it, but I wanted to get stronger.  This is when I first heard about CrossFit. I walked into my first CrossFit box (gym) on May 3, 2012. I saw people who had just finished a workout lying flat on their backs, breathing heavily, looking like they had just come out of a war zone. I thought to myself, ""I want to do this and look like that someday."" That first day I spent close to an hour with Scott Lefferts, owner of CrossFit Hard Core Boca Raton. We talked about everything from what I had done before, to what I thought I could do, to what I thought at the time was physically impossible. Scott accepted me for everything I was and together we took it workout by workout. Six months into my experience, I saw undeniable changes. I was stronger, I was moving faster, and all I could seem to think or talk about was CrossFit. It's now been a year. I have worked with several different coaches and have had the opportunity to travel the country showing people how an adaptive athlete with CP gets it done. If you would have told me that in a year I would be lifting weights over my head, flipping tires and coaching this sport, I wouldn't have believed you, but this is my reality.  As an adaptive athlete and coach, I see and do things differently than most, but that doesn't make my desire to be great any weaker. In CrossFit when the term ""RX'd"" is used it means an athlete has done something as prescribed.  My weights and rep scheme may never be RX, but my effort always will be. If this last year has taught me anything, it's to embrace every challenge that comes your way because you never know when that challenge is going to turn into great opportunity.","Stephanie Hammerman began getting in shape after a friend's death .

"Syrian government forces seized control Wednesday of the strategically important border city of Qusayr, which had been the site of nearly seven weeks of fighting. State-run TV credited an offensive ""that led to the annihilation of a number of terrorists,"" the government's term for rebels. ""Our heroic armed forces are always determined to confront any aggression that our beloved homeland may face in the future,"" an anchor on Syrian state television said. The Syrian opposition acknowledged the report. ""Yes, dear brethren, this is a battle that we lost, but the war is not over yet,"" said the Homs Revolution News, which is associated with the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition activist network. One dissident group said Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese Shiite militia backed by Iran and the Syrian government, was instrumental in the siege's success. ""Hezbollah fighters took control of Al-Qusayr city after the regime forces covered their night attack with heavy bombing ... and continued into the morning,"" the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Eleven of the regime's security forces were killed and 25 others were injured in the Qusayr fighting overnight and on Wednesday, the Observatory group said. There were also reports of deaths among Hezbollah fighters Wednesday morning. The Syrian Network for Human Rights reported that more than 1,000 civilians in Qusayr were injured, almost 600 of them unable to walk. Many are trapped in narrow areas near the city, the network said. France: Sarin gas used in Syria . The government's capture of Qusayr came on the day that U.S., Russian and U.N. officials met in Switzerland to plan an international conference on the Syrian crisis. After Wednesday's meeting, the United Nations' special representative for Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, told reporters that the conference wouldn't happen in June as previously expected but could take place in July. The loss of what had been a rebel stronghold near the Lebanese border represents a blow to rebels' efforts to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and may portend heightened sectarian tensions. That echoes what rebels have been predicting for weeks: that a government takeover of Qusayr could lead to a new level of sectarian warfare between Sunnis -- who dominate Syria's population -- and Shiites and Alawites. Al-Assad's family, which has ruled Syria for 42 years, belongs to the Alawite sect. ""If Qusayr falls at the hands of the regime, there is no way to stop the acts of reprisal, and that retribution will (reach) another level,"" rebel spokesman Col. Abdul Hamid Zakaria told the Al-Arabiya TV network last month. ""This will lead to Shiite and Alawite towns to be completely wiped out of the map."" Indeed, video appeared Wednesday on YouTube showing what the poster said were Free Syrian Army fighters launching rockets at two Shiite villages, inhabited mostly by Assad loyalists, in an overwhelmingly Sunni region in the northeastern province of Aleppo. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, rockets fell on the mostly Alawite neighborhoods of Ekrema and Zahraa in the city of Homs, the Syrian Observatory group said. Last week, Brig. Gen. Salim Idris of the rebel Free Syrian Army asked the public to ""excuse (the) FSA"" for any retaliation. ""We are being subjected to genocide conducted by Hezbollah,"" he told Al Arabiya. France has said that Hezbollah sent as many as 4,000 fighters to Syria to bolster al-Assad's forces. The Lebanese militants ""produced major results,"" particularly in the battle for Qusayr, said Fawaz Gerges, director of the Middle East Center at the London School of Economics. The Obama administration condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" the takeover of Qusayr, press secretary Jay Carney said. ""It is clear that the regime could not contest the opposition's control of Qusayr on its own and is depending upon (Hezbollah) and Iran to do its work for it in Qusayr,"" Carney said in a statement. Hezbollah's ""involvement in Syria and the Syrian regime's cross border attack today on Arsal represent blatant violations of Lebanon's sovereignty and a deliberate threat to Lebanese stability.  The United States firmly supports Lebanon's security, stability and sovereignty,"" Carney added. Lebanon's leaders call for a policy of disassociation from the Syrian conflict, Carney said. Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Elaraby condemned any form of foreign intervention in Syria, especially Hezbollah, but he expressed frustration. ""You could say the Arab League has not succeeded to stop the conflict. But also the United Nations -- with all its powers -- could not do anything!"" he said. ""The international community has not succeeded in stopping the violence or the humanitarian catastrophe which the Syrian people are experiencing."" War-torn Syria issues travel warning against Turkey . Qusayr's importance . Qusayr's location has made it a crucial battleground for regime and rebel forces. The government's control of the city helps secure a critical link between the capital, Damascus, and Alawite strongholds such as Tartus and Latakia, said Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. He said the rebels' loss will likely spark a rise in cross-border attacks on Shiite towns in eastern Lebanon and possible attacks on Hezbollah forces farther inside the country. Idris of the FSA  has said that the Syrian rebels will hunt Hezbollah down in Lebanon and ""in hell, if they have to,"" over the Shiite militia intervention in Syria. Mia Farrow: Don't let Syria's children die . Nasrallah's deputy, Sheikh Nabil Qaouk, responded by saying that his party can protect its Shiite supporters in Lebanon and they ""will punish the murderers who attack Lebanon's sovereignty."" A Syrian helicopter fired five missiles into Kherbet Dawoud, near the Lebanese town of Arsal, which is largely Sunni and has served as a refuge for people who fled Qusayr; no casualties were reported, the Lebanese Army Information Directorate said Wednesday. Lebanon's National News Agency reported that clashes were occurring in Tripoli between residents of rival areas of the city -- the Bab-al-Tibbaneh neighborhood, which is dominated by Sunnis, and the adjacent Jabal Mohsen neighborhood, which is dominated by Alawites. ""The Syrian conflict is no longer an internal struggle between Assad and the internal opposition,"" Gerges said. ""It's an open-ended war by proxy -- Iran, Hezbollah and Syria, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, plus Russia and the United States."" Shortly after the Syrian regime seized Qusayr, Iran sent congratulations. No Geneva conference in June . Brahami, after  Wednesday's meeting with U.S. and Russian officials in Geneva, told reporters that ""it will not be possible to hold the conference (on Syria) in June."" The talks, slated to be held in Geneva, would have brought  together officials from Assad's regime and members of the Syrian opposition to discuss a political solution. The three parties organizing the talks -- the United States, Russia and the United Nations -- have agreed the conference will be sponsored by the U.N. secretary general and will meet again in Geneva on June 25 to discuss details, Brahami said. Officials will look at ""windows of opportunities to hold the conference as soon as possible, hopefully in July,"" he said. Al-Assad told Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV on May 30 that his government agreed in principle to participate in the talks. Syria's main rebel umbrella group, the National Coalition for Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces, has demanded al-Assad step aside in order for it to take part in the talks. Meanwhile, sarin gas has been used several times in the Syrian civil war, including at least once by the Assad regime, France's foreign minister said Tuesday, citing results from test samples in France's possession. The evidence of chemical weapons in Syria poses a real problem for Russia's continued support of the Assad regime, a diplomatic source said. Some in the international community have been surprised by the U.S. reaction that evidence needs to be expanded and corroborated, but a U.N. commission for chemicals could be called upon to go to Syria to take its own samples and conduct an investigation, the official diplomatic source said. Stark choice for residents . More than 70,000 Syrians -- most of them civilians -- have been killed in the two-year conflict, according to the United Nations. In Qusayr alone, about 1,500 people are reported to be in need of medical care. Some residents escaped the violence by digging holes and hiding in them, refugees told U.N. staff. Most of those who fled Qusayr to Lebanon are women and children. ""Those we have spoken to say it is unsafe to flee with men, who are at heightened risk of being arrested or killed at checkpoints along the way,"" said Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the U.N.'s refugee agency. Fleming said one woman told the agency that Qusayr residents face a stark choice: ""You leave and risk being killed ... or you stay and face a certainty of being killed."" But thousands of residents remain in Qusayr,  their futures unknown. 'Open-ended' Syrian conflict draws in region .","More than 1,000 civilians are injured; many remain trapped, group says .

"Dresden, Germany (CNN)Anti-Islam protesters gathered Monday in the German city of Dresden, with some carrying banners with the names of those killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. It is the 12th march in Dresden called by the protest group Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the West, or PEGIDA, since October. Dresden police say the number of people attending these rallies has increased from an estimated 350 protesters on October 20 to 18,000 on January 5 and 25,000 people on Monday. The PEGIDA movement emerged last year in the eastern German city. About 2% of Dresden's inhabitants are foreigners. On its Facebook page, PEGIDA says citizens should ""wake from their slumber"" and recognize the ""danger in the Islamic ideology."" ""Stop the radical Salfists' Islamization,"" it urges. ""As a society, we should give people the chance to integrate, but we should not allow ourselves to be Islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy!"" The group claims to have supporters in more than 30 German cities and 18 countries in Europe. A PEGIDA group in Norway has also called for demonstrators to gather outside the Town Hall in the capital, Oslo, to show support for the French and demonstrate opposition to what it calls the ""Islamification of Norway."" In Dresden, organizers earlier announced that Monday's rally would commemorate the victims of last week's attacks in Paris. Critics, however, say that protesters are taking advantage of the attacks to attract supporters and incite hatred against refugees and foreigners. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas called upon the organizers to cancel the protests. In an interview with German newspaper Bild, he said, ""The victims do not deserve to be abused by such agitators."" The head of Germany's CSU party, Horst Seehofer, told ARD Television: ""I want to request those responsible ... that they cancel their demonstrations for the foreseeable future, especially at a time when the whole world is shocked about the events in Paris."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has repeatedly voiced her disagreement with the PEGIDA movement in recent weeks, made similar demands. A representative for PEGIDA in Dresden told CNN that the march would not be canceled. ""They are putting us on the same level as radical extremists,"" said Kathrin Oertel, one of PEGIDA's leaders. ""We have the right to express our condolences to the victims of Friday's terror attack."" Oertel added: ""We all think we are being neglected by our politicians."" She later told CNN that she does not want to be perceived as racist. ""Muslims are only a tiny fraction of the population, but they're so dominant in pushing for their demands that German culture is being pushed back,"" said Oertel. ""We want to live peacefully with all immigrants here in Germany, but we as Germans demand that they assimilate themselves into our culture and that they live in accordance with our laws and don't build up parallel societies."" At a planned protest in nearby Leipzig -- organized by a group similar to PEGIDA -- protest organizers had agreed to a city ban on showing anti-Mohammed cartoons, but city authorities revoked their ban Monday following criticism that it limited free speech. According to German wire service Deutsche Presse-Agentur, Leipzig city officials originally made the decision to ensure that the protests would remain peaceful. ""After Paris, one must assume that Mohammed cartoons are meant to be a provocation,"" DPA quoted a city representative before the ban was revoked. French cartoonists reacted to the German PEGIDA marches by publishing caricatures in which they ridiculed the protesters. On Saturday, 35,000 people assembled in front of Dresden's landmark site, the Frauenkirche, to advocate for tolerance. Local politicians emphasized that they were open for a dialogue with PEGIDA protesters. Counterprotests against anti-Islam demonstrators were planned in Hanover, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, Munich, Dresden, Leipzig and Berlin. On its Facebook page, the leftist group Dresden Nazifrei (Dresden free of Nazis) called upon its supporters to protest against the anti-Muslim demonstrators. The Dresden Nazifrei organizers wrote: ""It is your decision to decide whether there will only be protests in hearing range and sight distance or whether we will try to do more."" Large numbers of police officers will try to keep anti-Muslim protesters and their opponents from clashing, with a heavier presence because of the Paris attacks. ""We have slightly increased the number of police officers involved,"" a police representative told CNN on Monday, refusing to give specific numbers ahead of the demonstration. Later, police said that around 1,600 officers were involved on Monday. Some 8,700 people protested against PEGIDA in Dresden, according to police. A poll by German newspaper Der Spiegel in December found that 34% of respondents believed their country was becoming ""increasingly Islamicized."" German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told CNN's Christiane Amanpour last week that he was ""worried by this tendency"" but that the significance of the protests should not be overestimated. ""It's new, it's concerning, but we should not be dominated by PEGIDA when we discuss our political agenda,"" he said. On the other hand, he said protesters posed some questions that needed to be answered. ""They ask: 'Is there an end of asylum seekers, how dangerous is Islam for our society, what about the fight against IS (ISIS) -- can this be successful?' These critical questions have to be faced, have to be answered,"" de Maziere said. But he said he did not fear a rise of ugly nationalism in Germany again. ""I'm confident we are strong,"" he said. ""We learned our lessons from the Nazi years, and you can see it's very interesting that the organizations of PEGIDA; they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross --  this makes me more skeptical but they know where the taboos are in Germany so I don't see a renewal of the NPD (the far-right National Democratic Party) -- it's less than in other European countries. And we are very well aware of it, and we will fight against every tendency."" Joerg Forbrig, a European analyst with the German Marshall Fund of the United States, told CNN that the PEGIDA movement had really only gained traction in the Dresden area, where its ideas had fallen on ""particularly fertile soil."" ""These protests are not so much fueled by fear of Islam and fear of Islamist attacks, but by frustration at the cost of reunification -- about the way they are being integrated and represented since the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" Forbrig said. Dresden already had a well-established network of right-wing extremists before PEGIDA's emergence, he said. ""It's more a case of East Germans not entirely feeling at home in Germany,"" Forbrig said. ""There is a feeling of second-class citizenship, and in order to be heard, many East Germans take to radical measures."" The movement was ""basically a plea for more attention more than anything else,"" he said. ""I think this movement has peaked -- I don't think that there is much more of a local and regional potential that this movement can exploit."" Forbrig stressed that there was a substantial counterprotest movement, with those protesters outnumbering PEGIDA supporters last week in Cologne by 10-to-1. In fact, across Germany on Monday, more than 80,000 people protested against PEGIDA, according to the news agency DPA. In her New Year's speech, Merkel addressed the issue of xenophobia, saying such demonstrations encourage the exclusion of people because of their skin color or religion. Merkel urged people not to attend such rallies, where people have ""hatred in their hearts,"" she said. ""We know the value of unity in our country,"" she said. ""It is the foundation of our success."" CNN's Susannah Cullinane also contributed to this report.","Police estimate that some 25,000 people attended the march .

"Covert drone strikes are one of President Obama's key national security policies. He has already authorized 283 strikes in Pakistan, six times more than the number during President George W. Bush's eight years in office. As a result, the number of estimated deaths from the Obama administration's drone strikes is more than four times what it was during the Bush administration -- somewhere between 1,494 and 2,618. Under Obama, the drone campaign, which during the Bush administration had put emphasis on killing significant members of al Qaeda, has undergone a quiet and unheralded shift to focus increasingly on killing Taliban foot soldiers. Obama revealed: The man, the president . To the extent that the targets of drone attacks can be ascertained, under Bush, al Qaeda members accounted for 25% of all drone targets compared to 40% for Taliban targets. Under Obama, only 8% of targets were al Qaeda compared to just over 50% for Taliban targets. And while under Bush, about a third of all drone strikes killed a militant leader, compared to less than 13% since President Obama took office, according to an analysis of thousands of credible media reports about the strikes undertaken by the New America Foundation. While Bush sought to decapitate the leadership ranks of al Qaeda, Obama seems to be aiming also to collapse the entire network of allied groups, such as the Pakistani Taliban. As a result, so-called ""signature strikes"" have become a hallmark of Obama's drone war. These are drone attacks based on patterns of merely suspicious activity by a group of men, rather than the identification of a particular individual militant. These have decimated the ranks of low-level combatants, killing somewhere between 1,332 to 2,326 reported militants. In April 2010, a militant told a New York Times reporter, ""It seems they really want to kill everyone, not just the leaders."" Obama's drone campaign is quite controversial: Some claim that a substantial number of civilians are killed in the attacks, while U.S. government officials assert that the civilian casualty rate is now zero. In Pakistan, the program is deeply unpopular and the Pakistani parliament voted in April to end any authorization for the program, a vote that the United States government has simply ignored. The New America Foundation analysis of the drone campaign in Pakistan found that: . -- The civilian casualty rate has been dropping sharply since 2008. The number of civilians, plus ""unknowns,"" those individuals whose precise status could not be determined from media reports, reported killed by drones in Pakistan during Obama's tenure in office were 11% of fatalities. So far in 2012 it is close to 2%. Under President Bush it was 33%. -- Conversely, the percentage of militants killed has been rising over the life of the drone program. The number of militants reported killed by drone strikes is 89% of the fatalities under Obama compared to 67% under Bush. -- Some of these attacks were designed to help Pakistani interests. In the first eight months of 2009, the U.S. carried out 19 drone strikes targeting affiliates of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, who had carried out an extensive campaign of attacks against Pakistani police officers, soldiers and politicians. Mehsud was eventually killed by a CIA drone strike. -- Since it began in 2004, the drone campaign has killed 49 militant leaders whose deaths have been confirmed by at least two credible news sources. While this represents a significant blow to the militant chain of command, these 49 deaths account for only 2% of all drone-related fatalities. Osama bin Laden himself recognized the devastation that the drones were inflicting on his organization, writing a lengthy memo about the issue in October 2010 that was later recovered in the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where he was killed by a team of U.S. Navy SEALs. In the memo to a lieutenant, bin Laden advised that his men leave the Pakistani tribal regions where the drone strikes have been overwhelmingly concentrated and head to a remote part of Afghanistan and he also suggested that his son Hamza decamp for the tiny, rich Persian Gulf kingdom of Qatar. Buzz ramps up over SEAL's bin Laden book . The year 2010 marked the most intense point of the Obama drone campaign, with a record 122 strikes. This combined with the May 2011 raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, and the killing of at least 24 Pakistani soldiers in a NATO air strike in November severely damaged the relationship between the United States and Pakistan, and resulted in the eviction of CIA-controlled drones from Shamsi air base in Baluchistan in southwestern Pakistan. At the same time, Cameron Munter, then-U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, was urging that there be more judicious targeting of the drone strikes as well as increased consultation with the Pakistanis about them. In the past two years, there has also been increased congressional oversight of the program. The chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, explained in a May letter to the Los Angeles Times that ""Committee staff has held 28 monthly in-depth oversight meetings to review strike records and question every aspect of the program including legality, effectiveness, precision, foreign policy implications and the care taken to minimize noncombatant casualties."" Some combination of pushback from the State Department, increased congressional oversight, the closure of the CIA drone base in Pakistan and, perhaps, a declining number of targets in the tribal regions and a greater desire to heed Pakistani sensitivities about drone attacks has led to a sharp fall in the number of strikes since 2010. The number of drone strikes in 2011 fell by 40% from the record number of strikes in 2010. So far this year, the number of strikes has dropped by a further 25%. This is a welcome development. If the price of the drone campaign that increasingly kills only low-level Taliban is alienating 180 million Pakistanis -- that is too high a price to pay. While the drone campaign in Pakistan may be on the wane, it is amping up against the al Qaeda affiliate in Yemen. This year alone, Obama has authorized around 30 drone strikes in Yemen, while Bush only launched one drone attack there during his two terms in office. Small wonder that as Obama prepares to address the Democratic Party convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, he continues to enjoy a considerable advantage over Mitt Romney on national security. A Reuters poll in August found Obama leading Romney by a comfortable 12  percentage points on national security, which is traditionally regarded as a Republican strength.

"In order to understand the turbulent world of Thai politics, you have to start with one name: Thaksin Shinawatra. The former prime minister has dominated the country's political scene for more than a decade despite going into exile after his ouster in a 2006 coup. Back in 2010, deadly clashes took place between security forces and Thaksin supporters who had occupied central Bangkok. They were demanding his return. Now, his sister is in power and she recently tried to pass an amnesty law that could have allowed his return. The attempt failed, but it provided fuel for the current protests shaking the capital. Here's a quick primer to make sense of it all. 1. Who is Thaksin? He's a deeply polarizing figure -- a billionaire telecommunications mogul who built his political power on policies popular with Thailand's rural villagers. His success ruffled a lot of feathers among the country's established elites, and critics accused him of corruption and autocratic rule. He was prime minister between 2001 and 2006, when the military deposed him in a bloodless coup. 2. What happened in 2010? Thaksin's ouster spurred the protest movement that developed over the years into the widespread ""red shirt"" demonstrations that occupied upscale parts of Bangkok in 2010. By that stage, the movement had broadened to represent other issues, including resentment at the military's involvement in politics and economic inequality. The crackdown by security forces on the red shirts resulted in clashes that left around 90 people dead. It has been described as the worst civil violence in Thailand's history, and the country remains severely scarred by the experience. 3. Could the current protests lead to a repeat? The situation is different this time. Those protesting are opponents of Thaksin rather than his supporters. His sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is now prime minister. Her government is under pressure after widespread anger over its recent failed attempt to pass a bill that could have granted amnesty to Thaksin and others. Although the public has generally moved on from the conflict over the amnesty bill, the opposition Democrat Party is trying to use the issue to bring down Yingluck's government, says Paul Quaglia, director of the Bangkok-based risk assessment firm PQA Associates. ""The government is facing probably a countdown until it will have to dissolve and hold new elections,"" Quaglia says. ""But it doesn't look like it's a replay of 2010 when we're going to see violence in the streets and an extended takeover of central Bangkok."" 4. What has Thaksin been up to? He has been living in exile in a number of different places, most recently Dubai, while continuing to play an active role in Thai politics. He briefly returned to Thailand in 2008. Later that year, he was convicted by a Thai court of corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison over a controversial land deal. Courts have also frozen billions of dollars of his assets, but he is believed to still have a great deal of money held elsewhere. He's also stayed heavily involved in Thai politics over the years, communicating with supporters via social media and video messages. With his younger sister in power since 2011, his influence remains strong. Critics say Yingluck is Thaksin's puppet, but she insists she has always been independent. 5. What is happening this week? After weeks of demonstrations, thousands of protesters have gathered around government buildings in central Bangkok, occupying some of them for varying periods of time. Yingluck has expanded the area in and around Bangkok covered by an internal security law that gives police extra powers to disband protesters. In parliament, the Prime Minister is facing a ""no confidence"" motion against her. And police have issued an arrest warrant against protest leader, Suthep Thaugsuban. For most of Bangkok, business as usual despite protests . 6. What's at stake for the region? The demonstrations are bringing instability once again to Thailand, a key regional economy and popular tourist destination. The protests are centered on Bangkok, a vital transportation hub, especially for air travel. So far, the protests are concentrated in specific parts of the city. More than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in Bangkok. 7. What do the demonstrators want? Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister under the previous Democrat-led government, has said the demonstrations ""will not stop until Thaksin's regime is wiped out."" Such an aim seems ambitious. Yingluck's government was democratically elected and her Pheu Thai party retains support in its core areas. The current protests have echoes of 2008 when demonstrators opposed to a pro-Thaksin government occupied Bangkok's main airport and government offices. 8. Where are the protesters getting their support from? Opposition to Thaksin and Yingluck is strongest among the urban elites and middle class. That means the capital. ""Bangkok is the ground zero for anti-Thaksin protest movements,"" Quaglia says. ""The rest of the country, other than southern Thailand, is either in his camp or sort of politically neutral."" That's why the recent demonstrations have been concentrated in the streets of the capital. 9. What's the government's support base? Thaksin's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast of Thailand. The government's botched amnesty move may have hurt its standing in those areas, but not fatally. ""Despite the pictures of thousands of people in the street that doesn't necessarily mean the government will go -- or if it does go, that it will lose the next election,"" Quaglia says. 10. What is likely to happen next? Questions remain over the ability of Yingluck's government to maintain order in the capital and weather the heavy political pressure in Parliament. Some observers are concerned that government supporters, tens of thousands of whom rallied in Bangkok on Sunday, could clash with opposition demonstrators. Yingluck has said authorities would ""absolutely not use violence"" to disperse the demonstrators. Even if Yingluck survives the ""no confidence"" motion against her, the situation appears unlikely to calm down soon. ""We're going to see political instability here for some time,"" Quaglia says.","At the heart of the unrest is the polarizing figure of Thaksin Shinawatra .

"The man accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz pleaded not guilty Wednesday to two counts of murder and one count of kidnapping in the iconic missing child case that has gripped New York City and the nation for more than three decades. Pedro Hernandez was indicted last month by a grand jury after he confessed in May to killing the child in 1979. His attorney said his client had falsely confessed. Hernandez's next court appearance is scheduled for January 30. Police said Hernandez confessed to killing Etan, who disappeared on his way to a New York school bus stop, after passing by the bodega where Hernandez once worked. Hernandez -- who was a stock clerk in Lower Manhattan in May of 1979 -- admitted that he choked the boy after luring him into the basement of the grocery store, police said. He allegedly told authorities that he threw away the boy's body in a garbage bag, though the remains were never found. Etan disappeared on May 25, roughly a month before Hernandez left New York to resume living at his mother's South Jersey home, according to family members and police. Defense attorney Harvey Fishbein has claimed Hernandez was repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia, and that he has ""an IQ in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range.""","Pedro Hernandez's attorney has said his client falsely confessed to the child's murder .

"(CNN) -- Father Theodore Heck, believed to be the oldest Benedictine monk in the world, died Wednesday at the age of 108, his abbey in Indiana announced. Born in Iowa in 1901, Heck was less than a month shy of celebrating his 80th anniversary as a priest. Father Theodore Heck remained active in daily life at Saint Meinrad until recently. Heck was a monk at Saint Meinrad Archabbey in southern Indiana for 86 years, Archabbot Justin DuVall said. His main calling was as a teacher, DuVall said, adding that Heck had taught ""thousands"" of students in his career. ""Up until recently, his memory was excellent; He knew where those priests were and what they were doing,"" DuVall said. And Heck continued learning throughout his own life, said the archabbot, who knew Heck for 40 years. ""Every year, he would take up a subject and read about it,"" DuVall said. ""When he was 99, he decided he should learn Spanish, and when he was 100, he took up the computer."" The monk remained active in the life of the abbey until recently, DuVall said. ""Even up to a year or so ago, Father Theodore participated in all the public prayer with us four times a day. He sang in the choir. When he was still active teaching, he would have spent much his day in the classroom."" Heck sought out opportunities to teach and to minister, his longtime colleague said. ""For many years in the summers, he went to Iowa to teach at an extension of the Catholic University, in the '40s and '50s, so when he was not here, he was still teaching,"" DuVall said. ""When he was 70, he became a pastor at a nearby parish. He would drive on the weekends to lead services and hear confessions,"" DuVall recalled. ""He did that until he was 87."" Heck ""revolutionized"" the way monks were educated at his seminary, DuVall said. ""Back in the 1930s, he went away as a graduate student and did his graduate work. He established the pattern where our monks began to get doctorates, not only from Catholic universities, but Purdue and Indiana University,"" DuVall explained. Heck came from long-lived stock: His siblings lived into their 90s, according to DuVall. ""He once told me he was astonished to have lived this long,"" the abbot said. ""But he saw everything in his life as a gift from God, and he accepted it."" The Office of the Dead will be prayed for Heck on Friday evening, Saint Meinrad announced. He will be buried in the Archabbey Cemetery on Saturday morning after a funeral Mass. Saint Meinrad, which dates to 1854, operates a graduate school of theology and has more than a score of its monks in parish work, chaplaincies and diocesan assignments. The Benedictine community at Saint Meinrad consists of about 100 men who dedicate their lives to prayer and work, according to the archabbey's Web site.","Father Theodore Heck was just shy of 80th anniversary as a priest .

"The scene was horrifying. Gunmen stalked through the school, shooting children as they cowered under benches and booby-trapping buildings with homemade explosives. When the siege finally ended, Pakistan was left reeling and the world wondering: Who would do such a thing? And what do they hope to achieve? The identity of the group behind the massacre at the army-run school in Peshawar is no mystery. The Pakistan Taliban -- who have long conducted an insurgency against the Pakistani government as they seek to overthrow the authorities and bring in Sharia law -- were quick to claim the terror attack. And they said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by the Pakistani military. Earlier this year, the government held tentative peace talks with the Pakistan Taliban -- formally known as Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP -- but it suspended them after two brazen attacks around Pakistan's largest airport in Karachi in June. Since then, Pakistan's military has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out TTP and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. The campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people. The Pakistan Taliban are also against Western-style education for children and the employment of women. Most famously, their militants shot schoolgirl education activist Malala Yousafzai in the head in 2012 as she traveled on a school bus. She survived to receive a Nobel Peace Prize last week. The school attacked Tuesday, which educates both boys and girls in separate classes, is the main school for the children of army personnel in Peshawar and employs both male and female teachers -- making it a desirable target for the terrorists. 'Terrorist outfit' The Pakistan Taliban want to stop the authorities from interfering in the tribal areas but also have an extremist ideological agenda, said Sajjan Gohel, international security director for the Asia Pacific Foundation think tank. The outlawed Islamist group is closely affiliated with the Taliban in Afghanistan and its members swear allegiance to the Afghan group's leader, Mullah Omar. It also has close ideological ties with al Qaeda. ""This is a terrorist outfit, it's not just a group that is seeking control of the tribal area,"" Gohel said. And like their bedfellows, the Pakistan Taliban are vehemently opposed to the U.S. military presence in the region. In addition to vowing to force U.S. troops out of Afghanistan, they claimed responsibility for the failed bombing in 2010 in New York's Times Square and vowed revenge operations against the United States for the killing of Osama bin Laden. In 2012, a TTP leader endorsed ""external"" -- meaning overseas -- operations by the group against American and British targets. And its late leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, killed last year in a U.S. drone strike, once vowed to send suicide bombers to the United States. Outrage 'off the charts' So will the Pakistan Taliban get what they want from the massacre in Peshawar? CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen believes it could backfire spectacularly on them. The group may have gained a lot of publicity, he said, but this attack on schoolchildren is seen as beyond the pale, and the ripples will be felt through Pakistani politics. ""If the intent was to get the Pakistani military or the Pakistani government to back down, that is just not going to happen,"" he said. ""I think the level of outrage in Pakistan right now is off the charts."" While many Pakistanis have in the past either supported the Pakistan Taliban or backed peace negotiations with them, that attitude is now likely to harden, said Bergen. Previous attempts to forge a peace with the group in 2004, 2005 and 2008 fell apart, he said, and the chance of future talks seems slim. ""The history of doing deals with religious zealots is not good,"" he said. Splits and defections . The restive provinces of South Waziristan, North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, along the mountainous border with Afghanistan, have long been a stronghold for the Pakistan Taliban and other militant groups, including the Islamist Haqqani movement. And as the Pakistani military tries to clamp down on the TTP, it hits back with attacks. Last year, choir members and children attending Sunday school were among 81 people killed in a suicide bombing at the Protestant All Saints Church of Pakistan. A splinter group of the Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility for the church attack, blaming the U.S. program of drone strikes in tribal areas of the country. ""Their primary target is the Pakistani state and its military,"" Raza Rumi of the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani think tank, said of the TTP after the Karachi attacks in June. ""It resents the fact that (Pakistan) has an alliance with the West, and it wants Sharia to be imposed in Pakistan."" In recent months, the group has become increasingly fragmented -- meaning the formation of more militant factions -- and has suffered defections to ISIS. At the same time, the Pakistani army has stepped up its military campaign in North Waziristan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 'They are interested in killing' Ayesha Siddiqua, a Pakistani analyst and author of ""Military Inc.,"" told CNN that Pakistan needs to rethink its approach to militant groups and whether any form of militancy is tolerated in the country. ""Unless that happens, this bloodshed will continue,"" she said. However, even the latest attack is unlikely to prompt a major shift in policy, she argued, with some political elements within Pakistan continuing to be sympathetic to the TTP regardless. With this attack, Siddiqua said, the Pakistan Taliban are trying to ""achieve as much bloodshed and as much horror and terror"" as they can, arguing it's revenge for their own families being killed. ""Very clearly, their objective is maximum damage, as many people as they can kill. They are not interested in hostages, they are interested in killing,"" she said. ""Since they cannot access hard targets so easily, they are going after softer targets."" Analyst Gohel said this shift in approach by the Pakistan Taliban was extremely disturbing. ""To target a school is another dynamic altogether, and especially one that is supported by the military,"" he said. ""It's a very clear statement of intent. They have been battling the military for a long time, now they are trying to visualize the terrorism effectively, as we are seeing with those graphic images that are being beamed around the world."" Security vacuum . Obstacles to tackling the Pakistan Taliban lie in the country's complex politics, its troubled relationship with Afghanistan, and differences over foreign policy between Pakistan's government and its military, said Gohel. The Pakistan Taliban and their counterparts in Afghanistan move back and forth across the porous border, sharing resources, cooperating and jointly plotting attacks, said Gohel. ""There's no way of trying to challenge that unless you dismantle the infrastructure. And this is where the problem lies in Pakistan,"" he said. ""The military will not dismantle the infrastructure for the Afghan Taliban, which allows the Pakistan Taliban to continue to exist."" And, he warned, the withdrawal of Western combat troops from Afghanistan by the end of this year is likely only to heighten the problem, as the Taliban step in to fill the resulting security vacuum. ""The Taliban have been biding their opportunity, waiting to carry out plots and activities, to try and regain a foothold especially in southern Afghanistan,"" he said. ""They will be cooperating with the Pakistan Taliban. There is this paradox that is creating this problem. You have the Pakistani military sponsoring and supporting the Afghan Taliban, (while) fighting the Pakistan Taliban, but both Talibans cooperate because they have that Pashtun ethnic factor that unites them."" Recent Pakistani offensives had been believed to have weakened the group, but it is clearly still all too capable of a shocking attack.","Analyst: Pakistan Taliban have an ideological agenda, are opposed to Western education .

"The director of the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system and two others have been placed on administrative leave amid claims of a secret waiting list and claims that 40-plus veterans died waiting for care. These allegations have been exposed in a series of exclusive reports by the CNN Investigations unit. The announcement Thursday by U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki came a day after officials at the Phoenix VA denied in interviews with CNN the existence of such a list, only to be called liars hours later by the top VA physician who first appeared on CNN and brought the allegations to light. ""We believe it is important to allow an independent, objective review to proceed,"" Shinseki said in a written statement. ""... These allegations, if true, are absolutely unacceptable and if the Inspector General's investigation substantiates these claims, swift and appropriate action will be taken."" Those placed on leave, according to the statement, are Phoenix VA Director Sharon Helman, Associate Director Lance Robinson and a third employee, who was not identified by name. Retired VA doctor: There's a secret wait list in Phoenix . Shinseki's office denied repeated requests by CNN over six months to interview the secretary about the allegations. Sources told CNN the managers at the VA concocted an elaborate scheme to cover up long wait times there. The sources said more than 1,400 veterans were placed on the purported secret list and that documents were shredded to hide the evidence.  According to sources, at least 40 U.S veterans died waiting for care at the facility, many of whom were on the list. These issues raised in CNN's exclusive investigation have quickly drawn attention in Washington. On Monday, President Barack Obama said he called on Shineski to investigate what has happened in Phoenix. In recent days, numerous members of Congress have called for hearings on the Phoenix VA, and at least three members of Congress have publicly called for Helman's resignation. Tears, angry accusations mark hearing on delayed VA care . But in an interview with CNN on Tuesday, Helman and her chief of staff, Dr. Darren Deering, denied any secret effort to cover up or hide wait times. ""We have never instructed our staff to create a secret list, to maintain a secret list, to shred a secret list -- that has never come from our office as far as instruction to our staff,"" said Deering. ""It's never come from me,"" added Helman. Dr. Sam Foote, a 24-year VA physician and clinic director, recently retired and went public with the details of the list, went on the air publicly for the first time with CNN one week ago. He denounced Helman's claim. ""They started this secret list in February of 2013,"" Foote said. ""At some time, they changed over from paper to electronic, in early summer, maybe approximately June or July. And transferred names over to the electronic waiting list. And she [Helman] was called on an ethics consult evaluation about that -- it's written down, documented in July."" That documentation includes e-mails from July 2013, which were reported by CNN, that show top management, including Helman, were well-aware about the actual wait times, knew about the off-the-books list and even defended its use to her staff. When directly asked earlier this week about whether evidence of wait times was shredded and whether the secret list existed, Deering stated: . ""I think there is some confusion amongst our staff. When we came on as a leadership team in 2012, the practice at that time was that they would schedule new veterans who would were coming in for care way out into the future. Sometimes a year, sometimes 14 months. And that was the appointment that that veteran was given. ""As we started to tackle our challenges of access, we implemented a tool that the VA uses nationally called the electronic wait list. And what that tool is it's an electronic waiting list that allows us to everyday look to see who is waiting for an appointment. ""So what we did is we took those patients that were scheduled way out into the future, and we put them on this national tool that the VA uses so that we could track them. What that did is, rather than having an appointment 14 months out into the future, it put them on this EWL electronic waiting list, so that when we had an appointment that came open, so if a veteran called next week and canceled their appointment, we could pull a veteran off this list and get them into that slot. ""So it actually improved the probability of these veterans getting an appointment sooner. And in that transition time, I think there was some confusion among staff, I think there were some folks who did not understand that, and I think that's where these allegations are coming from.""

"Washington (CNN) -- For the past year the FBI has been actively working a new lead in the unsolved case involving skyjacker D.B. Cooper. But the information concerns a new suspect who has been dead for more than a decade, an FBI spokesman told CNN on Monday. In November 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper hijacked a plane and succeeded in getting authorities to give him $200,000 and parachutes in return for letting passengers off the plane. The man then asked to be flown to Mexico but jumped out of the back of Northwest Orient Flight 305 somewhere between Seattle and Reno, Nevada. Authorities have never been able to prove whether the man survived or what his actual identity was. A retired law enforcement officer brought a tip to the FBI about a year ago, said Fred Gutt, a spokesman for the FBI's Seattle Field Office. The retired officer had a contact who thought he or she knew the skyjacker's identity but added the suspect was dead. But that didn't mark the end of the trail. ""Family members of the deceased have cooperated with us and given us access to items which belonged to the deceased,"" Gutt said. The FBI's lab started looking for evidence that might prove the dead person was the man who skyjacked Flight 305. The FBI wanted to retrieve items with fingerprints belonging to the new suspect. Gutt said the FBI knows Cooper had handled certain papers, including his plane ticket, and touched plane seats, but many fingerprints were found on those items. Through the years the FBI managed to identify some fingerprints but not all of them. Gutt would not discuss the suspect's identity, the evidence retrieved or what the lab results were. But, Gutt said, ""so far there's not a lot that's inconsistent"" with the suspect matching D.B. Cooper. Gutt added the FBI has not been able to prove the person is the mysterious skyjacker and the law enforcement agency still does not know for certain whether Cooper survived his leap out of the plane almost four decades ago during bad weather. Although the FBI has been looking into the new lead for a year, it was first revealed during an interview with The Telegraph of London in advance of the 40th anniversary of the unsolved case this coming November. On the afternoon of November 24, 1971, Cooper -- the ""D.B."" apparently was a myth created by the press, according to the FBI -- approached the ticket counter of Northwest Orient airlines in Portland, Oregon, and used cash to buy a one-way ticket to Seattle. ""Cooper was a quiet man who appeared to be in his mid-forties, wearing a business suit with a black tie and white shirt,"" the FBI said in a summary of the case on its website. ""He ordered a drink -- bourbon and soda -- while the flight was waiting to take off."" But later, he handed a flight attendant a note saying he had a bomb in his briefcase and asking her to sit beside him. She did as she was told, and the man opened a ""cheap attache case"" and showed her a mass of wires and red-colored sticks and demanded that she write down what he told her. She wrote a note demanding four parachutes and $200,000 in $20 bills and walked it up to the captain, the FBI said. When the flight landed in Seattle, the hijacker exchanged the flight's 36 passengers for the money and parachutes, the FBI said, keeping several crew members on board. The flight took off again after he ordered it to fly to Mexico City. But Cooper jumped out of the plane. ""The pilots landed safely, but Cooper had disappeared into the night and his ultimate fate remains a mystery to this day,"" the FBI said. One clue came in 1980, when a young boy found a rotting package full of $20 bills -- $5,800 in all -- that matched the serial numbers of the ransom money. The FBI returned most of the bills to the boy, named Brian Ingram, and Ingram has since auctioned some of them, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported. The ""D.B."" stemmed from confusion in a United Press International newsroom, the Post-Intelligencer said. ""We've run down thousands of leads and considered all sorts of scenarios,"" the FBI said in 2007. ""And amateur sleuths have put forward plenty of their own theories. Yet the case remains unsolved. Would we still like to get our man? Absolutely."" The FBI appealed for help from the public, releasing pictures of Cooper's black J.C. Penney tie -- which he removed before jumping and which later provided authorities with a DNA sample -- along with some of the found money. The agency reminded the public that Cooper was no expert skydiver. ""We originally thought Cooper was an experienced jumper, perhaps even a paratrooper,"" said Special Agent Larry Carr in 2007. ""We concluded after a few years this was simply not true. No experienced parachutist would have jumped in the pitch-black night, in the rain, with a 200-mile-an-hour wind in his face, wearing loafers and a trench coat. It was simply too risky. He also missed that his reserve chute was only for training and had been sewn shut -- something a skilled skydiver would have checked."" Agents also believe Cooper had no help on the ground. If he had had an accomplice, he would have needed to coordinate closely with the flight crew and jump at just the right moment. ""But Cooper simply said, 'Fly to Mexico,' and he had no idea where he was when he jumped,"" authorities said. ""There was also no visibility of the ground due to cloud cover at 5,000 feet."" Two flight attendants who were in contact with Cooper gave nearly identical descriptions of him, as did those who encountered him on the ground. He was said to be between 5 foot 10 and 6 feet tall, weighing 170 to 180 pounds with brown eyes. Carr said in 2007 he believed it was unlikely Cooper survived the jump. ""Diving into the wilderness without a plan, without the right equipment, in such terrible conditions, he probably never even got his chute open,"" he said. By the five-year anniversary of the hijacking, the FBI said it had considered more than 800 suspects and eliminated all but two dozen from consideration. Several high-profile suspects have been ruled out over the years. Duane Weber, who claimed on his deathbed to be Cooper, was eliminated by DNA testing, the FBI said. Another man, Kenneth Christiansen, did not match the physical description and was a skilled paratrooper. A third, Richard McCoy, who died in 1974, also did not match the description and was at home the day after the hijacking having Thanksgiving dinner with his family in Utah -- ""an unlikely scenario unless he had help,"" the agency said. Fred Gutt said while the FBI understands there is great public interest in this long-unsolved case ""it's a fairly low-priority case for the FBI"" as it pursues new investigations involving cases like missing children that have a current impact on public safety. Even so, Gutt said the FBI always follows up on any new tips on the case. On Sunday, another FBI spokesperson, Ayn Sandalo Dietrich, told CNN the information on the new suspect is not expected to be ""a big break in the investigation.""

"A power outage in Minneapolis disrupted air travelers throughout the United States on Tuesday as computerized reservations systems for several carriers went down. The outage occurred at Navitaire, a reservation technology company with around 60 airlines as customers. It was not clear exactly how many airlines were affected or how many flights had been canceled because of reservations and ticketing issues, but the major North American airlines affected Tuesday night appeared to be AirTran, Spirit and Toronto, Canada-based Porter Airlines. In a statement to CNN, Navitaire said the power failure occurred at a ""third party's facility,"" and that the company was working to restore service as soon as possible. CNN iReporter Joe Garcia was an AirTran passenger who was stranded in Memphis, Tennessee, on Tuesday night. ""We were just given hotel rooms for the night. It's a security issue,"" Garcia said. ""They claim it's a lightning strike that knocked their system down nationwide. They couldn't issue new boarding passes or clear anyone. Flights left delayed but only with people that had preprinted boarding passes. They won't make any guarantees that the system will be up tomorrow."" Here is what some of the airlines that use Navitaire told CNN Tuesday evening: . AirTran: ""A power outage earlier today at our vendor's data facility that manages our airport computer systems is causing us to process customers manually at the airport for AirTran's operations,"" said Chris Mainz, spokesman for AirTran parent company Southwest Airlines. ""The power at the facility has been restored, and we are told that the AirTran system should be fully restored. ... We sincerely apologize to all of our customers impacted by this outage.  Of course, we'll do our best to minimize delays and accommodate impacted customers as quickly as possible.""

"(CNN) -- Viva Chile. Late last winter, Chile was shaken first by an 8.8-magnitude earthquake and, later, looting and military police hitting the streets. In August, the San Jose mine collapsed, threatening the lives of 33 men trapped a half-mile underground and further testing the upstart South American country's psyche weeks ahead of its bicentennial commemoration. But this week, Chile came alive -- in the eyes of its citizens, as well as the world. Copiapo, which could have been the site of mass mourning had the miners' rescue effort gone awry, instead became home to a patriotic festival. The strong national pride was omnipresent: from the red, white and blue Chilean flags that permeated the rescue site to the chants that rang out as the miners rose to the surface. It was clear, too, many miles away -- whether it was the hugs and tears of joy among the throngs watching the scene on a flickering big-screen TV set up in a Santiago city square, the champagne corks popping at the Chilean embassy in Washington, or countless bite-sized conversations in the vast reaches of cyberspace where the Chilean miners were a top trending discussion on Twitter. ""What emotion! What happiness! What pride to be Chilean!"" wrote Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, on his own Twitter page. Like many emerging countries, Chile has not been without its challenges. It continues to emerge from the shadows of dictator Augusto Pinochet's rule from 1974 to 1990, when up to 30,000 people vanished or were killed because of their political beliefs. Economic disparities and political divisions still exist, with the global recession having a real impact in this Andean nation. Yet, its past and recent challenges notwithstanding, Chile has also emerged as a model in Latin America and the world, given its solid economic base and fervent democracy. ""Chile is ... a country with really strong institutions,"" said Peter DeShazo, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""And it's economy has done really well."" While it could have been a calamity, the San Jose mine rescue effort instead turned into a celebration, not just of the miners' survival but also the nation's collective ability (with help from international friends) to safely extricate them. Thus, this week's rescue effort gave Chileans a good reason and made-for-TV stage to show off their longstanding patriot fervor to the world. ""Chileans, in general, have a strong sense of national identity,"" said Susan Purcell, director of the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. ""And with this episode, it's like they did everything right."" Since Pinochet, Chile has experienced significant economic growth and steady inroads combating corruption and poverty. But until now, Chile rarely had been front-and-center in most everyday discussions of Latin America, which are more likely to be dominated by Brazil's booming development, communist Cuba, Colombia's civil war and Venezuela under leftist leader Hugo Chavez. Thus, while international policymakers and business leaders have seen (and, in some cases, been party to) its development, the mine collapse and rescue effort were many people's first sustained exposure to Chile, its people and its potential. ""Chile should be held up as a model, but it often isn't,"" said Purcell. ""I don't know if (the rescue) changes the image of Chile, or it creates an image of Chile."" Led by President Pinera, the rescue effort and Chile were very much intertwined. Government officials frequently appeared before TV cameras, Chilean flags abounded and patriotic chants rang out regularly. The loudest and emotional could be heard when the miners emerged: ""Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le! Los mineros de Chile!"" That was no accident, said Nara Milanich, a professor at New York's Barnard College specializing in Chile. Pinera, who had seen his popularity drop since taking office last March, took control of the situation and played to the cameras, she said. Camp Hope sprung up, as a temporary home to miners' families as well as the scores of global media who descended on the scene. ""They are so conscious that the world is watching,"" said Milanich. ""This is as genuinely Chilean as Baywatch is genuinely American. This is a TV show."" Still, for all the production set-ups and political posturing, Milanich said that Chileans' joy was true and widely felt. While the release came at a critical time for Chileans, who wrestled with ""soul-searching"" after the quake and during the bicentennial commemoration, it reflected citizens' deep-rooted sense that Chile is worth celebrating. And in Latin America -- especially given Chile's rivalry with Andean neighbors Bolivia and Peru dating back to the 19th century War of the Pacific -- such self-congratulation among Chileans is almost expected and sometimes resented. ""I don't think Chileans suffer from an inferiority complex,"" said Kristen Sorensen, a professor at Bentley University in Massachusetts. ""In some sense, they have a superiority complex.""","Experts say that Chileans have long boasted a strong sense of national identity .
The miners' rescue effort is described as a made-for-TV production showcasing Chilean excellence and pride .

"Even as investigators say they need more access to bodies and wreckage from last week's Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crash in eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian rebels that control the territory say they're tiring of having any probe there, a spokesman for a monitoring group said Friday. With the site still not secure eight days after the crash, and victims' remains still lying with debris, nations such as Netherlands are pressing to send their own police and investigators to the scene. Various negotiations are under way. But rebels controlling the area -- the same rebels that Ukraine and the United States accuse of downing the plane and killing the 298 people aboard -- hinted to an international monitoring group that they've nearly had enough, even with the small amount of investigators they've already let in. ""We were given the indication ... that their patience is almost wearing out,"" said Michael Bociurkiw, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which has had a small team touring the site for days. ""They're saying maybe another week and then they don't know what would happen."" That's not likely to please a number of nations that say a proper investigation still hasn't begun, including Netherlands, whose officials say they're negotiating with the Ukrainian government to send 40 Dutch military police to search for more bodies. The rebels ""are encouraging us to pass the message up the command chain, if you will, that a group of experts, perhaps 25 or 30, should get here soon to oversee ... movement of the debris,"" Bociurkiw, who was with the OSCE team in eastern Ukraine, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday . Monitor: Personal effects suddenly appearing at wreck sites . Accusations over who was responsible for bringing down the passenger jet, which was headed from Amsterdam to Malaysia, continue to be traded by the Ukrainian government, pro-Russian rebels and officials in Moscow and Washington. Flight 17 was downed on July 17 by a suspected surface-to-air missile over eastern Ukraine, where groups of pro-Russian rebels are fighting Ukrainian government forces. The rebels have denied allegations from Ukraine and the West that they brought down the commercial airliner using equipment supplied by Russia. On Friday, the OSCE team again toured the crash site, returning to a recently discovered section of fuselage from the plane. This time -- unlike Thursday -- victims' passports and other documentation were there, Bociurkiw said. ""We can't draw any conclusions. But for sure, those were not there the last time we were there,"" he said. ""Perhaps someone placed it there. We don't know."" No Ukrainian government or international force has secured the site, raising concerns about tampering or pilfering. The OSCE team on Friday toured with a few experts from Australia and, for the first time, some forensic experts from Netherlands. CNN's Phil Black has reported from the area that  there appears to be no ongoing effort to find and retrieve victims' bodies. Though many corpses have been recovered already, Bociurkiw said the group still has seen human remains among the debris several times this week. 378 body bags processed so far . As of Friday afternoon, 378 body bags containing remains of Flight 17 victims have been processed in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where discovered remains have been sent, Sergey Bochkovskiy, the head of Ukraine's State Emergency Services, told reporters there. Officials say it's unclear how many individual victims' remains are contained in the bags. Dutch citizens comprised 193 of the 298 people aboard the downed flight. By Friday, 198 coffins had either already arrived in Netherlands or were on their way Friday,  Bochkovskiy said. Another 38 coffins were expected to arrive in Netherlands on Saturday, he said. Officials accused the rebels who control the crash area of preventing recovery workers Thursday from searching for more bodies. On Friday, Jan Tuinder, head of the Dutch police team that his country wants to send to Ukraine, said he hoped better access could be negotiated between the rebels and the Ukrainian government. ""I just want to get in,"" Tuinder said. Netherlands is stepping up efforts to ensure that the remains of all the crash victims return home from Ukraine, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told CNN on Thursday. ""We will increase our effort to bring home all the victims of this disaster,"" he told CNN's Cooper. ""We will send into the crash site a large number of people from the Netherlands -- experts, forensic experts, people from the police who are trained to deal with this type of work."" He said he hoped to have about 50 personnel at the site by Sunday. Dutch families keep airport vigil . At Netherlands' Eindhoven airport Friday, Silene Fredriksz and other victims' relatives held vigil for a third day, watching the coffins come in but not knowing whether they contained their loved ones. ""When they're here on the Dutch grounds, I (will) feel safe,"" Fredriksz told CNN's ""New Day"" on Friday. ""After all the horrible things I've seen that happened there in the Ukraine fields, it's a big, big nightmare for us, but ... when everybody's here, I feel safe."" Fredriksz's son, Bryce, was on the flight with his girlfriend, Daisy Oehlers, bound for a Bali vacation. Fredriksz said she'll be at the airport, watching the military cargo planes come in and the coffins come out, until they stop coming. As the coffins have been brought off, they have been received in solemn ceremonies. ""It's very emotional, but also beautiful that they're finally home,"" she said. The bodies' arrival in Netherlands contrasts starkly with their initial treatment at the crash site, where they were left exposed to the elements for days, and in some cases, according to Dutch officials, stripped of personal belongings. The transfer of the remains to Netherlands that were brought to Kharkiv, Ukraine, is expected to be completed by Saturday, Rutte said Thursday. The work to identify them, by at least 200 international experts, is likely to take weeks or even months. Australia sending police . Australia, which had 27 of its citizens on board the plane, says it has 90 police officers in Europe and is sending another 100 with a view to their joining a planned international deployment to provide security at the crash site. ""Australia is close to finalizing an agreement with Ukraine for the deployment of Australian police, some of whom could be armed,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at a news conference Friday. ""What we want to do is claim our dead and bring them home,"" he said. Netherlands has said it is sending 40 unarmed military police to Ukraine, and they're expected to arrive Saturday. European Union increases pressure on Russia . Earlier Friday, the European Union stepped up pressure against Russians and others it blames for fomenting the crisis in Ukraine, banning visas and freezing the assets of 15 more people and 18 more companies and organizations. The EU's move aims to punish those supporting the monthslong pro-Russian rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Details about who was sanctioned Friday weren't immediately available. But the European Union and the United States previously have targeted Russians and Ukrainians they say have assisted the rebellion and Russia's annexation in March of the Ukrainian Black Sea peninsula of Crimea -- such as Vladimir Shamanov, commander of Russian airborne troops. The move brings the total number of EU sanctions in the Ukraine crisis to 87, and the number of entities to 20. The European Union on Friday also widened its criteria for future sanctions, saying it would now look to punish not only those who are aiding the rebellion, but also those benefiting ""from Russian decision makers responsible"" for it.

"A troubled Michigan nuclear power plant cited for safety violations has been taken off line for maintenance and refueling, the plant's owner said Monday. Palisades Power Plant, a 39-year-old facility located near Kalamazoo, has been under increased scrutiny from inspectors after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission cited the plant for three safety violations. The plant is currently owned and operated by Entergy Corporation. Officials are bringing in 1,165 additional workers to complete the scheduled maintenance, according to Mark Savage, a spokesman for the plant. Repairs include replacing 64 fuel assemblies, inspecting the reactor vessel head, replacing five control rod drive seals and inspecting steam generators, moister separators and heat exchangers. Entergy also said it plans to rebuild the main feed pump seals. Violations at the plant included a September 25, 2011, incident in which half of the control room indicators were lost because of an electrical fault ""caused by personnel at the site,"" according to the NRC. A special inspection ""determined the plant failed to have adequate work procedures for the electrical panel maintenance work to ensure the job was done successfully,"" the NRC report said. Additionally, the NRC cited Palisades and Entergy for an October 2010 incident in which an operator left his post unattended in the nuclear reactor's control room without permission. The Palisades spokesman declined to provide a timetable for when the work will be completed. ""Due to competitive reasons, we do not discuss outage duration or planned time to return to service,"" Savage said. Entergy operates nine other nuclear power plants in the United States. The news of a shutdown at Palisades came just days after Friday's report that California's San Onofre nuclear plant would remain shut down indefinitely until the source of problems with two of its generators can be determined.","The Palisades Power Plant was cited for safety violations .

"(CNN) -- A former Catholic bishop in Norway has admitted sexually abusing a minor 20 years ago, a spokesman for the Norwegian Catholic Church said Wednesday. Bishop Georg Mueller admitted to having sexually abused an altar boy but said there were no other victims, said church spokesman Andreas Dingstad. Mueller, 58, became a priest in 1978 and served as bishop of Trondheim, Norway, from 1997 to 2009. The abuse is said to have happened more than 20 years ago, when Mueller was a priest in Trondheim, Dingstad said. Allegations of sexual abuse by Catholic priests have spread across Europe, surfacing in countries including the Netherlands, France, Mexico, Italy, Ireland, the United States, Austria and Germany, home country of Pope Benedict XVI. Some have been critical of Catholic leaders including the pope, saying little action had been taken when he was a top Vatican official. Waves of victims have come forward, claiming they were victims of abuse by religious leaders and saying the church did little or nothing to stop it. In a rare move, a senior cardinal spoke Sunday before the pope's Easter Mass at the Vatican, saying the pontiff maintains the support of Catholics around the world ""who do not let themselves be influenced by the gossip."" Cardinal Angelo Sodano, former Vatican secretary of state and dean of the College of Cardinals, did not specifically mention the sexual abuse scandal, but his remarks clearly referred to criticism leveled at church leaders. The pope did not address the scandal in his Easter message. In a letter last month, he said he was ""truly sorry"" for the abuse suffered by victims at the hands of Catholic priests in Ireland.","Georg Mueller was bishop of Trondheim from 1997 to 2009 .

"(CNN) -- Two months before her death, former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto sent an e-mail to her U.S. adviser and longtime friend, saying that if she were killed, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf would bear some of the blame. Bhutto was assassinated after the campaign rally, seen here, Thursday. She cited his government's denial of her request for additional security measures after the October suicide bombing that targeted her upon returning to Pakistan from exile. ""Nothing will, God willing happen,"" she wrote to Mark Siegel, her U.S. spokesman, lobbyist and friend. ""Just wanted u to know if it does in addition to the names in my letter to Musharaf of Oct 16nth, I wld hold Musharaf responsible. I have been made to feel insecure by his minions and there is no way what is happening in terms of stopping me from taking private cars or using tinted windows or giving jammers or four police mobiles to cover all sides cld happen without him."" Bhutto was seeking to become prime minister for a third time when she was assassinated; her death comes exactly two weeks before Pakistan's January 8 parliamentary elections.  Watch Siegel describe her concern and the reaction of Pakistan's U.S. ambassador » . Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., Mahmud Ali Durrani, on Thursday insisted Musharraf's government provided the former prime minister with unprecedented security. He said that terrorists and extremists, who also have targeted Musharraf, were the only ones responsible for her death.  Watch a report on security provided to Bhutto » . Bhutto wrote the e-mail on October 26, eight days after at least 130 people were killed and hundreds more wounded in Karachi by the suicide bombing that occurred as Bhutto's motorcade passed. Siegel forwarded that e-mail to CNN's Wolf Blitzer, with instructions he not report on it unless Bhutto was killed. Just before returning to Pakistan after eight years of self-imposed exile, Bhutto told CNN she was aware of threats against her and said that some had come from people who hold ""high positions"" in Pakistan's government. She said she had written a letter to Musharraf about her fears, apparently the same letter she refers to in her e-mail to Siegel. In a speech, she listed four groups she believed posed the biggest threat to her and her cause -- the Taliban in Pakistan, the Taliban in Afghanistan, al Qaeda and a suicide team from Karachi that she did not describe. After the October bombing, she accused elements in the government and security services of trying to kill her and asked Musharraf for ""basic security,"" including vehicles with tinted windows and private guards in addition to police guards. Three United States senators repeated the request in a letter to Musharraf. Bhutto was concerned by the lack of security she had upon her arrival in Karachi and called the October 18 bombing ""very suspicious,"" Siegel said. He accused Pakistani authorities of not investigating the assassination attempt and of refusing Bhutto's request for Scotland Yard and the FBI to aid in the investigation. Bhutto and her husband had asked for jammers to impede the detonation of bombs; special vehicles with tinted windows; and four police vehicles to surround her at all times, Siegel said. ""She basically asked for all that was required for someone of the standing of a former prime minister,"" Siegel told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" ""All of that was denied to her. ... She got some police protection, but it was sporadic and erratic."" Bhutto was concerned the problem was worsening as the January elections neared, Siegel said. At the time of the October suicide bombing, Bhutto was riding in a truck from Karachi's airport to the tomb of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan. She had moved from the roof to inside the bulletproof, armed vehicle just moments before the blast and was unharmed. CNN's Dan Rivers, in Karachi to cover her return to Pakistan, remarked at the time that her security appeared to be loose, saying his crew was able to walk up to the side of her vehicle without being stopped by authorities. Durrani, Pakistan's ambassador to the U.S., insisted security surrounding Bhutto then was more than adequate. ""There were, I think, a sea of security people,"" he said. ""She was surrounded by police vehicles. And had it not been one of the police vehicles which took the blast in Karachi, unfortunately she would have died there. ""There was a bubble around her of security. The PPP [People's Party of Pakistan, Bhutto's party] insisted that they have their own private loyalists around. They were there too. And there were about 7,800 to 8,000 security people deployed just for that,"" Durrani said. ""That is more security than anybody deploys anywhere in the world."" ""She was moving almost in a sea of humanity,"" Durrani said. ""No system in the world can protect you against that."" Bhutto ""is not a security person,"" he said. ""She's a politician. I think the government of Pakistan provided her all the security that was necessary. You tell me -- the way she was hit, she would have been hit with tinted windows or without, or without the IED ... so it's just a blame game."" After the October attack, Bhutto said police offered to let her use a helicopter for the trip from the airport, but she told them she wanted to be near her people. She said she did not regret that decision. ""She believed in democracy, and she believed in speaking to the people,"" Siegel said. ""It's not reckless to go out and touch the people. Don't blame the victim for the crime. The person that was supposed to be protecting Benazir Bhutto and the other candidates was the government of Pakistan with the government of Pervez Musharraf."" Blitzer noted that Bhutto was shot Thursday while standing out of her vehicle's sunroof -- seen by some as a a reckless action after the October incident. Getty Images senior staff photographer John Moore, who was at the scene of her assassination, told CNN he was surprised at Bhutto's actions, considering the earlier suicide attempt. The rally was smaller than expected, he said, and the people he spoke with said they ""were just afraid to come out, for the simple reason that they all remembered what happened in Karachi."" Siegel grew emotional as he told Blitzer that Bhutto was ""the bravest person I ever knew. ... She knew that there were risks coming back, but those risks were important, she thought, for the fight for democracy.""

"George W. Bush is a proud new grandfather and fascinated by his unlikely new hobby: painting. But some things haven't changed a bit: the trademark smirk when he is amused, a squinty glare when he doesn't appreciate the question -- and a quick turn to humor when the conversation turns to ""legacy,"" including the scars of Iraq or the cloud of Katrina. ""History will ultimately judge  the decisions that were made  for Iraq and  I'm just not going to be around to see the final verdict,"" the two-term president told CNN in a wide-ranging interview. ""In other words, I'll be dead."" On Thursday, every living president will be on hand for the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas. One, of course, will be his father, George Herbert Walker Bush; the other three, Democrats -- Presidents Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. By the Numbers: Presidential libraries . The 43rd president said he has learned lessons from his predecessors about how to make a mark after leaving the White House. ""You learn that life doesn't end after you're president,"" Bush said. ""In other words, you're going a hundred miles an hour and, and, in my case, we woke up in Crawford and now it's going zero. And so the challenge is how to live life to its fullest. ""In my case, I've chosen to do so outside the limelight. On the other hand, I am confident that when this chapter of our life is finished, that we'll both be able to say that we've advanced  the cause of peace and freedom and -- and the human -- and helped improve the human condition."" Remembering 43: 'Bush tended to... follow strong people' In July, Bush visited Zambia and Botswana to promote a health initiative that focuses on cervical and breast cancer prevention and treatment. He also helped create the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which focuses on long-term economic reconstruction projects that create jobs and promote economic opportunity. Laura Bush said her husband rarely itches to add his voice to the daily political debate. The former president said he knows the library dedication will re-stir the debate about his presidency, and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history's verdict. But he predicted visitors would find it ""more objective"" than they might have imagined and he showed little interest in revisiting flash points like Iraq, Hurricane Katrina or the 2008 financial crisis. Or the scorn with which many look back at the Bush presidency. A glimpse at a White House before everything changed . ""You know, I'm  really not that concerned about  why people did what during my presidency."" Bush said. ""I'm more concerned about  being an effective person for the rest of my life. ""I know this, that  Laura and I gave  the presidency eight years of our life. We gave it our all. Made the best judgment calls I could. I didn't compromise my principles. And I'm a content man. And  I am excited about  what we're going to do here."" The library path is a quick reminder of how everything changed on a crisp September morning. One early exhibit is filled with children's books -- education reform was to be a major first term priority. Brazile: Bush came through on Katrina . Then, the dress Laura Bush wore to a state dinner on September 6, 2001, for then-Mexican President Vicente Fox.  Candidate Bush had promised a humble foreign policy, with a heavy focus on the Western Hemisphere. One step past images of that festive dinner takes you into the horror and carnage of September 11, including a twisted beam from the second tower of the World Trade Center and the bullhorn the president used during his now iconic visit to the rubble at ground zero a few days after the attacks. Given his heavy focus on terrorism as president, we began the conversation with his thoughts when he heard the news of the explosions at the Boston Marathon finish line. ""I was reminded that evil exists,"" Bush said. ""And that there are people in the world who are willing to kill innocent people to advance  a cause."" History's jury is still out on George W. Bush . The Decision Points Theater is a centerpiece of the library tour. Visitors can relive big Bush administration policy debates, and read and listen to some of the advice given to the president at the time. Then they can pick a course of action. Never known as one to second-guess himself, the former president conceded problems in administering the Iraq war but was adamant he believed history would embrace the decision to go to war. A Bush White House before everything changed . Asked if he is now convinced he launched the war with too small a U.S. military force, Bush said, ""There are some -- you know, tactics that  need to be revisited. On the other hand, the removal of Saddam Hussein  was the right decision. America is more secure. The Iraqi people have a chance to live in a free society."" He said he will take no offense if museum visitors come to a different conclusion. ""The museum  is a -- it does give people the opportunity to hear  the different points of view that  I got on these particular issues,"" he said. ""The purpose of which is not to try to defend the policy. The purpose of which is to try to show people what it's like to be the president. And how you make decisions."" Another exhibit includes former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice explaining enhanced interrogation tactics used against some suspected al Qaeda terrorists taken into U.S. custody. Stand back: Bush is 'busting stereotypes' Veterans of Bush administration policy battles might wonder why former Vice President Dick Cheney does not have that role in the library, given his strong support for the tougher interrogations, including waterboarding in a few cases. Cheney is attending the ceremonies, and while he has written and talked openly about differences with his former boss late in their White House years, President Bush brushed aside any talk of bad blood. ""No, it was never strained,"" Bush said. ""I think that's the mythology that we've escaped. In other words, there's a mythology in Washington."" Reminded of Cheney's recollections in his book, especially over the president's refusal to pardon longtime Cheney aide and friend Lewis ""Scooter"" Libby, the former president added this to the talk of tensions: . ""Not really. They were on Scooter Libby. Yeah, he didn't agree with that decision.  But I don't -- you know -- people ought to look at the total picture.  And we're friends then and friends now."" By the numbers: The Bush family . Other highlights of the interview: . On his debate just before Katrina hit about whether to overrule Louisiana's governor and send in federal troops: . CNN: People were telling you, ""Mr. President, maybe you need to declare an insurrection."" George Bush: Insurrection. Which would have been pretty difficult. Not pretty di -- very difficult.  Yeah, so I -- it just points out the dilemma. ... CNN: Do you wish in hindsight you had done it? George Bush: No, not really.  I'm -- you know, I get -- there's no telling how history would have recorded the situation had I declared an insurrection.  I can tell you the decibel level would have risen even louder than it was. Hopefully people will go to the Decision Points Theater and say, ""Wow, I didn't understand that.""  Or, ""I now understand it better."" On whether he feels personal redemption now that many Republican leaders are pushing immigration policies that mirror his failed proposals: . George Bush: No, I don't. I don't really view it as  redemption, I view it as smart. And logical. And I was real proud of my little brother being out there, you know -- pushing the issue. Because he understands the issue well. Eventually these problems will get solved.  And a  president just has to understand that not every issue  gets solved  during his presidency. But he can contribute  to the ultimate solution. On whether that brother, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, should seek the 2016 GOP nomination: . George Bush: Well, big Jeb, you know, he's got a decision to make.  And if I could make it for him, it'd be, ""run,"" but I can't.  And I don't know what he's going to do. He'd be a great candidate and a great president. On plans for a third trip to Africa this summer: . George Bush: I think it's important to set priorities in life.  I always said that  one of the principles that was important to me was human life. We went to Africa and saw  people dying, needlessly dying. And there's nothing more important, I think, and Laura thinks as well, to help somebody live. And so  during my presidency I convinced Congress to spend taxpayers' money to save lives not only  from HIV but as well from malaria. And it worked. And we want to continue that type of work with cervical cancer. Finally, on his post-presidential hobby of painting: . Laura Bush: Who would have thunk it? George was looking for a pastime, actually, when he gave up smoking cigars.  So he read Churchill's book, ""Painting As a Pastime"" and he's actually very good.  He's a very good painter. George Bush: I relax.  I see colors differently.  I am, I guess, tapping a part of the brain that, you know, certainly never used when I was a teenager. And I get the satisfaction out of completing a project.  And  I paint people's pets.  And I love to give them their pet as a gift. And I readily concede the signature is more valuable than the painting.","CNN's John King gets a private interview with George and Laura Bush .

"(CNN) -- Iran's atomic energy chief said Wednesday that no deal has been struck to export uranium for enrichment abroad, a demand of Western nations worried that Tehran plans to use its program to build nuclear weapons. ""The discussions are still being conducted, and we will inform the nation of any final agreements,"" said Ali Akbar Salehi, director of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, according to the state-run Iranian Labour News Agency. Asked what countries in addition to France and Brazil were under consideration, he cited an Asian country, but would not specify which one. Salehi's remarks came a day after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told state-run Press TV that Iran would have ""no problem"" turning over most of its low-enriched uranium to the West for further enrichment. Iranian diplomats had initially accepted the idea, which was proposed by the West, but then rejected a plan put forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the atomic watchdog of the United Nations. ""In our opinion, there are no issues with the exchange"" of 3-to-5 percent enriched uranium for 20 percent enriched uranium, Ahmadinejad said. He added that, if the West were to refuse to return the enriched fuel, world opinion would shift. ""If they don't live up to their agreement, the international atmosphere will change in our favor,"" he said. They [Western countries] can come and build 20 nuclear power plants for us; Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts and build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point to build our own power plants.""

"(CNN)Two sheriff's deputies in Georgia have been placed on leave with pay for ""inappropriate actions"" in the case of a college student who died in the county jail, a Chatham County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman said. Cpl. Maxine Evans and Cpl. Jason Kenny will remain on administrative leave until the conclusion of an investigation into the death of Matthew Ajibade, a 21-year-old student from Nigeria who died last week in an isolation cell of the Savannah jail, said Gena Bilbo, the sheriff's spokeswoman. Authorities provided no further details into the deputies' conduct. The two deputies couldn't be immediately reached for comment Thursday. Ajibade, who had bipolar disorder, died in custody after he ""became combative during the booking process,"" the Sheriff's Office alleged. His family is demanding to know why Ajibade died. During the alleged jail altercation, three deputies were injured, including a female sergeant who suffered a concussion and broken nose, authorities said. The two deputies now on leave weren't among the three injured, Bilbo said. The  sergeant is on medical leave, but the other two injured deputies remain on duty, said Chief Deputy Roy Harris. The alleged combativeness doesn't square with family members' description of the 21-year-old, whom they described as a much-loved ""geeky kid."" The Nigeria native was in Savannah studying computer science. Ajibade's family has hired Mark O'Mara, a CNN legal analyst who once represented George Zimmerman in the death of Florida teen Trayvon Martin. O'Mara called the disciplinary action against the two deputies ""a good small step in holding people responsible for their actions."" ""We still need questions answered how Matthew's life was taken from him,"" O'Mara added. The body was released to the family Thursday morning, O'Mara said. The attorney hopes to see ""discourse of all available information as soon as possible,"" he said. Ajibade was diagnosed with bipolar disorder three years ago and was having a medical emergency at the time of his arrest and confinement, O'Mara said. Savannah police arrested Ajibade on January 1 after receiving a call about a domestic disturbance. When police arrived, they witnessed Ajibade holding a women under a blanket, according to an incident report. Police uncovered the two and noticed that the woman's ""face was bruised, and her nose was bleeding,"" the report says. Officers ordered Ajibade to release the woman, but he did not comply, the report says, adding that when police tried to arrest Ajibade, he proceeded to ""resist apprehension in a violent manner."" He was accused of domestic violence, battery and obstruction of an officer. A woman whom he identified as his girlfriend tried to inform police of his mental health issues, O'Mara said. ""She also gave police a bottle of his medication,"" the attorney said. The police report notes that officers received a prescription bottle from the alleged victim, but the name of the prescription has been redacted. Once at the jail, officials say, Ajibade had to be restrained, during which time he injured the three officers. He was then moved to an isolation cell because of his ""dangerous behavior,"" a police news release says. Deputies conducted welfare checks on Ajibade and on their second check, he was found nonresponsive, police say. First aid was administered by the jail's medical unit staff. Despite CPR and attempts to restart his heart with a defibrillator, Ajibade could not be revived, according to the release. It's unclear how much of the event, if any, was captured on the jail's surveillance system, or whether officers conducted a mental health evaluation before Ajibade's death. County government officials declined CNN requests for an interview, citing the ongoing investigation. The Sheriff's Office has requested that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation conduct an independent investigation. A GBI spokesperson said an autopsy had been conducted, but that a cause of death was pending toxicology reports. The Chatham County District Attorney's Office said a criminal investigation is ongoing and the office will ""handle the matter further, should it become necessary.""","Two deputies will remain on leave with pay until an investigation into a jail death is done .

"(CNN) -- Just 20 years ago, when the world was entering a new era of high technology and test-driving the information super highway that is now the World Wide Web, South Africans still battled the racist apartheid of the National Party and suffered in the poverty of an almost bankrupt state. Today, almost 20 years since Nelson Mandela established the country as a democracy, South Africa is the economic powerhouse of sub-Saharan Africa and the largest economy in the second largest continent in the world. ""I almost joke and say we directly moved from drums to cell phones, without the entire generation of landline technology,"" said Ebrahim Rasool, South African Ambassador to the United States. As the country launched a satellite last week, Rasool suggests the next generation is already being developed and technology is one of the brightest areas for future economic growth. According to a recent report released by investment banking giant Goldman Sachs, South Africa's Gross Domestic Product has since almost tripled to $400 billion; foreign exchange reserves have increased from $3 billion to nearly $50 billion; and a growing and sizable African middle class was created, within two decades of freedom. ""Perhaps the most striking successes since 1994 are the creation of a growing and sizable African middle class, increased real wages for the employed, and the extension of social welfare and services to underprivileged communities,"" said Colin Coleman, managing director at Goldman Sachs International. Coleman, who's the head of investment banking for sub-Saharan Africa, says in the first 14 years of democracy the country's ethnically African middle class more than doubled in size and in the past two decades real GDP per capita increased by 40%, while 10 million South Africans, one out of five, graduated from the lower to the middle and higher income bands. However, many, including Coleman himself, realize how poverty, inequality, and unemployment continue to haunt this nation of 52 million. ""Structural unemployment and racial economic inequality continues to plague South Africa. Five million jobs have been added in the past 20 years, but insufficient to lower the overall rate of unemployment. Now 14 million people are working and 7 million are not,"" said Coleman, who adds that unlocking job opportunities for more South Africans would unleash tremendous growth. In loosening these restraints, Rasool says education is the most important challenge to address, where there are marked inconsistencies between the working class's education and skills verses the growing markets and jobs. According to Rasool 40% of South Africa's population is under the age of 35 and that's where, among black people, unemployment is the highest. He also says the majority of these youths who grew up under apartheid ""are not unemployed, but rather unemployable"" due to illiteracy and lack of skills. Rasool argues many traditional areas of employment, such as agriculture, mining and textiles, are either mechanized or replaced by cheap labor -- suggesting that ""in order to move this generation to the next we need to find a way to put the skills and the jobs together."" This is a hurdle that Ann Bernstein, head of CDE, a South African think tank in social and economic development, traces to a lack of education -- even among the teachers who school the young generation that is getting ready to enter the workforce. According to Bernstein around 80% of public schools are dysfunctional and the quality of schooling for the majority of poor people is abysmal. She suggests the key reform is to introduce performance management of principals and teachers. ""We cannot allow a situation to continue where many teachers do not come to school on Mondays and Fridays, when they are in class they do not teach much, and where they often are unable to pass tests in the very subject they are supposed to be teaching,"" said Bernstein. Reports indicate that internal corruption remains a problem in South Africa, but the government says it has been clamping down on corrupt officials, with 2,638 officials found guilty of misconduct related to corrupt activities between 1 September 2004 and 31 August 2013. But still government management faces other challenges; ""The government needs to be clearer on its priorities, and its approach to regulation and the role of markets, for the country to achieve a coherent approach to the most important issues of job creation, FDI and growth,"" said Coleman, who believes in the need for collaboration to encourage and facilitate private companies to invest in the country. But despite the challenges the country faces, Rasool praises what South Africans have accomplished in their short experience with democracy and freedom. ""Twenty years ago, many of these people had no electricity, water and had their lands taken away from them,"" said Rasool, who praises programs such as accessible healthcare, social security networks and programs that look after young children, elderly, and the disabled. According to Rasool, 20 years from now, half of South Africa's population will be under the age of 35; and based on the Goldman Sachs report, in the longer term, if the country could raise economic growth from an average 3.3% over the last 20 years to 5% per annum over the next 20 years, it would half formal unemployment over that period. In a country where millions are still taunted by the miserable memories of apartheid, others who have no memories of the past are impatient to move forward in haste. ""The young black people with the memory of apartheid are patient because they know what they have now is infinitely better than the past; but those with no memory from the past have aspirations beyond what's immediately available at hand,"" said Rasool. He adds that in order to create another 20 years of robust growth for South Africans the two have to meet hand in hand.","New report praises South Africa's transformation since apartheid .

"(CNN)  -- Dylan Ryan and Danny Wylde knew each other online -- she's read his blog, he's seen her tweets -- before they met in person in Los Angeles a few weeks ago. A bit awkward, they made small talk, spending an hour or so getting to know each other. ""When I'm with someone new, my primary bit of nervousness is I have no idea if they'll like me, or be attracted to me, or be interested in me,"" Ryan says. ""It's sort of akin to a first date situation."" But this wasn't a first date -- it was strictly business. After chatting, Ryan and Wylde got to work, which in their case meant having sex. Ryan and Wylde (their stage names) are adult performers. While hooking up with a new co-star can provoke some anxiety, there's one thing they're usually not anxious about: getting a sexually transmitted disease from their co-star, since both get tested for STDs at least once a month. ""Before you start shooting, you go online to see the other person's test results,"" Wylde explains. ""Or sometimes on set, before you start, they show you the results on paper."" Such diligence about STDs is a good idea for anyone having sex with a new partner, even if you're not a porn star, says Dr. Craig Strafford, director of clinical research at the Holzer Clinic in Gallipolis, Ohio. ""It really shows they're thinking conscientiously,"" Strafford says. ""I think it really works."" Talent Testing Service, which does STD screenings for adult performers, routinely tests for HIV, chlamydia, and gonorrhea, according to Sixto Pacheco, president and CEO of the service. In addition, some performers opt for an additional panel of tests for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and syphilis. So far, Ryan and Wylde say it's worked for them. Ryan says in her eight years as an adult performer -- she has about five sexual partners a month professionally -- she hasn't contracted a single STD. She says when she has sex with men outside work she always uses a condom. Wylde says about once a year he comes down with a case of chlamydia or gonorrhea. ""I take some pills and it goes away in a week,"" he says, adding that outside of work he has sex only with other performers, since he's knows they're regularly tested. While the testing isn't foolproof, it lowers the risk of getting infected. Combine that with condom use and the risk goes down even more. HIV is a particularly tricky test, since it may provide a false negative if taken too soon after a person is exposed to HIV. This is because most people don't produce enough antibodies for the test to detect until around a month after being exposed. Some people take three months or longer to produce detectable antibodies. ""I think about this all the time,"" says Ryan, who's been an adult performer for eight years. ""It's by far the biggest risk in the industry. I think the one thing that gives me comfort -- small comfort -- is that the people I'm working with by and large have very strong safer sex practices because of what they do for a living."" Wylde says he's not too concerned about contracting HIV since he has sex only with women, but he adds that he knows he's taking at least a small risk. ""There's risk in a lot of jobs,"" he says. ""Professional athletes take risks."" When beginning a new relationship, many wonder what diseases they should get tested for. ""It's a very common question, for both males and females,"" Strafford says. Neither the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nor the American Social Health Association has a list of STDs you should get tested for when you're about to have sex for the first time with someone. However, after discussion with various STD experts, here's a list of tests many doctors recommend. They can be a starting point for a discussion with your doctor. The CDC has a list of clinics that offer testing for STDs by ZIP code. Chlamydia . Often a simple urine test is all that is necessary; sometimes a swab must be taken from the infected area, according to ASHA. Many people don't know they have chlamydia, the most frequently reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. Complications among men are rare, but in women chlamydia can lead to chronic pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancies. The disease can be easily treated and cured with antibiotics, according to the CDC. Gonorrhea . This is also often a urine test, although sometimes a swab is taken from the infected area, ASHA says. Some men have no symptoms of gonorrhea, while others have painful urination or discharge from the penis, according to the CDC. Antibiotics can treat the disease, but if left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to infertility in men and women, and can be life-threatening if it spreads to the blood or joints. Syphilis . A blood test is used to diagnose syphilis, a disease that's easy to treat in its early stages, but if left untreated can cause blindness or even death, according to the CDC. Hepatitis A and B . Men who have sex with men should talk to their doctor about getting tested for Hepatitis A and B, and they should also be vaccinated against the diseases, says Dr. Hunter Handsfield, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD. HIV . As noted above, you can be positive for HIV for several weeks or months before it will show up on most HIV blood tests. A note about herpes . About one out of six people ages 14 through 49 have genital herpes simplex virus type 2, according to the CDC. Testing is controversial since the results are not always accurate or helpful. Dr. Bradley Stoner, associate professor of anthropology and medicine at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, and a spokesperson for ASHA, says the best strategy might be to get tested if you have recurrent lesions that could be herpes, or if you're starting a new relationship with someone who has herpes, since drugs can be given to your infected partner to decrease the chances you'll get the disease, too. ""Other than that, I probably would not screen for herpes -- the waters are just too murky,"" Stoner says.","Porn stars often get tested for STDs at least once a month .
While the testing isn't foolproof, it lowers the risk of getting infected .
HIV is a particularly tricky test, since it may provide a false negative .

"Pedro Hernandez, a former Manhattan stock clerk who once lived in the same neighborhood as Etan Patz, was arrested Thursday in connection with his death, more than three decades after the 6-year-old went missing. A then-19-year-old Hernandez allegedly lured Patz to a store with the promise of a soda, choked him in the basement and then disposed of the body using a plastic bag, placing it in the trash about a block and a half away, Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters. ""Detectives believe in the credibility of the statement,"" Kelly said, referring to the man's earlier confession. Authorities were alerted to the suspect by a tip. Hernandez, who had been working in construction until an injury sidelined him, is expected to be charged with second-degree murder, Kelly said. The suspect is expected to make an initial appearance in court Friday, with the district attorney's office formally filing paperwork. He has no prior criminal record and is the father of a teenage girl, Kelly said. Etan's disappearance exactly 33 years ago on Friday helped spawn a national movement to raise awareness of missing children, which involved a then-novel approach of splashing an image of the child's face across thousands of milk cartons. According to police, in the years following Etan's disappearance, Hernandez told a family member and others that he had ""done a bad thing"" and killed a child in New York. He voluntarily left New Jersey on Wednesday night with detectives to travel to Manhattan and the building, currently an optical business. Kelly described the suspect as remorseful. ""The detectives thought it was a feeling of relief on his part."" He told reporters that other employees of the store were interviewed after Etan disappeared, but not Hernandez. ""I can't tell you why,"" said Kelly, indicating the case apparently was a crime of opportunity. The commissioner said it is unlikely police will find Etan's remains. In her book detailing the investigation, author Lisa Cohen describes the plan Etan had the day he went missing. Just prior to his disappearance, according to the book, Patz told his parents that he planned to stop at a store to buy a soda with a dollar that he'd earned by helping a neighborhood carpenter. The carpenter, Othniel Miller, 75, had met Etan the day before and was recently the focus of media attention when investigators announced they were again questioning him. ""Mr. Miller is relieved by these developments, as he was not involved in any way with Etan Patz's disappearance,"" said Miller's attorney Michael C. Farkas. ""At the same time, Mr. Miller is very pleased that those responsible for this heinous crime may be brought to justice, and the Patz family may finally have the closure they deserve."" But a separate law enforcement source said Thursday that Hernandez's claims were being treated with ""a healthy dose of skepticism."" Investigators have not uncovered any forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the case, Kelly added. Hernandez's name ""came up more than once while interviewing others recently,"" said a law enforcement source, who added that authorities had been familiar with him years ago. Renewed attention over the Patz case sprung up last month when investigators scoured Miller's SoHo basement, where Etan had been seen a day before he went missing. But their search produced no apparent clues. The tipster contacted authorities months ago after news coverage of their renewed search. That contact, at least in part, prompted investigators to question Hernandez. A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which reopened the case in 2010, declined to comment on the recent development. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg added that there's ""still a lot more investigating to do."" ""To his credit, District Attorney Cy Vance reopened (the investigation) in hopes not only of bringing justice, but also offering some closure to Etan's parents,"" the mayor told reporters Thursday. ""And as a father, I just can not imagine what they've gone through."" Etan went missing on May 25, 1979, a block from his home in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo. It was the first time that he had walked to his school bus stop by himself. His mother, Julie, learned after her son failed to return home that he hadn't been in classes that day. After calling the school and Etan's friends, she then called police. The boy was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against a drifter, Jose Antonio Ramos, a convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million -- money the Patz family has never received. Though Ramos was considered a key focus of the investigation for years, he has never been charged in the case. He is serving a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year. A source has previously said investigators wanted to expand the pool of possible suspects beyond Ramos. Parents Stan and Julie Patz still live in their SoHo home and have not commented on the new developments. Police said Thursday that Stan Patz was a little surprised and overwhelmed by Thursday's developments. Cohen, author of ""After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive,"" told CNN earlier that ""the family's been living through this for 33 years. They've had many moments like this. They've learned how to deal with it."" Thursday evening, Cohen told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Night"" she had not heard of Hernandez before the arrest. The Patz family, she said, won't be making any quick judgments on this case. Just weeks after Etan disappeared, an attacker abducted the first of more than 20 children to be kidnapped and killed in Atlanta. A suspect in that case was arrested two years later. In 1984, Congress passed the Missing Children's Assistance Act, which led to the creation of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. President Ronald Reagan named May 25, the day Etan went missing, as National Missing Children's Day.","Author of book on investigation had never heard of suspect .

"(Mental Floss) -- With baseball season in full swing, here's a list of some of the more creative, generous or ludicrous perks players have received. 1. Bobby Bonilla finally gets paid . Hey, New York Mets fans, think things couldn't get any worse? Next year former outfielder Bobby Bonilla goes back on the payroll at the ripe old age of 48. In 1999, Bonilla returned to the Mets for a second stint at Shea following his borderline disastrous free-agent signing in 1992. Bonilla wasn't any better the second time around, so the Mets waived him in 2000. The problem was that the team still owed Bonilla $5.9 million in guaranteed salary. Bonilla's agents worked out a deal with the Mets where he would defer the salary if the team would pay him $1,193,248.20 every July 1 from 2011 to 2035. Not a bad deal for someone who was so bad the team basically paid him to go away. 2. Support for Rollie Fingers' 'stache . Former A's owner Charlie Finley never thought of a gimmick he wouldn't try, including a mechanical rabbit that delivered fresh balls to the umpire and hiring a 13-year-old MC Hammer as his ""Executive V.P."" In 1972, Finley offered his players cash for growing a mustache by Father's Day, thereby giving birth to reliever Rollie Fingers' trademark handlebar 'stache. The A's went on to win the World Series that season, and Fingers' contract for 1973 contained a $300 bonus for growing the mustache as well as $100 for the purchase of mustache wax. 3. Charlie Kerfeld's tasty bonus . After a spectacular rookie season in 1986, rotund reliever Charlie Kerfeld, who always pitched in his lucky Jetsons T-shirt, needed a new contract. Kerfeld asked for $110,037.37, matching his No. 37 jersey, to pitch in 1987. On top of that, he received 37 boxes of orange Jell-O in the deal. The Astros would soon regret this delicious bonus, though; Kerfeld, who was famously caught eating ribs in the dugout that season, would battle weight and injury problems and get sent down to the minors. Mental Floss: 19 unusual injuries . 4. Red Sox buy John Lackey insurance . The Boston Red Sox made a big free-agent splash this winter by signing starting pitcher John Lackey to a five-year, $82.5 million deal. Signing pitchers to long-term contracts is a tricky venture due to the possibility of injury, but the Red Sox managed to give themselves a little peace of mind. If Lackey misses any significant time due to surgery on a pre-existing elbow injury during the first five years of the contract, the Red Sox gain a club option for the 2015 season in which Lackey would have to pitch for the major league minimum salary. 5. George Brett becomes a landlord . The contract extension George Brett signed with the Kansas City Royals in 1984 must have been one of the stranger deals in MLB history. The club agreed to give Brett the bat he used in the infamous 1983 ""Pine Tar Game"" as part of the pact, but that wasn't the only odd perk. The contract also gave him part ownership of an apartment complex in Memphis. At the time, Avron Fogelman co-owned the Royals. Fogelman had made his fortune as a lawyer and real estate baron in Memphis, so when the team needed a little extra incentive to get Brett to sign, they offered the third baseman a piece of one of Fogelman's developments. Brett's agent/brother Bobby negotiated the deal; he referred to the 1,100-apartment complex as ""a nice little kicker."" Brett received a guaranteed cash flow of $1 million from the development and retained the right to sell his 10 percent stake to the Royals for $2 million. Fogelman's Royals used the trick a couple more times when they signed reliever Dan Quisenberry and outfielder Willie Wilson to similar deals that gave them stakes in the 700-apartment Stewart's Ferry development in Nashville. (Quiz got 24.5 percent of the development, while Wilson got 9.5 percent.) Fogelman later told the New York Times that he might have given up too much in the hastily negotiated deals. 6. Barry Bonds gets a legal deal . All player contracts are full of legal jargon, but Barry Bonds' 2007 deal with the San Francisco Giants contained a different kind of legalese. In the wake of Bonds' ongoing problems with the law, the club negotiated a deal that would allow the Giants to release Bonds or convert his contract to a non-guaranteed deal if he came under indictment for a crime. Moreover, the club contractually severed its relationship with Bonds' personal trainers and wrote in the deal that said trainers were no longer allowed in team facilities. 7. Roy Oswalt's big toy . Before pitcher Roy Oswalt made a start in the 2005 National League Championship Series, Astros owner Drayton McLane promised to make the ace's dreams come true if he won, specifically his life goal of bulldozer ownership. After Oswalt dominated the Cardinals to send Houston to its first World Series, McLane came through with a Caterpillar D6N XL. Since Major League Baseball requires high-dollar gifts be disclosed, Oswalt signed an addendum to his contract, a ""bulldozer clause,"" authorizing the club to give him his new toy. 8. Daisuke Matsuzaka's lucky number . Dice-K's deal with the Red Sox includes a plethora of strange or excessive clauses including housing allowances and a personal masseuse, but the oddest is that he's contractually guaranteed the jersey number 18. 9. Ichiro won't be homeless . One would think a guy making a guaranteed $17 million a year wouldn't be too worried about keeping a roof over his head. Not Ichiro Suzuki, though. The Seattle Mariners star outfielder signed a five-year contract extension in July 2007 that included, among other perks, four round-trip airline tickets to Japan each year and the services of an interpreter and trainer throughout the season. It also included a housing allowance for each year of the deal. While the numbers themselves aren't eye-popping -- the allowance ranges from $32,000 to $36,000 a year over the life of the deal -- kudos to Ichiro for getting someone else to pay his rent. Mental Floss: Where are  kids from Sports Illustrated covers? 10. Curt Schilling stays skinny . By the end of his storied career, outspoken hurler Curt Schilling had started to get a bit doughy. When the Boston Red Sox re-signed him to a one-year deal for $8 million before the 2008 season, it included a clause in which Schilling could pick up an extra $2 million if he made weight at six random weigh-ins over the course of the season. Schilling picked up a $333,333 check each time he didn't tip the scales too far. 11. Carlos Beltran's tennis ball launcher . Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran's mammoth seven-year, $119 million deal from January 2005 showed that he had all of baseball's five tools but lacked a conditioned ocular enhancer: a gadget that throws numbered, colored tennis balls over 150 mph to help players pick up the speed of a pitched ball. There's a clause in the contract requiring that the Mets lease the machine and retain an operator for it. 12. A.J. Burnett's family rode in style . Lots of players have free-plane-ticket perks written into their contracts, but some feel that air travel really lacks that we're-going-to-the-prom feeling you can only get from a long limo ride. When current Yankees flamethrower A.J. Burnett signed with Toronto as a free agent in December 2005, he required that his wife receive eight round-trip limo rides from his home in Maryland to Toronto each season. That's around nine hours in a limo each way, which is enough time to move the little divider between you and the driver up and down roughly 3,500 times. Mental Floss:A baseball card quiz . 13. Michael Jordan pulls in cash in the minors . This last one's actually a basketball contract. Michael Jordan's abrupt departure from basketball to play minor league baseball following the Chicago Bulls' 1993 championship campaign struck a number of observers as odd. How could Jordan quit playing hoops and leave all of that money on the table? As it turns out, ""His Airness"" was losing less cash than we all thought. Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf also owned the Chicago White Sox, the team Jordan was playing for in the minors. Even though Jordan was technically retired from basketball, Reinsdorf paid Jordan his $4 million salaries for the Bulls seasons he missed.","Some baseball players' contracts have included creative, generous or ludicrous perks .

"MILAN, Italy (Reuters) -- A new theory that Leonardo's ""Last Supper"" might hide within it a depiction of Christ blessing the bread and wine has triggered so much interest that Web sites connected to the picture have crashed. Speculation over hidden meaning in Leonardo da Vinci's famous fresco has crashed several Web sites. The famous fresco is already the focus of mythical speculation after author Dan Brown based his ""The Da Vinci Code"" book around the painting, arguing in the novel that Jesus married his follower, Mary Magdelene, and fathered a child. Now Slavisa Pesci, an information technologist and amateur scholar, says superimposing the ""Last Supper"" with its mirror-image throws up another picture containing a figure who looks like a Templar knight and another holding a small baby. ""I came across it by accident, from some of the details you can infer that we are not talking about chance but about a precise calculation,"" Pesci told journalists when he unveiled the theory earlier this week. Websites www.leonardodavinci.tv, www.codicedavinci.tv, www.cenacolo.biz and www.leonardo2007.com had 15 million hits on Thursday morning alone, organizers said, adding they were trying to provide a more powerful server for the sites. In the superimposed version, a figure on Christ's left appears to be cradling a baby in its arms, Pesci said, but he made no suggestion this could be Christ's child. Judas, whose imminent betrayal of Christ is the force breaking the right-hand line of the original fresco, appears in an empty space on the left in the reverse image version. And Pesci also suggests that the superimposed version shows a goblet before Christ and illustrates when Christ blessed bread and wine at a supper with his disciples for the first Eucharist. The original Da Vinci depicts Christ when he predicts that one among them will betray him. E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"From the outside, the home at 2207 Seymour Avenue looked like most any other in Cleveland's Westside neighborhood. From the inside, it looked like hell. There were the makeshift alarms rigged to the front and back doors. The porch swing blocking a stairway. Heavy fabric obstructing the kitchen and the second floor. A plastic toilet in a bedroom. Doors without handles, but with padlocks, dead bolts and slide locks. Solid wood covering second-floor windows, assuring no light would enter even on bright, sunny days. And there were the restraints -- duct tape, plastic zip ties, metal chains fastened to a basement pole and bedroom walls -- to ensure that Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus wouldn't leave. But, despite Ariel Castro's efforts, they did. On May 6, Berry alerted passers-by by banging on the front door then crawling out with her 6-year-old daughter. Police officers arrived and went upstairs, where Knight jumped into their arms -- holding them tight and thanking them for ending her 11 years of terror. A pale, quiet DeJesus emerged from a room a short time later. Today, all three women are free. And Castro is paying a price for what he did: life in prison without parole and 1,000 years, as finalized in a Cleveland court Thursday. Castro sentenced to life plus 1,000 years . The sentence follows a deal in which Castro agreed to plead guilty to 937 charges to avoid a trial and a possible death penalty. The prosecution didn't have to present evidence Thursday, but they did -- laying out in vivid detail the twisted torment that Knight, DeJesus, Berry and Berry's young daughter, fathered by Castro, went through -- in testimony, impact statements and a sentencing memorandum. ""The days never got shorter,"" said Knight, the lone victim to speak in court. ""The nights turned into days. The days turned into years. The years turned into eternity."" Lured into home, restrained and assaulted . It started on August 22, 2002, when Castro saw the then 21-year-old Knight at a Family Dollar store. She was trying to find the social worker in charge of her son, then not even 2½ years old, Cleveland police Det. Andrew Harasimchuk testified. Knight asked around for directions, and Castro responded that he knew where to go. Knight knew his daughter, Emily, so she took up his offer for a ride. They ended up at the Seymour Avenue home Castro had bought a decade earlier. Did Knight want to go inside to get a puppy for her son, Castro asked? She did, and went in. But instead of giving her a puppy, Castro tied her up with an extension cord. A few hours later, Knight was taken down to the basement, where she was restrained with a chain and with plastic ties around her wrists, said Harasimchuk, his department's lead investigator on the case. Castro put a motorcycle helmet over her head. And then he sexually assaulted her -- for the first of what would be scores of times. Michelle Knight: 'After 11 years, I'm finally being heard' The following April, Castro spotted Amanda Berry walking along a Cleveland street in her Burger King. She was 16; he was 42. Did Berry know his son, who'd also worked at Burger King? What about his daughter Angie? Berry said she knew them both, and she accepted his offer for a ride after he told her Angie was at Castro's home. Berry went in, but saw no sign of her friend, ending up in an upstairs bedroom. Berry asked to go home and when Castro didn't comply, she tried to run away -- her exit stopped when she slammed into a closet instead. Then Castro sexually assaulted her, putting duct tape over her wrists, legs and mouth and a motorcycle helmet over her head. Berry was carried to the basement and tied to a chain attached to a center support pole. A third, eerily similar chapter of this story played out about a year later. This time the victim -- Gina DeJesus -- was younger, at age 14. And she was even closer to Castro's family, as one of his daughter Arlene's best friends. That spring afternoon, DeJesus and Arlene Castro had been together and hoped to spend the afternoon at DeJesus' house. When that plan didn't pan out, the two walked separate ways. Ariel Castro spotted the two together, then apart. He admitted driving past his daughter to get to DeJesus. She got in the car after he asked for help finding his daughter, then got out of it when he asked for help carrying a speaker from his home into his car, testified Harasimchuk. Once inside, DeJesus became uncomfortable and wanted to leave. Castro steered her, unwittingly, into the basement -- where she was tied up with a chain and plastic ties and sexually assaulted. Constantly fearing for their lives . The young women's nightmares didn't end there. The sexual abuse was rampant, as was the violence and threats thereof. Castro had a gun that he'd show to Knight, DeJesus and Berry, threatening to shoot them if they ever tried to escape, prosecutors said. At times, they'd play Russian roulette -- where one bullet is loaded, the cylinder is spun and a person pulls the trigger to see whether the gun fires a shot. Each woman was given one meal a day. They couldn't use the lone bathroom downstairs, and were allowed to shower at most twice a week. After sexually abusing them, Castro would sometimes throw money at them -- money that he'd take back if they wanted him to get anything on the outside. ""He made them believe that their physical survival depended on him,"" Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney Timothy McGinty wrote in the prosecution investigation report and sentencing memorandum. ""And he threatened to end their lives if they did not comply with his every demand."" When Knight became pregnant, Castro acted. He said they devised a plan together, which ended after ""several days"" following a diet of only tea and a regimen of knee bends and jumping jacks. But according to authorities, Knight (and DeJesus) explained it very differently: Castro punched, kicked and jumped on her stomach, forced her to do exercises and starved her for days. This happened multiple times, Knight told Harasimchuk, each time culminating in the loss of a baby. Castro's guilty plea included two counts of aggravated murder. Amanda Berry also got pregnant. She wasn't given any prenatal care, but was allowed to carry the baby. And on Christmas Day 2006, the little girl was born in a plastic baby pool (to contain the mess) inside the Seymour Avenue home. Knight served as the midwife, albeit under great duress. The child wasn't breathing when she emerged, until Knight breathed into her mouth. All the while, Castro loomed over her. ""I remember Michelle saying if that baby died, 'he was going to kill me',"" recalled Cleveland police Officer Barbara Johnson, one of the two officers that went inside the home and rescued Knight, during her testimony Thursday. That baby, miraculously, survived. And so did Knight, Berry and DeJesus. ""I spent 11 years in hell,"" Knight said Thursday, proclaiming herself a survivor before addressing Castro. ""Now your hell is just beginning."" 'The damage that was done does not go away' Over all these years, Castro would go about his life -- working as a school bus driver, jamming in bands with names like Grupo Fuego and Los Boyz del Merengue, going to church on Sundays -- and return home to abuse the young women sexually, physically and emotionally again and again and again. In court  on Thursday, he tried to explain his behavior by saying, ""I am not a monster. I am sick."" Castro claimed his addiction to sex had compelled him to do things he understands were ""100% wrong,"" even as he denied torturing or beating his three captives. Still, by pleading guilty to the hundreds of charges, Castro has officially admitted to committing numerous sordid crimes. Plus, the stories of the victims and the ample evidence presented by law enforcement officers paint a vivid, horrifying picture of what these women went through. So how did they make it? While the four captives were typically kept apart, they did help and draw strength from each other. Knight, the oldest of them, served as a doctor, nurse, midwife and pediatrician for Berry and her young child, Dr. Frank Ochberg testified Thursday. And she literally put herself in between Castro and DeJesus, taking on physical and sexual abuse herself to protect her friend. In court Thursday, Knight credited DeJesus -- whom she shared a dark room measuring about 7 feet by 11½ feet -- for saving her life. ""I never let her fall, and she never let me fall,"" Knight said. ""She nursed me back to health when I was dying from his abuse. My friendship with Gina is the only good thing to come from this situation."" The captives kept diaries documenting the forced sex and anticipation of more abuse, the days and nights bleeding together amid the darkness, of being chained to walls and being treated like animals. And, somehow, they also kept hope. As Knight said, ""We said we'll all get out alive some day and we did."" Ochberg, a pioneer in trauma science, lauded the three women's survival and coping skills as ""marvelous, compelling examples of resilience, of imagination, of humanity."" Still, while they're no longer at 2207 Seymour Avenue, their suffering from their years there isn't over, he said. ""The damage that was done does not go away. They have life sentences,"" said Ochberg. ""...I think they will -- with the love and support of the whole community -- they have a good chance to live a good life. But that doesn't mean that they'll ever be free of the damage that was done.""","Four captives were freed from Ariel Castro's Cleveland home in May .

"The wreckage of an Air Algerie flight that crashed early Thursday has been found in the northern Mali desert, officials in Burkina Faso, where the plane took off, said on state-owned RTB television. No survivors were found, according to Burkina Faso Gen. Gilbert Diendere. Flight 5017 was carrying at least 116 people when it departed for Algeria. It disappeared from radar after diverting from its planned course due to bad weather, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told reporters. At least 50 of the passengers aboard the MD-83 were French. Mali will lead the investigation into the crash. French forces, including two fighter jets, helped search  for the aircraft, along with Algerian and U.N. personnel in the region, Fabius said. Radar contact with the crew was lost 50 minutes after takeoff from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, at 1:47 a.m. Thursday, Fabius said. The aircraft was supposed to arrive at Algiers' Houari Boumediene Airport. Mali lies between Burkina Faso and Algeria. The plane was carrying 110 passengers and six crew members, Air Algerie sales manager Zoheir Houaoui told reporters. Among the passengers, he said, were 50 people from France; 24 from Burkina Faso; eight Lebanese; six Algerians; five Canadians; four Germans; two from Luxembourg; one from Mali; one Cameroonian; one Belgian; one Ukrainian; one Romanian; one Swiss; one Nigerian; and one Egyptian. The plane's six crew members were Spanish, Houaoui said. The plane belongs to a private Spanish company, Swiftair, but it appears to have been operated by Air Algerie. A U.S. State Department official said the department was not aware of any Americans on the flight. Ouagadougou Airport said in a statement that Mariela Castro, daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro, was among those on board. However, the National Center for Sexual Education in Havana, Cuba, which Mariela Castro runs, denied the reports and told CNN she was at an event in Havana. Castro subsequently told a Telesur anchor who interviewed her by phone, ""I'm alive, kicking, happy and healthy!"" Weather may have played a role in crash . According to CNN meteorologist Mari Ramos, the flight path took the aircraft through a region of  thunderstorms. The flight path went through a turbulent area, so it is likely that if the plane was diverted because of weather, it was to avoid a bumpy flight. Thunderstorms are a very common occurrence at this time of year in the area. The MD-83 is part of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 family of twin-engine, single-aisle jets. Air Algerie is Algeria's national airline, with flights to 28 countries. The deadliest incident in the airline's history occurred in March 2003 when a domestic flight crashed after takeoff, killing 102 people on board. One person survived. In February, a Hercules C-130 military aircraft crashed in the mountains of eastern Algeria, killing 77 of the 78 people on board. Flight 5017's disappearance comes exactly a week after a Malaysia Airlines plane was brought down in Ukraine with 298 people on board.

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's military chiefs have been told to prepare for a ""leaner and less centralized"" Ministry of Defence. The warning Friday from Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox marks the latest stage in attempts by the new British government to shake up the country's armed forces and defense spending. In a speech in London, Fox -- just returned from a trip to Afghanistan where Britain has almost 10,000 troops deployed -- said the previous Labour administration had left a ""dangerous deficit"" in the public finances, including an unfunded liability in the ministry's balance sheet of around £37 billion ($57.7 billion) over the next 10 years. Fox steered clear of any announcements on numbers of possible job losses but said he remains committed to a pledge made in opposition to cut Ministry of Defence running costs by 25 percent. ""I don't pretend it is going to be painless,"" he said. But he made it clear that any cuts would be more likely to hit those at the top than those at the bottom. A review of the senior rank structure will be carried out, he said, hinting at probable reductions in the number of senior military positions. ""We cannot demand efficiency from the lower ranks while exempting those at the top,"" he said. Friday's speech came against the backdrop of the ongoing Strategic Defence and Security Review, Britain's first such review in 12 years. The report, scheduled for release at the end of October, will set out what the panel believes should be the shape of the United Kingdom's armed forces in 10 years. Three factors would determine that shape, Fox said: foreign policy goals; an assessment of the character of future conflicts; and anticipated changes in technology. Fox said Britain's future strategic posture should be a ""flexible and adaptable"" one. According to Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the Royal United Services Institute, a think-tank, that reflects the generally held view among Britain's defense establishment that the current strategic environment is one characterized by ""uncertainty and complexity, not by a single existential threat."" The challenge, according to Chalmers, will be to translate that consensus into agreement on where the ax needs to fall. ""Some of the hardest decisions in the review will be those that involve curtailing legacy capabilities with powerful institutional backing in order to create space for new technologies and new tasks that lack such sponsors,"" he said. Among those legacy items are fighter jet programs and the procurement of two aircraft carriers, both projects reportedly threatened with big cuts.","""I don't pretend it's going to be painless,"" Liam Fox says .

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda warnings against the United States emerged Friday as the materials taken from Osama bin Laden's compound continued to yield a trove of intelligence, including details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11. Al Qaeda, the bin Laden terrorist network that carried out the deadly attack in 2001, confirmed its leader's death on Friday in a Web statement and used that opportunity to taunt and threaten the United States. ""Sheikh Osama didn't build an organization that will vanish with his death or fades away with his departure,"" according to the statement, which CNN could not independently authenticate. The statement, which congratulates the ""Islamic Nation on the martyrdom of their devoted son Osama,"" repeated themes and threats made over the years in prior al Qaeda statements. ""The blood of the mujahid sheikh, Osama bin Laden, may God have mercy on him, is very dear to us and more precious to us and to every Muslim from being shed in vain,"" the statement said. A mujahid is defined as a Muslim engaged in what he considers to be jihad. ""This blood will be a curse that will chase the Americans and their agents, a curse that will pursue them inside and outside their country, and soon -- with God's help -- we pray that their happiness turns into sorrow and may their blood mix with their tears and let Sheikh Osama's resonate again."" In its pronouncements, al Qaeda frequently cites the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, and it did so again, saying Friday that America ""will neither enjoy nor live in security until our people in Palestine live it and enjoy it."" ""The soldiers of Islam in groups and as individuals will continue to plan and plot without any fatigue, boredom, despair, surrender or indifference until you receive from them a cunning misfortune that will gray the hair of the child even before he gets old,"" the statement said. Pakistanis were urged to ""rise up"" and cleanse the ""disgrace that was brought upon them by a handful of traitors and thieves"" and ""their country from the filth of the Americans who have wreaked havoc in the land."" The statement surfaced as protesters packed the streets of Abbottabad -- where bin Laden was shot and killed -- in a rally organized by Jamaat-e-Islami, Pakistan's largest Islamist party. The demonstrators denounced the U.S. and Pakistani governments. Also, the statement expressed disdain for the United States, both its efforts and its motives, saying that the Americans managed to kill bin Laden ""by disgrace and betrayal."" Bin Laden was killed in a U.S. Navy SEAL raid on his compound early Monday in Abbottabad, a military garrison town north of the capital of Islamabad. ""Men and heroes only should be confronted in the battlefields but at the end, that's God's fate. Still we ask, will the Americans be able -- through their media outlets, their agents, their instruments, soldiers, intelligence services and their might -- be able to kill what Sheikh Osama lived for and was killed for? How far! How impossible!"" Bin Laden was buried at sea in what U.S. officials have described as a proper Islamic burial. But the statement said if Americans treat the bodies of bin Laden or his family members improperly, either dead or alive, or do not hand over the bodies to families, there will be retribution. ""Any offense will open unto your doors of multitudes of evil for which you will only have yourselves to blame."" According to the statement, bin Laden recorded an audio message a week prior to his death regarding the revolutions sweeping the Muslim world and offering advice and guidance. Al Qaeda indicated that the release of this message is forthcoming. Meanwhile, investigators poring over material seized in the Monday raid found details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11, and the intelligence led Thursday to a nationwide alert regarding rail security. As early as February 2010, al Qaeda members discussed a plan to derail trains in the United States by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and valleys, the alert said, according to one law enforcement official. The plan was to be executed later this year, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, though no specific rail system was identified, the official said. The Department of Homeland Security confirmed a notice was sent to federal, state, local and tribal authorities. ""We have no information of any imminent terrorist threat to the U.S. rail sector, but wanted to make sure our partners are aware of the alleged plotting. It is unclear if any further planning has been conducted since February of last year,"" spokesman Matt Chandler said. Rail agencies across the United States heightened security. The Chicago Transit Authority reissued security bulletins, ""reminding employees of what activities to look for and what steps to take should they encounter any suspicious or criminal activity during the course of their duties,"" said Wanda Taylor, a CTA spokeswoman. Amtrak employees also were on a heightened ""state of vigilance,"" spokesman Marc Magliari said. At Fort Campbell, Kentucky, President Obama thanked the troops for their efforts and vowed to achieve more. ""We are going to ultimately defeat al Qaeda,"" he said to applause. ""We have cut off their head and we will ultimately defeat them."" He said the U.S. strategy is working, ""and there is no greater evidence of that than justice finally being delivered to Osama bin Laden."" A U.S. official said that ""valuable information has been gleaned already"" from the information gathered at bin Laden's compound, though no specific plots or terrorist suspects were identified. But the material suggests that al Qaeda was particularly interested in striking Washington, New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, according to the law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity. U.S. authorities have found that al Qaeda appeared especially interested in striking on significant dates like July 4, Christmas and the opening day of the United Nations. The material seized from the compound included audio and video equipment, suggesting bin Laden may have taped messages there, a U.S. official said. Ten hard drives, five computers and more than 100 storage devices, such as disks and thumb drives, were also found, a senior U.S. official told CNN. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the CIA had a safe house in Abbottabad ""for a small team of spies"" who performed surveillance on the compound. Citing U.S. officials, the effort ""relied on Pakistani informants and other sources to help assemble a 'pattern of life' portrait of the occupants and daily activities at the fortified compound where bin Laden was found."" It was ""mobilized after the discovery of the suspicious complex last August that involved virtually every category of collection in the U.S. arsenal, ranging from satellite imagery to eavesdropping efforts aimed at recording voices inside the compound,"" the Post reported. Dozens of people in Abbottabad have been arrested because of their suspected connections to the compound where Osama bin Laden was shot and killed, a Pakistani intelligence official said Friday. Investigators want to know whether any of the people are al Qaeda members or sympathizers. The United States and Pakistan have been allies for years in the anti-terrorism effort, but U.S. concerns that Pakistanis haven't been robust enough in the fight against Islamic militants and suspected U.S. drone attacks that killed innocent civilians have heightened tensions. Another suspected drone strike killed 12 suspected militants on Friday in the Pakistani tribal region. Questions remain over why and how Pakistani intelligence officials could not have known bin Laden was hiding out in the city, which is home to a military academy and has a strong military presence. Pakistani armed forces chiefs issued a statement Thursday admitting ""shortcomings in developing intelligence"" on the terrorist leader's presence in the country. The army chief of staff, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, ""made it very clear that any similar action, violating the sovereignty of Pakistan, will warrant a review on the level of military/intelligence cooperation with the United States,"" the statement said. Since the raid, Pakistan has ordered U.S. military personnel on its territory drawn down to the ""minimum essential"" level, the statement said.","NEW: ""We are going to ultimately defeat al Qaeda,"" Obama says .

"Interim Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov ordered the withdrawal of armed forces from Crimea Monday, citing Russian threats to the lives of military staff and their families. Russian troops have seized most of Ukraine's bases in the peninsula, including a naval base at Feodosia on Monday. Russia annexed Crimea last week after a controversial referendum that Ukraine and the West say was illegal. ""The acting President of Ukraine has given an order to the Ukraine Defense Ministry for the withdrawal of all Ukrainian forces from Crimea,"" a spokeswoman for Turchynov told CNN. The soldiers' families will be evacuated as well. Earlier, Russian troops stormed and seized the Ukrainian naval base in Feodosia, a port in Crimea, a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman said. Witnesses said several Mi-24 and Mi-8 helicopters were involved in the raid. Between 60 and 80 Ukrainian troops were captured and taken from the base, said Vladislav Seleznev, a Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman in Crimea. Ukrainians had said they would leave the base if they were allowed to take their weapons with them. Russian forces consolidated their control of the Black Sea peninsula over the weekend. On Saturday, six Russian special forces armored personnel carriers broke through the gates of Belbek air base, firing warning shots into the air. In separate incidents, pro-Russian self-defense forces stormed the Novofederoskoe military base as well as a Ukrainian ship, the Slavutych. On a trip to Crimea Monday, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu appointed Rear Adm. Denis Berezovsky deputy commander of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, Russia's ITAR-Tass reported.  That fleet is based in the Crimean city of Sevastopol, making it strategically important to Moscow. Shoigu also met with former Ukrainian military personnel, who are now willing to serve in the Russian army, state news agency RIA-Novosti reported. NATO concerns . NATO's top military commander expressed concern Sunday about the buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's border. Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Philip Breedlove said that Russia had a large force on Ukraine's eastern border and that he was worried it could threaten Moldova's separatist Transnistria region. The Russian force ""at the Ukrainian border now to the east is very, very sizable and very, very ready,"" said Breedlove, a U.S. Air Force general. Russia said the presence of its forces complied with international agreements.  Moscow annexed Crimea after a snap referendum in the autonomous region last week that appeared to produce an overwhelming majority of votes in favor of leaving Ukraine to join Russia. ""Russia is acting much more like an adversary than a partner,"" Breedlove said, speaking at an event held in Brussels, Belgium, by the German Marshall Fund think tank. A senior U.S. defense official told CNN Russia ""has enough troops that we believe they could move against Ukraine at any time now."" The official emphasized that Washington still does not know Russia's intentions on the border, despite statements by Moscow that the troops are there for exercises. U.S. intelligence also indicates that the Russian forces are positioned to possibly go after three Ukrainian cities: Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian forces have moved so close to the border, there would be no warning time, and the U.S. would likely only see an incursion as it was happening, the official said. Claims on Crimea . Ukraine's new leaders -- who took office after months of protests forced President Viktor Yanukovych, a Russian ally, from office -- as well as the United States and other Western powers say Crimea is still a part of Ukraine. Russia insists its actions are legitimate. Crimea had belonged to Russia until 1954, when it was given to Ukraine. The region also has a majority ethnic Russian population and other long historic ties to Russia. Moscow has doggedly pursued its own course, even as Western leaders have denounced its actions as violations of Ukraine's sovereignty and a breach of international law. Diplomacy at The Hague . U.S. President Barack Obama arrived at The Hague on Monday for a G7 summit on threats to nuclear security. The G7 is a group of the world's seven wealthiest industrialized nations. Diplomats at the G7 were talking about Ukraine on the sidelines of the long-planned summit. ""Europe and America are united in our support of the Ukrainian government and the Ukrainian people,"" Obama said. ""We're united in imposing a cost on Russia for its actions so far."" Obama and other world leaders decided to end Russia's role in G8, the group of leading industrialized nations plus Russia, the White House said Monday. ""International law prohibits the acquisition of part or all of another state's territory through coercion or force,"" the White House statement said. ""To do so violates the principles upon which the international system is built.  We condemn the illegal referendum held in Crimea in violation of Ukraine's constitution."" Earlier in the day, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said being kicked out of G8 would be no big deal. ""G8 is an informal organization that does not give out any membership cards and, by its definition, cannot remove anyone,"" he said during a news conference. ""All the economic and financial questions are decided in G20, and G8 has the purpose of existence as the forum of dialogue between the leading Western countries and Russia. ""If our Western partners believe that this organizational format has outlived (its usefulness), so be it."" Ahead of Monday's G7 meeting, a representative for British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that no G8 meeting -- a group of the world's seven top industrial powers plus Russia -- would take place in Russia this year as previously planned. The G7 had already suspended preparations for a planned G8 summit in the Russian city of Sochi. Monday's comment by Cameron's representative ruling the meeting out altogether comes as the West tries to increase Moscow's isolation over its actions in Ukraine. A planned EU-Russia summit also has been canceled. Also at the nuclear summit Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov met with Ukrainian Interim Foreign Minister Andrii Deshchytsia and, separately, with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. During his meeting with Lavrov, Kerry expressed concern about Russian troops amassed on the Ukrainian border, U.S.State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. Also Monday, Russia's Foreign Ministry announced it was issuing retaliatory sanctions against 13 Canadian public figures, in response to a similar move by Canada last week against Russian officials over the Crimean situation, RIA-Novosti reported. Russia is banning the Canadian officials -- including several aides to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper -- from entering the country, according to RIA-Novosti. EU leaders imposed a new round of sanctions against 12 people last week, bringing the total number of people facing EU asset freezes and travel bans to 33. Canada also announced its own sanctions against Russian officials last week. The United States announced its own new round of sanctions against 20 people and a bank that U.S. officials say is linked to Putin and senior Russian officials. Washington had already announced sanctions on 11 people. Russia responded with its own list of sanctions against a number of U.S. lawmakers and officials.","NATO commander concerned about buildup of Russian forces on Ukraine's border .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN)  -- Kenyans have long watched the U.S. presidential election with special interest and, in many cases, a special sense of pride. Barack Obama speaks to residents of Africa's largest slum, Kibera, Kenya, in  August 2006. Barak Obama is the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas. ""I'm excited ... because he's a Kenyan. He's a half Kenyan,"" a smiling woman said in a Nairobi neighborhood. More than a few hangovers were expected Wednesday as many Kenyans celebrated the presumptive Democratic nominee's latest primary election win and him surpassing the delegate total needed to win the party's nomination. Video from across the country showed Kenyans dancing and swilling Senator Keg Lager, which has picked up the nickname ""Obama Beer"" in honor of the junior senator from Illinois. Obama is popular across many parts of the country, especially in western Kenya where many of his relatives live. ""I want a black man to rule America so that you can see the changes that Obama promised the people ... to see the change,"" one young man said. ""Obama is a (good) man,"" said an older man with gray hair, carrying twisted wrought iron on his shoulder. ""He's fit to lead the country."" In summer 2006 thousands of Kenyans lined the streets of Kisumu, giving Obama a hero's welcome on his visit to his father's home. Obama's father died in a car accident in Nairobi in 1982. As he rode through the streets in a truck, flanked by a lengthy convoy, massive crowds chanted ""Obama, Obama"" and waved flags emblazoned with his name and an image of his face. Many also wore T-shirts dedicated to the U.S. senator. CNN's David McKenzie contributed to this story .","Barack Obama is popular across Kenya, from where his father came .

"(CNN)  -- Where would you take a loved one for an anniversary or other special occasion? Tomo 1, a Buenos Aires classic, where food is the main focus -- far from the artifice of fashion and modernity. A comfortable environment, it's serious and without fanfare and it has become a special place for celebrations. It's common to see couples celebrating their wedding anniversary or groups of young businessmen eating there after a successful project. The menu is varied and of high quality, coming from one of the leading authorities in (Argentinean cuisine), the chef Ebe Concaro. The wine list is one of the best in town. What's the best place to try to spot A-list celebrities? There aren't too many celebrities around Buenos Aires. Local celebrities often go to restaurants in Palermo Viejo, a traditional old quarter of the city, that in recent years has grown with its trendy restaurants and boutique hotels. But international visitors who visit the city often go to Puerto Madero, where the celebrated restaurant at Hotel Faena is located. What is your favorite neighborhood and why? Palermo is my favorite neighborhood because it has a bit of everything that makes the city attractive: the nostalgia and elegance of the tango, with the energy and vitality of modern places to eat. It's a great neighborhood to walk in or bike around. It's where young fashion designers have their shops. And on weekends they have clothing, food and music fairs on the streets and it's a traditional meet-up point. In the evening it's taken over by young people who find a wide range of fun things to do there. And it was one of the places where Jorge Luis Borges lived and the setting for some of his stories. That's why one of the main drags in the neighborhood bears his name. What is the biggest misconception about your city? That everyone in this city knows how to dance tango and plays soccer. And that the only thing we always eat is steak, and would never choose another dish to savour. Where do you go to relax? The Delta del Tigre, on the outskirts of the city, is a great place to take a walk and is accessible by train or bus. It's where the Parana River flows into the Rio de la Plata through a number of streams. The lush vegetation and the silence of nature has led many folks to choose this place for their weekend homes. If you don't have your own boat, there are group boats to take you along the river. Where was your most memorable meal? During the late 2001 crisis in Argentina, the country was literally in flames -- enraged protesters set fire to the palm trees on Avenida 9 de Julio, the main avenue in the downtown area. There was rolling coverage throughout, so we had to order takeaway food to continue at work. And to alleviate hunger, there was the wonderful Argentine pizza -- the legacy of the Italian immigration of the early twentieth century. Our favorite pizzeria was always Los Inmortales, a historic place in this city -- a place that the legendary Carlos Gardel (an iconic Argentine tango star) would frequent. Where can a visitor find good souvenirs? One place tourists rarely miss on their way through Buenos Aires is the Caminito, a quaint seaside town of colorful houses in the La Boca neighborhood. It's near the famous La Bombonera stadium where locals go to see the Boca Juniors football team. Caminito is where tourists traditionally get most of the souvenirs that they take back home. The vast majority have motifs related to tango and you can even pay for photos of tango dancers doing their seductive moves. Where can you get the best view of the city? The city of Buenos Aires has no highs and low points -- it's mostly flat so there is no place that works as a viewpoint. But the Plaza Mayor with its Casa Rosada, the seat of government, the Cathedral and the Cabildo (the government palace in Spanish viceroyalty times) make it a popular place for taking photographs. The same goes for Puerto Madero, the last neighborhood built on land reclaimed from the city of Rio de la Plata, where restaurants, hotels and luxury buildings give it a unique look. What's something to see that might not be on the radar? Tourists often come to the city for tango and usually fall into the shows meant only for tourists. But for those who truly want more of this music they can find it in Las Milongas -- the place where the local dancers go to showcase their skills (far from the show lights). That's where we get to know the true spirit of this genre -- where you can understand the sensuality of their dancing and appreciate the ability of the dancers because it's done without pretence. It's not all about professional dancers, but rather those who work at other jobs during the week, but they love this dance and keep true the essence that made it famous throughout the world.","CNN correspondent Javier Doberti shares his travel tips for Buenos Aires .

"Kathleen Sebelius -- who weathered heavy criticism over the flaw-filled launch of the Obamacare website, then saw the program through as it topped a major milestone -- is resigning as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, a White House official said Thursday. President Barack Obama intends to nominate Sylvia Mathews Burwell, current director of the Office of Management and Budget, to replace Sebelius, according to the official. A former Kansas governor and, before that, state insurance commissioner, Sebelius was sworn in as HHS secretary in April 2009. Her time as head of the federal health agency coincided with the passage and implementation of the Affordable Care Act, the bill often referred to as Obamacare. Sebelius came under fire last fall for the rocky rollout of HealthCare.gov, the website central to the new law's implementation. That included being subject of a ""Saturday Night Live"" parody and talk show one-liners panning her. Republicans in Congress were especially critical of what they saw as her lack of leadership shepherding through what they saw as an ill-conceived, ill-advised law. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso went so far as to characterize her last October as the ""laughingstock of America."" But Sebelius, 65, held on to her job, insisting America shouldn't abandon the legislation and all that it hopes to achieve. In an interview with CNN's Sanjay Gupta, she admitted that Obama didn't know of the website's many technical problems until ""the first couple of days"" after it went live October 1. ""There are people in this country who have waited for decades for affordable health coverage for themselves and their families,"" Sebelius said, explaining why the website's launch wasn't pushed back despite anticipated problems. ""...So waiting is not really an option."" The website's performance did improve significantly, prompting the calls for her job to die down as well. Earlier this month, in a letter to department employees, Sebelius reflected on Obamacare enrollment exceeding its target of 7 million as evidence of ""the progress we've made, together,"" while stating ""our work is far from over."" ""I know that this law has been at the center of much debate and discourse in Washington, but what this enrollment demonstrates is that the Affordable Care Act is working and much needed,"" she said in the note. Obamacare hits 7.5 million sign-ups, Sebelius says . According to senior Obama administration officials, Sebelius told the President in early March that she thought the enrollment period would end well and, after that, she planned to step down. Even granted the initial uproar over the website, her decision to resign was on her own accord, the officials said. One White House official praised her overseeing ""one of the most consequential initiatives of this administration"" as well as her efforts to ""improve children's health, expand mental health care, reduce racial and ethnic disparities, bring us closer to the first AIDS-free generation and promote women's health."" ""The President is deeply grateful for her service,"" the official said. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, thanked Sebelius for her five years in the federal government -- while taking at a swipe at the legislation she is most closely associated with. ""She had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work,"" Cantor tweeted. Other Republicans weren't that gracious. Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said Sebelius' departure ""has been a long time coming after a litany of failures and total mismanagement."" Not surprisingly, given the sharp partisan divide that defines the Obamacare debate, Democrats came to her support. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi commended the outgoing health secretary for her dedication ""to a single purpose: to make health care a right, not a privilege, for all Americans."" ""When all is said and done,"" tweeted ex-Obama senior adviser David Axelrod, ""Sebelius has lots to be proud of, including the surprisingly strong finish on exchange signups after rocky start."" Sebelius is expected to be by the President's side at 11 a.m. Friday when he announces Burwell's nomination, according to a White House official. Burwell, 48, was confirmed to her current Cabinet-rank position in April 2013. She came to the White House from her spot atop the Walmart Foundation -- the giant retail chain's charitable organization which, according to its website, donated nearly $1 billion to causes worldwide in 2011. Prior to that, Burwell worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and in President Bill Clinton's administration under then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.

"John XXIII and John Paul II were canonized Sunday by Pope Francis in an unprecedented ceremony witnessed by huge crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square in Vatican City. Millions more around the world watched as two former pontiffs were for the first time installed as saints in a dual canonization. The faithful and the curious packed the streets of Rome around the Vatican before dawn, hoping to gain entry to St. Peter's Square and catch a direct glimpse of church history in the making. Vatican Radio put the crowds at some 800,000 in the St. Peter's area, including the square and the roads and gardens around it. Another 500,000 followed the proceedings on giant screens set up around Rome, according to estimates based on police aerial shots. In another first on a historic day, two living popes were present for the ceremony. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who resigned from the papacy a year ago citing health reasons, was not at the altar but was greeted warmly by Francis both before and after the event. Many of those gathered in the square for the solemn open-air ceremony carried flags and banners. The red and white Polish flag was prominent among them, a reflection of the affection felt for John Paul II in his homeland, Poland. Another read simply, ""Thank you."" With the canonization, a holy relic for each of the popes was formally presented to the altar before the crowds. Giant banners showing the faces of the two late popes hung on the facade of St. Peter's Basilica. In his homily, Francis described the pair as ""men of courage"" who bore witness to God's mercy. ""They were priests, bishops and popes of the 20th century,"" he said. ""They lived through the tragic events of that century, but they were not overwhelmed by them. For them, God was more powerful, faith was more powerful."" He paid tribute to the efforts of John XXIII and John Paul II to renew and strengthen the church. The landmark Second Vatican Council called by John XXIII was of great service to the church, he said. That council helped to bring the church to the people, for example by allowing languages other than Latin to be used for Mass. John Paul II, who served for nearly 27 years, is seen as the ""pope of the family"" and wanted to be remembered that way, Francis added. Popemobile progress . After greeting visiting dignitaries, Pope Francis climbed into the Popemobile, a chance for him to get closer to some of the many faithful who have flocked to Rome. The joyful crowds waved and screamed as he passed through their midst in the open-sided vehicle, with Francis waving and smiling back. One American pilgrim, Hector Alicea of Maryland, told CNN it was ""a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" for him and his two children to be there for the event. ""It was very exciting,"" he said. ""We didn't get a lot of sleep and it's very, very crowded, but all in all it was an incredibly cheerful environment."" The event has a special significance for him because his faith was revitalized after he heard John Paul II preach a sermon in Baltimore in 1994, he said. ""What we are seeing today is the kind of youth who grew up in the John Paul generation."" He was impressed by the diversity of the crowds, he said, as well as the numbers of young and old among them. Applause greets Benedict . Vatican spokesman the Rev. Federico Lombardi said beforehand that as many as 150 cardinals and 1,000 bishops would attend the canonization ceremony, as well as some 6,000 priests. Benedict, looking frail in his white robes, was greeted with applause as he took his place among the bishops and cardinals. Delegations from more than 100 countries around the world were expected to be present, the Vatican said, including at least 24 heads of state. A large Jewish delegation was also to attend, reflecting the efforts of both popes to reach out to the Jewish faith. Sunday evening also marks the beginning of Holocaust Remembrance Day. The two popes canonized are: . John XXIII (1881-1963) -- known as Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli before he became pope -- was one of 13 children born into a family of Italian peasants, farmers from a tiny village in the country's north. He was sent away to study for the priesthood at age 11. John Paul II (1920-2005), born Karol Jozef Wojtyla, was brought up in a grimy industrial town in Poland and raised by his soldier father after his mother died when he was just 8 years old. He spent his formative years living under first Nazis, then Communists. His beatification is the quickest in modern times, made possible because Benedict -- who succeeded John Paul in 2005 -- waived the normal five-year waiting period after death to get someone's beatification rolling. Tomb visits . Vatican observers see the decision to canonize both popes together as a masterstroke designed to invite unity within the Roman Catholic Church, since it brings together a conservative and a reformer. The day chosen for the ceremony, the first Sunday after Easter, is significant because in the church calendar it is Divine Mercy Sunday. Mercy was a theme important to both popes -- and to Francis. After the Mass, the Basilica of St. Peter will be open into the evening to allow pilgrims the opportunity to visit the tombs of the two new saints, Vatican Radio said. John Paul II's relic, a vial containing his blood, is the same one used for his beatification ceremony in 2011. John XXIII's relic is a piece of skin removed from his body when it was exhumed -- in order to move his body from the crypt under St Peter's Basilica to the main Basilica -- for his 2000 beatification ceremony. After the Eucharistic service, their names were included for the first time in the chanting of the litany of the saints. The huge crowds present in Rome reflect the fact that both men were popular in life and known for their efforts to reach out to ordinary people, a path which Francis also seems determined to follow. The event is the biggest in Vatican City since the election of Pope Francis last year. The Vatican's official website said civil security forces were prepared and the subway system would run nonstop through the weekend to accommodate the influx of pilgrims for the ceremony.","Estimated 800,000 watch ceremony in St. Peter's area, 500,000 more around Rome .

"A New York high school student has made it to the Elite Eight in a different sort of March Madness. Kwasi Enin of Shirley has been accepted by the eight Ivy League schools -- Harvard, Yale, Brown, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth, Princeton and Cornell  --  and then some. He will have his choice as the  decision deadline of May 1 approaches. ""I applied knowing that going to any of the Ivy League schools would be wonderful,"" Enin told CNN. ""I thought if I applied to all eight, I figured I'd get into one ... but from the first one onwards I said, 'This can't be happening!' I was shocked seeing all these acceptances under my name."" Enin scored 2250 out of a possible 2400 on his SAT, placing him in the 98th percentile across the country, according to The College Board. He's also ranked 11th in his class at William Floyd High School, a public school on Long Island, according to his principal, Barbara Butler. Butler said Enin is not only a model academic student but also plays three instruments for the chamber orchestra, sings in an a cappella group, throws shot put and discus for the high school's track and field team, participates in student government and has had a lead role in school plays since the ninth grade. ""Usually kids are good athletes or good musicians or good actors, but they don't have all three and then on top add student government. It's a balancing act. He somehow finds time to do it all and then volunteer at a local hospital,"" Butler said. Butler has been Enin's principal for six years in both middle and high school. ""He is an incredibly modest, humble and respectable person,"" Butler said. ""He is incredibly dedicated and he has his priorities straight. He takes advantage of whatever opportunity he is afforded."" Rachel Rubin, the founder of Spark Admissions in Massachusetts, who also previously served on admissions committees at selective universities, said the feat is extremely rare. ""It's quite atypical,"" Rubin said, adding that most students do not apply to all the Ivy League schools. ""Standardized test scores and good grades will get a student in the door to have their application read,"" Rubin said. ""But it's their extracurricular activities, leadership experience, exceptional talents, recommendation letters and personal essays that will move a student from a pile of 'maybes' to a pile of 'accepted.'"" Harvard's acceptance rate, among the most selective in the country, was just 5.9% for the applicants for the class of 2017, according to its admissions site. Enin was also accepted to Duke University and three State University of New York campuses. Although Enin has yet to make a decision, there seems to be a front-runner. ""I'm thinking about Yale. I really liked their sense of family, relationships between undergraduates and professors, and the residential college. They also have a strong biomedical engineering program, which is a wonderful combination of biology and creative tools that doctors and health care professionals can use."" Enin added that Yale also has a strong music program, one of his beloved hobbies that he hopes to continue when he isn't hitting the books in college. He hopes to one day pursue medicine, a dream of his that just so happens to align with his parents' careers. His parents, who immigrated from Ghana in the late 1980s, are both nurses and pushed Enin to receive the highest grades possible and follow his dreams. ""Health care is a prominent field that satisfies people beyond finances and edifies people and is about moral development,"" he said. His advice for future applicants? ""Follow your passions in high school and not just follow suit for what you think can get you into these schools,"" he said. ""Develop your outside interests -- not just academics.""","Kwasi Enin, 17, has been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools and then some .

"[Breaking news update, 11 p.m.] . Police on Thursday night were back at the Massachusetts home of former NFL player Aaron Hernandez, according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of an ongoing investigation into an unsolved 2012 double homicide in Boston. Hernandez, who is being investigated in connection with that 2012 case, is accused of orchestrating the killing of a man whose body was found last week less than a mile from Hernandez's home. [Previous coverage, updated 10:55 p.m.] . Massachusetts State Police late Thursday said they were seeking a man as an ""accessory after the fact"" in the death of Odin Lloyd, who was found less than a mile from the home of former NFL tight end Aaron Hernandez. A North Attleboro Police Department tweet linked to a poster that described Ernest Wallace as being armed and dangerous. In most states, accessory refers to aiding someone suspected of committing a felony. Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the Lloyd case. Authorities are seeking the public's assistance in locating Wallace, who was described as being his 40s and having a heavy build. Police also are seeking a silver/gray 2012 Chrysler 300, allegedly last seen being operated by Wallace. While Hernandez stood in court this week, police were combing a condo he rented to search for evidence in the case against him. Inside the condo, a district attorney said Thursday,  detectives found ammunition for a .45-caliber weapon -- the same caliber weapon that investigators believe was used to shoot Lloyd last week. Hernandez is accused of orchestrating the killing of Lloyd, a 27-year-old semipro football player whose body was found last week in an industrial park. He has pleaded not guilty. He's also being investigated in connection with an unsolved 2012 double homicide case in Boston, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. The source gave no indication whether there was any connection between that investigation and Lloyd's killing, which drew national attention as Hernandez, a 23-year-old who was once one of the NFL's most promising rising stars, became a high-profile focus of the investigation. The rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez . In court, prosecutors have described witness accounts and surveillance footage that they argue solidifies their case against Hernandez. But, according to First Assistant District Attorney Bill McCauley's arguments in court this week, one key piece of evidence apparently hasn't been found, the gun investigators believe was used to kill Lloyd. Inside a Hummer registered to Hernandez parked in front of the condo he leased, McCauley said Thursday, investigators found a clip to a .45-caliber firearm. Search jars neighborhood . By Thursday evening, the Hummer was no longer parked at the condominium complex in Franklin, Massachusetts. Authorities towed it away after they scoured the area, neighbor Carol Bailey said. The small condo Hernandez rented near the highway looks drastically different from Hernandez's large house with a plush, green lawn about 10 miles away in North Attleborough, where over the weekend police patrol cars filled the driveway as search dogs and detectives scoured the property. At the condo complex about 20 minutes away, the police search Wednesday was a jarring sight, Bailey said, noting that she saw them using a dog to sniff for evidence and also carting in a ladder truck to get at the building's roof. ""We've never had the place crawling with cops,"" she said. ""This is a very peaceful, quiet community. This doesn't happen here."" The retired biology professor said she never spoke directly with Hernandez, but she had seen him at the complex, wearing hooded sweatshirts in an apparent attempt to fly under the radar. When police questioned her on Wednesday, Bailey said she told them she never saw anything suspicious going on in the condo next door. ""No suspicious activity, no girls, nothing other than just typical guy stuff. A little bit loud, a little bit of cigarette smoke, a little bit of, maybe pot,"" she said, ""but nothing that you wouldn't expect from a bunch of guys.""] . Attorney: Hernandez is 'one of the best football players' Details about the condo search first came to light on Thursday during a new hearing for Hernandez, who was pushing for authorities to release him on bail. Hernandez's lawyers said their client had not obstructed the investigation, as prosecutors alleged, and was not a flight risk. Defense attorney James Sultan said he wasn't asking for special treatment for his client, but stressed what he called Hernandez's professionalism and the athlete's stable home environment. ""Mr. Hernandez is not just a football player,"" he said, ""but is one of the best football players in the United States of America."" He also noted that Hernandez was recovering from shoulder surgery and needed medical care. And he offered the use of electronic monitoring and house arrest as options. But those arguments didn't convince Superior Court Judge Renee Dupuis. ""He also has the means to flee, and a bracelet just wouldn't keep him here, nor would $250,000,"" she said. Hernandez tied to second murder investigation . Hernandez is being investigated in connection with a double homicide that occurred in Boston's South End in July 2012, a law enforcement source close to the investigation told CNN. The source gave no indication whether there was any connection between that investigation and Hernandez's current murder charge. What is known is that the Boston Police Department has located and impounded a silver SUV with Rhode Island registration that police have been trying to find for almost a year, which is linked to the scene of  the double homicide, the source said. Investigators said they believe Hernandez was renting the SUV at the time of those killings, the source said. Hernandez reportedly will be sued for shooting man in face . Rental car keys found in victim's pocket . On Wednesday, McCauley revealed that a rental car had been a key link allegedly tying Lloyd to Hernandez. When investigators found Lloyd's body, McCauley said, the keys to a rental car registered to Hernandez were found inside his pocket. Hernandez took selfie with a gun . Lloyd, 27, was a semipro football player who worked for a landscape company. His sister, Olivia Thibou, said last week that her brother was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd and Hernandez were at a Boston nightclub together the night of June 14, she said. Twitter reacts as Hernandez charged, released from Patriots . Second arrest in homicide investigation . A second man has been arrested as part of the investigation into Lloyd's death, but authorities haven't provided details. Carlos Ortiz, 27, was arrested Wednesday in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut. The arrest occurred in connection with the homicide investigation, a Connecticut state prosecutor said in a statement Thursday. Ortiz was charged as a fugitive from justice, New Britain State's Attorney Brian Preleski said, indicating that documents had been sealed by court order. In Massachusetts, a warrant for Ortiz's arrest says he faces a charge of possessing a firearm without a license, according to court documents obtained by CNN. Ortiz spoke with investigators in Connecticut on Tuesday, according to an affidavit filed by a Massachusetts State Police trooper. In that interview, the affidavit says, Ortiz told police that he had been carrying a firearm in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, on June 17 -- the day investigators have said Lloyd was killed. Details about Ortiz's alleged connection to the Lloyd case were not spelled out in the court documents CNN obtained. He was being held on $150,000 bond in Hartford on Thursday. It was not clear from court documents whether Ortiz has an attorney. A 'model inmate' During his first day in jail, Hernandez has been ""polite and cooperative"" and a ""model inmate,"" Bristol County Sheriff Tom Hodgson said. Hernandez was being held in the jail's medical unit, which is standard for someone who hasn't been incarcerated before, Hodgson said. What does his release mean for the Patriots? The former pro athlete showed ""no apparent nervousness"" in jail, Hodgson said, but he noted the difficulty of going from having thousands of people cheering for him to being ""just a number."" While in the medical unit, Hernandez will be locked up for 23 hours a day, with a break for a shower and phone calls, the sheriff said.

"A Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device he hopes will suck pollutants from Beijing's smog-cloaked skies, creating columns of clean air for the city's surgical-mask wearing residents. An electromagnetic field generated by copper coils will pull airborne particles in the smog to the ground where they can be easily cleaned. ""It's like when you have a balloon which has static (electricity) and your hair goes toward it. Same with the smog,"" says artist Daan Roosegaarde. His studio has reached an agreement with the Beijing government to test the technology in one of the capital's parks. With its skies regularly shrouded by filthy gray smog, Beijing this week unveiled a series of emergency measures to tackle the problem. Roosegaarde says an indoor prototype has already proven it works and is confident the results -- with the help of a team of scientists and engineers -- can be replicated outside: . ""Beijing is quite good because the smog is quite low, it's in a valley so there's not so much wind. It's a good environment to explore this kind of thing."" ""We'll be able to purify the air and the challenge is to get the top of the smog so you can see the sun again."" Roosegaarde acknowledges that projects like this are a way of drawing attention to the problem, rather than a viable solution to Beijing's dire air pollution. ""This is not the real answer for smog. The real answer has to do with clean cars, different industry and different lifestyles."" However, he hopes the project will make a ""radical statement"" by allowing the city's residents to realize the difference between breathing clean and smog-filled air. ""I want to take a park in Beijing, 50m by 50m square, and make it the cleanest park in Beijing,"" he says. He is still discussing with local authorities which park will be used. Roosegaarde's studio has worked on several projects that use static electricity in unusual ways; creating a road that charges electric cars and a floor that generates electricity when danced on.","Dutch artist and designer has come up with a device that aims to suck pollutants from air .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Sunday against arming Syrian rebels ""who kill their enemies and eat their organs,"" referencing a widely circulated video that purports to show a rebel fighter eating the heart of a dead soldier. Putin's comments signaled a clear disapproval of a U.S. plan to increase military support to Syrian rebels, and his  warning came just one day before he was to meet with U.S. President Barack Obama for talks at the Group of Eight summit in Northern Ireland where Syria is expected to top the agenda. ""I believe you will not deny that one should hardly back those who kill their enemies and eat their organs. ... Do you want to support these people? Do you want to supply arms to these people?"" Putin asked, speaking to reporters in London after meeting with British Prime Minister David Cameron. Explosion, fire at Damascus military airport . The video referenced by Putin first surfaced online in May and generated outrage. The video, which was posted by a group loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, also raised questions abut the credibility of the rebels despite widespread condemnation of the act by the opposition. Putin said those actions do not represent the ""humanitarian and cultural values"" of Europe or Russia. Opinion: Why a man eats another man's heart . ""If we speak calmly, in a businesslike fashion, let me draw your attention to the fact that Russia supplies arms to the legitimate government of Syria in full compliance with the norms of international law,"" he said. ""We are not breaching any rules and norms. Let me emphasize that: we are not breaching any rules and norms, and we call on all our partners to act in the same fashion."" Russia has been at odds with the United States, the UK and others over how to bring an end to the bloodshed in the civil war that has raged in Syria for more than two years, a conflict that the United Nations estimates has left more than 92,000 people dead and millions displaced. Russia and Syria have an alliance dating back to the Cold War, and Moscow has been one of the leading weapons suppliers for al-Assad's government. Obama is expected during his meeting with Putin to make his case for increasing support to the rebels. Obama's administration announced the move last week after it said Syria crossed a ""red line"" with the use of chemical weapons, including sarin gas, against the opposition. Obama has not detailed the increased military support, but Washington officials told CNN that the plan includes providing small arms, ammunition and possibly anti-tank weapons to the rebels. World leaders have put enormous pressure on al-Assad to end the war and step down, and U.N. Security Council efforts to take action have been repeatedly blocked by Russia and China. Cameron, meanwhile, told reporters that Britain had not decided whether to provide weapons to rebels but was providing technical assistance and training alongside the United States, France and its other allies. ""I'm in no doubt that responsibility lies with President Assad. It is the onslaught that he is inflicted on his own people which is the primary cause of the suffering, the humanitarian catastrophe and the deaths we have seen,"" he said. Putin told reporters that he hoped the G8 summit would provide an avenue that would allow him to help broker a peace deal to end the Syrian conflict. He said he believed both sides were responsible for the bloodshed. Will Rouhani alter Iran's policy on Syria? Cameron acknowledged that he and Putin have deep differences on the issue of Syria but said they agree that it will take political and diplomatic efforts to help end the carnage. Putin did not address Russian concerns that the United States may attempt to enforce a no-fly zone over Syria, using F-16 fighter jets and Patriot missiles based in Jordan. On Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned the United States against taking such action, saying it would be a violation of international law, according to Russian state broadcaster Russia Today. Russian television reported that Lavrov's comments followed speculation in the media that a no-fly zone could be imposed through the deployment of the missile systems and fighter jets sent by the United States to global military drills in Jordan. Those reports followed news that the United States had approved a Jordanian request to keep the fighter jets and missiles in the country after the conclusion of a joint military exercise. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki has dismissed media accounts that Obama has decided on establishing a no-fly zone. Those reports are incorrect, she told reporters on Friday. U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes also addressed the matter Friday when he was asked how difficult it would be to establish a no-fly zone. ""In Syria, when you have the situation where regime forces are intermingled with opposition forces, they're fighting in some instances block by block in cities. That's not a problem you can solve from the air,"" he said. Syrian rebels have pleaded for anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons, saying they are outgunned by al-Assad's miltary. In recent weeks, the rebels have suffered a series of devastating setbacks, including the loss of the stronghold of Qusayr near the Syria-Lebanon border, that coincide with the arrival of Hezbollah fighters who have been reinforcing government troops. In recent days, al-Assad's military and the Hezbollah fighters, backed by Lebanon and Iran, have been battling rebels for control of Aleppo, Syria's largest city.","Vladimir Putin blames both sides for the bloodshed in Syria .

"In ""The Hunger Games,"" wealthy Capitol citizens of all races and ethnicities come together to watch the 74th annual bloodbath of the same name. It seems some present-day moviegoers, however, are a bit less ""post-racial."" Earlier this week, some ""Hunger Games"" fans tweeted their discontent because the characters of Cinna, Thresh and Rue are played by black actors in the big screen adaptation. This, despite the fact that both Thresh (Dayo Okeniyi) and Rue (Amandla Stenberg) are described as having ""dark skin"" in Suzanne Collins' novel, while Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) is simply described as having short brown hair. Whether fans' remarks -- such as, ""Awkward moment when Rue is some black girl and not the little innocent blonde girl you picture"" -- stem from poor reading comprehension or intolerance, they're indicative of a larger issue in Hollywood, said Harry M. Benshoff, an associate professor of radio, TV and film at the University of North Texas who co-wrote ""America on Film: Representing Race, Class, Gender and Sexuality at the Movies."" ""Hollywood has never been on the forefront of the civil rights movement,"" said Benshoff, who hasn't read or watched ""The Hunger Games."" Despite certain character descriptions being spelled out in the book, Benshoff said, people typically project themselves onto a character in order to empathize with that person. ""For a white person reading a book, they're very rarely going to go, 'I'm just assuming this is a black character' if he or she isn't marked as such,"" he said. ""A nonwhite person might project their own identity onto the character."" Skin color is a recurring but understated motif of the novels. Many Capitol residents, for instance, dye their skin to make a statement of affluence, taking on exotic hues like green, gold and olive. The way Hollywood sees it, the more people who identify with a character, the more tickets a movie might sell, he added, referencing Donald Glover's May 2010 Twitter campaign for the chance to audition for Spider-Man. (The role eventually went to British actor Andrew Garfield). ""Put Donald Glover as Spider-Man, (and the movie) will only make $80 million rather than $100 million,"" Benshoff said. ""If it's Tobey Maguire or Andrew Garfield, it's a Spider-Man movie. With Donald Glover, it's a black superhero movie."" In June 2010, African-American blogs lit up when Angelina Jolie's name was proposed for the lead role in the upcoming ""Cleopatra: A Life."" The book's author agreed that the actress would be a good fit in the role as the Egyptian queen. An Essence.com post stated: ""Honestly, I don't care how full Angelina Jolie's lips are, how many African children she adopts, or how bronzed her skin will become for the film, I firmly believe this role should have gone to a Black woman."" And there are plenty more instances of white actors snagging minority roles: Fans were disappointed when Jake Gyllenhaal was cast as the Prince of Persia, and the lack of Asian actors cast in M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Last Airbender"" prompted some people to boycott the film. Usually fans are angry when a film adaptation strays too far from a novel, said casting director David Rubin. In ""The Hunger Games"" ""They're being true to the source material, so I don't see what the issue is,"" he said. Having cast film adaptations of popular books like ""The Firm"" and ""The English Patient,"" Rubin added, ""It's impossible to be slavish to the way characters are described in a novel because those characters exist in the readers' mind in a purely subjective way. ... It's often ... a self-referential image."" Rubin recently worked on HBO's ""Game Change,"" in which Julianne Moore and Ed Harris play Sarah Palin and John McCain, respectively. He said casting historical and political figures, who are known to the audience, is different from putting a face to a character from a novel. ""[Moore and Harris' performances] are not impersonations, and certainly not caricatures,"" Rubin said. ""They are evocative of those people and they have their own integrity. But they're close enough to make people feel like they're watching the real thing."" Even so, Moore said she underwent quite the physical transformation to play Palin, spending two hours in makeup before shooting. Similarly, Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson both changed their hair color for ""The Hunger Games."" ""As a casting director,"" Rubin said, ""I'm concerned about the quality of performance much more than hair color, and if an audience leaves a film overly concerned about the color of a character's hair, something might be missing from the storytelling."" As far as the backlash over casting black actors in ""The Hunger Games,"" he said ""I like to think Hollywood studios would take the high road on this issue, and remain true to the story regardless of what a segment of the population might object.""","Some ""Hunger Games"" fans are displeased that Cinna, Thresh and Rue are played by black actors .

"(CNN) -- Trafficking of children and human organs is occurring in the aftermath of the earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti, killed more than 150,000 people, and left many children orphans, Haitian Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said Wednesday. ""There is organ trafficking for children and other persons also, because they need all types of organs,"" Bellerive said in an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. He did not give specifics, but asked by Amanpour if there is trafficking of children, Bellerive said, ""The reports I received say yes."" Haiti is trying to locate displaced children and register them so they can either be reunited with other family members or put up for adoption, Bellerive said. But, he said, illegal child trafficking is ""one of the biggest problems that we have."" Many groups appear to be legitimate, ""but a lot of organizations -- they come and they say there were children on the streets. They're going to bring them to the [United] States,"" he said. Bellerive said he's trying to work with embassies in Port-au-Prince to protect Haiti's children from traffickers. ""Any child that is leaving the country has to be validated by the embassy under a list that they give me, with all the reports,"" he said. Speaking at his temporary headquarters in a police station near the Port-au-Prince Airport, Bellerive said the first thing Haitian officials seek to confirm is whether the children have adoption papers before they leave the country. In Washington, the State Department said Wednesday it is moving cautiously on the issue of adoptions from Haiti. ""We want to be sure that when a child has been identified, that due diligence has been done to make sure that this is truly an orphan child and not a child that actually has family,"" said State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley. ""Sometimes if you push too hard, too fast there can be unintended consequences. So we are being very, very careful."" ""We respect the sovereignty of Haiti and their right to control the departure of Haitian children. So we think the system that has been established is working effectively. I know there is a perception out there of 'cut through the red tape.' But there are very good reasons we want to make sure this process works well,"" Crowley said. On the broader issue of Haitian children, Bellerive told Amanpour the government will reopen schools Monday in most of the country. He said there were particular problems in Port-au-Prince. ""We cannot open one school and not the other. But some of the schools want to operate right now. They say if there are tents -- if there are facilities and we can help them -- they are willing to open very rapidly."" Bellerive also highlighted the critical importance of getting enough tents and shelters to Haiti before the rainy season begins in May. He said he didn't know where all the tents promised by aid agencies and governments are. ""We have reports that they've already sent 20,000 tents maybe, and 20,000 more are on the way. But yesterday, when we didn't see the tents and we didn't see any action to organize the shelters, the president himself asked to see the storage place and we only counted 3,500 tents."" Bellerive said President Rene Preval asked for 200,000 tents to house between 400,000 and 500,000 people. ""We are very preoccupied about the consequences of all those people on the street, if it starts to rain."" The prime minister also rejected criticism from within Haiti and overseas that his government needs to be more visible to the Haitian people. ""We are in charge. Frankly I don't understand what that position is that we are not visible,"" he said. ""I almost feel that I spend more time talking to radio, television, than I am working."" ""I know it's part of my job and I have to communicate. But I really feel that I have spent too much time doing that."" Bellerive also said he does not believe it's necessary to relocate the capital to another part of Haiti. ""I have to wait for technical and scientific evaluation, but from what I've heard until now, Port-au-Prince will stay there."" ""Tokyo is still there, Los Angeles is still there. We just have to prepare a better constructed Port-au-Prince, a safer Port-au-Prince,"" he said. He also acknowledged the need for more transparency and new procedures to prevent corruption in Haiti. But he said 70 to 80 percent of the aid coming to the country right now does not go through the Haitian government. Bellerive said about 90 percent of American aid, for example, goes through non-governmental organizations. ""They are accountable to the American government, but not to the Haitian government,"" he said. The prime minister told Amanpour that he does not believe people overseas are helping Haiti out of a moral obligation. ""I believe it's a more pragmatic responsibility,"" he said. ""I believe Haiti could be an interesting market in the midterm. We are 10 million [people] here and it's a market.""","NEW: Government working to protect children from traffickers, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive says .

"Nailah Winkfield doesn't know what a new court-appointed independent doctor will say about her daughter, who was declared brain dead after tonsil surgery this month. But she has no doubt about one thing: her plan to keep fighting for her daughter to stay on life support. ""I'm her mother. I'm going to support her. It's my job to do it. Any mother would do it,"" Winkfield said in an exclusive interview with CNN's The Lead on Monday. ""I just want her to have more time. There are so many stories of people waking up in her situation."" Doctors at Children's Hospital & Research Center in Oakland, California, have said 13-year-old Jahi McMath is brain dead and won't wake up. ""We have the deepest sympathy for Jahi's mother, who wishes her daughter was alive; but the ventilator cannot reverse the brain death that has occurred and it would be wrong to give false hope that Jahi will ever come back to life,"" Dr. David Durand, the hospital's chief of pediatrics, said in a statement on Monday. McMath was declared brain dead December 12, three days after the surgery. The case has drawn national attention and sparked protests from some local leaders who say the hospital should have provided better care. On Monday, a judge appointed Dr. Paul Fisher, chief of pediatric neurology at Stanford Children's Hospital, to evaluate McMath. Fisher is expected to testify on the case in a closed hearing Tuesday, according to court documents. Alameda Superior Court Judge Evelio Grillo also ruled that the hospital must hold off on any decisions regarding discontinuing life support until December 30. And he encouraged both sides to work together. ""This is a very, very charged case. The stakes are very high. There is a young girl involved, and I think it would suit both parties well if you would speak with each other about how we are going to get through the next few days,"" Grillo said. Ultimately, the fight pits the family's faith against what the hospital calls false hope. Winkfield told CNN Monday that she's seen recent improvements in her daughter's condition. A hospital monitor suggests her daughter is trying to breathe on her own, she said. ""They told me without your brain, you can't take your own breath,"" Winkfield said. ""Well, she's trying, so that means something's working."" Winkfield said the memory of watching her daughter bleeding profusely after the surgery remains seared in her mind. The hospital hasn't done enough to explain to her what went wrong, she said. ""They have not given me a reason yet of why she went into cardiac arrest. They haven't even given me a reason for her bleeding. They haven't given me a reason that they couldn't stop the bleeding,"" she said. ""The only thing they keep pushing for me is to get her off their ventilator."" Durand said Monday that hospital officials are looking into the matter and are ""committed to learning what led to this catastrophic outcome."" ""We are sorry that Jahi McMath suffered tragic complications from her complex surgery,"" he said. ""Our hearts go out to the grieving family and community about this sad situation. We look forward to the independent expert's evaluation of the patient."" Douglas Straus, an attorney for the hospital, told the judge that McMath couldn't be brought back to life. ""This is obviously a tragic situation,"" he said. ""A young lady has died and no one takes that in a callous or uncaring manner, but she is dead."" Winkfield, meanwhile, said she still has faith. ""I will not stop fighting for Jahi, because, like I said, I see signs of improvement,"" she said. ""I really feel that my child needs time to heal.""","""I just want her to have more time,"" Jahi McMath's mom says .

"Abbottabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Children in the Abbottabad neighborhood where Osama bin Laden lived said they noticed oddities at bin Laden's massive compound but were oblivious that the world's most wanted terror leader was hiding in the quiet city. Twelve-year-old Zarar Amjed Turk is one of the children who played with the eight or nine kids from bin Laden's house -- some of whom may have been the al Qaeda leader's grandchildren. ""I don't know why they had security cameras installed outside the house,"" Zarar said. ""We used to knock the door for 10 or 20 minutes then someone used to come to talk. That was strange for us."" He said he didn't know the names of the kids he played with. ""We used to play cricket next to their house. Whenever our cricket ball went into the compound, we knocked on the door and asked for the ball. But the guy always said our ball was lost, and gave us 50 rupees (59 cents) and asked us to buy a new one."" Zarar had never heard the name Osama bin Laden before the terror leader's death last week. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh contributed to this report.","Children would knock on door for 10 or 20 minutes, one tells CNN .

"West Virginia is recovering from another hazardous health crisis -- a toxic chemical spilled into the Elk River that poisoned the water supply for hundreds of thousands of residents. Safety and health advocates are cautiously optimistic things will change following the leakage of 4-methylcyclohexane methanol from a storage tank belonging to a company called Freedom Industries. But that appears doubtful based on past experiences. Pregnant West Virginia women told to drink bottled water . ""Chemical Valley,"" as it's known, has a less than stellar record. This is the third major accident in just over five years. In 2008, a Bayer Cropscience pesticide explosion killed two workers and injured eight others. Two years later, three consecutive accidents at a DuPont plant released a deadly nerve agent used in World War I, killing one worker. The Chemical Safety Board investigated and in both cases found that the companies cut critical corners to save money. In the Bayer Cropscience explosion, the report found multiple ""deficiencies"" and ""critical omissions."" In the DuPont accident, the CSB found ""numerous safety deficiencies"" and ""incomplete investigations"" of previous near accidents. But safety advocates say local and federal officials did little to beef up safety standards and protections. ""Any kind of real reform is not there,"" Maya Nye, spokeswoman for People Concerned about Chemical Safety, said. ""Our lives are currently in the hands of chemical industry lobbyists."" After the most recent incident, the chemical industry said it would consider taking appropriate steps if they are needed. The chemical industry in West Virginia is a lot like the coal industry -- large and powerful. CNN tests at 2 W.Va. sites show acceptable chemical levels in water . Elected officials have been reluctant to take on industries that contribute millions of dollars to political campaigns and also employ tens of thousands of people in the state, which is dependent on these high-risk, high-reward industries. Neil Berch, an associate professor of political science at West Virginia University, said the latest incident raises the same debate that followed past chemical spills -- as well as questions about the erosion of mountains from mining and deadly accidents relating to coal, including the Massey Energy Upper Branch Mine explosion of 2010, whicht killed 29 miners. ""There's always a tension between the economic benefits ... and the environmental issues,"" he said. Even Nye, who is lobbying for better safety measures for chemical tanks, is sympathetic. Her father worked for the chemical companies and she acknowledged that it's a dominant source of livelihood for West Virginians. ""It's what the economy is dependent upon,"" Nye said. The chemical industry employs more than 27,000 West Virginians and boasts that the average annual wage is $78,000. The coal industry, which is even more powerful in the state, employs 60,000 people. And both the coal and chemical industries fiercely fight additional oversight that they say is too costly. On the front page of the West Virginia Coal Association's website, a banner blares: ""Let EPA hear from America today. EPA policies are hurting real people!"" referring to the Environmental Protection Agency. And just three days before the chemical spill, the American Chemical Council responded to proposed safety topics of discussion. While the organization said it would support some ideas, it said it is ""concerned"" that some options would ""further complicate an overly complex regulatory system by creating requirements for assessing safer alternatives."" What is 4-methylcyclohexane methanol? In response to the most recent chemical accident, the chemical industry group said in a statement: ""If careful examination suggests that new steps are needed, ACC will work with members of Congress to ensure any new rules are targeted and minimize unintended consequences."" Berch said elected officials are most concerned with ""keeping the coal industry alive."" Those tensions are apparent as elected officials are measured in their response, and it crosses party lines. In an interview on Friday on CNN, Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat and a former governor, said he is ""not going to cast guilt on anybody."" Manchin said, however, that he would push for legislation that would require inspections of chemical tanks near water. In the House, Republican Rep. Shelley Moore Capito, who represents Chemical Valley and is running for Senate, has called for a congressional investigation. She said she supports a review by the Chemical Safety Board. But both Manchin and Capito have repeatedly made sure to separate the latest spill from the coal industry, even though the chemical involved is used in that industry. ""We have the country we have today because of the coal that has been provided, a lot of it from West Virginia, that has given us the life that we have and the wars that we have won and everything that we have taken for granted,"" Manchin told CNN. ""The incident that happened with this spill is not related to my view of the EPA, of overreaching and not looking at economics and trying to reach a balance in the energy industries,"" Capito told The Charleston Gazette. ""I see this as a chemical issue, and so the coal issue is secondary."" Fueling elected officials' soft approach is a deep distrust of the federal government among West Virginians, who feel forgotten and insignificant to Washington. ""The sentiment of the people is probably related to the influence of coal,"" Berch said, as coal runs successful campaigns against government intrusion. The federal government has also failed to protect West Virginia residents from deadly chemical and coal accidents. More investigations launched as 180,000 residents still without water . In this instance, Angie Roser, executive director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, said at least three federal laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, should have provided oversight of the chemical tanks, but that the local Department of Environmental Protection hasn't been on the site since 1991. While federal laws are going unenforced, state and county laws are failing to fill in the gaps, she said. No local law exists that requires the inspection of above-ground chemical storage tanks. And at a second facility owned by Freedom Industries, inspectors have cited five violations, including for storage and containment. Now both Manchin and Capito have asked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to explain why pregnant women are advised to drink bottled water when drinking restrictions are slowly being lifted for other residents. ""We are deeply disappointed in the CDC for recommending a screening level before receiving all relevant studies and information, which has resulted in confusion, fear and mistrust among Kanawha Valley residents,"" they wrote in a letter to the CDC. The state has not fared much better. The state admitted it has no response plan for a release of the chemical, The Charleston Gazette reported. In the latest incident, seepage from the tank entered the soil, found its way to the Elk River and then entered a water plant downstream. Nye said she can still vividly remember the oxygen liquid blast in 1978, when she was 8 years old, that killed three people. In addition to the 2008 and 2010 chemical accidents, Nye said there have been many more smaller-scale ones. ""I am concerned with all the tanks; there are so many of them,"" Nye said, saying they are too numerous to even know how many exist in Chemical Valley. ""You name the chemical and we've got it."" She said she has lived through numerous shelter-in-place orders to protect against chemical accidents. More disturbingly, she said there have been accidents when people should have been ordered to stay indoors but weren't, because it's up to the chemical company to admit and determine the hazard -- a system that allows for little accountability, Nye said. She is optimistic that things will change this time. ""I think because so many more people were impacted, the response will be different,"" Nye said. Local West Virginia officials are signaling that more oversight is necessary and numerous local and federal investigations have been launched. But that deep-seated distrust of government could persist. With a trickle, not a flood, water restrictions are ending . ""A lot of people I've talked to have said they will never drink their water again,"" Rosser said.","The Charleston area has experienced 3 hazardous material incidents over 5 years .
The chemical, coal industries are politically and economically powerful in West Virginia .
Safety, health advocates cautiously optimistic response will be different this time ."
"With its skies regularly shrouded by a filthy film of gray smog, bringing chaos to the transportation network and forcing millions to seek refuge behind surgical masks, Beijing has been forced to take more extreme action. Officials in China's capital this week announced a raft of emergency measures in a bid to tackle the problem, including mandatory factory closures and bans on cars entering the city on days when pollution levels are particularly high. While Beijing is not alone when it comes to smoke-filled skies, this city of more than 20 million people has come to symbolize the environmental cost of China's break-neck economic growth. Red alert . The city's Heavy Air Pollution Contingency Plan stipulates that when there is ""serious pollution for three consecutive days,"" a warning system comprising of blue, yellow, orange and red -- the most serious -- alerts will be activated. Kindergartens, primary and middle schools will then have to stop classes, while 80% of government-owned cars must be taken off the roads. Private cars will only be allowed to enter the city on alternate days according to ballot system of the numbers on their registration plates. All freight vehicles and those transporting material for construction sites will be barred from the roads when the red alert is issued, while more watering carts and sprinkler trucks will take to the roads, the state-run China Daily reported. Factories in the city emitting pollutants will be required to cut their emissions or shut down completely when the orange warning signal is hoisted, while construction sites must halt excavation and demolition operations. Other measures include a ban on barbeques and fireworks on heavily polluted days. Harmful to health . According to the plan, these emergency measures will come into play when the air quality index for fine particulate matter, PM2.5 -- airborne particles considered most harmful to health -- exceeds 300 micrograms per cubic meter for three days running. The ""safe"" limit is 25 micrograms, the World Health Organization says. While the announcement has been broadly welcomed as a step in the right direction, doubt remains about its long-term effectiveness. ""The new emergency measures show the government's determination to tackle the air pollution in Beijing, especially those regulations that limit car use and close schools and kindergartens on heavily polluted days. It shows that the authority has really paid attention to those vulnerable groups,"" Huang Wei, a spokesman for Greenpeace East Asia, told CNN. ""But what is problematic is that those emergency measures are only targeted to those polluted days. It is rather a remedial measure than a preventative measure, and just to repair won't help the issue in the long run. ""The air pollution in Beijing is mostly transmitted from other cities, and what Beijing can do is very limited. What the authority should do is to build a linkage mechanism, combining preventative measures with emergency control. For instance, factories in surrounding areas like Inner Mongolia, and Shandong Province could close their factories in advance before the potential transmission of serious pollutants. It should be collaborative work between cities, and only Beijing is not enough."" Popular opinion . This view was backed by many ordinary Chinese on Weibo, China's popular micro-blogging service. ""They should have some long-term thinking instead of always waiting till the crisis happens,"" posted one user with the handle Shijinmilu. Another, called Qinghualiuqingyu, asked: ""How about those people who can't afford an expensive house in the city and have to take cars to work every day?"" ""Cars are not the main polluters, surrounding factories are. Sometimes the pollution level still goes up crazily even it's around 2 or 3 a.m. The policy itself is good, but it's more important how they implement it,"" said TangyuanAllesGute. Positive action . Last month, the central government in China announced plans to start listing its top ten most air-polluted cities every month in the hope that national humiliation will push positive environmental action. ""We must put air quality control as an ecological red line for economic management and social development,"" China's Vice Premier Zhang Gao Li said in a statement as he announced the new policy at the 18th Air Pollution Control Conference in Beijing. Chinese officials did not say when the first list would be announced, but the northern megacities of Beijing and Tianjin, as well as the surrounding provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shandong have signed onto an official plan to speed up air pollution control measures. Meanwhile, life was returning to some semblance of normality in northeastern China Wednesday as days of smog-filled skies brought one city to a standstill. Thick smog closed Harbin's international airport, affecting hundreds of flights, and closed schools and businesses as visibility in some areas was reduced to less than 20 meters (65 feet).  Some buildings could barely be seen from the opposite side of the street, while drivers brave enough to take to the roads were forced to flash their hazard warning lights. The unusually severe pollution levels were blamed on the city's coal-fired heating system, as well as farmers burning straw as temperatures in the region begin to drop.","Beijing authorities to close factories, reduce vehicle traffic to reduce pollution .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Limited runway space and battered telecommunications networks are hindering efforts to get food, water and medical aid into the hands of desperate Haitians amid the devastation of last week's earthquake, relief agencies said Monday. Doctors Without Borders reported that flights carrying critical medical equipment were being diverted to the neighboring Dominican Republic. Oxfam warned that fuel shortages could be on the horizon. And a volunteer at a hospital in northern Haiti said he has large numbers of open beds, but no way to get patients there from Port-au-Prince. ""My surgeons are sitting around looking at each other, wondering why they came,"" Tim Traynor told CNN. While visiting the injured at a U.N. clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haitian President Rene Preval said his ravaged population -- already the Western Hemisphere's poorest -- needs medicine, food and long-term reconstruction assistance. ""The more we receive help, the more we can take care of them,"" he said. Louis Belanger, a spokesman for Oxfam in Port-au-Prince, said many roads have been cleared of debris since the magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti on Tuesday. That has allowed trucks to deliver aid to parts of the capital and its suburbs that had been cut off by collapsed buildings. But with thousands of tons of aid heading into Haiti, the airport in Port-au-Prince ""can't handle all the aid that's coming through,"" Belanger said. The U.S. military has been helping Haitian authorities direct air traffic around Port-au-Prince, said Capt. John Kirby, a spokesman for the U.S. Joint Task Force Haiti. But he said ""literally hundreds"" of flights are trying to land at Port-au-Prince, which has ""one tarmac, one runway, one ramp for all the aircraft."" ""It is a sheer volume issue,"" he said. ""There are more planes that want to land here than we can accommodate in any given hour."" Bypassing the airport, the U.S. Air Force began dropping supplies by parachute into Haiti on Monday. A C-17 transport flying from North Carolina dropped more than 55,000 pounds of supplies, including 6,900 bottles of water and more than 42,000 packets of combat rations, about five miles northeast of Port-au-Prince. In addition, Belanger said, the damage to phone lines and wireless networks has made it difficult for aid agencies to communicate with each other and with the United Nations, which is in charge of coordinating relief efforts. Full coverage of the quake . ""What we want to do is coordinate that aid so that we don't just truck in a lorry full of bottled water in a crowded area without any planning beforehand,"" he said. Haiti's damaged phone network ""really posed a huge challenge, and it still does."" In an interview on CNN's ""Amanpour"" program Monday afternoon, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said effectively orchestrating the flow of millions of dollars of aid into the earthquake-ravaged Caribbean nation is ""a great challenge at this time."" But he said U.N. officials have requested transport helicopters from the U.S. government and other assistance from the European Union, and is trying to improve port facilities to get more aid ashore. ""I know that there is a frustration amongst Haitian people, but when I met them, from their faces, I have seen that they have great hope and they are great, resilient people,"" said Ban, who visited Haiti over the weekend. ""And I told them ... to be more patient, because (the) whole world (is) standing behind them."" iReport: Quake victims | Looking for loved ones . The next issue relief workers may have to tackle is fuel, needed to run not only vehicles but also generators that are now powering critical equipment, Belanger said. ""The fuel issue cannot become the problem,"" he said. ""It needs to be tackled, and it needs to be tackled soon."" Benoit Leduc, head of operations in Haiti for Doctors Without Borders, said five of the group's supply planes have been diverted to the neighboring Dominican Republic rather than being allowed to land in Port-au-Prince. He told reporters Monday that coordination is ""not existing, or not efficient at this stage."" ""It's an issue,"" Leduc said. ""I don't really know who is in charge."" iReport: Share your story . Leduc said the diversion of flights to the Dominican Republic has set back plans to erect a portable field hospital by 48 hours -- a critical time when many of injured survivors of the earthquake are now suffering from life-threatening infections. Meanwhile, in the northern town of Milot, medical volunteer Traynor said the Sacre Coeur Hospital has more than 200 beds and a nearby soccer field where helicopters can land but few patients. He said the U.S. Coast Guard has flown some injured people up from Port-au-Prince, ""one or two or three or four people at a time."" ""We are within 30 minutes by air. We could take 200 to 300 people. We can do amputations. We have a fully operational trauma center, and no patients,"" he said. Impact Your World . Carol Fipp, another volunteer at Sacre Coeur, said eight patients have made it to Milot from Port-au-Prince on their own, taking about seven hours to complete the 75-mile drive. The hospital had fewer than 30 patients Monday afternoon. ""Shout it from the mountaintops: We need helicopters,"" she said. CNN's Matt Smith, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Karen Denice and Allison Blakely contributed to this report.","Port-au-Prince airport ""can't handle all the aid,"" Oxfam spokesman says .

"For the better part of a decade, the world has seen an episodic stream of predictions that Iran was on the cusp of building a nuclear weapon and that an Israeli or American pre-emptive military strike was imminent. Alarming forecasts are again gaining currency because of a new assessment issued by the United Nations nuclear watchdog: The International Atomic Energy Agency reported last week that Iran appears to be trying to develop a nuclear weapon. The specter of a nuclear weapon in the hands of someone as erratic as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad would weigh heavily on decision-makers in Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey and throughout the international community. If and when Iran is seen as becoming the world's 10th known nuclear power, many experts see danger mounting, whether from the ""Iranian bomb"" or from having to ""bomb Iran."" The prospect alone has been enough to muscle national security to the forefront of the 2012 U.S. presidential election, a contest that heretofore has focused on economic issues. As Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham recently put it, if Iran gets ""a nuclear weapon, the world is going to go into darkness."" Relying on satellite imagery and other information, the IAEA suggests that Iran has advanced nuclear weapons development at its Parchin military complex, about 20 miles southeast of Tehran. Experts estimate that Iran could make enough weapons-grade enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon within six months. Thus, even if Iran's claims of peaceful intent were true, Iran is shortening the timeline needed to achieve a nuclear-weapon breakout. Iran's checkered track record on nuclear transparency encourages worst-case analysis. No country agonizes over the threat posed by an Iranian nuclear weapon more than Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who once said, ""It's 1938, and Iran is Germany,"" last week called an Iranian nuclear bomb a ""grave, direct threat."" The Israeli media have been filled with rumors about the growing likelihood of an assault on the Iranian program, analogous to the way Israel destroyed the Iraqi Osirak nuclear reactor 30 years ago or a Syrian nuclear reactor in 2007. Alas, military planners generally believe that any attempt to set back an Iranian nuclear program would be far more complicated than either of those surgical operations. Iran's secret, multilayered and entrenched nuclear facilities and forces would require repeated air attacks on myriad sites over time. Escalation could spiral out of control, while there would be no certainty about the demise of Iran's nuclear program. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed to hit any attacker with an ""iron fist."" But thus far, it remains a war of words. Defense Minister Ehud Barak said Israel has made no decision on whether to resort to force. While we may not be on the threshold of an Iranian nuclear weapon, that day appears ever closer. Several years ago, the International Institute for Strategic Studies published a dossier by a team led by Gary Samore, now the Obama administration's top nonproliferation official. That report concluded that if Iran were to throw caution to the wind, it could produce a nuclear weapon by about 2010. That date has come and gone. No one outside Iran's inner circle can be certain about whether and when Iran will become a nuclear-weapon state, but Tehran surely wants the outside world to continue guessing. Even a slower timeline suggests that Iran could almost surely produce a nuclear weapon between 2013 and 2018, placing the timing during the term of office being decided by the next U.S. presidential election -- or beyond. Accordingly, how to manage a recalcitrant Iran and how to support an ally, Israel, have become major features of the presidential campaign. A Republican debate on national security this past weekend provided a get-tougher-with-Iran set of policies that included more covert operations, support for Iran's political opposition, tighter economic sanctions, arming regional allies and deploying greater U.S. military might to the region. And, as Gov. Mitt Romney put it, ""If all else fails, if after all the work we've done, there's nothing else we can do besides take military action, then of course, you take military action."" As Romney and most of the Republican candidates see it, an Iranian nuclear weapon is unacceptable. ""If we re-elect Barack Obama,"" the candidate said Saturday, ""Iran will have a nuclear weapon."" Of course, it is easier for candidates than for officials to talk about covert operations designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. And yet there are numerous reports that the United States or its allies have been behind clandestine attacks, whether against scientists working on Iran's nuclear program, the introduction of Stuxnet malware to thwart Iranian centrifuges or the recent explosion at an Iranian Revolutionary Guard ammunition depot or missile site near Bidganeh. One area in which many Republicans appear to differ with the president's policy is over the degree to which the United States should be supporting regime change by expanding the support for Iran's Green Movement, which rose in 2009 but has gone underground.  Of course, one problem with trying to instigate a ""Persian Spring"" is that overt U.S. support for opposition could make regime opponents a bigger target and allow the regime to claim outside interference, rallying Iran around a more authoritarian government. Republican presidential candidates also called for stronger sanctions. For instance, some advocate sanctioning the Iran Melli Bank. However, it is unclear whether the United States could successfully pressure that institution, what effect it might have on Iran's nuclear program and how an attempt to close it might roil global oil markets and the fragile global economy. A better financial tourniquet might be to go after Iran as a money-laundering state, as this could lead to the entities making money for the regime's hard core. This Republican assault on America's Iran policy clearly caught Obama's attention. In the midst of hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Hawaii, he spoke about how sanctions on Iran had ""enormous bite and scope."" The president promised to ""explore every avenue"" and take no ""option off the table,"" an apparent reference to the possibility of military force. Still, it remains to be seen whether any U.S. president might try to live with deterring an Iranian nuclear weapon the way North Korea's nuclear program has been deterred rather than shut down; one huge difference, however, is the wild card of what Israel would accept and do. Obama came to power promising to talk with Iran and North Korea.  What he may not have bargained on was that neither government was interested in talking to his administration, at least not on Washington's terms.  On the Korean Peninsula, officials expect further provocations from nuclear North Korea, and U.S. policy is now focused on deterrence and crisis management. There may still be time to avoid a nuclear Iran.  Washington should double down on financial measures, support for political opponents, arms for allies and covert action.  But the United States needs to be resolute, not reckless.  It needs statesmanship, not sound bites.  If Iran succeeds in brandishing nuclear arms, all Americans, and not just one political party, will feel the repercussions of a post-American era in which no outside power can act as a security guarantor. As America winds down its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Iranian leaders no doubt perceive a vacuum of power. If Americans lack the stomach for a fight, then there is little in Iran's way of grabbing more power in a brittle region that features a weak Iraqi state and a shaky Arab world order. Iran's brazen opportunism may well be what precipitates the unthinkable: another major military operation in the greater Middle East.","Patrick Cronin: Iranian nuclear bomb would threaten stability of Middle East .

"(CNN) -- Neil Patrick Harris is officially a married man. The 41-year-old actor revealed in a tweet on Monday that he and his partner of 10 years, David Burtka, exchanged vows in Italy on Saturday. ""Yup,"" Harris confirmed on Twitter. ""We put the 'n' and 'd' in 'husband'."" The couple, who are also parents of 3 1/2-year-old twins Harper Grace and Gideon Scott, have been engaged for years. When New York legalized gay marriage in 2011, Harris said that he and Burtka, 39, had proposed to one another at least five years prior and had ""been wearing engagement rings for ages."" According to E!, Harris and Burtka wore matching Tom Ford tuxedos at the wedding ceremony, which was officiated by their friend, ""How I Met Your Mother"" director and producer Pam Fryman, and included a performance from Elton John. Harris, who came out as ""a very content gay man"" in 2006, told Details magazine in 2012 that he thought he'd always be single -- until he came across fellow actor Burtka. Neil Patrick Harris, David Burtka share their love story . ""It's all baby steps: You have to be OK with telling your friends you're going on a date, you have to be OK with the people in your world meeting and judging them, you have to be OK with breakups,"" the ""How I Met Your Mother"" star said at the time. ""I'm infinitely grateful all those steps led to Mr. Burtka -- once we started talking, we never stopped."" Harris and Burtka weren't the only celebrity couple throwing a wedding this weekend. Another TV star, Fran Drescher, said ""I do"" to Shiva Ayyadurai on Sunday. According to People magazine, Drescher and Ayyadurai, who invented an email messaging program when he was a teenager, tied the knot in an intimate ceremony on the beach at their home. The couple met just over a year ago at an event hosted by Deepak Chopra, Ayyadurai told The Huffington Post in August. This is Drescher's second marriage. Her first, to her high school sweetheart, ended in 1999 after her then-husband came out as gay.","Neil Patrick Harris and Fran Drescher each had weddings this weekend .

"(CNN) -- When Rep. Anthony Weiner admitted Monday to sending inappropriate messages and photos ""of an explicit nature"" to women online, his wife of 11 months was not standing at his side. Huma Abedin was with another politician, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Abedin, 34, began working for Clinton as a White House intern in 1996, eventually becoming the former first lady's traveling chief of staff -- or ""body man"" -- during her campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Her popularity among movers and shakers in the Democratic Party should have been an asset for Weiner's future. However, now that she is the victim of the congressman's indiscretion, ""... the Democrats are furious at this guy,"" Democratic insider James Carville told CNN Monday. ""He is married to one of the most popular people in the Democratic Party."" Weiner: Liberal firebrand or political opportunist? Although she is described as a very private person, Abedin's intelligence, striking style, unusual background and ability ""to make the trains run on time,"" brought her attention well before last summer's marriage to Weiner. Vogue magazine profiled her in 2007, an unusual distinction for a campaign aide. ""Huma Abedin has the energy of a woman in her 20s, the confidence of a woman in her 30s, the experience of a woman in her 40s and the grace of a woman in her 50s,"" Clinton told Vogue. ""She is timeless, her combination of poise, kindness and intelligence are matchless, and I am lucky to have had her on my team for a decade now."" Abedin is the daughter of college professors. Her late father, an Islamic scholar, was from India and her mother, a sociologist, was from Pakistan. She was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but the family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was 2. She moved back to the United States to attend George Washington University. She told Vogue that she decided at 15 that she wanted to be an international journalist, inspired by former CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Can Weiner survive scandal? Abedin's plans changed when the White House intern program assigned her to the first lady's office, not the press office as she had requested. She has not been far from Clinton since then, friends say. ""I don't think you could say they are like mother and daughter,"" actress Mary Steenburgen and longtime friend to the Clintons told Vogue in 2007. ""It's more like an older sister-younger sister relationship, but it's definitely familial."" She joined Clinton's State Department staff in 2009, serving as a senior aide. Her efficiency, language abilities, attention to detail and remarkable ability to pack for long trips -- noted by the Vogue reporter -- make her invaluable to the globe-trotting Clinton. New York voters divided on Weiner's future . ""Huma does make the trains run on time,"" Clinton lawyer Bob Barnett told Vogue. The Vogue story hinted in 2007 that she dated actor John Cusack and cyclist Lance Armstrong. Abedin was introduced to Weiner during the 2008 campaign. Former President Bill Clinton officiated at their July 2010 wedding. Their marriage drew extra attention because Abedin is Muslim and Weiner is Jewish. Ruben Navarrette: Weiner's only choice is to resign . Weiner rose through New York City politics as a young man unafraid of a fight and eager for media attention. Abedin, in contrast, is known for her diplomacy and privacy.","Huma Abedin, 34, joined Hillary Clinton's staff 14 years ago .

"Washington (CNN) -- How many people died of marijuana overdoses last year? ""Spoiler alert -- it's zero!"" said Oregon Democratic Rep. Earl Blumenauer, putting his hands over his head in the shape of a zero. The comments were made at an event Thursday with a bipartian group of House members calling for Congress to jump on the bandwagon of marijuana legalization initiatives passed in Oregon, Alaska and D.C. on Election Day. Colorado passed a similar ballot initiative in 2012. Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton from, D-D.C., Dana Rohrabacher, R- California and Jared Polis, D-Colordao, were also at the event touting the health and economic benefits of legal marijuana. ""There were many close elections across America last week, but there was one clear winner: ending our failed prohibition of marijuana, and instead legalizing, regulating, and taxing adult use,"" Blumenauer said. ""It's not more dangerous than methamphetamines or cocaine."" ""Or tequila,"" Rohrabacher jumped in. Marijuana legalization in the District requires approval from Congress, which is still pending. Norton said that newly elected D.C. Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser is unsure about how Congress will react. ""I think she has some concerns about what Congress will do,"" Norton said. ""We have to do it in a way so that we don't become the place to come for pot."" . CNN's Courtney Battle contributed to this report.","Democratic Rep.

"The congressional spending bill agreed to on Tuesday night blocks Washington, DC lawmakers from using federal or local funds to implement November's popularly passed referendum to legalize marijuana in the district. The legislation, according to a release from Republican Rep. Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, ""prohibits both federal and local funds from being used to implement a referendum legalizing recreational marijuana use in the district."" The language in the bill -- found on page 660 of the 1,603 page document -- is word-for-word what Republican Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland proposed earlier in the year. ""None of the funds contained in this act may be used to enact or carry out any law, rule or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession, use, or distribution of any schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act or any tetrhydrocannabinols derivative for recreational purposes,"" reads the bill. DC marijuana activists' worst fears were realized on Tuesday night with the agreed upon language. Earlier in the day, activists worried that Congress would thwart November's popular vote to legalize pot in the district. ""This House language sucks,"" Adam Eidinger, chair of the DC Cannabis Campaign, said after the language was released. ""Only the Senate can step up and do something or presidential veto. Otherwise our election has just been overturned and we will take it to the streets."" In response to the Congress' decision, pro-marijuana groups are prepared to protest Wednesday night. Although the proposal needs to pass the House and Senate and get signed into law by the President, it appears unlikely the Democrats will risk shutting down the government to remove the marijuana language. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who believes that DC should be able to do what it wants, admitted to reporters earlier today that ""if they put it in there, it's going to be hard to take it out."" And in announcing the deal, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-New York, said that although she ""strongly oppose[s] several policy riders included in this final agreement ... I am pleased Democrats were able to eliminate many of the most damaging provisions."" By moving to stop legalization efforts in DC, Congress will have trumped the over 70 percent of district residents who voted to legalize marijuana in November. Congress, under DC's Home Rule charter, is able to veto every law approved by either DC voters or government. In the past, this power has been used to block everything from abortion spending to needle exchange. During the 2011 budget negotiations, President Barack Obama reportedly used the district's law of paying for low-income women's abortions as a bargaining chip with House Speaker John Boehner. ""John, I will give you DC abortion. I am not happy about it,"" Obama said, according to The Washington Post. ""This was always a possibility but I think it is very, very disturbing that Democrats have given this away,"" said Michael Collins, policy manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, a group that lobbied for the DC law. ""This is really one of the final acts of Democratic leadership before Republicans control both sides and for them to give this away, it just seems to very tone deaf."" The DC Cannabis Campaign, the group who introduced and passed the legalization ballot initiative, also blamed congressional Democrats for blocking the legislation. ""This is a big issue and if you are going to overturn an election, you are going to demoralize young Democrats across the country,"" said Eidinger said. DC Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser has not yet commented on the possibility of Congress addressing the district's marijuana law. But her spokesman, Joaquin McPeek, before the language came out on Tuesday that Bowser ""would hope that Congress would respect the will of the voters and reject any challenge to their rights."" With Congress blocking marijuana funding, expect many DC residents to cry foul about what they calling living under the thump of Congress. ""This is nothing new,"" said Mark Plotkin, a longtime figure in DC politics. ""We are a colony. We are America's colony and anytime they want to screw around with us, they can do such things."" What's more, while Congress is making decisions for the district, proponents of district autonomy were quick to point out that district residents still have no voting member of the House or Senate.","The congressional spending bill blocks Washington, DC lawmakers from implementing marijuana legalization .

"(CNN) -- Pakistani authorities dispatched Navy helicopters Thursday to alert fishermen near Karachi and parts of Balochistan to the expected arrival of Cyclone Phet and to urge them to return to shore, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan reported. Navy units were on high alert should they be needed in the aftermath of the cyclone, which had already started striking the coast of Oman. Fourteen families marooned Thursday by high tides were evacuated by helicopter to higher ground, said Pakistani Chief of Naval Staff Adm. Nauman Bashir. Civilians along Pakistan's coast will receive priority in the relief effort, dubbed ""Operation Madad,"" should it be needed, he said. The Pakistan navy secured its ships near the threatened areas, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff (Operations) Vice Adm. Abass Raza told reporters in Islamabad. ""All the assets of Pakistan navy are safe and necessary precautionary measures have been taken to ensure their safety in case cyclone Phet hits the coastal areas of country,"" he said. In neighboring India, the Indian Meteorological Department called Phet a ""very severe"" cyclone and said it had remained nearly stationary Thursday over the west-central Arabian Sea. In a posting at 11:30 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) on its website, the department said Phet was centered about 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) southwest of Karachi, Pakistan, and 350 kilometers (217 miles) south-southeast of Sur, in Oman. Winds were sustained at 120 - 130 kilometers per hour (75 - 81 miles per hour) and were gusting to 140 kph (87 mph). They were expected to retreat gradually to 70-80 kph (44-50 mph) by Monday. The department predicted the system would move Friday northward across the coast of Oman, then weaken gradually before emerging Saturday in the northwest Arabian Sea headed toward the coast of Pakistan. Seas ""will be rough to very rough"" along and off the coast of Gujarat, India, and the north Arabian Sea, the department said.","Pakistani authorities alert fishermen near Karachi to dangerous seas .

"John Walker Jr., a former U.S. Navy officer convicted of spying decades ago for the Soviet Union, has died in federal prison, according to the U.S. government. Walker, 77, died Thursday at a federal correctional facility in Butner, North Carolina, the Federal Bureau of Prisons said. The agency's website indicated Walker was scheduled to be released on parole within the year. Authorities said Walker stole, then sold, codes to help unlock encrypted Navy messages, which allowed the Soviets to monitor American military assets. Walker pleaded guilty to running a spy ring that included his brother, son and good friend. The spying went on from 1968 to 1985, when he was arrested by the FBI -- caught in part due to a tip from his ex-wife. Walker joined the Navy in 1955 as radioman and served on board six different vessels in the first decade of his career. The impersonal nature of serving on large vessels took a personal toll on him; Walker became even more politically disillusioned after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, and eventually started selling secrets to Moscow, according to a profile of Walker in Naval History magazine. ""Walker's information not only provided us with ongoing intelligence, but helped us over time to understand and study how your military actually thinks,"" Soviet spy chief Boris Solomatin told author Pete Earley. U.S. officials later said Walker's actions did significant damage to national security. Walker's spying gave the Soviet Union ""access to weapons and sensor data and naval tactics, terrorist threats, and surface, submarine, and airborne training, readiness and tactics,"" the late U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger said. Walker's brother, Arthur -- a retired Navy lieutenant commander -- died last month in the same prison. He was 79. Michael Walker, John's son, was released in 2000 after serving 15 years in prison. The youngest Walker also served in the Navy.","Walker's spy ring included his brother and son, according to the FBI .

"Spanish fashion retailer Zara has apologized for selling a striped T-shirt bearing a yellow star that drew criticism for its resemblance to uniforms worn by Jewish concentration camp inmates.

""We honestly apologize,"" Zara said on Twitter in response to numerous outraged tweets. The offending item was removed from Zara stores and its website, according to a press release from Zara's parent company, Inditex. It was on sale for just a few hours before the company pulled it ""due to the potential similarity with the Star of David,"" the company said. Sales were ""marginal"" and the remaining products will be ""destroyed."" ""Inditex would like to reiterate its utmost respect for all cultures and religions.

"A Los Angeles County jury found a retired police detective guilty of first-degree murder Thursday in the 1986 death of an alleged romantic rival who married the detective's college sweetheart. Stephanie Ilene Lazarus, now 51 and retired after rising through the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department, was accused of beating, biting and shooting to death Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in her townhouse in the suburban San Fernando Valley. The judge scheduled sentencing for May 4. Lazarus faces 27 years to life in prison, prosecutors said. Lazarus' attorney said she will appeal the conviction. The attorney for the Rasmussen family said the murder investigation ""covered the arc of a generation"" for 26 years. ""Today's verdict absolutely confirms the identify of the person who murdered their daughter and the intent to which she committed the crime,"" said John Taylor, the Rasmussen family lawyer. ""This trial has been a roller coaster for her husband and her family. The family is relieved of this verdict,"" Taylor told reporters. The Rasmussen family will pursue civil action against the police department and the city of Los Angeles, Taylor said. The family has sued the police for failing to investigate one of their own officers, but a judge tossed out the case. The family is appealing. Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said the case was ""a tragedy on every level."" ""Not only did the family of Sherri Rasmussen lose a wife and a daughter, a life that can never be returned, but also the LAPD family felt a sense of betrayal to have an officer commit such a terrible crime,"" Beck said in a statement. ""I am also sorry it took us so long to solve this case and bring a measure of justice to this tragedy,"" Beck said. The 1986 case went cold for years. Then it was reopened in 2004 and again in 2009. When Lazarus became a suspect, homicide detectives faced ""special challenges as Lazarus' office was located next door to the detectives who were now investigating her,"" a police department statement said Thursday. As the jury verdict was read convicting her of murder with a firearm, Lazarus showed no emotion, and she wasn't handcuffed as authorities escorted her from the courtroom. Lazarus's husband, with whom she has a daughter, walked out of the courtroom immediately after the verdict. Some of Lazarus' relatives were crying as they exited. Her family was escorted by a plainclothes security detail. Rasmussen's parents didn't express emotion at the verdict, either. Lazarus was charged with staging the crime scene to look like a burglary gone bad. Rasmussen, a hospital nursing supervisor, was the new bride of John Ruetten, who had been Lazarus' college sweetheart. Ruetten was in the courtroom Thursday to hear the verdict, but he was emotionless. In their investigation of an officer within their own ranks, Los Angeles detectives solved the 23-year-old cold case after DNA testing in 2009 revealed a bite mark on the murder victim's left forearm came from Lazarus, authorities said. Rasmussen, director of nursing at Glendale Adventist Medical Center, was shot three times in the chest on February 24, 1986, prosecutors said. Her husband of three months, Ruetten, discovered her body upon returning from work that evening, prosecutors said. Prosecutors argued that Lazarus was in love with Ruetten and distraught when she learned he was marrying someone else. ""The family of Sherri Rasmussen never gave up their quest for justice for their daughter,"" District Attorney Steve Cooley said in a statement. He added that ""justice was served today."" Ruetten testified he casually dated Lazarus after college, but he never considered her a girlfriend and dated other women while seeing her, prosecutors said. Police had long believed Rasmussen was the victim of two male burglars, and the case was unsolved until 2009. Lazarus, who was a veteran art theft detective, has remained in custody since her June 5, 2009, arrest at LAPD headquarters. Lazarus' attorney, John Overland, argued in court that the crime scene evidence from 1986 was mishandled and tainted years ago and couldn't be trusted. In speaking with reporters after the verdict, Overland stated: ""Clearly, because of the speed of deliberations, we never had a chance in this case."" When asked about the DNA evidence, Overland said: ""Clearly, it was the only piece of evidence linking her.""","Police feel ""betrayal"" for officer committing ""such a terrible crime,"" chief says .

"François Hollande did not thank his opponent, Nicolas Sarkozy, during his acceptance speech, after defeating the incumbent with 51.6% of the vote in the French presidential runoff. But he should have, as he ran an anti-Sarkozy campaign, promising to behave like a ""normal president"" in contrast to the impulsive, unpredictable and sometimes ostentatious Sarkozy. And it worked: Fifty-five percent of the voters who cast a ballot for him did it to defeat Sarkozy rather than to elect Hollande. This victory comes after an odd campaign on both sides. Sarkozy started off courting the center by emphasizing his record of reforms and his role in solving the eurozone crisis with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. But in March, he decided to take a page from his own 2007 campaign and raid the extreme-right electorate of Marine Le Pen instead. He emphasized themes like immigration, Islam and the necessity for a more protective, even protectionist, Europe. This time, however, the strategy backfired. Le Pen got a historic score in the first round, while Sarkozy sowed confusion in his own camp -- and lost. Hollande, betting on the anti-Sarkozy mood, refrained from making big promises, and even his signature reforms had a lot of fine print. For example, he announced that he would recruit 60,000 more teachers -- but by shifting existing civil service jobs from other ministries to education. He promised to roll back Sarkozy's pension reform -- but for only a tiny fraction of workers. He pledged to renegotiate the European Fiscal Compact Treaty that Sarkozy negotiated with Merkel -- but only to add a growth stimulus, not to alter the new disciplines it imposes. His prudence is easy enough to explain: French debt is close to 90% of GDP, the 2011 deficit was 5.2%, and Hollande has promised to rein it in to 3% in 2013 and zero in 2017 (Sarkozy was promising 2016). He will be closely monitored by the bond markets and the rating agencies, one of which stripped France of its triple-A in January. That is precisely one of the three big challenges Hollande will face -- to convince markets he can chart a fiscally responsible course and restore the competitiveness of France's economy while its southern neighbors are reforming fast and Germany is already very competitive. This in turn partly depends on a second challenge he faces, fashioning a new Franco-German, and then pan-European, consensus on the eurozone crisis. Merkel was furious when Hollande announced in December that if elected, he will renegotiate the Fiscal Compact Treaty. She went as far as to refuse to receive him in Berlin, as is traditional for French presidential candidates, and to announce that she would campaign for Sarkozy -- which in the end she didn't, given Sarkozy's own U-turn on Europe. But in recent weeks, the landscape has changed profoundly. Twelve European countries are now in recession, and the leaders of Italy and Spain have asked for balancing fiscal consolidation with growth measures, lest their drastic reforms be altogether rejected by populations suffering from austerity measures. This new ""growth consensus"" even includes Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, who insists, however, on structural reforms rather than a stimulus with public money. For the difficult question facing European leaders is how to stimulate the economy without deepening the deficit. Hollande has put forward suggestions (pumping up the European Investment Bank, reallocating structural funds, issuing eurobonds for infrastructure projects, creating a financial transactions tax), and there is room for a compromise with Merkel, who cannot afford to be isolated. This could take the form of an additional protocol to the Fiscal Compact to make it more acceptable, including to the German opposition Social Democratic Party, whose votes are needed for ratification. For Hollande, this negotiation will be particularly difficult during his first month in office, because he will face a third challenge -- to win the legislative elections June 10 and 17. If he loses, the resulting situation of cohabitation (divided government) would be a disaster for France and the eurozone, as Paris would be largely paralyzed. This is why Hollande will be very careful not to antagonize French voters before the crucial votes. Fortunately for him, the pressure from the extreme left, which had a disappointing showing in the first round, is low. In the longer term, especially after the September 2013 German elections, much will depend on Hollande's vision for France and Europe. An interesting hint of what's in store might come from a man named Jacques Delors. In 1983, as minister of economy and finance, Delors successfully lobbied socialist President François Mitterrand to stay in the European Monetary System at the price of steep austerity. And between 1985 and 1995, as president of the European Commission, he became one of the founding fathers of the European Union, introducing the single market. One of his protégés was none other than François Hollande.","Justin Vaïsse: French president Francois Hollande avoided making big promises .

Before the election, as opinion polls suggested his rival Francois Hollande would win easily, Sarkozy's camp had been pinning their hopes on the pollsters being wrong. But they were not. Analysts had warned that the large share of the vote in the first round for far-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who took 18% of the vote, could mean problems for Sarkozy.  Le Pen said she had cast a blank ballot in the second round, and observers expected many of her supporters to follow suit. ""The two remaining candidates are political Siamese twins, so I'm not  expecting very much from the result,"" she said after voting in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, according to Agence-France Presse. Sarkozy has fought to keep his job amid a wave of discontent over his inability to rein in unemployment. He defended his economic record despite low growth and unemployment at about 10%, saying the impact of Europe's debt crisis could have been far worse. France is a key player in plans to lead the eurozone out of its debt crisis, making the election vital to the region. Sarkozy's defeat marks the latest -- and most significant -- of at least half a dozen European leaders swept from office during the eurozone economic crisis, including the Greek and Italian prime ministers. Earlier Sunday, longtime Sarkozy supporter David Harari said he stood by the president, even as opinion polls appeared to tip in Hollande's favor. ""I believe the cards were stacked against him, but I want to believe still that he may have a chance to win, because his campaign was reasonable. ... I don't understand why people do not see the reasonableness of his program, even though it's unpopular,"" he said. Concerns over the economy, unemployment and immigration have been at the forefront of the French election. In his final address Friday, Sarkozy, of the center-right UMP party, picked up on the debate over immigration as he appealed for the nation's support. ""I've always said that France needs to remain an open and profoundly humanistic country, but there is a reality that is that we have welcomed more people in France than we can manage,"" he said. ""I'm not speaking to the right, the left or the center, this is a presidential election. I am president of France. I must speak to the French, no matter who they are."" He and Hollande traded insults last week in the only televised head-to-head debate of the campaign. Sarkozy labeled his rival a liar and a ""little slanderer,"" while Hollande accused the president of shirking his responsibilities, cronyism and favoring the privileged over France's poor. The son of a Hungarian immigrant, who did not go to one of France's elite schools, Sarkozy had to fight his way to the top of politics by sheer strength of will. The smartest kid in the class, as some describe him, he was not always the most popular though. Mocked for his lavish lifestyle, and a private life that saw him divorce his second wife immediately after his election in 2007 and go on to marry singer Carla Bruni, the French never truly warmed to Sarkozy. He is often known as ""quel q'un qui derange,"" someone who drives you crazy. The reason for their mixed feelings about ""Sarko"" was his apparent desire to ruffle feathers and challenge the established order, with his policies to end the 35-hour week, raise the retirement age beyond 60 and eliminate 160,000 civil service jobs. None of these reforms was universally popular and some, at least initially, were roundly condemned. But Sarkozy believed them necessary and hoped his countrymen would come round to his way of thinking. However, as the eurozone crisis swirled, the president received a jolt in January when Standard & Poor's credit ratings agency downgraded France from the maximum Triple A status. Hollande launched a scathing attack on the government's policies, saying: ""We are no longer in the first division."" Then came the killings in March of seven people, including three young children, by an Islamic extremist in Toulouse and Montauban. Election campaigning was suspended by most candidates, but as incumbent president, Sarkozy was praised for his handling of the crisis. The president received a short-term boost as the massacre diverted attention away from the financial crisis, but the economy and job security were always going to be of most concern to voters.","French President Nicolas Sarkozy concedes defeat in re-election bid .

"A New York man pleaded guilty Thursday to three charges over online threats he posted against the creators of the television show ""South Park,"" the Department of Justice said. Appearing before a Virginia federal court, Jesse Curtis Morton admitted to charges of using the Internet to conspire to solicit murder, making threatening communications and using the Internet to place others in fear. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison on each of the charges when he is sentenced May 18, the Justice Department said in a statement. Morton was the co-founder in 2007 of Revolution Muslim, a radical group based in New York City that is supportive of al Qaeda's philosophy. The former Brooklyn resident, also known as Younus Abdullah Mohammad, was taken into U.S. custody in Morocco last May,  according to the Justice Department statement. ""Jesse Morton operated Revolution Muslim to radicalize those who saw and heard his materials online and to incite them to engage in violence against those they believed to be enemies of Islam,"" U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said in the statement. ""We may never know all of those who were inspired to engage in terrorism because of Revolution Muslim, but the string of recent terrorism cases with ties to Morton's organization demonstrates the threat it posed to our national security."" Morton left the United States in the summer of 2010 because he feared arrest after two associates from New Jersey were charged with terrorism offenses in June of that year, according to a senior U.S. counter-terrorism official. Investigations had revealed that Revolution Muslim was the ""top catalyst for radicalization for violence in the United States"" over the last several years, according to the official. Morton had a multitude of connections to individuals charged or convicted in U.S terrorism cases, the official said. They included Zachary Adam Chesser, now 21, who last year admitted to posting online threats and attempting to provide material support to Al-Shabaab, a designated foreign terrorist organization. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Chesser, a Muslim convert like Morton, communicated threats against the writers of ""South Park"" for an episode that depicted the Prophet Mohammed in a bear suit. Morton aided Chesser in posting online messages that included the writers' home addresses and urged online readers to ""pay them a visit,"" the Department of Justice said. They also posted speeches by radical Islamist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki giving a justification for killing those who insult the Prophet Mohammed. In an affidavit accompanying the complaint against Morton, FBI special agent Paula R. Menges said Morton worked with Chesser on a ""clarification statement"" after the latter's postings. The pair made website postings that were threats -- despite their claims otherwise, Menges said. Morton's links with extremists included Samir Khan, the editor of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's English-language ""Inspire"" magazine. Khan was killed last September along with al-Awlaki in a U.S. drone strike. Khan knew Morton from his days living in New York and invited him to contribute to a radical blog he was producing in North Carolina called ""Jihad Recollections,"" before traveling to join AQAP in Yemen in October 2009, according to the official. Khan told Morton of his plans to travel to Yemen, according to the senior U.S. official. The official was unaware of any communications between the two after Khan left the United States. Rezwan Ferdaus, a U.S. citizen from Ashland, Massachusetts, who was charged with planning to use model aircraft filled with C-4 plastic explosives in an attack against targets in Washington in September was in touch with Morton as he prepared his operation, according to the official. Ferdaus asked Morton about the Islamic justification of suicide bombings. Morton replied that what was key was the intention behind them and that they were an enormous benefit in a war of attrition, according to the official. Morton later invited Ferdaus to speak in more detail in an online conference call he was holding on the website Paltalk. In the e-mails, Ferdaus did not reveal his specific plan, according to the official. Ferdaus has pleaded not guilty to the plot. Jose Pimentel, a Bronx resident who in November was arrested and charged with plotting to detonate pipe bombs in New York City after allegedly beginning to build an explosive device was in touch with Morton via e-mail before he was arrested, according to the official. Pimentel wrote that he was big fan of the Revolution Muslim website and ""Islam Policy,"" another website run by Morton, and asked Morton about whether he could trust a particular individual, according to the official. Pimentel has pleaded not guilty to the plot. Morton's group was connected online to several others who have admitted or been charged in connection with terrorist offenses. Colleen LaRose, an American woman who pleaded guilty last year to conspiring to assassinate a Swedish cartoonist in 2009, was a subscriber to Revolution Muslim's website. Antonio Martinez, a Hispanic convert to Islam who pleaded guilty to a plot to blow up a Maryland military recruiting station in 2010, also visited the website -- but was not in direct touch with its founders, according to the official. Abdel Hameed Shehadeh, arrested in Hawaii in October 2010 and charged with making false statements in a matter involving international terrorism, attended Revolution Muslim meetings and made his website a feeder for Revolution Muslim's, according to the official. Shehadeh, who authorities alleged attempted to travel to fight jihad overseas, pleaded not guilty. Morton's associates in New Jersey were Mohammed Alessa and Carlos Almonte, who last year pleaded guilty to conspiring to murder individuals on behalf of a terrorist group in Somalia. Alessa and Almonte were arrested as they tried to board international flights at a New York airport on June 5, 2010. A few days later, Morton arranged for tickets to fly to Morocco. Morton also had a web of international connections, according to officials. He was in touch with Mohammed Chowdhury, the ringleader of a plot to blow up the London stock exchange and other London targets in December 2010, who pleaded guilty last week. When Morton moved to Morocco, he asked Chowdhury to take over the running of the Revolution Muslim website, according to the official. Chowdhury was part of a group of radical extremists linked to the British pro-al Qaeda group al Muhajiroun, whose former members have been implicated in several U.K. terrorist plots. Morton's group Revolution Muslim was a spinoff of the American wing of Al Muhajiroun. The British group is still active in the United Kingdom, operating under different names. According to the U.S. official, Morton was also in touch with Bilal Ahmad, another member of the same British extremist circle. Ahmad pleaded guilty to soliciting murder after posting a death threat in November 2010 on the Revolution Muslim website against British parliamentarians who had supported the Iraq war. In a CNN interview in  2009, Morton defended the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and argued that further attacks on Americans were justified. However, he said he did not encourage violence on U.S. soil.","The former Brooklyn resident, also known as Younus Abdullah Mohammad, pleaded guilty .

"There has been a great deal of austerity-bashing -- that is to say Germany-bashing -- this French election season. Buoyed by his success in the first round, Socialist candidate Francois Hollande declared last Thursday: ""It is not for Germany to decide for the rest of Europe."" Vowing to reset Europe on a growth path, he said, ""we're not just any country, we can change the situation."" Now he looks set to put his words into action, following his victory in Sunday's runoff election. French President Nicolas Sarkozy was quick to throw off the ""Merkozy"" mantel early on in his campaigning once he realized that vaunting his friendship with the German chancellor was the last thing his electorate wanted to hear, but it appears to have been in vain. But Merkel stood by her one-time ally, saying she continued to support him in his re-election bid. This came despite increasingly anti-immigrant, protectionist rhetoric from the Sarkozy camp in order to appeal to voters on the far-right that must have sit uncomfortably with Berlin. Much was made of the fact that the German chancellor's office has made no official overtures to Hollande. The chairman of Germany's Social Democrat party Sigmar Gabriel called his socialist counterpart in Paris a ""victim of slander"" by the ruling coalition and by Merkel personally in a recent interview with German daily Die Welt. ""She knows perfectly well that it is a lie that Hollande want to scrap the fiscal compact and incur mountains of debt."" Whether or not she is sure of that, Merkel has made it quite clear that Hollande cannot scrap the fiscal pact. Not up for renegotiation, she said. But it was also clear that Berlin recognized the writing on the wall. ""Germany is clever enough to adapt its position to a new political constellation in France,"" said Etienne Francois from the French Center at Berlin's Free University.  ""Germans are not people to improvise."" And Merkel has already responded with more talk of growth, although she's at pains to argue this isn't a new position on her part. ""It is important that we break with the idea that growth always costs a lot of money and must be the result of expensive stimulus programs,"" she told the Hamburger Abendblatt. The way out of this crisis has always rested on two pillars: ""solid finances and measures for growth and employment."" Hollande for his part said if he became president, his first trip would be to Berlin. This is a man who does not underestimate the strength of the Franco-German alliance. Plus he's of a more similar temperament to the German chancellor than Sarkozy ever was. ""He's pragmatic, prepared to compromise, accepts budget discipline and he'll be under enormous pressure from the markets,"" says Claire Demesmay, French expert at the German Council on Foreign Relations. ""Once the summer's over, once the parliamentary elections have happened, he will have to start saving and he will have to push through reforms."" For now, expect small modifications to the fiscal pact but no rewrites. ""Germany will be clever enough to accept little changes in formulation in order to help Hollande tell French voters that he's been victorious,"" Francois said. ""But it's just tactics."" Merkel is already talking about more flexible use of EU infrastucture funds to spur growth, a strengthened role for the European Investment Bank. But that is a long way from meeting any future French leader on proposals such as eurobonds or a European Central Bank lending directly to governments, both anathema to Berlin. How far the German chancellor will be forced to compromise to Hollande's growth mantra may well depend on matters outside France. Greece was also holding elections on Sunday. Greek voters stung by austerity are turning to extremist parties on the left and right. Recession is biting across Europe, swingeing cuts making electorates restive in Spain, Portugal and Italy. The more support Hollande gets from other disgruntled eurozone countries, the less lee-way Berlin has to stick to its tough belt-tightening course. But that is still some way off. Merkel has two crucial state elections coming up in the next two weeks and the Netherlands goes to the polls in September. If the past decades are anything to go by, it is more than likely the Franco-German alliance will remain an anchor of stability amid all the uncertainty, whoever holds the reins of power in each country.","Nicolas Sarkozy quick to throw off the ""Merkozy"" mantle early on in his campaigning .

"A college trip to Israel changed rabbi Kalman Levine's life, his childhood best friend Shimon Kraft remembers. They grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Levine was always whip smart, funny and kind. He became a giving husband, a wise dad to nine children and a doting grandfather to five, his friend said. Kalman was a dental student at University of Southern California when the two went to Israel. Levine loved it so much he stayed and devoted his life to studying Jewish text. ""To be killed in such a cruel way when all he cared about was kindness ..."" Kraft said, his voice trailing off. ""I know he's in a great place. His priority in life was connecting to God."" Levine's friends and family cling to that optimism in the wake of his slaying, along with three others rabbis, on Tuesday at the ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof. At 7 a.m. local time, officials say that two Palestinian cousins from East Jerusalem, armed with a gun and butcher knives, came charging into the synagogue and slaughtered 55-year-old Levine, Moshe Twersky, 59; Aryeh Kupinsky, 43 and Avraham Shmuel Goldberg, 68. Levine, Kupinsky and Twerksy had dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship, according to the Jerusalem Post. Goldberg was a British-Israeli national, authorities said, and reportedly grew up in Liverpool. While police tried to apprehend the attackers, at least eight people were wounded. Among them was 30-year-old Israel police officer Zidan Saif, who was Druze. The Druze are an Arabic-speaking religious community, a monotheistic offshoot of Islam that also combines elements of other religions. Many of its members live in Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Saif died hours later Tuesday. Thousands, including those from the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, attended his funeral Wednesday, Haaretz reported. The terror attack left behind more than a gut-wrenching scene. Police released photos of the synagogue's floor covered in blood and prayer books and prayer shawls covered in red. It has inflamed already strained relations between Palestinians and Jews and put the city of Jerusalem on edge. The brutality at the synagogue was the deadliest attack in Jerusalem since 2008 when a man with an automatic weapon and handgun killed eight seminary students. A series of stabbings and vehicles attacks has recently beset the city. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the attack ""the direct result of incitement being led by Hamas"" and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, referring first to the Palestinian group that controls Gaza and next to the Fatah movement leader in control of the West Bank. Abbas reportedly condemned the attack and stressed the importance of ending the sometimes root of such violence, including tensions over what Jews call the Temple Mount and Palestinians call al-Aqsa Mosque. Ma'an, a semi-official Palestinian news agency, identified the attackers as Ghassan Abu Jamal and his cousin Udayy. It's unclear whether their alleged actions were part of a coordinated campaign or spontaneous. A 'gigantic soul' A world away, in Los Angeles, Shimon Kraft focused on remembering his friend. ""He had an amazingly gigantic soul,"" he told CNN. ""He didn't waste a minute. He was so alive."" Levine had been living in Israel for years, Kraft said. Alan Edelman, the executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Kansas City, said Levine moved to Israel 30 years ago. ""He was always a sweet, wonderful person,"" Edelman told CNN. ""He was really someone who tried to bring people together no matter what their background was, and their approach to life or religion. Such a tragic irony that a person who loved his fellow human beings would meet a tragic end in such a horrible attack."" Dedicated to faith . Moshe Twersky immigrated to Israel in 1990, The New York Times reported. Twersky is originally from Boston, according to the Jerusalem Post, and his father was Isadore Twersky. The elder Twersky was an internationally renowned rabbi and philosopher as well as a professor of Hebrew literature at Harvard University. When he died in 1997, the Harvard Crimson called him a pioneer of Jewish thought. Moshe Twersky's grandfather was Joseph B. Soloveitchik, who is considered a founding father of modern Orthodox philosophy. A New York Times obituary on Isadore Twersky says that Moshe Twersky had two brothers who were rabbis. Isadore Twersky formerly directed the Center for Jewish Studies at Harvard. ""I know that I speak for all of us in the CJS community when I say that we are heartbroken at the news of this unspeakable act of sacrilegious cruelty,'' Eric Nelson, the director of the center, told CNN. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Twersky family at this terribly sad and difficult time."" Moshe Twersky graduated from Boston's Maimonides School in 1973, the school said in a statement, adding that ""the Maimonides School Family is engulfed in grief and outrage."" Twerksy is survived by his wife, Bashy, their five children and many grandchildren. Kupinsky grew up in the Detroit suburb of Oak Park, the Detroit Free Press reported. The 43-year-old was a member of Young Israel of Oak Park, one of the largest Orthodox Jewish congregations in Michigan and moved to Israel with his family when he was in elementary school, a boyhood friend, Michael Zwick, told the newspaper. ""It was a terrible thing to hear,"" Zwick said of the slayings. ""He was so sweet, always smiling, always saying nice things,"" Kupinsky's friend Esther Schwartz told the newspaper. ""We're shaken to the core. My husband and I couldn't stop crying this morning. We can't get it out of our heads, our minds. ... Such a useless, hateful thing they did killing him."" Goldberg, who used to work as a chemical engineer, lived in Jerusalem with his wife and six children, his cousin Michelle Hirschfield told the Guardian. She is from London, and he left the British city more than 20 years ago. ""We are completely devastated,"" she told the newspaper. ""He was just a tolerant, good man. ... I was due to see him in a couple of weeks when he was going to be in London."" ""This has brought it all home to us,"" she said. ""This was a man who was simply praying in the morning at his usual synagogue, just going about his daily life, not trying to impose his views on anyone."" 'Wonderful men ... slaughtered' The devastation felt from the slayings was evident among mourners at an eulogy for the four rabbis. ""When four great men, wonderful men, wise in Torah study are slaughtered while praying in public, there is no public grieving greater than that,"" the man at a microphone said in Hebrew to the large crowd in the street. A camera captured young women wrapping their arms around each other and swaying. One buried her head in another's shoulder and wept. ""It was horrific,"" a man described as a witness to the slayings said in a Reuters video. ""I can't imagine such attacks would occur to our community. We have to take some time to walk out of the trauma."" The new President of Israel Reuven Rivlin attended officer Saif's funeral, as did members of the ultra-Orthodox community where the attack occurred, several news outlets reported. He has been vocal, Haaretz noted, about the need to better Jewish-Arab relations and to coexist in Israeli society. He praised Saif for his bravery and selflessness, the newspaper said. ""I stand before you in shock and in pain. ... Terror that does not differentiate between people, between creeds. ... Your beloved Zidan, one of this state's best sons, didn't hesitate and didn't waver,"" Rivlin said. ""He was among the first to reach the scene of the massacre, among the first to protect the people of Jerusalem. Your dear Zidan stood fearlessly before the terrorists and used his own body to block their attack, to block their fire."" The President addressed the mourners as another person wounded in the attack fought for his life. CNN partner network CTV said Canadian-Israeli dual citizen Howard Rothman, who was stabbed in his head, eyes and arms, was in a medically induced coma. ""He was trying to fight off the attackers,"" Toby Trumpter-Kraman, a family friend, told CTV.

"As the ramifications of a grisly chemical weapons attack loom over a summit of world leaders, some of Syria's staunchest friends blasted what they call the ""arrogance"" of U.S.-led efforts to strike the war-torn nation and said those who do will pay a steep price. Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Thursday the United States -- which, in addition to being one of his country's chief adversaries, has led the push to punish Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government over chemical weapons -- has no right to make ""humanitarian claims (given) their track record"" in Iraq, Afghanistan and at the military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The turmoil in the Middle East, Iran's leader said in remarks reported by state-run Press TV, is a ""reaction of the global arrogance"" that is rooted Washington. Should the United States and allies strike Syria, he added, it won't be able to ""eliminate (the) resistance."" ""We believe that the Americans are committing a folly and mistake in Syria and will, accordingly, take the blow and definitely suffer,"" said Khamenei. He spoke on the same day Hezbollah issued its first official statement since the effort began to strike al-Assad's forces in the wake of an August 21 chemical weapons attack outside Damascus that, the United States estimates, killed more than 1,400 people, many of them children. Video: Rows of bodies, injured children after attack . The group, which is popular in parts of the Arab world yet labeled a terrorist organization by the United States, claimed that any military action against Syria's government is ""a form of direct and organized terrorism."" ""These threats fail to conceal the true objectives of this strike aimed at mobilizing Israeli (strength) in the region in an attempt to impose the Western colonial grip,"" Hezbollah alleged in a statement read by parliamentarian Hassan Fadlallah, as reported by Lebanon's official National News Agency. The remarks from Hezbollah and Iran are significant, given concerns that international military intervention in Syria could set off a wider war that further destabilizes the region and, thus, the world. Based in Lebanon, Hezbollah is linked to numerous terrorist attacks and is one of Israel's chief adversaries. So, too, is Iran, which has been at odds with Washington and others for years regarding its nuclear program. Still, U.S. and other leaders continue to press for military action against Syria's government -- taking their arguments, through Friday, to the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, Russia. Before heading east, U.S. President Barack Obama said that he believes the world has a duty to act, saying a failure to do so would give those with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons carte blanche to use them on anyone. Arguing that ""the international community's credibility is on the line,"" the president said, ""The moral thing to do is to not to stand by and do nothing."" Yet Russia, which repeatedly has used its veto power to block U.N. Security Council efforts targeting al-Assad, has pushed back. They accused Washington and others of being overzealous and bull-headed by ordering strikes without irrefutable proof Syrian leaders are responsible for using chemical weapons, something they don't publicly believe. Russian President Vladimir Putin even went so far as to accuse U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry of being dishonest as he makes the case to Congress for a strike, including his assertions about the role of an al Qaeda-linked group in Syria. ""He is lying, and (he) knows he is lying,"" Putin said at an event Wednesday. ""It's sad."" British scientists find traces of sarin gas . Russia also has challenged assertions that Syrian forces has used chemical weapons, killing rebel fighters and civilians, including in the attack last month on a rebel stronghold near Damascus. Such accusations against al-Assad and his government are hardly new since his government cracked down on protesters in 2011, setting off what became a civil war that the U.N. estimates has left more than 100,000 people dead, produced over 2 million refugees and displaced another 4 million inside Syria. The violence shows few signs of abating: On Thursday, for instance, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria reported at least 87 more dead nationwide, among them 14 women and 14 children. How you can help Syrian refugees . While the overall bloodshed has drawn rebukes and spurred some support for the opposition, it's chemical weapons allegations -- involving sarin gas, an extremely volatile and potentially lethal nerve agent -- that provoked the threat of direct international military action. In June, France's foreign minister said samples in his nation's possession showed sarin gas had been used several times in Syria. The United States has made such assertions on multiple occasions, including in April when Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel alleged there's evidence sarin had been used lethally on a small scale.  More recently, Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that blood and hair samples from near the August 21 eastern Damascus attack site ""tested positive for signatures of sarin"" gas. What are signatures of sarin gas? And on Thursday, the British prime minister's office announced that its military scientists found traces of sarin gas in soil and clothing taken from a patient treated near the site of an alleged chemical weapons attack outside Syria's capital. Scientists at the Porton Down military laboratory concluded the samples were unlikely to have been faked, and Britain is sharing its findings with the United Nations, the office said. The U.N. was expected to review samples taken by its own inspectors this week. Echoing rebel forces, Washington has insisted that al-Assad's forces are behind such chemical weapon attacks, claiming only they have access to them and can deploy them on a large scale. Yet Syria has been equally adamant it has done no such thing, instead accusing ""terrorists"" -- its blanket term for opposition fighters -- of deploying chemical weapons. Who is to blame, and what the world should do about it, looms large over Thursday and Friday's G20 gathering of world leaders in St. Petersburg, Russia. G20: Where geopolitics trump economics . The summit's focus is officially on economic matters, though the deep divisions among its participants on this pressing issue are hard to ignore: the U.S. and French leaders are calling for a military strike against Syria's government, while Russian leaders are standing by their longtime ally and questioning claims al-Assad's government is responsible for gassing its own people. How these talks influence the debate, if at all, is itself in question. When asked Thursday while walking alone to dinner if any progress had been made on Syria, U.S. President Barack Obama said, ""No, we talked about the economy."" Fervent debate in U.S., around the world . A sweeping international consensus seems unlikely as long as Russia -- which will host Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem in Moscow on Monday, according to Syria's official SANA news agency -- and the United States maintain their firm positions . Kerry said this week, in Washington, that ""at least 10 countries have pledged to participate"" in a military intervention that Obama and French President Francois Hollande have urged. Yet that figure could well change. Britain, normally a dependable U.S. ally in military affairs, has voted against joining any military action. And officials in France -- where polls show one in three people favor strikes -- have said they will wait until the United States decides on a course of action. Read the U.S. Senate draft resolution (.pdf) That won't come until after Congress weighs in, likely next week, on a measure authorizing strikes focused on degrading Syria's ability to use chemical weapons. While congressional leaders have backed Obama's call for action, most legislators are officially undecided so much that what happens is still anyone's guess. ""It weighs on me,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who added ""it is conclusive"" chemical weapons were used. ""... There is no question that what (public reaction) is coming in is overwhelmingly negative."" Yet the president -- arguing that the world cannot afford a country to use such weapons against its own people without responding -- hasn't promised he'll abide by the vote in Congress. And Pentagon spokesman George Little said the Syrian government ""should not take solace from the deliberative process that we are undertaking right now."" ""We have time to adjust, if necessary, given conditions on the ground, given what the Syrian regime may or may not do in terms of movements of equipment and so forth,"" Little told reporters Thursday. Fast facts: Sarin gas . Whatever the United States decides, some world leaders are stumping against military action. In a letter Thursday to Putin in his role as host of the G20 summit, Pope Francis urged a ""peaceful solution through dialogue"" and called an armed intervention a ""futile pursuit."" Speaking from St. Petersburg, European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said that while the international community ""cannot remain idle"" in the face of Syria's apparent chemical weapons use, ""there is no military solution to the Syrian conflict."" ""Only a political solution can end the terrible bloodshed, grave violations of human rights and the far-reaching destruction of Syria,"" he said. ""Too many lives have already been lost and too many people have suffered for too long and lost too much.""","Opposition group reports 87 dead, including 14 women and 14 children .

"Her paintings may sell for thousands of dollars, but she is best known for a modeling shot 50 years ago that helped launch a money-spinning business empire. Now 72, but looking a decade younger, Babette Beatty was the first Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue cover star. Discovered on a beach in Florida, these days she resides in a mountain town far from the glamor and glitz of the entertainment industry that has made household names of her successors. It all started on a whim -- for her a chance of some Mexican sunshine; for Sports Illustrated a chance, for one week, to fill the void left by a lack of content in the winter months. Today, the swimsuit issue, launched half a century ago on January 20, has outgrown the magazine that first spawned it. The 2012 edition generated more than $40 million in advertising revenue, 7% of the weekly publication's total for the entire year, not to mention the millions it makes in sales to the public. That issue had 34.5 million video views online, while a free mobile app had 500,000 downloads in the opening week alone. So it's a very happy 50th birthday indeed for owner Time Inc. The swimsuit issue is more than just scantily-clad women in bikinis gallivanting around the world's most picturesque beaches -- it's a business behemoth. Supermodels such as Christine Brinkley, Elle Macpherson, Tyra Banks and Heidi Klum have featured on the cover, while sports stars including Maria Sharapova and Danica Patrick have featured along with pop star Beyonce Knowles. But leading the way was an aspiring young German, then living in New York after spending several years in Brazil. Known at the time as Babette March, she had featured on the Paris catwalks and been a regular on the pages of Vogue and Elle. In November 1963 she received a call from J. Frederick Smith, a renowned glamor photographer with whom she had worked regularly. ""There were about five or six photographers who seemed to like me, and that's how things started for me really -- he was one of them,"" she told CNN. ""We did a lot of pictures together and he worked for Sports Illustrated on and off. He asked if I wanted to come on a trip to Mexico and I thought, 'Why not?' "" It wasn't the money -- as little as $50 a day for the 10-day shoot -- that persuaded her, rather the lure of a trip to the sun-drenched island resort of Cozumel. ""It was a great trip -- so much fun,"" she recalls. ""There weren't any people there, not like now. You have to remember Cancun (on the mainland) didn't really exist then, the only people there were the Mexican Air Force. And they seemed to enjoy the shoot! ""There was nothing about it being a cover shoot, it was just a shoot, something fun and something different. ""Each day, we'd have breakfast and then the photographer would tell as where to go. He was just constantly snapping pictures. I was put in my bathing suit, and that was it."" When she and the rest of the team boarded the plane back to the United States, their high spirits were shattered soon after touching down in Dallas, Texas. ""When we landed, we were grounded and it was announced that President John F. Kennedy had been shot dead,"" Beatty says. ""The whole plan was just crushed. People were screaming and crying, it was awful. I'll never forget that. The dream trip had ended on such a terribly sad note."" Beatty quickly moved on to her next job -- she continued modeling until 1979 -- and gave very little thought to Sports Illustrated, as did they to her. ""That was the only time I ever worked for them,"" she says. ""I never heard from them again. ""Of course I had no idea I'd be on the cover of the first issue (which was merely a short supplement to the magazine) and of course I had no idea it would become as big as it did."" But she made the cover: her head turned to the side, smiling cheekily in a white bikini as the Mexican waters lapped against her ankles. Even now, people still send her copies of the magazine asking for an autograph. ""There are marriage proposals too,"" says the married Beatty, ""and I'm 72, I tell you!"" It's perhaps apt that her modeling career should have begun with her wearing a white bikini. As a 15-year-old, she went to the beach in Fort Lauderdale, where she lived with her family at the time, wearing a white, tassled outfit -- which proved to be too risque for the time. ""It was 1959 and I got asked to leave the beach because of what I was wearing,"" she says. ""But also on the beach was a photographer for Eastman Kodak, and he basically discovered me. My first job was outside a camera shop for $25. I still think I've got the check for it somewhere. I then started modeling properly in New York in 1961."" Beatty, and her husband Dale, live nowhere near the beach these days. They relocated from California to Halfway, a small town of 350 people in Oregon, where he works as a sculptor and she paints. Art has been a big part of her life, from self-portraits to the nature landscapes and home interiors that hang from the walls of her home gallery -- which sell for $7,000 each. And when not painting, she loves nothing more than hiking with her dogs in the surrounding, undulating terrain, where it's not uncommon to see coyote, deer, antelope and elk. ""Painting's always been a big part of my life and where I live is the perfect setting for inspiration,"" she says. ""For me, personally I love the bright colors."" While in Oregon, she is known as Babette Beatty. To the rest of the world, she is the first cover star of one of the world's most celebrated magazines.","Babette Beatty was the first model on the cover of Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue .

"As new allegations emerged surrounding the FIFA bidding process for the World Cup finals, an American former anti-terrorism lawyer will interview leading figures from Qatar's bid team in Oman Monday. Those interviews will take place against the backdrop of calls for a new vote on which country should host the 2022 event. Qatar has promised laywer Michael Garcia ""full cooperation"" after soccer's global governing body was engulfed in new scandal following a British newspaper's  damning investigation into the bidding process for the World Cup finals. The story alleges a Qatari official paid more than $5 million in an attempt to secure support for his country's successful bid to host the 2022 tournament. The Sunday Times alleges that Mohamed bin Hammam made secret payments to soccer officials in the run up to the controversial ballot. Bin Hammam, the former president of the Asian Football Confederation, was a member of FIFA's powerful 24-person executive committee charged with voting on who hosted the finals at the time of the vote in 2010. Despite the country's small size, a technical report from FIFA calling its bid ""high risk"" and summer temperatures that can exceed 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), Qatar shocked the world by winning the right to host the 2022 finals, defeating bids by the United States, Australia, Japan and South Korea. FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce has said he would back a re-vote, potentially opening the possibility of the U.S. staging the 2022 tournament. When FIFA voted on who should host the 2022 World Cup in 2010, the organization 's president  Sepp Blatter reportedly voted for the U.S., while a potential rival for the presidency, UEFA chief Michel Platini, voted for Qatar. 'Millions' of e-mails . The Sunday Times claims to have seen millions of e-mails detailing payments to officials in the Caribbean, Africa and the Pacific designed to secure support for the tiny, gas-rich Middle Eastern emirate's quixotic bid to host the world's most popular sports tournament. ""Bit by bit, we have been unraveling it and finally we hit the mother lode,"" Sarah Baxter, deputy editor of the Sunday Times, told CNN in an interview. ""We've seen millions of documents that prove without a shadow of doubt that corruption was involved. There is clear evidence linking payments to people who have influence over the decision of who hosted the World Cup. ""You also have a bunch of officials with a bearing on the vote begging favors. They were prepared to sell their influence. What bin Hammam was doing was buying people up who could have influence."" Denial from the 2022 bid committee . Mohamed bin Hammam responded by saying he would not be making any comments other than he believed ""that the truth will find its way to (the) public one way or another."" The Qatar 2022 bid committee strenuously denies any wrongdoing or knowledge of any payments made on its behalf. ""Mohamed bin Hammam played no official or unofficial role in Qatar's 2022 Bid Committee,"" it said in a statement sent to CNN. ""As was the case with every other member of FIFA's executive committee, our bid team had to convince Mr. bin Hammam of the merits of our bid. ... ""Following today's newspaper articles, we vehemently deny all allegations of wrongdoing. ""We will take whatever steps are necessary to defend the integrity of Qatar's bid and our lawyers are looking into this matter. ""The right to host the tournament was won because it was the best bid and because it is time for the Middle East to host its first FIFA World Cup."" Dogged by allegations . Almost as soon as Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup finals, the process was dogged by allegations of bribery and corruption. In the run-up to the 2010 vote, two FIFA executive committee members were suspended after another Sunday Times investigation filmed Nigeria's Amos Adamu and Tahiti's Reynald Temarii appearing to offer to sell their votes in exchange for money. Bin Hammam was banned from all football-related activities for life after first being accused of offering bribes to soccer officials in the Caribbean seeking support for his doomed 2011 bid to replace Sepp Blatter as FIFA president. He was cleared of those allegations after a hearing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport but was later banned for different ""conflict of interest"" charges relating to his time as AFC president. Ethics investigation . The Sunday Times' allegations come ahead of a FIFA-commissioned ethics investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments. That two-year investigation has been led by Garcia. ""We are cooperating fully with Mr. Garcia's ongoing investigation and remain totally confident that any objective enquiry (sic) will conclude we won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup fairly,"" the Qatar bid team added in its statement. Several leading figures in the sport have called for the vote over hosting the 2022 World Cup finals to be rerun. ""I certainly as a member of the executive committee would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation (in Garcia's report) was for a revote,""  FIFA vice president Boyce told the BBC on Sunday. But FIFA's head of media, Delia Fischer, told CNN that Boyce was not speaking to the BBC on behalf of FIFA when he mentioned a rerun of the vote and that the organization would not be making a statement until after Garcia's meeting with the Qatari delegation in Oman. Garcia didn't immediately reply to attempts by CNN to contact him. Murky world of favors and junkets . The 11-page Sunday Times investigation uncovers an alleged murky world of international payments, favors and junkets. Among the allegations are claims that bin Hammam ran a network of 10 slush funds to make payments to 30 African football officials and that up to $1.6 million had been paid to former FIFA Vice President Jack Warner. Although the Qatar 2022 bid team denies any involvement from bin Hammam, a 2010 interview seems to suggest he did have some role to play. ""When it comes to executive committee members, we don't really get involved in what happens inside the committee because FIFA is very strict,"" the bid's chairman, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, told World Football Insider a month before the 2010 vote. ""But outside the executive committee and within the bid itself, Mohamed bin Hammam has been a very good mentor to us. He's been very helpful in advising us how to go about with our messaging and can have the biggest impact. ""He's always been advising us and always been by our side. He's definitely our biggest asset in the bid."" The Pacific connection . One of the most damaging claims centers on the fate of the former head of the Oceania Football Confederation, Reynald Temarii. After Temarii had been caught on camera allegedly offering to sell his vote, he was suspended from the executive committee and had, according to the e-mails seen by the Sunday Times, been preparing to resign, allowing his deputy to vote in his stead. But the Sunday Times alleges that bin Hammam paid Temarii's legal fees of $300,000 before the Tahitian decided that he would not resign after all and would instead fight the charges. That move effectively took a vote in the executive committee away the Oceania Football Confederation, which was likely to choose Qatar's rival Australia. ""I don't know whether it is a smoking gun, but the Reynald Temarii allegations are very significant,"" said James Corbett, one of the world's leading journalists on FIFA's World Cup bidding process. ""What it shows is clear manipulation by someone very close to the bid,"" he added. Corbett believes that many of the accusations of bribery and illicit payments could be connected to bin Hammam's abortive presidential campaign rather than the 2022 vote. ""Putting someone (a soccer official) from, say, Somalia up in a five-star hotel and giving them $5,000 won't win you the World Cup bid,"" he said. ""But it will get that person's support for a FIFA presidential bid. And that could have future use."" Blatter and FIFA to blame? The problem, he believes, goes even deeper than corrupt payments from a few individuals. ""It's not about bin Hammam or even Qatar,"" Corbett said. ""It is about a system that is rotten to the core and easily manipulated. There's also serious questions that need to be asked about Blatter. ""Bin Hammam was heavily involved in his (Blatter's presidential) campaign in 1998. Was he using these tactics to help defeat Lennart Johansson? Questions need to be asked."" The Sunday Times has promised to release more revelations in the run-up to the World Cup in Brazil, which starts in less than two weeks. ""Qatar itself should call for a rerun of the vote,"" Baxter believes. ""The bid was tainted. We are not saying there's no right of the Middle East to host the World Cup. But Qatar won through corrupt means. ""How can you host the World Cup with integrity? That is why they should press for the vote to be rerun. And if not they should be forced. FIFA's reputation is at stake. It is crying out for reform."" The end game? The latest allegations come after a slew of negative reports surrounding Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup finals. Attempts to move the tournament from summer to winter have angered Europe's powerful and rich soccer leagues. Allegations of migrant worker abuse under the so-called kafala system of sponsorship, which has been heavily criticized by international human rights groups, have also tainted what had been greeted as a jubilant moment in Qatar's short history. But the latest allegations, coupled with Garcia's imminent report on the bid process, could be the beginning of the end game. ""This is a turning point,"" said Corbett. ""For the first time we have seen hard allegations regarding manipulation of the bid process. ""I think this is the beginning of the end.""","Investigation by British newspaper alleges network of payments for World Cup votes .

"Osh, Kyrgyzstan (CNN) -- Smoke rose over the streets of Osh and sporadic gunfire could be heard Monday as ethnic groups continued to battle in the strategically important Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan. An estimated 80,000 ethnic Uzbeks have fled the ongoing clashes against ethnic Kyrgyz, causing one aid official to describe the situation as a ""humanitarian catastrophe,"" according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. At least 114 people have been killed in the clashes, and another 1,458 have been wounded, Kyrgystan's national news agency AKI Press reported Sunday. It is the most serious outbreak of ethnic violence in the former Soviet republic since 1990, when hundreds died after clashes between Uzbeks and Kyrgyz in Osh, the country's second city. Refugees who fled the violence are desperate for food, a top European official said Monday. ""People are screaming, 'We need food; we need food,' to those who are passing by,"" EU Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva said. The World Food Programme has emergency stocks in the country and can deploy food quickly, she said, but would then need to restock urgently. The United States committed over $800,000 for immediate humanitarian assistance to be provided through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), according to the U.S. Embassy in Bishkek. U.S. officials are working with the provisional government to determine how to best distribute another $200,000 in medical and emergency supplies. The United Nations says it is sending an emergency team to Uzbekistan to aid refugees who crossed the border. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees is airlifting aid from emergency stockpiles in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and sending logistics, operations and field officers ""immediately,"" it said in a statement. U.N. Security Council President Claude Heller said the group condemns the ""continued acts of violence in the Kyrgyz republic and notes the need to support the delivery of humanitarian assistance."" He said the council is still assessing the situation in Kyrgyzstan and calls for ""calm and a return to the rule of law"" in the country. The Uzbek government estimates that 75,000 people have fled into the country since Friday, slightly below Red Cross estimates. The violence comes two months after President Kurmanbek Bakiev was overthrown after bloody clashes between police and protesters in the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Opposition leaders had accused Bakiev of corruption and consolidating power by keeping key economic and security posts in the hands of relatives or close associates. Kyrgyzstan hosts a U.S. military transport base that is vital for supplying its troops in Afghanistan. It also has a Russian military base and strategically important natural gas pipelines. According to one report, the death toll is much higher than official figures suggest. Local officials in Osh, the city worst affected by the violence, said that at least 500 ethnic Uzbeks have been killed, according to Ferghana.Ru, an independent news agency. And the situation seemed to be continuing early Monday as a Uzbek neighborhood in Osh looked grim. At least three bodies were on the street, buried in rubble. Goats and sheep had been killed and burned in yards. Some homes were vandalized with spray-painted signs proclaiming ""get out of Kyrgyzstan."" Red Cross representatives visited refugee camps Sunday in Uzbekistan where 30,000 adults, mostly women, have registered, spokeswoman Anna Nelson said. Each woman, Nelson said, has two or three children with her. Uzbek authorities are providing refugees with food and shelter, but camps are inundated by the flood of people crossing the border, Nelson said. Red Cross officials said they saw 250 injured people in the camps, including about 40 Uzbek men with gunshot wounds, according to Nelson. ""We do not yet fully understand the true scale of the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding in southern Kyrgyzstan,"" said Francois Blancy, deputy head of the Red Cross regional office in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The interim government worked this weekend to quell the upsurge of violence, imposing states of emergency in Osh, where fighting between ethnic Uzbek and Kyrgyz youths led to mass rioting, and in Jalal-Abad in order to keep the unrest from spreading there, it said. But the measures did little to calm the situation Sunday. Russia Today reported that the interim government has given police permission to shoot to kill rioters on the streets. Members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization -- comprised of Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- are to meet Monday to discuss the crisis, official Russian news agency RIA-Novosti reported. Turkey has established a crisis desk to help find ways to address the violence in Kyrgyzstan, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said. Turkey is sending two planes to are to help evacuate Turkish citizens trapped in the area. The United States is monitoring developments and is calling for a ""rapid restoration of peace and public order in the city of Osh and elsewhere where it appears ethnic violence is occurring,"" according to a statement released Saturday by the State Department. A small group of expatriates from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan demonstrated outside the White House on Sunday, calling for President Barack Obama's help in ending the crisis. About 50 people from the Uzbek Initiative Group carried signs reading ""Stop the killing"" and chanted ""Bring peace to Kyrgyzstan."" The group had sent a letter to Obama ""urging the United States and the United Nations to assist in bringing a halt to the current ethnic unrest in southern Kyrgyzstan,"" describing the clashes as ""the worst ethnic violence in the region since 1990 when hundreds were killed before the quick intervention of Soviet troops.""

"Australia plans to create the world's largest network of marine reserves, its government announced Thursday. The proposal would increase the number of protected areas from 27 to 60 and would cover 3.1 million square kilometers (1.9 million square miles), roughly one-third of Australia's waters. ""We have an incredible opportunity to turn the tide on protection of the oceans and Australia can lead the world in marine protection,"" said Tony Burke, the country's environment minister. ""This new network of marine reserves will help ensure that Australia's diverse marine environment, and the life it supports, remain healthy, productive and resilient for future generations."" The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the Coral Sea Commonwealth marine reserve will become the world's largest adjoining marine protected area, covering 1.3 million square kilometers. Interactive: Conservation hits and misses . ""Our aim is to protect our unique marine environment, while supporting coastal communities and marine industries around the country,"" said Burke. ""Over the coming months, the government will consult the fishing industry and fisheries management agencies on the design and implementation of a fisheries adjustment assistance package."" WWF Australia hailed the plan as an ""important example to the world."" The newly created sanctuaries would give protection to Australia's biggest undersea mountain range, the Diamantina fracture zone off the southwest coast, as well as new parts of the Coral Sea that are critical nesting sites for green turtles and rich in large predatory fish and sharks. Paul Gambin from WWF Australia cautioned that some areas equally rich in biodiversity had not been included in the plan, possibly because of their proximity to rich reserves of fossil fuels. ""Oil and gas rigs are still moving ever closer to places like the stunning Rowley Shoals and Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia,"" said Gambin in a press statement. ""These are among the jewels in the crown for Australia's marine environment and surrounding waters have not been protected under this plan.""

"Usually, airstrikes, rebels seizing control of oil fields and refineries, plus a severe refugee crisis are a recipe for market panic. That is the situation unfolding in Northern Iraq, but without a spike in prices, even though energy companies are retrenching. There's been a growing list of small and medium sized explorers who have suspended operations: London listed Afren, Dublin based Petroceltic and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company, known as TAQA here in the UAE. Chevron, a major oil company, is trimming non-essential staff and others will likely do the same. Gulf Keystone, an early mover in the Kurdish Region, said the situation is not good, but after fortifying their facilities, production is holding steady at 25,000 barrels a day. What we have now, after the initial panic when ISIS made its move into Iraq, are two distinct camps: Explorers suspending operations and producers battening down the hatches and producing as best they can. According to the Kurdish Regional Government, supplies up north are still above 300,000 barrels a day. Tucked into the IEA's latest monthly report is one of today's harsher realities: ISIS has taken control of seven fields, which typically produce about 80 thousand barrels a day. Energy and security sources here in the region tell me that oil is starting to find its way onto the black market, offered at a heavy discount. Beyond the fighting, other complex problems still exist that could easily tilt the balance in Iraq. In Baiji, near the country's center, 300,000 barrels of refining capacity is off-line after ISIS rebels fought for control, according to the Iraq Energy Institute's Luay al-Khatteeb. Oil is being exported via pipeline from the Kurdish region through the Port of Ceyhan in Turkey.  Tankers have sailed, but Baghdad is blocking sales with an on-going dispute over who actually controls that oil. Despite all that, Iraq continues to supply the market with an ample level of crude.  According to the IEA's monthly report, overall production is 3.1 million barrels a day, down slightly from the month before.  Exports are up again to 2.44 million and that is what the market is concentrating on. But there is a price to pay for the violence in the north and political in-fighting in Baghdad. The country's original target of expanding capacity to over 4 million barrels a day will be missed, according to al- Khatteeb. With this level of uncertainty, the international oil companies (IOCs) may tighten their purse strings, waiting to see if the U.S. intervention can help stabilize the country before committing more money for exploration and production. The big bounty for Iraq and the energy majors remains the oil rich south around Basra which, despite initial security threats against international oil workers, is pumping and exporting crude at near record levels. BP initially trimmed staff when ISIS began its march into Iraq, but at the end of July, CEO Bob Dudley went out of his way to assure investors production is back up to normal with plans for expansion. ""The Rumaila field is now the second largest producing field in the world at about 1.4 million barrels per day,"" said Dudley. ""If you think about the map of Iraq, it is down in the bottom of the funnel, near the Kuwait border, in the desert, in an unpopulated area."" Lukoil has put $4 billion into the West Qurna 2 field in the south -- one of the world's largest oil fields -- and despite initial delays is still producing 300,000 barrels a day without interruption. What we have learned in the past two months of fighting, is another harsh reality: Money talks. Iraq may have difficulty staying glued together as a country or even passing a petroleum law to govern revenue sharing, but securing production and distribution have been paramount. And that persistence earned the country $53 billion last month alone. REA D MORE: Iraq's 'new reality' shakes global oil markets .

"The relationship between France and Germany is the barometer of the political health of Europe. Even in a European Union of 27 member states, and which has expanded far beyond the original six countries founding the union, Franco-German relations are the drivers of Europe's politics. This means that changes in the leadership of either country matter -- and the personal chemistry between the German chancellor and the French president have wider ramifications for Europe. The election of Francois Hollande as the new French president has created an uncertainty in the relationship between Europe's two leading states. Hollande is a socialist elected on a platform of opposition to the European Union austerity and euro stabilization program. The problem for Franco-German relations is that the program was agreed by Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy with the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. This creates a political dislocation at the heart of the EU, just as the euro is under renewed pressure with the scenario of a Greek exit from the currency becoming all too possible. Can this Franco-German rift be mended? Both leaders will do their best to appear publicly in agreement and the first meeting between the two leaders this week was all smiles. But both leaders have limited room for maneuver. The French public voted decisively against a program of austerity in electing Hollande -- and France faces elections to its National Assembly next month. The president will be seeking a working majority for his Socialist party. Now will not be a moment for Hollande to publicly backtrack. Merkel faces her own domestic political difficulties. The German people are hostile to expanded support for eurozone economies in difficulty, such as Greece and Spain, and there is a possible bailout for Spain looming. In state elections in Germany at the weekend Merkel's party suffered an electoral setback, losing control of Germany's most populous state to the opposition Social Democratic Party. The German public appears to dislike Merkel's austerity program at home but is also  strongly resistant to supporting the economies of other states such as France, which are asking for Germany to take measures to stimulate the wider European economy. And a general election is on the horizon in Germany next year. The stakes for the European Union of a difficult Franco-German relationship are high. A credible plan to preserve the eurozone remains elusive, with France and Germany's agreement on a common course of action looking difficult to broker. The rescue of the eurozone is a political and economic challenge of a magnitude that the EU has not faced since its creation in the 1950s and neither Merkel nor Hollande look to be leaders who have the capacity for the bold leadership on European integration that their predecessors demonstrated across successive decades. Other European leaders from Europe's smaller states will be pressing them hard to demonstrate decisive leadership. In the absence of a strong British engagement with the EU, and Spain and Italy's leaders preoccupied with the precarious condition of their own economies, there are no other candidates for the leadership role in Europe. Merkel and Hollande are by default the only credible leadership team in Europe and their developing relationship carries the burden of Europe's future. Whether they are now able to move on from their ""first date"" this week to build a successful political marriage is the key to the EU's capacity to navigate its way out of its current crisis. A dysfunctional relationship between the two leaders will see the EU's current crisis prolonged.","Richard Whitman says the election of Francois Hollande has created uncertainty .

"Meissen, Germany (CNN) -- Rising rivers menaced swaths of Germany, the Czech Republic and Austria Tuesday, as floodwaters inundated historic cities and forced mass evacuations of low-lying areas. The floods are feared to be the worst since 2002, when parts of Germany and the Czech Republic were devastated and communities in Austria, Slovakia, Russia and Romania were affected. Seven deaths have been reported in the Czech Republic, while southern and eastern areas of Germany, including Bavaria and Saxony, are also badly impacted by recent heavy rains. Images from Passau, a city in southern Bavaria where the Danube River is joined by two other rivers, show dirty brown water running through the streets of the historic old town after water levels passed a 500-year-old record. Floodwaters in Bavaria are now receding but the crest on the Danube continues east into Austria and could threaten cities such as Vienna, in Austria, and Bratislava, in Slovakia, said CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Large parts of Meissen, a town built on the banks of the Elbe River in Saxony, were also inundated after flood defenses were breached overnight Monday to Tuesday. Those with homes and businesses were moving valuables and trying to sandbag their properties to protect them from the rising waters as the town's evacuation was ordered. German Chancellor Angela Merkel visited towns in the region Tuesday and promised 100 million euros ($130 million) in emergency aid for affected areas. The German military, government agencies and local authorities are helping with efforts to evacuate residents and protect properties. The heaviest rain fell over Bavaria, Austria, Switzerland and the western Czech Republic from Saturday through Monday, with total rainfall over those days well over 3 inches for many locations, said Miller. Salzburg in Austria recorded its entire monthly average of rainfall (155 millimeters, or 6.1 inches) in only the first two days of the month, he said. The high waters also will have an impact on businesses beyond the communities directly affected by flooding. The region's rivers are important in the transportation of freight and people, providing thousands of kilometers of navigable channels, as well as supporting agriculture, power generation and tourism. Emily Russ, an American living in Vienna, told CNN iReport that a number of Danube cruise ships appeared to be being held in the city until water levels subside. She saw 15 on Tuesday where normally there would be one or two, she said. Deaths reported in Czech Republic . Water levels have peaked in the Czech capital, Prague, but places downstream in the Czech Republic and along the Elbe River in Germany are still at risk. A state of emergency is in place in most of Bohemia, the western part of the country, said Nicole Zaoralova, a spokeswoman for the Czech Fire Department. Seven people have died as a result of the latest flooding, she said. Among the victims, two people died in a house collapse, one woman died when she was hit by a falling tree and another person was electrocuted. Most of northern Bohemia, around the Vltava and Labe rivers, remains at risk of flooding, she said. ""We have evacuated 10,000 people so far,"" said Zaoralova. In Usti nad Labem, in northern Bohemia, many households are without electricity. Melnik, 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Prague, was being evacuated Tuesday morning. The Berounka River, which flows into the Vltava, peaked overnight, prompting officials to raise anti-flood barriers in Prague to a level intended to cope with ""100-year"" floods. So far, however, the Vltava River has not reached the level of the devastating floods of 11 years ago, Zaoralova said. Transportation is severely disrupted in the capital, Prague, as well as other parts of Bohemia, she said. But while several metro stations in Prague have been closed, the subway system has not been flooded as it was in 2002, she said, thanks to a flood barrier system put in place since then. ""We do not expect the situation in Prague to become worse,"" she said. Rainfall in Prague has already totaled more than 102 millimeters in June, more than the city's monthly average of 73 millimeters, Miller said. Zoo animals moved to safety . Staff at the Prague Zoo also swung into action as the risk of flooding became apparent. Zoo director Miroslav Bobek said the animals had been moved from the entire lower part of the zoo, which lies by the Vltava River, to other enclosures on higher ground. ""Hundreds of animals were evacuated, including large cats, tapirs, the whole monkey pavilion and the gorillas,"" he said in a statement. ""The gorillas' pavilion includes a special 'flood tower' that has been built specifically for moments like this, because the pavilion is situated directly by the River Vltava."" Most of the gorillas were lured to the safety of the tower using food, but the oldest male had to be tranquilized and carried up there after he refused to move, he said. Two small birds drowned in one exhibit but the other animals were saved, he said. ""We are now working with other zoos in the Czech Republic to see where we can place animals that won't be able to return to their pavilions soon,"" Bobek added. The zoo is expected to reopen Wednesday. The flood damage is currently estimated to cost 160 million Czech Koruna ($8.1 million.) The zoo was hit badly during the 2002 floods, when several animals, including an elephant, died. Since then, anti-flood barriers have been built. Volunteers fill sand bags . Prague resident Katerina Netikova has spent the past two days helping volunteer efforts to stave off the worst of the flooding, coordinated by authorities and local people using social media. On Sunday, she headed to the suburban town of Radotin, on the Berounka River, where residents directed the efforts. ""They knew exactly what is needed, where people should go and what should they do. They had the experience from previous flooding (in 2002). They were securing the town, putting barriers where needed,"" Netikova told CNN. On Monday, she spent the night working at a fire station in central Prague, near the worst affected areas of the Holesovice neighborhood, helping to make flood barriers -- heavy-duty tube-shaped sacks filled with sand. ""It's hard work, because the sand is wet and gets really heavy,"" Netikova said. ""People were rotating the whole night -- students from nearby university halls, Scouts, local people and more volunteers sent in by the town. ""The firefighters just told them what to do, and then the volunteers organized everything among themselves."" CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Meissen and Ivana Kottasova reported from London, where Laura Smith-Spark reported and wrote.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- When you think of high-risk jobs, you probably do not think of judges. But perhaps you should. In 2005, a man angry about a Chicago judge's ruling killed the judge's husband and mother, authorities say. According to the U.S. Marshals Service, the number of threats against federal judges and prosecutors has mushroomed from 500 in 2003 to 1,278 in 2008. It is on track to go even higher this year. There are no statistics on the number of threats against state and local judges. U.S. District Court Judge Reggie Walton has had his share. His decision not to grant bail to Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, Scooter Libby, triggered several threats, but there have been others. ""I received some threats in a case about a bear hunt that I refused to stop from animal-rights activists. I also received some after I issued a Second Amendment opinion,"" Walton says. As a result, the U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for the protection of federal judges, installed an elaborate camera surveillance system at Walton's house. He has taken other protective measures himself, which he declines to disclose. ""You can't let it impede on what you do as a judge, but obviously you're concerned about your security and the security of your family, so you do take it seriously.""  Watch how threats have increased » . Bobby Fagan, deputy assistant director of the U.S. Marshals Service, also takes it seriously. ""Our third branch of government is where the rule of law and our basic freedoms are upheld day in and day out. The civilized world could not function without our judicial branch, and for them to be independent and safe and not intimidated or harmed ... is a sacred responsibility of the Marshals."" The Marshals' Judiciary Security Division has opened a threat management center to collect, analyze and investigate inappropriate communications with judges. Fagan says it is sometimes a challenge to distinguish between a threat and a legitimate expression of opinion. In borderline cases attorneys are consulted to determine whether a communication crosses the line of protected First Amendment speech. Fagan says the people sending the threats are ""individuals frustrated with the legal system"" who ""feel that they have not gotten their day in court."" Investigation often reveals that they have made previous threats against judges in state and local courts. Fagan says the threats often escalate as a case moves through the legal system. ""The federal court is their final forum, the last resort in their minds to get justice."" Judge Laurie White of the Orleans Parish Criminal Court in Louisiana says she has not gotten any threats in her two years sitting on the bench. However, she did get threats when she was a prosecutor and a defense attorney, and she is well aware of the dangers. She feels exposed to possible danger from her doorstep to her courtroom. ""If you're going to get elected and be in the rough and tough world of criminal justice, you can't be shy and you'd better have nerves of steel. And you better have a strong gut. Because it is not easy, it's not an easy spot, and I think you do this job at your own personal risk."" In Louisiana judges are the only ones allowed to carry guns in the courtroom, but White doesn't want to discuss whether she does. In 2005, authorities say, a man who was distraught about the dismissal of his medical malpractice case murdered the husband and mother of Judge Joan Lefkow in Chicago. That tragic case has led to better reporting of threats against judges, according the the U.S. Marshals. But Walton has his own theory on why the volume of threats has increased. ""I think the unfortunate reality is our society has become so partisan ... that when you have hot-button issues, people take it to the extreme."" He places some of the blame on talk show hosts. ""The type of vicious attacks sometimes that you see coming from certain players in the media, I think contributes to the problem."" When asked what can be done about the situation, Walton responds: ""It will take societal change, I think,"" and heaves a deep sigh.

"Every day, millions of people like 16-year-old Celeste live their lives shouldering a huge emotional weight forged by fear, uncertainty and separation. She was only 10 years old when the reality of her family's desperate situation hit her in the face. Rolando Zenteno has lived more than half his 18 years in the United States, yet he still feels like an outsider. Another undocumented immigrant -- Prerna Lal -- is fighting to stay in her adopted homeland and dreaming of becoming an immigration lawyer. As Washington lawmakers try to hammer out an immigration reform plan while avoiding political gridlock, millions of people find themselves caught in the middle -- suspended between two worlds -- while not really belonging to either. Some immigrants spoke to CNN, giving permission to use their full names. Others chose to withhold their last names, fearing it would affect their legal status. Here are their stories. 'Now's the time' to move on immigration, Obama says . Celeste, 16: She's carrying a 'big old rock' Celeste was 10 years old when police pulled over her dad while he was driving near their south Georgia home. She recalls crying as she frantically translated the officer's words from English into Spanish for her father. She feared her family would be deported back to Mexico, but the officer let them go. The family got a second chance, but Celeste never shook the dread that filled her that day -- the fear that she could be sent back to a country she barely remembers, or get separated from the family that she loves. That's why immigration reform must happen now, she says. ""It would be a big old rock that would be lifted from our shoulders,"" she says. She says any policy changes should create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants like her parents, who are agricultural workers. Celeste says they came to the United States from Mexico to give their children a better life. Last year, the Obama administration's deferred action program gave her the hope of a reprieve. But that isn't enough, she says. ""It's like being out in the cold and me having the only blanket in the family."" Mexico welcomes new U.S. immigration reform push . Rolando Zenteno, 18: 'In limbo' Zenteno has lived in the United States since he was 7, and says he identifies more with American culture than his native Mexico. But he feels like he's in limbo, and it's a constant struggle. ""I identify myself with the American culture,"" he says, ""but at the same time the American society is like 'No, you're not part of us.'"" Zenteno says talk of immigration reform is encouraging, even though it's a problem the president has pledged before to tackle -- and then failed to solve. Actions speak louder than words, says Zenteno, a freshman who is studying journalism at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, Georgia. ""At the end of the day, the political parties will do what they can"" for votes, he says. And with what he's seen so far when it comes to immigration reform, Zenteno says if he ever had a chance to vote in the United States, he wouldn't cast a ballot for Democrats or Republicans. Ana, 20: Everything is complicated . Ana was 10 when her mother decided she'd had enough of Michoacan, Mexico, packed up the family and moved to the United States. ""When you first get here, you think like you're like everyone else,"" Ana says. Sometime around the eighth grade, though, she began to realize she was different. While friends were starting to think about their futures, where they might move to or go to school, Ana ""hit the wall."" She feels stuck. Everything is complicated because she is undocumented -- finding an apartment, a good job, securing loans for school. Ana currently works at a jewelry kiosk in Atlanta. If immigration reform were to become a reality, she says she'd like to study psychology and find a better paying job so as not to be a burden to her parents. She'd also like to go to Mexico to visit relatives she hasn't seen since she was a little girl. ""If they want to make it a little strict, that's OK ... so they don't think they're giving it to us,"" Ana says. Immigration plan: New era of bipartisanship or political necessity? Prerna Lal, 28: It's not just Latinos . Many Americans connect the immigration issue to Latinos, but it's broader than that, says Lal. She came to the United States from the Pacific island of Fiji when she was just 14. Now, she's fighting a legal battle in court to avoid deportation. ""I don't think it's a bad thing to really focus on this amazingly powerful voting bloc,"" she says. ""I do think that people need to look at immigration from a lens that shifts from just 'those Mexicans just coming across the border' to the many people from Asia and from Europe who are still stuck in the system."" The government should stop deporting people, she says, and focus on fixing a broken system that leaves many people in limbo even when they follow the rules. ""Everyone talks about going to the back of the line being the number one thing that undocumented immigrants should do. I have been in several different lines. ... The issue is there are so many undocumented immigrants that are caught up in lines that never really go anywhere,"" she says. Lal is a third-year law student at George Washington University. No matter what happens with the latest reform efforts, she plans to become an immigration lawyer. Tania, 43: Citizenship means everything . Tania's family is a hodgepodge of legal statuses. She and her husband are undocumented, as are their two oldest children. Their younger four were born in the United States and are citizens. ""For my family, it would be the best,"" she says about immigration reform. She wants a change that would lead to citizenship. ""For my husband, it would mean a good job where he wouldn't be abused by bosses. And for my children, it would mean they could continue their studies,"" she says. Her husband works at a recycling plant. She is from Ecuador. Tania spoke at an immigrant rights organization in Queens, New York. Voices for and agaiunst immigration reform proposals . Vasant Shetty, 59: Hope and hard work . In India, Shetty says he never could have imagined starting his own business or sending his two children to college. In the United States, he has done both of those things. On Monday, Shetty was answering phones at the front desk of his motel in central Arizona. When he bought it, he said the property was in shambles. He then renovated it into a place he's proud to own. ""I came to this country with lots of hope, almost 15 years ago. It was very hard,"" he says. ""Today I have two motels. I never used any shortcuts. It was all hard work, all the time."" As President Barack Obama prepared to deliver an immigration reform speech in Nevada on Tuesday, Shetty braced himself  to appear in an Arizona immigration court. There, a judge may decide whether he should be deported. Immigrant rights activists have asked federal officials to drop their case against him, arguing that deporting him would unjustly separate his family and unfairly punish someone with no criminal history. Despite his personal battles with the U.S. immigration system, talk about immigration reform makes Shetty feel optimistic. Time and time again, he says, America has shown him kindness and opportunity. ""I believe this country has a lot of good people,"" he says. ""There is a way. They will do something good."" Mario, 33: Faith and fear . Mario lives in constant fear of being picked up by the police. ""Just to come here, I have to think,"" he says, weighing whether the trip was worth the risk. ""Here"" in his case is Plaza Fiesta, a mall in Atlanta that caters to immigrants. As he spoke Monday, TVs showed senators announcing their plan for reform. No one paid attention to the screens, which could barely be heard over the noise of the food court and nearby arcade games. Mario has lived in the United States for 13 years. He moved from the capital of Mexico. He cleans offices for a living and says he would like to see some sort of change so that he could find better work, maybe buy a car or a house. Mostly though, he wants reform so he could feel free, free of fear. ""I still have faith,"" he says. ""Who knows when? Maybe it won't happen tomorrow or the day after, but sometime ... Faith never dies."" Opinion: Immigrant - Can we trust Obama?","With talk of reform, undocumented immigrants reveal their fears and hopes .

"Some of the world's fastest growing population centers in Asia and Africa are at greatest risk from the impact of climate change, according to a new report. The Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI), published by UK-based risk analysis and mapping company Maplecroft, examined the climate risks and adaptive capacity of 193 nations factoring in population concentration, development, natural resources, agricultural dependency and conflict. A total of 30 countries were classified as being at ""extreme risk"" with Haiti, Bangladesh, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and Madagascar making up the top five most in peril, while Vietnam, Indonesia and India all ranked inside the top 30. The analysis, which forms part of Maplecroft's fourth annual Climate Change and Environmental Risk Atlas, also assesses climate impacts on towns and cities. Six out of the 20 fastest growing cities worldwide, including Calcutta, India, Manila in the Philippines, Indonesia's capital, Jakarta and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, were also classified as at ""extreme risk"" by the CCVI. ""Cities such as Manila, Jakarta and Calcutta are vital centers of economic growth in key emerging markets, but heat waves, flooding, water shortages and increasingly severe and frequent storm events may well increase as climate changes takes hold,"" principal environmental analyst at Maplecroft, Charlie Beldon said in a statement. Beldon says the impacts on cities -- where infrastructures are already struggling to cope -- could have far-reaching consequences for not just local people, but for businesses, national economies and international investors. Manila is the commercial center of the Philippines and its population is expected to rise 20% this decade, says the report. But, as recent back-to-back batterings from typhoons has shown, it is very vulnerable to climate change and has the highest exposure to extreme weather of the top 20 fastest growing cities in the world, according to the report. Thailand is currently dealing with its own climate-related tragedy which has left hundreds dead. According to Maplecroft, the disaster could have negative knock-on effects for business, particularly locally-based technical companies, leading to wider disruptions to global supply chains. Bangkok faces worst flooding yet . ""As these megacities grow, more people are forced to live on exposed land, often on flood plains or other marginal land. The expansion of population must be met with an equal expansion of infrastructure and civic amenities,"" Beldon said in a statement. The best-performing countries in the report are to be found almost exclusively in Northern Europe, with Finland, Ireland, Sweden and Norway all in the top ten. Iceland heads the list of least vulnerable countries, while Qatar is also considered a low climate risk, coming in 10th. The U.S. is categorized as low risk, although some coastal regions, including Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, North and South Carolina were rated as ""high risk."" Events like Hurricane Katrina, says the report, highlight how even the economically strongest countries with a large adaptive capacity can find themselves extremely vulnerable to climatic events. The report is released just days before the world's population is projected to reach seven billion. ""A huge task before us"" The United Nations Populations Fund's executive director Babatunde Osotimehin described the milestone as ""a challenge, an opportunity and a call to action,"" at the launch of The State of the World Population 2011 report in London on Wednesday.","New report assesses vulnerability of different nations to climate change effects .

"The announcement that Russia's prime minister, Vladimir Putin, will run for president in next March's election and will, if elected, appoint the current president, Dmitri Medvedev, as his prime minister brings to mind one of the most famous lines of Italian literature. In Giuseppe di Lampedusa's novel ""The Leopard,"" set in 19th century Sicily, a young nobleman tells his conservative uncle that clinging to the past will not work. ""If we want things to stay as they are,"" he says, ""things will have to change."" The Kremlin's proposed game of musical chairs is the kind of change whose only purpose is to keep things as they are. Putin and company have made clear for years that they do not intend to leave the scene quietly in 2012 when Medvedev's presidential term expires. The only question was in what configuration the two leaders would return. To stay in the same positions would have smacked of stagnation. Switching places, although hardly an inspired move, is the simplest way to stir the waters without fear of rocking the boat. It will provoke a temporary burst of indignation from Putin's many critics in the West, some of whom saw in Medvedev a champion of liberalism and civil rights. Some will predict a tightening of authoritarian rule. Yet the reality is that Putin's return to the Kremlin will not, in itself, change much. For the last four years, he has made all key decisions, with Medvedev's advice, and he will continue to do so. Those who imagine that a second Medvedev term would have produced dramatic breakthroughs face the problem of explaining why his first term did not. Unless Western leaders seek to punish Putin for his return, there is no reason to think it will undermine the ""reset"" of recent years. Improved relations with the US could not have been pursued had Putin not approved of the policy. Despite rumors of disagreements between the two leaders -- or, more often, their aides -- Putin and Medvedev have always worked together as a close-knit team. Ordinary Russians understand this well. Fifty-eight percent think stories about conflicts between the two are dreamed up by journalists and opposition politicians. Seventy-three percent see Medvedev as having continued Putin's policies rather than introducing new ones of his own. Both want to make Russia a strong, modern country and understand the need for an efficient economy linked into global markets and capital flows. At the same time, both want to protect a circle of friends and acquaintances who have grown rich during their years in power. Obviously, these two goals at times conflict. To maintain their popularity, the two leaders have employed a political division of labor. Putin's priority has been to keep mainstream Russians loyal. His occasional anti-Western jibes and earthy aphorisms aim to appeal to provincial sensibilities. But his main weapon has been money. During the financial crisis, the prime minister spent lavishly to soften the pain, increasing pensions by 24% in real terms in 2009 and another 13% in 2010. Although the economy shrank by 8% in 2009, government spending grew from 34 to 41% of GDP. Russians' real disposable income rose by 2% in 2009 and almost 5% in 2010. The strategy has largely worked. Although Putin's -- and Medvedev's -- approval ratings have fallen in the last two years, the decline has been relatively slow. The latest polls by the respected Levada Center show that 68% still approve of Putin's performance while 63% approve of Medvedev's. Barring a sudden collapse, this should be enough to get Putin comfortably through next March's election, even without the predictable electoral irregularities. But the support, although high, is thin, resting on economic performance and little else. Russians are worried about the future. Even as the economy stabilized after the worst of the global crisis, the percentage who think the country is heading in the right direction fell during the past year from 48% to 36%. Medvedev's political constituency has been the urban, educated elites in business, academia, the arts, and other spheres. He has courted them with articulate interviews, technology incubators, and tweets about modernization. The problem is that, after years of empty promises and speeches, almost all have given up on him. As prime minister, Medvedev will be plunged into the operational details of managing the economy at an unusually tricky moment. Although Russia achieved growth of 4% last year, it is not clear how long it can continue at this rate without major reforms to restore battered investor confidence. Oil and gas output is unlikely to increase much in coming years, especially if growth in the developed economies stalls. Aware of this, the two leaders have already announced reforms to simplify rules for investors and privatize large stakes in state-owned companies. Medvedev's first task will probably be implementing unpopular cuts to rein in public spending. He may have to back away from a commitment to triple defense expenditures -- a promise that prompted Alexei Kudrin, the long-serving finance minister and leading budget hawk, to say he would refuse to serve under Medvedev. The need to trim social spending threatens to turn Medvedev into a lightning rod for discontent, and could shorten his tenure. Yet there is also the chance that he will survive for long enough to see reforms bear fruit -- and claim a share of the credit. Having visibly chafed at the lack of levers to get his policies implemented, he will now get opportunities to implement some himself. How effective he proves in this new role -- and how much leeway Putin allows him -- remain to be seen.","Vladimir Putin will run for Russian president; Medvedev to become prime minister .

"Oscar Pistorius denied he picked on girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, his murder trial heard Thursday, as the chief prosecutor sought to portray the track star as an arrogant hothead who is reckless with guns. In a second day of blunt and aggressive questioning, prosecutor Gerrie Nel accused the double amputee of blaming other people for his mistakes, as he sought to prove the Olympic and Paralympic athlete murdered Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. Nel began by picking apart message exchanges between the couple, accusing the runner of screaming at his girlfriend and acting selfishly toward her. ""I didn't treat her badly,"" Pistorius replied. Asked if Steenkamp had lied when she said he picked on her incessantly, Pistorius replied: ""She never lied."" He later added: ""Reeva was never scared of me."" Nel highlighted an incident in which Steenkamp complained in a message that Pistorius asked her to stop chewing gum. He also read a message in which she defended herself against Pistorius' accusations that she flirted at a party. ""You were strong enough in that relationship to say stop your voices, stop your accents, stop chewing gum,"" Nel said. But Pistorius replied he gently told her to stop chewing gum before they got on camera at an event. Nel said Pistorius never responded to Steenkamp's message in which she said,  ""I'm the girl who fell in love with you."" ""We did a search ... the phrase 'I love you' appears twice on her phone, to her mother,"" the prosecutor said. ""Because it was all about Mr. Pistorius,"" Nel said. The athlete said he never got the opportunity to tell Steenkamp he loved her. 'You will blame anybody but yourself' In his second day of cross-examination, Pistorius faced persistent questions about what happened on the night he shot Steenkamp. Nel said Pistorius' version of events on the night of the killing ""is a lie"" and accused him of ""adapting"" events to suit his account. The runner recounted waking up during the night and getting out of bed to close the doors to a balcony, shut the curtains and move fans into the room. Steenkamp is then thought to have gotten out of bed, but the athlete said he was unable to see her because he had his back turned and the room was dark. Pistorius insisted again that the shooting was an accident and he did not intentionally fire four shots. Nel, with a reputation as one of South Africa's toughest attorneys, has sought to portray Pistorius as negligent with firearms. ""You will blame anybody but yourself,"" he said to the 27-year-old, cross-examining him about a separate incident in which Pistorius is accused of firing a pistol in a restaurant in January 2013. Pistorius said the gun was given to him by a friend under a restaurant table and went off by itself as he tried ""to make it safe."" He had wanted to see the gun but conceded he hadn't checked the magazine first. Police Capt. Christian Mangena gave evidence earlier in the trial, saying the weapon could fire only if the trigger was pulled. The athlete said he could not explain how the gun went off, and he questioned the decision of his own defense lawyer, Barry Roux, not to cross-examine Mangena on his evidence. ""Now you blame counsel Mr. Roux,"" Nel said. Pistorius, the most composed he has been in days, said he repeatedly took the blame for the incident, but the prosecutor tried to poke holes in his declaration. ""This is incredible. You never touched the trigger, the gun went off. You took the blame, you took responsibility, but no one remembers,"" Nel said. Pistorius also said two witnesses, an ex-girlfriend and a friend, were lying about an incident in which the runner is alleged to have fired his gun out the sunroof of a car. And he said he wasn't guilty of a fourth charge against him: illegal possession of ammunition found in a safe in his home after Steenkamp's death. ""You just don't want to accept responsibility for anything,"" Nel told Pistorius, whose answers to the accusations were short denials. 'You shot and killed her. Say it' A day before, a defiant Nel bluntly barked at the Olympic star on the stand: ""You shot and killed her. Say it -- 'I shot and killed Reeva Steenkamp,' "" No one disputes that Pistorius killed Steenkamp. But the prosecution is trying to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he did so knowingly and intentionally. The runner has admitted to the killing, but he said he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder in the bathroom when he fired through the door and killed her. Before Nel went after Pistorius, Roux had tossed his client a question to drive that argument home. He asked Pistorius if he intentionally killed Steenkamp. ""I did not intend to kill Reeva or anybody else for that matter,"" he replied. In a dramatic opening to his cross-examination Wednesday, Nel shocked the Pretoria court when he confronted Pistorius with a graphic photograph of Steenkamp showing the side and back of her skull, her hair matted with blood. Pistorius broke down and sobbed as Nel pushed him repeatedly to take responsibility for her killing. Pistorius has told the court what he remembered from the night Steenkamp died. The prosecution alleges Pistorius killed his girlfriend after they argued. Only those in the courtroom can see Pistorius because he has chosen not to testify on camera. His testimony can be heard on an audio feed. 'I'm obsessed with looking at him' Earlier, the athlete said he would like to meet Steenkamp's parents to apologize. ""I don't think they will ever want to meet me,"" he said. ""I am terribly sorry that I took the life of their daughter."" Steenkamp's mother, June, has sat in court throughout Pistorius' four days on the stand. In an interview with the UK's Mirror newspaper, she said she was still trying to decide whether the sprinter was acting as he defended himself. ""I look at Oscar the whole time, to see how he is coping, how he is behaving. I'm obsessed with looking at him, it's just instinctive, I can't explain it,"" she said. ""I keep thinking, 'let me see how he's taking this.' He has been very dramatic, the vomiting and crying."" Talking about Pistorius' apology this week, she said: ""It left me unmoved. I knew it was coming. My lawyers had prepared me for it."" ""I cried for the first time, 'Yes,' but not because he apologized, because of the suffering and agony that my darling daughter went through and because I will never have her again."" The trial is scheduled to continue until the middle of May. Judge Thokozile Masipa will decide the verdict in collaboration with two experts called assessors. South Africa does not have jury trials.

"A Florida man who said he became addicted to spying on celebrities must spend the next 10 years in a federal prison for hacking their e-mail. Christopher Chaney, 36, stole nude photos, scripts and personal information from the e-mail accounts of 50 entertainment industry figures, including movie stars Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis and singer Christina Aguilera, prosecutors said. The FBI's Los Angeles office busted Chaney last year during its ""Operation Hackerazzi,"" which looked into computer intrusions targeting individuals associated with the entertainment industry. During a hearing Monday in Los Angeles, U.S. District Court Judge S. James Otero sentenced Chaney to 120 months -- 10 years -- in prison and ordered him to pay $66,179 in restitution. Chaney pleaded guilty earlier this year to wiretapping charges and has been in custody since March. Without a plea deal, he could have faced 121 years in prison if convicted on all 26 charges, the U.S. attorney said. ""Mr. Chaney is responsible for causing dozens of illegally obtained, private photographs to be posted on the Internet, where they were available for all to see,"" said U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr. ""This case is a sobering reminder that cybercrime poses a very real threat to every American, and everyone should take steps to safeguard their identities and personal information on the Internet."" Chaney, who is from Jacksonville, Florida, apologized when he was arrested in October 2011. ""What I'm most sorry about is that I had to drag my mom into all of this, and my family and my neighbors, and they just want to live their lives,"" Chaney told reporters. Chaney told a reporter that he had become ""addicted"" to the intrusion and ""didn't know how to stop."" ""I know what I did was probably one of the worst invasions of privacy someone could experience,"" he told CNN affiliate WAWS/WTEV in Jacksonville. ""And these people don't have privacy to begin with. And I was in that little sliver of privacy they do have."" A nude photo of Johansson that was circulated online last year was part of the investigation, Birotte said. Chaney allegedly ""also took financial information, movie scripts and conversations that the celebrities believed to be private,"" Birotte told reporters. Chaney said the hacking ""started as curiosity and it turned into just being, you know, addicted to seeing the behind-the-scenes of what's going on with these people you see on the big screen every day."" ""It just happened and snowballed,"" he said, adding that he wishes it had never begun. Chaney said he felt ""almost relieved months ago"" when authorities seized his computer because ""I didn't know how to stop doing it myself. I wasn't attempting to break into e-mails and get stuff to sell or purposely put it on the Internet. It just -- I don't know."" Authorities allege that Chaney distributed the photos he obtained illegally and offered them to celebrity blog sites. Some of the files, including private photographs, were posted online ""as a result of Chaney's alleged activities,"" authorities said in a statement. Chaney admitted when he entered his guilty plea that he hacked e-mail accounts by clicking on the ""forgot your password?"" feature to reset passwords.  His research of celebrities' personal information helped him to correctly answer their security questions. ""Once Chaney gained exclusive control of the victims' e-mail accounts, he was able to access all of their e-mail boxes,"" the U.S. attorney's office said.  ""While in the accounts, Chaney also went through their contact lists to find addresses of potential new hacking targets."" While inside the accounts, he changed the settings to forward a copy of each e-mail to his own inbox, the prosecutor said.  ""Most of the victims did not check their account settings, so even after they regained control of their e-mail accounts, Chaney's e-mail address remained in their account settings.""

"Search teams shifted to a different part of the Indian Ocean Friday in their hunt for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane after ""a new credible lead,"" authorities said. An analysis of radar data led investigators to move the search to an area 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) to the northeast, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said, calling the new information ""the most credible lead to where debris may be located."" ""It indicated that the aircraft was traveling faster than previously estimated, resulting in increased fuel usage and reducing the possible distance the aircraft traveled south into the Indian Ocean,"" the authority said in a statement. Four search aircraft are now over the new area, with six more due to fly there over the course of Friday, said John Young, the authority's general manager of emergency response. The renewed search for Flight 370 in the southern Indian Ocean comes a day after Japan and Thailand both said they'd sent new satellite images to Malaysia showing separate debris fields that could be related to the plane, which vanished March 8 with 239 people aboard. Analysts said the search area shift could be a sign that investigators are closing in on the missing plane's whereabouts. ""With this development, perhaps they're able to hone in on the more accurate altitude,"" said Mary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation. That, experts said, could bring investigators closer to determining what happened aboard the plane, what caused it to veer off course and where it ended up. Satellite images raise hope . In addition to the Japanese and Thai satellite images, Malaysian officials announced Wednesday that a French satellite had found 122 pieces of something floating nearby. It's enough to make you wonder: Have they found that proverbial haystack inside which they'll find the well-hidden wreckage? Maybe. Maybe not. Search teams will have at least one more plane in their fleet starting Friday, when a second U.S. Navy P-8 Poseidon will fly from Okinawa, Japan, to Perth, Australia, to join the hunt for the missing aircraft. ""From the pilot and the aircrew perspective, they are optimistic,"" said Cmdr. William Marks of the U.S. 7th Fleet. ""I know every day, when they launch a flight, they have a good feeling about finding something. But the satellite imagery hasn't been conclusive."" There's one thing that Marks said would be a defining moment in the search: visual confirmation from the search crews at sea. While analysts say it's intriguing that the finds all appear to be in the same general area, searchers have yet to lay eyes on any of the objects, much less haul one aboard a ship and examine it. Satellite images that have been followed up on have not produced any sightings for search teams, said Young of the Australian maritime authority. ""That may change in the future,"" he added. The Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation is directing satellites to capture images of the new area, authorities said. Stephen Wood, a former CIA analyst and satellite imagery expert, said the satellites could be seeing something as simple as whitecaps, which he said can look deceptively like solid objects. CNN aviation analyst Jeff Wise said that while the latest find is ""very enticing,"" the number and size of the objects make him question whether they could be from the plane. ""If you see something floating that's 60 feet across, that could be a big chunk of fuselage,"" he said. ""But if you have 10 pieces that are 60 feet across, that would indicate that they're not from the plane, because the plane has only so much stuff in it."" But Miles O'Brien, another CNN aviation analyst, said what he sees on the latest satellite images doesn't look like everyday garbage to him. ""What I see there is something that seems to be somewhat metallic and shiny. Looks like airplane wreckage to me. I also see some surfaces that look like they're aerodynamic."" Geoffrey Thomas, an aviation expert and editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, said he doesn't have any doubts about the satellite images. ""The debris pictures we're getting now, they absolutely have to be wreckage from this airplane,"" he told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""They're too big, there's too many of them. And certainly, we get debris in the ocean, unfortunately, but not of this scale, not of this size."" Authorities, he said, must know more than they're letting on. ""I think they know exactly that this is the airplane,"" he said. ""And hopefully, in a few days, we're going to get someone picking a piece up out of the water and saying, 'This is it.'"" Loved ones holding out hope . With no physical evidence pointing to what happened to the plane, loved ones of the passengers onboard have said they're still holding out hope. Sarah Bajc, the partner of American passenger Philip Wood, said she's not convinced by the authorities' argument that an analysis of satellite data shows that there were no survivors. The plane, she told CNN's ""Erin Burnett Out Front,"" could have landed somewhere. ""I do believe it's still a possibility, because there's no contradictory evidence to that being a possibility. Even the satellite data that's been pushed forward to show or to demonstrate that the flight took the southerly route, they're really just still guessing,"" she said. ""I mean, this is not something that anybody has ever done before. So, you know, as brilliant as those mathematicians are, they don't really know. They're only analyzing the data that they have. They don't really know for certain."" The confusion has left many family members of missing passengers and crew increasingly frustrated. Some have accused Malaysian authorities of failing to keep them properly informed. Others have accused officials of lying or covering up facts. Bajc said she first learned that authorities believed there were no survivors from a text message Malaysia Airlines sent to passengers' families. ""The wording of the message led me to believe that they were going to be giving evidence that it was found, right? That there were bodies ... and then all he did is say they've extrapolated the data and they're sure that it went into the water. I mean, I think that was extremely irresponsible."" 'Unspeakable challenge' for families . Mystery surfaces pain of 1977 tragedy . Concerns about weather, currents . Malaysian officials have defended their handling of the situation, arguing that they've released information as soon as possible to families and the public. In recent days, authorities' announcements have focused on the satellite images. Now the search is on for the physical evidence to back them up. The Thai images show about 300 objects ranging in size from 6 feet (2 meters) to 50 feet (15 meters). When photographed Monday, they were about 125 miles (201 kilometers) away from the spot where a French satellite captured a floating group of objects Sunday. The Japanese images were taken Wednesday and show about 10 objects floating in a six-mile (10 kilometer) radius some 1,550 miles (2,500 kilometers) off the west coast of Australia, according to the Japanese Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office. The biggest object was square and measured some 13 feet by 26 feet (4 meters to 8 meters), the agency said. The finds come after news Wednesday that a French satellite had seen 122 objects in the same region and follows earlier sightings by U.S., Chinese and another French satellite. Planes are set to try to find the materials and figure out what they are on Friday after rough weather in the remote spot once again delayed search efforts Thursday. By then, experts say, these objects could have drifted hundreds of miles in the complex currents of the Indian Ocean. 'I understand him' Meanwhile, the youngest son of missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah has broken his family's silence on the plane's disappearance, rejecting speculation that the longtime aviator was somehow responsible. ""I've read everything online. But I've ignored all the speculation. I know my father better,"" Ahmad Seth Zaharie, 26, said in an interview published Thursday by the New Straits Times, an English-language Malaysian newspaper. The idea that Zaharie or co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid were responsible for the plane's baffling disappearance is one of many theories investigators continue to pursue. One line of speculation suggests Zaharie might have hijacked the plane as a political act. He has been identified as a supporter of a high-profile Malaysian opposition figure. His son rejected such theories. ""We may not be as close, as he travels so much. But I understand him,"" he said of his father in the interview, which was conducted Tuesday. Comments from government officials on the investigation so far support the son's view. A senior Malaysian government official Wednesday told CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes that authorities have found nothing in 19 days of investigating the two pilots that leads them to any motive, be it political, suicidal or extremist. And an ongoing FBI review of the two pilots' hard drives, including one in a flight simulator Zaharie had built at his home, has not turned up a ""smoking gun,"" a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation told CNN. ""They have accessed the data,"" the official said. ""There is nothing that's jumping out and grabbing us right now."" And investigators haven't found anything suspicious with any of the other crew members or passengers, leaving them struggling to find an explanation. ""I don't think there is a prevailing theory,"" one U.S. official told CNN. ""There are counterarguments to every theory right now."" Questions linger . Did flammable cargo doom flight?

"At times angry and choked with emotion, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Wednesday took on Republican critics of her department's handling of the September terrorist attack in Libya that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, but repeatedly distanced herself from a direct role in specific situations. ""As I have said many times since September 11, I take responsibility,"" Clinton told two long-anticipated congressional hearings examining the attack that became a major issue in the November presidential election. Conservative Republicans challenged Clinton on the lack of security at the diplomatic compound in Benghazi, where Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three others were killed, as well as the erroneous account provided four days later by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice that the attack grew spontaneously from a protest over an anti-Islam film produced in the United States. Sen. Ron Johnson, a tea party backed Wisconsin Republican serving his first term, persistently questioned Clinton on Wednesday morning about what he described as Rice ""purposely misleading"" the American people. Security Clearance: Clinton lays out daunting security challenges in North Africa . ""We were misled that there were supposedly protests and something sprang out of that, an assault sprang out of that and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact,"" Johnson said, adding that ""the American people could have known that within days."" Shouting and gesturing with her arms in frustration, Clinton shot back: ""With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans. Was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night decided they'd go kill some Americans?"" Her fists shaking, she continued: ""What difference, at this point, does it make? It is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again, senator."" Five things we learned from the Benghazi hearings . Later Johnson, interviewed by CNN's Erin Burnett, said he still did not think Clinton answered his question. ""The American people also have the right to be told the truth,"" said Johnson.  ""They have an expectation that this administration, this president will be honest with them.  And so it makes a big deal of difference. I'll tell you what, I was surprised by Secretary Clinton's reaction to that."" Another conservative, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, told Clinton she should have been fired for not reading cables from Stevens and others in Libya. Later in the day, conservative GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina accused Clinton of  ""national security malpractice"" by letting the Benghazi consulate ""become a death trap."" Duncan also questioned Clinton's claim of taking responsibility, noting she still had her job and the State Department officials cited for culpability by an independent review also remained on the payroll, though on forced leave pending possible further steps. #whatdifferencedoesitmake: Clinton quote goes viral on Twitter . At both hearings, which together totaled more than five hours, Clinton acknowledged the ""systemic breakdown"" cited by an Accountability Review Board she appointed and noted she had accepted all 29 of its recommendations, adding her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities around the world. However, she also told both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee that she had no direct role in the handling of requests by Stevens and other diplomats for increased security that were denied, saying: ""I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me."" In reference to the erroneous talking points by Rice that were aired on September 16, Clinton told the Senate panel that she was focused at that time on ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel at other facilities where protests were taking place. ""I was pretty occupied about keeping our people safe, doing what needed to be done,"" Clinton said, adding ""I wasn't involved in the talking points process."" Ticker: What Benghazi hearing could say about 2016 White House . At one point, Clinton attempted to wrap up the issue, saying: ""If you wish to fault the administration, it's that we didn't have a clear picture, and we probably didn't do as clear a job explaining that we did not have a clear picture, until days later, creating what I think are legitimate questions."" The independent report from the review board said it did not find ""that any individual U.S. government employee engaged in misconduct or willfully ignored his or her responsibilities"" leading up to the attack. However, one State Department official resigned and three others were placed on administrative leave after the report was released in December. One of the GOP's harshest critics of the administration over the Benghazi attack, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, called Clinton's testimony unsatisfactory. Johnson says he should not have 'speculated' about Clinton's emotional moments . He said her department had yet to fully disclose all e-mails and other communication from Stevens and others in Benghazi, noting the American people, including the family and loved ones of those killed, deserved full answers. Critics also complain the assailants remain at large, and Clinton noted that ""we continue to hunt the terrorists responsible for the attacks in Benghazi and are determined to bring them to justice."" She told Wednesday's hearings that the FBI is pursuing what she called ""very positive leads."" In her opening statement to both panels, Clinton said the Benghazi attack didn't happen in a vacuum but was part of a ""broader strategic challenge in North Africa and the wider region."" Clinton's Benghazi statement: 'Not just a matter of policy -- it's personal' She defended her department's response, saying there was ""timely"" and ""exceptional"" coordination between the State Department and the Pentagon on the night of the attack . ""No delays in decision making. No denials of support from Washington or from the military,"" Clinton said. The review panel's report ""said our response saved American lives in real time -- and it did,"" she added. Clinton also said she directed the response to the attack from the State Department that night and ""stayed in close contact with officials from across our government and the Libyan government."" In addition, Clinton said she immediately took steps to beef up security at U.S. posts around the world and to implement the review panel's 29 recommendations. Clinton made clear that the security situation in North Africa and the Middle East remained threatening in the wake of the Arab Spring upheaval, with longtime leaders ousted in Egypt, Tunisia and Libya. The fledgling Libyan leadership turned out to be unable to fulfill traditional security commitments to the U.S. diplomatic compound, she said. Opinion: Benghazi blame game is useless . ""What I found with the Libyans was willingness but not capacity,"" she said. Clinton also warned that weapons from Libya have turned up in Algeria and elsewhere, adding that ""this Pandora's Box if you will"" represented a major security threat. ""The Arab Spring has ushered in a time when al Qaeda is on the rise,"" she said. ""The world in many ways is even more dangerous because we lack a central command [in al Qaeda] and have instead these nodes that are scattered throughout North Africa and other places."" Clinton expressed particular concern at events in Mali, where well-armed Tuareg militia, who had been working for former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, came home just as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) gravitated toward the area. The size and topography of northern Mali, with its endless desert and caves, made for a long but necessary struggle, she said, adding that ""we cannot permit northern Mali to become a safe haven."" Opinion: Rand Paul vs. Hillary Clinton, clash of titans . Overall, she said, at least 20 U.S. diplomatic outposts ""are under a serious threat environment as I speak to you."" Wednesday's committee appearances were some of the last acts for Clinton before she leaves her post as long planned, and Clinton showed a personal side in discussing what happened. ""For me, this is not just a matter of policy,"" she told the Senate panel. ""It's personal."" In reference to the return of remains of the four slain Americans, Clinton said in a voice choked with emotion: ""I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters."" Democrats on both panels made a point of praising Clinton's service and noted that House Republicans have voted to cut funding for diplomatic security. However, Republicans rejected any connection between budget resources and vulnerability at the Benghazi compound, citing a report by a State Department financial officer. Clinton faces hearings with numbers on her side . The hearings provided Republicans with a final opportunity to question Clinton, considered a possible presidential contender in 2016, on camera before she leaves office. After the September attack, conservative Republicans focused on the issue to attack the Obama administration's handling of the Libyan revolution and the overall Arab Spring upheaval. Several legislators made references on Wednesday to Clinton's possible political future, with Republican Steve Chabot of Ohio drawing a laugh from the secretary when he said: ""I wish you the best in your future endeavors. Mostly."" Polls show strong public support for Clinton and her performance as secretary of state, with an ABC News/Washington Post survey released Wednesday showing 67% of respondents had a favorable impression of her. Clinton was originally scheduled to testify last month but postponed her appearance as she was treated for illness, a concussion and a blood clot near her brain. The country's top diplomat returned to work just over two weeks ago.

"The Egyptian revolution has a new, and shocking, image: It's the Egyptian flag, but the eagle in the middle has been replaced by a simple blue bra. The image refers to the recent, savage beating of an abaya-clad female protester by Egyptian military forces. Graphic videos of the beating, captured on phones and uploaded to YouTube and Facebook, have quickly proliferated. They show a limp woman being dragged by her arms along the street. Her abaya is ripped open, exposing her naked torso and blue bra. Security forces surround her, many wielding batons. As the beating progresses, the guards hit her and one even stomps on her. Photos of the man bringing his heavy boot down on her bare stomach made the front page of newspapers around the world. In response, thousands of women -- and men -- marched Tuesday in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Observers say it was the largest demonstration of women in Egypt in decades. Not since 1919, when women mobilized under the leadership of feminist Hoda Sha'rawi in anti-colonial demonstrations against the British have so many Egyptian women taken to the streets.  (After representing Egyptian women at the International Women Suffrage Alliance in Rome in 1923, Sha'rawi returned to Cairo and very publicly removed her veil.) Women have played an important role in Egypt's modern revolution but have struggled to translate their activism into a political role in the new, emerging system. They have been excluded from important decision-making bodies, and the military leadership declined to continue a Mubarak-era quota for women that ensured them at least 64 seats in parliament. Based on early election results, it appears that few women will win a place in the new government. Nevertheless, one intrepid woman, Bothaina Kamel, is breaking ground with her candidacy for president. The campaign of Kamel, a well-known television presenter, at first was shocking, and certainly quixotic, with polls indicating her support is less than 1%. But her persistence has gained her credibility. While she has little chance of winning, she is helping to normalize the idea of women in politics -- an idea that is deeply contested in Egyptian society. Leaders of Salafi parties, which gained a surprising 20% of the vote in the first rounds of elections, have spoken out against women running for office. The recent women's protest may breathe life into a movement that desperately needs new energy. In the early weeks of the revolution, women activists tried to bring attention to women's issues but never succeeded in getting the masses behind them. A women's march in Tahrir Square to mark International Women's Day on March 8 ended badly. Only a few hundred women showed up, and they were soon harassed by a mob of angry men who shouted at them to go home and warned that their demands for rights were against Islam. Around the same time, the Egyptian military rounded up scores of women demonstrators, and in a show of raw intimidation, subjected many of them to ""virginity tests."" Military leaders at first denied the accusations, and later defended their abuse by claiming the women ""were not like your daughter or mine."" In a remarkable show of courage, one of the victims, Samira Ibrahim, is pursuing a criminal case against the military for her ordeal. The only one of the 17 victims willing to take her case to court, Ibrahim is challenging not only the heavy-handed tactics of the military but also the social stigma associated with her issue. The woman attacked by the military in the recent protests has declined to come forward, so for now she is only known as ""blue bra girl."" But her mistreatment seems to be a galvanizing force. Thousands of people joined the march through Cairo on Tuesday, many of them taking to the streets for the first time in outrage. Organizers of the march used the hashtag #BlueBra on Twitter to encourage people to join them. Some of the protesters held giant posters of the blue bra/flag icon. Others carried photographs of the beating. Men formed a cordon around the women, chanting ""The women of Egypt are the red line."" Still, many Egyptians were not supportive. Bloggers and tweeters offered negative comments on the blue bra girl -- criticizing her for being out in public protesting in the first place and accusing her of being provocative for not wearing more clothes under her abaya. It remains to be seen whether these new humiliations for Egyptian women will lead to significant changes. But given the country's deep-seated patriarchy, women in Egypt should not take their rights for granted.","Isobel Coleman: Videos of vicious beating of Egyptian woman have prompted protests .
