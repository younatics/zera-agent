Two newborn babies have died after contracting a rare killer bug which swept through a neonatal unit. The unit has now been closed and deep cleaned after staff discovered deadly bacteria at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS) which left five other babies fighting for their lives. The worrying outbreak infected seven children in total - four have now been allowed to return home while another remains in intensive care. The A&E department at University Hospital of North Staffordshire . After the bug was detected in July the hospital continued to admit babies born in the centre, although it closed to admissions from other hospitals. Now a review of practices at the hospital by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) is underway. Post-mortem examinations on the babies, both born before 28 weeks, found they died from the Serratia Marcescens bacteria. Further tests on the surviving newborns showed the infection had been picked up while on the ward. The surviving infants were found to be carriers of the bug and did not suffer the illness itself. But they were placed in isolation incubators while their treatment continued for conditions linked to be being born prematurely. Serratia Marcescens is a rod-shaped pathogen involved in hospital infections . Last night, chief executive Julie Bridgewater said: 'We identified the infection in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit(NICU). It can affect babies born extremely premature. 'Sadly two babies who died, both born before 28 weeks, had this uncommon infection and postmortems confirmed Serratia Marcescens as the cause of death. 'The families of the two babies were informed at the time of this infection.' UHNS infection experts said the parents of babies already discharged had no need to worry. Consultant Microbiologist Dr Jeorge Orendi said: 'As a precaution we temporarily closed NICU to new admissions. 'The five other babies who were carrying the organism, but not unwell, were isolated. 'One of those continues to be treated on the unit for other conditions and will remain here until well enough to go home. 'In addition we carried out a deep clean of neonatal intensive care and reviewed infection prevention practice immediately with assistance from the HPA.

'The unit introduced enhanced contact isolation and weekly screening.There have been no new cases of infection of babies carrying the organism since the initial cases were first identified in July. 'All the families with babies on the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the time that the infection was identified were kept fully informed.'

Hollywood actress Salma Hayek feared she was carrying a baby with Down's syndrome, her French billionaire husband has revealed as he tackles his former flame, Linda Evangelista, in court. On the witness stand in Manhattan for the second day, Francois-Henri Pinault explained that his wife, then 41, was having a 'very difficult pregnancy' and almost lost their daughter Valentina, now four. 'We were told the baby had Down syndrome until late May 2007,' Pinault said. 'I asked Linda to delay the legal . recognition process [of son Augustin] until after the birth of . Valentina.' Evangelista, who has taken Pinault to court for $46,000 a month in child support for their five-year-old son Augie, agreed and he said he was grateful, theÂ New York Daily News reported. Fears: At a child support trial with his former flame Linda Evangelista, Francois-Henri Pinault (left) revealed his wife Salma Hayek (pictured) feared their daughter Valentina (right) might have Down's syndrome . The revelation comes a day after the French billionaire revealed he broke up with Evangelista after discovering she was pregnant four months into their relationship. The supermodel's lawyer also claimed on Thursday Pinault had demanded she have an abortion. On Friday, as Pinault took the witness stand for the second time, details of his lavish spending came to light - and how he did not buy his son a birthday present until Evangelista complained. He revealed he spent $260,000 in 2010 on luxury watches for himself, but could not remember what he bought Augie for his fourth birthday, or how much he had spent on the boy. Ready for business: Evangelista arrives at a Manhattan court with her lawyer for the second day of the trial. She is demanding Pinault pay $46,000 a month for their five-year-old son . Revelations: Her former partner, French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, has admitted he spends $260,000 a year on gifts for himself - but cannot remember the presents he has bought their son, Augie . 'I have a watch collection,' he said, the New York Post reported. 'It's for when I buy a watch for me.' He . went on: 'I bought him a present for his birthday and for Christmas,' yet admitted he could not remember what he bought Augie for his birthday. And for Christmas: 'I bought it online. It was a piano thing.' Evangelista also spent 30 minutes on the stand on Friday and revealed her humble beginnings. 'I asked my dad for a bike and he said, ""No bike, go to work"",' she said, adding that she began picking cherries until she worked as a model - a career which is now stalling, she said. 'There's not a lot of demand for me,' said Evangelista, whose $1.8 million annual salary took a hit last year when her contract with L'Oreal came to an end. The four-day trial will spell out Pinault's childcare obligations. Evangelista spends $46,000 a month for their son's around-the-clock . nanny and armed drivers, and wants Pinault to cover the costs. Escape: Pinault leaves court on Thursday after revealing the couple had spent just seven days together . Bitter feud: The former couple are hoping to thrash out a deal over the four-day trial in Manhattan . Evangelista's . lawyer William Beslow has argued that Augie deserves a lifestyle . similar to that of his four-year-old daughter with Hayek. Pinault, 49, is heir to a family estate estimated at $11.5 billion. As chief executive of . PPR, . the conglomerate that owns Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci and Bottega Veneta, he earns $5 million a year. He . spends $50,000 a month just on the taxes, upkeep and loan payments for . the $12 million Los Angeles home he's put in trust for the girl, . Valentina, the Post reported. Despite his wealth, Pinault has criticised Evangelista for . her outlandish demands, suggesting the $46,000 a month is in fact for 'mom . support'. She has maintained she is modelling or working on her image at . all hours of the day. Battle: Evangelista has previously said she wants $46,000 a month in child support for the five-year-old . Attention: The model drew a scrum of photographers to the family court hearing in Manhattan . 'Most of the expenses do not relate . to Augie but they relate to Ms. Evangelista,' Pinault's lawyer, David . Aronson, said in opening statements on Thursday. 'It is the classic case of someone trying to bootstrap herself to something that is alimony.' Also at the trial on Thursday, Evangelista's lawyer recounted a conversation the former couple shared in January 2006. 'After some initial happiness, he told her he wished she would terminate the pregnancy,' Beslow told a support magistrate. Evangelista, who was then in her early 40s, told Pinault she would keep the baby. Pinault revealed the couple had spent just seven days together in four months when she made the announcement. 'She would support the child herself, since he had made it perfectly clear to her that he had no interest in doing so. And she did.' Hectic: Evangelista was spotted out with her son Augie, right, ahead of the court appearance . Pinault said he found out she was pregnant . in early 2006 and admitted he broke up with her on hearing the news. 'She was so happy to be pregnant,' he said. 'But it was not planned. I decided to stop the relationship at that point.' He added: 'We were dating four months and I didn't even know her very much.' Asked . why he didnât pay Evangelista anything in child support for the first . years of Augie's life, Pinault answered: 'She didnât ask and I didnât . offer.' In opening statements on . Thursday, Beslow insisted Evangelista is not hoping to improve her . station in life but that she has paid all of his expenses without a . single cent from Pinault. 'Ms. Evangelista is not looking to piggyback on the lifestyle of Mr. Pinault,' Beslow said. 'She is looking for a continuation of the . reasonable lifestyle of Augie.' 'I need to protect him,' Evangelista told Love magazine in February. If she is granted the $46,000 of . her demands, it will shatter records for childcare payouts. Unhappy ending: Evangelista was excited about her pregnancy, while Pinault was not, he said in court . Last year a judge questioned the model's need for full-time nannies, asking how often she worked. 'When I work, it can be a 16-hour . day,' she said. 'On days when I do not work, I am . working on my image. I have to hit the gym. I have beauty appointments. I . have to work toward my next job and maintaining my image, just like an . athlete.' Evangelista, herself worth $8 million, is also demanding Pinault give her . son a home similar to the $13 million California mansion he put in a . trust for his and Hayek's four-year-old daughter, Valentina. His family estate includes the . Christieâs auction house, the ChÃ¢teau-Latour vineyard in Bordeaux and . the French premiere league football team Stade Rennais, the Daily News . reported. Earlier this week, Manhattan divorce lawyer Raoul Felder . said the eye-watering payout - which comes to $1,500 a day - was unlikely. He pointed out that judges . consider how much it costs to care for a child, rather than the wealth . of the parents. Demands: Evangelista is not so hard up herself, earning millions from high-profile modelling campaigns, cosmetic contracts and cover shoots . 'Sheâs in for a big surprise. I wouldnât be counting the money yet,' he told the New York Daily News. She is worth $8 million and owns a . penthouse in Chelsea, New York and an apartment near her . sonâs school on the upper East Side. She . broke up with billionaire and Hard Rock Cafe co-founder Peter Morton . last year and filed her case against Pinault shortly after the break up. Since, Pinault has been paying child support - although the amount has not been disclosed. The couple dated from . September 2005 until January 2006, and she was pregnant with Augie when . Pinault began dating Hayek in April 2006. He and Hayek married in 2009.

The range was created for Asda after customers said they wanted to emulate 57-year-old Mrs Middletonâs âelegantâ style.

A hotel worker who confessed to murdering Michaela McAreavey had his head held under water and was almost suffocated with a towel during interrogation. Avinash Treebhoowoon insists his admission of guilt was extracted with police brutality. The court in Mauritius heard claims that officers also failed to put anti-contamination clothes on him when he was taken to the crime scene at the holiday island's luxury Legends Hotel for a reconstruction three days after the murder. Avinash Treebhoowoon arrives at the Supreme Court in Port Louis, Mauritius, on day four of the murder trial of Irish citizen, Michaela McAreavy, who was murdered during her honeymoon a year ago . In another twist, it was later revealed to the jury that a witness who claims he saw Treebhoowoon and his co-accused Sandip Mooneea leave the room where the honeymooner was strangled was himself charged in connection with the crime. Fellow employee at Legends Raj Theekoy and two other men were accused with conspiracy to murder the daughter of Tyrone gaelic football boss Mickey Harte, but all three had the charges against them dropped.

Millions of commuters face fresh misery next week as London Underground workers plan a 72-hour walkout. The strikes, which come a week ahead of the mayoral election, stretch over four days and will involve the people who maintain and upgrade the tracks who are unhappy with negotiations over pensions and benefits. The Rail, Maritime and Transport . union, which represents around 1,000 staff on the Tube Lines contracts, . said its members will walk out at 4pm on Tuesday until the same time on . Friday. Maintenance workers on London Underground are set to take part in a walkout stretching over four days in a row over pensions and benefits . RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: . 'RMT members have delivered a massive mandate for action following a . straightforward demand for parity with other Tube staff. 'This . dispute is about justice and about ensuring that all groups of staff . under the umbrella of London Underground receive the same rights and . benefits, and our members have no choice but to strike to secure those . basic rights. The staff work on the Piccadilly, . Northern and Jubilee lines and provide a number of services, including . emergency repairs, across the entire network. Militant: Bob Crow says the strike is a bid to get parity with other Tube staff . The . row is over union demands for all Tube Lines staff to be allowed to . join the Transport for London pension scheme and receive the same travel . concessions as those who work for London Underground. RMT officials said the strike will have a 'widespreadâ impact on Tube services across the network. The announcement follows a 4-1 vote in favour of industrial action in a ballot of union members. Colin Stanbridge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce, said: 'The last thing London businesses need at the minute is another Tube strike costing millions in lost business and damaging the city's reputation especially with just 100 days to go to the Olympics. 'The RMT should call off this needless strike and work to find a settlement before any damage is done.' Mr Crow continued: 'We have gone through all the negotiating channels but Tube Lines has refused to budge and have refused to engage in meaningful talks and that pig-headed approach has raised the temperature on the shop floor and has resulted in this strike action being called. 'Former Metronet employees have been allowed back into the Transport for London pension fund and now also have the same travel facilities as other LU employees. 'Tube Lines is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London and there is simply no excuse for refusing to give equal pension and pass rights. 'The union remains ready to talk, and . the strong mandate for this industrial action shows Tube Lines and TfL . the depth of anger there is over this blatant lack of fairness and . justice.' Tube Lines operations director Lee Jones said: 'A strike on this issue is completely unnecessary and will not achieve anything. 'We . urge the RMT leadership to end their strike threat and return to talks, . as it will only be resolved through constructive discussion. 'The . RMT's ballot showed that less than 44 per cent of its members voted in . favour of strike action. Any action would be by maintenance staff, not . Tube drivers and station staff. The lines affected include the Jubilee, Piccadilly and Northern lines . Tens of thousands of NHS workers will . take industrial action and other forms of protest next month in the . continuing bitter row over pensions. Unite said its 100,000 health service members will walk out on May 10, a . day after the Queenâs Speech, which is expected to include a . Parliamentary Bill on the Governmentâs controversial reforms. Other workers are expected to join the strike and there could be further industrial action in June. Unite said its NHS members, including health visitors, pharmacists and . paramedics, face paying an average of Â£30 a month more for their . pensions. The dispute has been raging for well over a year and sparked a strike by . more than 1.5 million public sector workers last November. Unite said it expected other public sector unions to join the May 10 . action as part of the continuing campaign of opposition to the . Governmentâs changes. Officials pointed out that the pension reforms came against a backdrop . of pay freezes and cuts in the public sector, and the prospect of . regional pay being introduced. National officer Rachael Maskell said: 'The Government is picking the . pockets of health workers by an average of Â£30 a month in order to pay . for pension changes which will see people having to work longer to get . less. 'This disgraceful attack comes against a backdrop of pay freezes and the . threat of regional pay in the public sector. In the face of continued . attacks, health workers will be stepping up their campaign and looking . to join other public sector workers in taking action on May 10.' Uniteâs health members voted by more than 9-1 to reject the pension changes. 'Should . a strike go ahead, we have plans in place which will enable London . Underground to operate Tube services on all three lines and to minimise . any disruption.' Earlier this month it was revealed that London Underground drivers could earn an extra Â£6,000 in bonus payments for working during the Olympics this summer. Drivers are also in line for overtime payments, and enhanced pay packets for shifts which extend beyond 1.30am. Previously, MPs have condemned payments to drivers as a 'bribe' and accused the unions of holding the public to ransom. Underground drivers have been offered the latest terms by transport chiefs for a period covering nine weeks to the end of the Paralympics, according to a document seen by the Evening Standard. A spokesman for London Mayor Boris Johnson said: 'It will come as no surprise to Londoners that, a week before the mayoral election, Ken Livingstone's RMT friend Bob Crow is trying to hit hard-working Londoners and businesses.' Mr Livingstone's deputy mayoral running mate, Val Shawcross, said: 'The failure of Boris Johnson and the RMT to resolve their differences comes at a huge cost to Londoners. Now millions of Tube users are facing the huge inconvenience and disruption that comes with a Tube strike. 'It has been 1,444 days since Boris Johnson was elected and he has still not bothered to meet representatives of the Tube unions to discuss his manifesto promise to implement a no-strike deal. 'Boris Johnson's failure to get a grip of the Tube has led to more Tube strikes in the last four years than in the previous eight years.' Caroline Pidgeon, Liberal Democrat chairman of London Assembly's Transport Committee, said: 'This is a dispute between Tube Lines and the RMT. 'For the RMT to try and involve innocent Tube users in an internal disagreement is totally out of order, especially given the damage it will do to London's economy. 'Both sides should get back round a table, hammer out a solution and the RMT should stop posturing.'","Workers to walk out at 4pm on Tuesday until 4pm on Friday next week .

Prince William has qualified as an operational search and rescue captain just weeks before his 30th birthday, Clarence House has announced. The Duke of Cambridge, who turns 30 on June 21, started serving with the squadron at RAF Valley in Anglesey in 2010 as he believed it was best chance to 'serve operationally' in the Armed Forces as he was barred from going to Afghanistan unlike his brother Prince Harry. After completing his captaincy tests on May 29 and undergoing two years of flying experience in Sea King helicopters he will now be able to command operations, helping rescue distressed mountaineers or exhausted swimmers across the UK. Prince William has qualified as a Search And Rescue captain, allowing him to lead rescues across the UK . The mock rescue scenarios saw him take part in an airborne searches for vessels and missing people while extinguishing a simulated fire. 'Flight Lieutenant Wales, as the duke is known in the military, will now command search and rescue operations in RAF Sea King helicopters,' Clarence House said. The second in line to the throne joined C Flight, 22 Squadron after graduating training in September 2010 and despite the new qualification his rank will remain Flight Lieutenant. Just last year the young royal said the promotion would be an honour, stating: 'The training has been challenging, but I have enjoyed it immensely. I absolutely love flying, so it will be an honour to serve operationally with the Search and Rescue Force.' In response to theÂ  news of William's qualification Officer Commanding 22 Squadron, Wing Commander Mark Dunlop, said: 'Flt Lt Wales demonstrated the required standards needed for the award of Operation Captaincy. A Royal Air Force search and rescue helicopter leaves the RAF base in Anglesey . 'Due to the nature of search-and-rescue operations, the required standards are always set at a very high level. Operational captaincy carries the overarching responsibility for the safety of the aircraft, its crew and any casualties.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said his tests had been carried out in 'the normal timescale'. Earlier this year the prince spent six weeks flying search-and-rescue missions from the Falkland Islands. His routine posting proved controversial in the run up to the 30th anniversary of the Falkland Islands conflict, with the Argentinian Government accusing the UK of using the princeâs presence to inflame tension between the two countries. The extra hours in the air, as well as the challenge of flying over harsh terrain and the South Atlantic, will have been useful experience to William in gaining his new qualification. William's brother, Prince Harry, recently completed helicopter pilot training on Apache gunships, which are used by the Army Air Corps. Part of his course included two months of advanced weapons training in California and Arizona, where the desert conditions replicate those found in Afghanistan. He is currently flying Apaches on exercises in the UK and is keen to return to Afghanistan after his first tour of duty was cut short in 2008. A spokesperson for William added: 'The Duke is pleased to have passed the milestone and is looking forward to contributing in a command role to the lifesaving work of the Search and Rescue Force.' The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have a home in North Wales near Williamâs RAF base.

She became Britain's most reviled mother after faking the kidnap of her own daughter in a bid to scoop reward money. But now it's claimed Karen Matthews wants to become a mother again by starting another family with her new lover. Since her release from prison  for kidnapping her nine-year-old daughter Shannon, the 36-year-old has been dating the man. Freedom: Karen Matthews enjoys the sunshine as she goes on a shopping trip, wearing a white shirt, black vest, green trousers, black leggings . He began writing to Matthews when she was behind bars and now, according to relatives, she is in love and wants to have his children. The family member told the Daily Star Sunday: 'Karen began exchanging letters with a man while she was in prison. Released: Matthews' figure is a little more slender after four years on prison food . He was in prison too and he was released first and began visiting her. 'She says he is her boyfriend and they are planning to have kids together. They have met up several times since she was released at Easter.' Matthews was jailed in 2008 for the horrifying crime of kidnapping her own daughter and doping her up with temazepam and travel sickness pills. She was freed from prison last month after serving just half of her eight year sentence. However, Matthews could be facing jail again after a probe into alleged benefit fraud was reopened. Investigators are examining more than Â£100,000 she is believed to have pocketed between 2004 and 2009. Matthews was entitled to much of it - including thousands of pounds in child benefit. But Government officials are understood to be analysing the rest of her claims to make sure she really was entitled to it. A source told The People: 'If she's found guilty she faces another stretch inside. 'But anyone who knows her thinks it's only a matter of time till she's back behind bars. It's where she belongs.' Matthews is said to have claimed up to Â£400 a week in benefits while living with supermarket fishmonger Craig Meehan who earned Â£16,000 a year. She told officials at the time she got no child support from the five men who fathered her children and was therefore due the cash. Face in the crowd: Matthews, centre in black vest, who served just four years for kidnapping her own daughter, mingled with more shoppers . Pictures following her release showed Matthews strolling freely through the streets near her bail hostel in southern England with a completely new look. Clad in a cream coat and blue jeans, the ex-convict looked calm as she returned to her bail hostelÂ  following a trip out with another woman. Matthews was given a full makeover including a new hairstyle before her release to prevent her being recognised in the street, and now lives under an assumed name. She was chasing Â£50,000 of reward money when she tried to con police into thinking a predator had kidnapped her daughter.

Matthews, wearing black leggins under a pair of trousers, was hardly kitted out for the hot weather as she strolls with a friend from the bail hostel in southern England . The crime, carried out with 44-year-old Michael Donovan, saw her launch tearful pleas for help finding the nine-year-old, who she held captive for 24 days. The mother-of-seven was freed from Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire last month and taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire. Unlike Maxine Carr, who was jailed after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, she has not been given a new identity including a new National Insurance number and passport. Such a move would have cost the taxpayer Â£250,000 and required Matthews to keep her real identity a secret. It is not known if Matthews requested a new identity. But officials were so concerned that she would jeopardise it and her safety by failing to keep it a secret that they ruled it out. In love: With a trendy, short hair cut, Karen Matthews is trying her best to conceal her identity from the British public but has found love with a new man . Matthews will use the assumed name when she comes into contact with people in a social setting, but when she is dealing with officialdom she will use her real name and rely on client and patient confidentiality to protect her identity. She will be supported in this by probation officers. Matthews, whose children are now in care, will remain on licence for the rest of her sentence. During that time she must observe strict rules or face being returned to jail.

Widespread confusion over the hosepipe ban has led to parents being reported to water companies by their neighbours for filling up their children's paddling pool. Water suppliers are investigating reports of people using hosepipes to fill paddling pools - which can hold hundreds of litres of water - during the recent heat wave. The hosepipe ban currently covers about half of England and anyone convicted of flouting it faces a fines of up to Â£1,000. Banned: Paddling pools, can hold hundreds of litres and water companies are investigating reports of people using hosepipes to fill them during the heatwave (file pic) It has meant that few children in the South East have been able to enjoy splashing around in their paddling pool since the ban came into force. Seven water companies across southern and eastern England, serving about 20 million people, have introduced the hosepipe bans, which came into place April 5. All of the companies allow customers to fill up paddling pools using hand-held containers such as buckets, but not using hosepipes. But warnings have arisen from campaigners saying it can be difficult for the public to interpret rules and this could lead to them being unintentionally flouted. Campaigners at hosepipeban.org.uk, have taken a critical view of the need for the ban. They accused the water companies of 'totally confusing the general public' and said they have been 'receiving a lot of questions regarding the filling of domestic swimming and paddling pools.' Seven water companies across south and eastern England, serving about 20 million people, have introduced the hosepipe bans, which came into place April 5 . South East Water, which covers supplies to parts of Kent, Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, and Berkshire, said that 'the vast majority' of their customers have been compliant, but they have had reports of rule flouts. 'We have received a small number of reports of individuals not adhering to the current essential restrictions on hosepipe use. In these cases, we wrote to the customer about the seriousness of the drought and have not had to take further action as people comply with the ban.' Veolia Water commented: 'We have not taken action against any of our customers and hope that this situation will remain. Family affair: A mother and father walk their little ones down to the beach at Southsea, Hampshire as they all enjoy a paddle . Keeping cool: Georgia, 8, and Evie, 3, Marriott enjoy an ice cream during the hot weather in Heacham, Norfolk . 'Our experience during the last drought is that most customers who were reported to us for using a hosepipe, were either covered by an exception, or were not fully aware of the rules of the ban. They said it was 'very unusual once we have sent a letter reminding people of the restrictions that the individual involved continues to break the ban.' Thames Water, which covers parts of Greater London, the Thames Valley, Surrey, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, and Kent said they have had a 'handful of calls and sent a few reminder letters, but we are not in the process of prosecuting anyone.' Seven water companies across south and eastern England, serving about 20 million people, have introduced the hosepipe bans, which came into place April 5. The following water companies allow you to fill, top up or maintain a paddling pool using a hand held container directly from a tap (not filled by a hosepipe): . Anglian Water . Sutton and East Surrey Water . Thames Water . Veolia Water Southeast . Veolia Water Central . South East Water . Southern Water . Covering customers in Kent and Sussex, Southern Water said: 'Since the restrictions came into force weâve had calls from a handful of people calling to clarify the legislation. A small number of these calls have been to tell us that people may not be adhering to the rules. 'In these cases, we would write to the customers to remind them of the restrictions.' The company added that had not 'had to take any further action.' Similarly, Anglian Water, which covers much of the east of England said: 'We've had a handful of complaints as the weather has been hotter over the weekend.' The water company stressed they 'were not looking to catch people out,' and were hoping to work with customers. On internet forums discussing the hosepipe ban, water customers vocalised their confusion: . One user wrote: 'So have I understood this correctly .. You canât fill/top up a childs paddling pool using a hose, but you can do it buy using âhand held containersâ, so buckets then? Is this not going to use the same amount of water anyway?? Another disgruntled customer wrote: 'So how is filling a pool with a bucket less wasteful than using a hose pipe surely you spill more using a bucket and who is going to know how i filled it up anyway?' Legislation is in place for prosecution, but during previous hosepipe bans it has never come to this. The hosepipe ban is expected to stay in place throughout the summer. The weekend was the hottest of the year so far and thousands of people took the opportunity to spend a few hours at the seaside.

Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. Before the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, William was the country's preferred choice to be the next king. But in a dramatic shift of mood, Charles is now considered to be the best person to take over the throne. Popular: Prince Charles is the people's choice to succeed the Queen and take over the throne as King, a poll has revealed. He is pictured paying a moving tribute to 'Mummy' after Monday's Diamond Jubilee concert . Turnaround: A fortnight ago, Prince William was the favoured successor to the Queen. But since the Diamond Jubilee celebrations, Prince Charles is now the most popular choice. This could be because of his witty speech in praise of the Queen . The boost in Prince Charles' popularity may have been helped by his witty and emotional speech in praise of his mother at the close of the Diamond Jubilee Concert last Monday. His opening word â âMummyâ â earned him rapturous cheers from the crowd as the Queen looked on delighted. As he drew to a close, he led the audience in giving three cheers for the Queen, before kissing her hand affectionately and adding: âSo Your Majesty we offer you our humble duty and with it three resounding cheers for our Majesty The Queen!â Next generation: Just a fortnight ago, 44 per cent of people said they preferred Prince William to be the next king . Another reason could be the way in which he stood in for his father, Prince Philip, who was hospitalised with a bladder infection which caused him to miss a large part of the Jubilee celebrations. The figures a fortnight ago revealed that 44 per cent of people preferred William to be the next king. This was compared with 38 per cent who preferred Charles. But since the successful Jubilee celebrations the figures have exactly reversed, according to a YouGov poll for The Sunday Times. The last time Charles was favoured to be the successor to the Queen was in 2005. Previously, he has struggled to shake off the perception among some members of the public that he is stuffy and pompous. But this has gradually altered over the years, thanks largely to his ideas for reform. He is believed to have been talking privately to aides for a number of years about a stripped-down monarchy - something which was demonstrated last week when the core members of the Royal family appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on the final day of the Jubilee celebrations. The Queen appeared with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Just Prince Philip was missing as he was being treated in hospital for his illness. The poll also revealed that William remains as popular as the Queen with 86 per cent of people considering them to be an asset to the royal family. Prince Philip yesterday celebrated his 91st birthday quietly with his family after spending five nights in hospital. He was discharged from the King Edward VII Hospital in central London on Saturday after being treated for a bladder infection. When asked if he was feeling better, the Duke of Edinburgh replied: âI wouldnât be coming out otherwise.â Buckingham Palace said he would âcontinue his convalescenceâ at home but could not confirm if he would accompany the Queen to a garden party at Sandringham tomorrow. The Duchess of Cambridge polled 81 per cent with Prince Harry slightly behind - but still popular- on 75 per cent. Reflecting the astonishing success of the Jubilee celebrations, 33 per cent of people said they feel more proud to be British following last weekend's events. A total of 29 per cent also said they felt more positive towards the royal family since the Jubilee celebrations. During Charles' popular speech last Monday, he paid tribute to âthe life and service of a very special personâ. He told the Queen: âA Diamond Jubilee . is a unique and special event, some of us have had the joy of . celebrating three jubilees with you, and I have the medals to prove it. âAnd we're now celebrating the life and service of a very special person, over the last 60 years. âI . was three when my grandfather George VI died and suddenly, . unexpectedly, you and my father's lives were irrevocably changed when . you were only 26. âSo as a nation this is our opportunity to thank you and my father for always being there for us. âFor inspiring us with your selfless duty and service and for making us proud to be British.â Stripped back: Prince Charles is believed to be in favour of a slimmed-down monarchy.

An experienced skydiver from California was killed on Saturday night after slamming into the ground while attempting an advanced maneuver known as âswooping.â Donald Brown, 43, of American Canyon, was pronounced dead minutes after he deployed his parachute above Byron Airport. The victimâs friends told the San Francisco Chronicle that the 43-year-old, known as âDonny,â had been skydiving for 20 years, but may have misjudged his altitude and therefore had too little room to perform the risky landing move. Experienced: Skydiver Donald Brown, 43, plunged to his death while attempting the advanced 'swooping' move during landing . The U.S. Parachute Association describes âswooping,â or canopy piloting, as a skydiving discipline that involves hurtling down at high speeds and then decelerating by turning horizontally just above the ground. Contra Costa Sheriff's Office spokesman Jimmy Lee says the accident is regarded as a non-criminal death. Officers, fire crews and paramedics arrived at Byron Airport at around 7:40pm on Saturday after receiving a report about a skydiving accident. Brown was pronounced dead at the scene. People who witnessed the accident told police that as Brown was descending, his parachute opened fully but it appeared like he was going to miss his landing target. Club: Brown was affiliated with the Davis-based Skydance Skydiving, where he organized events and mentored fellow enthusiasts of the sport . Dangerous move: 'Swooping,â or canopy piloting, is a skydiving discipline that involves hurtling down at high speeds and then slowing down by turning horizontally before landing . The 43-year-old attempted the âswoopingâ move in an effort to redirect himself to his target, but did not have sufficient altitude to complete the maneuver and struck the ground at a high rate of speed, according to Lee. People who knew Brown described him . as a highly skilled skydiver who specialized in 'freeflying' - a . discipline in which skydivers manipulate their bodies in a way that . allows them to fly through the air rather than fall. Tragic: Brown is survived by his fiancee, Courtenay Bost . 'It was just a landing accident,' Brown's friend Scott Meeker told the Chronicle. 'His descent rate was too high, and he hit the ground too hard.' Brown, who had 3,000 skydives under his belt, was a mentor to other enthusiasts of the high-flying sport and helped organize events at the Davis-based club Skydance Skydiving. 'Donny was the friendliest, most positive smiling guy you could ever want around,' said club president Ray Ferrell. He also added that the 43-year-old was striving to perfect the sport and push the envelope in skydiving, which at times leads to fatalities. People who knew the 43-year-old said that besides skydiving, Brown was also a skilled mechanic, race car driver and painter. He is survived by his fiancee, Courtenay Bost, his sister, Cynthia Brown, and his mother, Barbara Brown.","'Swooping' involves hurtling down at high speeds and then slowing down by turning horizontally before landing .

Bright colors and famous stars helped Andy Warhol make his name in the art world but a new exhibition at New Yorkâs Metropolitan Museum shows how the artist had a more nuanced impact over the past half century. The exhibit, titled Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years, opens next week and intersperses Warholâs work with pieces by other artists like Damien Hirst and Cindy Sherman who counted the blond pop artist as a key influencer of their style. Celebrities like Marilyn Monroe, First Lady Jackie Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor are all highlighted in the show - titled Regarding Warhol - alongside the everyday objects that he helped turn into pop art. The man behind the myth: Andy Warhol's work is being exhibited at The Met starting next week . Given Warholâs interest in the mass consumerism that was overtook American society in the late 1960s and 1970s, it comes as no surprise that his iconic picture of an oversized can of Campbellâs Beef Noodle Soup is granted the same reverence as the Hollywood stars that Warhol immortalized in bright hues. Warholâs interest in fame and celebrity as well as media culture in general prompted him to re-examine mundane, everyday objects and approach them on an artistic scale similar to that of the Hollywood stars and political figures that were generally accepted as worthy of great art. Objects of Andy's affection: The artist paid a great deal of attention to all aspects of popular culture, whether it was everyday items like Brillo pads (left) or screen sirens like Marilyn Monroe (right) Fittingly, his most famous statue is . that of a Brillo pad, showing that because Warhol took his eccentric . touch to the commonplace object, he was able to elevate it to a higher . creative point than would have been expected in years prior. âHe . pained (objects) in a very hard-edged, straight forward way that also . made people uncomfortable and confused because there seemed to be . nothing expressive about his painting except for his choice of subject . matter,â curator Mark Rosenthal says in the galleryâs audio tour. Modern interpretations: Cindy Sherman (left) and Chuck Close (right) feature in the exhibition as they are among the contemporary artists to take a lead from Warhol's ideas . Beauty in the mundane: The work of contemporary artists like Damien Hirst are also highlighted in the exhibit as it examines how Warhol influenced artists who came after him . In keeping with the practice of . highlighting the beauty in the mundane, the piece of British artist . Damien Hirstâs work that showcased in the exhibit is a reconstructed . medicine cabinet that was once displayed in Pharmacy, the popular . Notting Hill restaurant of which he was a co-owner before it closed in . 2005. Big anniversary: The exhibit is timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of this Campbells soup painting . Jeff Koons, Cindy Sherman, and . Gerhard Richter are some of the other living artists whose work is . portrayed alongside the work of Warhol, who died in 1987. Rather than the living and the dead, the starkest contrast in the exhibit is that between the everyday items that Warhol raised up to a higher level of value with his work- for instance his revisited version of a foot treatment for calluses- with the portraits he made of the worldâs biggest stars. His oft-copied portraits of Jackie, Marilyn and Chairman Mao are instant attractions for even the most superficial of art aficionados. Portraits of Elvis, Marlon Brando, and Liz Taylor completed on lighter backgrounds with silver and grey paints are less glaring than the bright pinks and blues used in the bolder portraits, but they still provide a great homage to the stars of the silver screen. âWarhol adored celebrities. He was always chasing after this kind of person,â Mr Rosenthal said. As . he elevated the Brillo pad and the 19-cent can of Campbells, Warhol was . able to elevate a whole new class of celebrities through his art by . allowing them to buy into the idea that if they had their portrait done . by Warhol, they would solidify their own fleeting fame. âThe . âlifestyles of the rich and famousâ type people were coming to Warhol . starting in the 70s which of course was a way for them to join the likes . of Marilyn,â Mr Rosenthal explained. The . clearest example comes from Warholâs painting entitled American Man, a . portrait of insurance executive Watson Powell who was one of the . earliest commissioned sittings that Warhol completed. Famous faces: While much of the exhibit looks at his work regarding everyday objects, his famous portraits of former first lady Jackie Kennedy are also included . Given that he was the one to predict that âIn the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutesâ, it comes as no surprise that Warhol had a hand in creating lasting legacies for those who would have otherwise been forgotten. For a man obsessed with the famous and the act of becoming it, the celebration of Warholâs art on the 50th anniversary of his 32 Campbells Soup Cans painting shows that his name and work has clearly extended past his 15 minutes and shows no signs of stopping.",Preview of the exhibit at New York's Metropolitan Museum detailing career of the Pop Art icon .

A millionaireâs daughter was yesterday jailed for two years for her role in âone of the most seriousâ rampages of last summerâs riots. Laura Johnson was said to have become infatuated with a drug-dealing gangster and acted as a chauffeur for him and his friends as they pillaged electrical goods in a seven-hour crime spree. Yesterday, the 20-year-old Exeter University student and former grammar school prefect smiled nervously as sentence was passed while her parents, who live in a Â£1million house in Orpington, Kent, watched from the public gallery. Laura Johnson, left, was found guilty of burglary and handling stolen goods last month. The maximum sentence for handling is 14 years . Sentencing her and teenage accomplice Christopher Edwards at Inner London Crown Court, Judge Patricia Lees said: âYour actions added to the overall lawlessness that threatened to overwhelm the forces of law and order.â Johnson, dressed demurely in a black cardigan and blue blouse, was joined in the dock by Edwards, 17, who can now be identified after the judge lifted an order banning his identification. He was sentenced to 12 months. Jailed: Laura Johnson, right, arriving at Inner London Crown Court yesterday. She was sentenced to two years while her accomplice Christopher Edwards, left, got 12 months . The judge said: âYou both come from supportive homes. 'Of neither of you could it be said that your parents have not provided every advantage they could for you. âIt seems to me that like so many others, you both revealed a weaker side to your characters in taking advantage of an escalating situation because you thought you could get away with it and would not be caught. âYou most probably also got caught up with what you, through immaturity and ill-judgement, thought was an exciting experience. âIt is clear that these offences were committed as part of one of the most serious criminal enterprises which occurred during the civil disturbances which spread across the capital and beyond last August.â Last steps in freedom: Laura Johnson (right) and her mother walk up the steps to the court. She smiled nervously as she was led to the cells to begin her sentence . Then there were two: Johnson's parents, Robert and Lindsay, leave court without their daughter after she was sent to jail this afternoon . Johnson will spend just over seven months in prison. This is because she will serve half her sentence before being released on licence, minus 144 days for time spent on a curfew. She was found guilty of burglary and handling stolen goods last month. The maximum sentence for handling is 14 years. Throughout the trial Johnson, who has mental health problems and has made several suicide attempts, claimed that talk of guns and knives had terrified her into driving convicted robber and âbad boyâ Emmanuel Okubote, 20, and his friends.

She also blamed her descent into lawlessness on being raped by two men in the weeks before the riots â an allegation which went unreported to the police â and on having a mental breakdown after being dumped by her previous boyfriend. Yesterday the judge told her: âYou were pivotal to this planned criminal enterprise, you provided and drove the car which carried the others both to and from premises which they burgled and outside of which they robbed others of goods stolen only moments before.

The court heard Laura Johnson wanted to protect boyfriend Emmanuel Okubote, 20 . âYou drove to pick up the rest of the group and willingly remained with them throughout. 'On your evidence so much was stolen throughout that night it necessitated trips to safe addresses where goods could be off-loaded.â The judge also observed that Johnsonâs reaction to the arrival of the police was to put her foot on the accelerator of her car â despite an officer standing in front of it. The judge said she had no doubt that Johnson was âexcitedâ by what she âperceived to be the thrill of Okuboteâs worldâ, adding that she had read a letter from her mother which was âheartfelt and saddening and reflects the tragedy that this case is for both of the defendants and their familiesâ. Johnsonâs parents, Robert and Lindsay, who own direct marketing business Avongate Ltd, left court without comment last night. Exeter University said it was considering the case âto determine the best way forward with regards to Lauraâs studiesâ. Johnson, who studies English and Italian, was convicted last month along with Edwards of one count of burglary at Comet and one count of handling stolen goods at Currys, but found not guilty of a third count of burglary at a BP petrol station.

Camp Bastion: Prince Harry was moved to a guarded location following the Taliban attack on the camp, even though it was said he was never in danger . Prince Harry was moved to a guarded location during a recent Taliban attack in Afghanistan. The 28-year-old is being protected by 'additional security arrangements' as he carries out his second tour of duty in the war-torn country, the Defence Secretary has revealed. Phillip Hammond had earlier told the Commons that Captain Wales - as Harry is known to the Army - was never in danger although he was present during the assault on Camp Bastion last Friday. But last night, speaking on BBC 2's Newsnight, Hammond said that the arrangements recognised the prince 'could be a target... specifically as a result of who he is'. Two US Marines were killed and six . planes destroyed during the attack on the desert base in Helmand . province, where the bulk of the UK's 9,500-strong force in Afghanistan . are deployed. Taliban sources claimed Bastion was targeted because Prince Harry is serving there as an Apache attack helicopter gunner. The Prince was about two kilometres . away with other Apache crew members during the assault on the base, . which is the same size as Reading. Speaking last night, Hammond said: 'Clearly there are fall-back plans and I can't go into the detail of them - but once we knew on Friday night that the perimeter at Bastion had been breached he would have been moved to a secure position under effective guard.' Asked by presenter Jeremy Paxman if that meant Prince Harry was not treated the same as every other soldier, the Defence Secretary said: 'You asked me whether he was at any greater risk. 'And I've told you that in combat he's at the same risk as any other Apache pilot. 'Clearly if we had a VIP in theatre and frankly if I was there or, Jeremy, if you were there in Camp Bastion and there was a breach of the perimeter security, anybody who might, by nature of who they are, be a target, they would be put in a secure location.' He added: 'He is serving there as an ordinary officer but clearly there are additional security arrangements in place that recognise that he could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is.' Mr Hammond's comments came following a bloody spell for Nato forces in the troubled country, which saw two British soldiers killed at the weekend by an attacker dressed as an Afghan policeman and pretending to be injured.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond told Newsnight there are 'additional security arrangements' in place that 'recognise that he (Prince Harry) could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is' Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province, on Saturday, in what appears to be the latest in a string of 'green-on-blue' incidents. The soldiers, from 3rd Battalion, The . Yorkshire Regiment, were killed at a checkpoint when a man dressed as a . local Afghan policeman pretended to be injured so they would help him. Nato says it is restricting operations . with Afghan troops following the string of deadly attacks on its . personnel by rogue Afghan security forces. Only large operations will now be conducted jointly, with joint patrols evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Attacked: Smoke can be seen rising from Camp Bastion buildings in the Taliban attack where two US Marines were killed . Deadly: The Taliban claimed responsibility on Saturday for the attack on the British base . The news comes after the deaths of the two soldiers prompted a furious reaction from MPs and relatives yesterday â who demanded that troops were brought home from an âunwinnable warâ. Yesterday Sergeant Thursbyâs stepfather Brain Whitaker, 58, said UK troops were fighting a âlosing battleâ. Mr . Whitaker, who lives with Garethâs mother, Caroline, 49, in Padiham, . Lancashire, added: âWe just feel numb at the moment but it is absolutely . ridiculous that our troops are still out there. âGarethâs . death just shows that these people donât want us there and as soon as . we leave the Taliban will be back in power.

The weekend's news brought the total number of members of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 430. Answering an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Hammond insisted the strategy of 'mentoring and training' Afghan army and police was vital to the war effort, adding: 'We cannot and we will not allow the process to be derailed.' Afghan deputy foreign minister Jawed . Ludin said he understood Nato's efforts to protect its forces but . insisted the move did not represent a 'break in the partnership' to . train Afghan forces to take over in 2014. 'This insider attack phenomenon is a matter of deep concern for all of us,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'This is a challenge that has come up in what is really a very essential mission and that is to get the Afghan forces up to speed. Thomas Wroe is pictured with his mother Claire, father, Mick and sister Demi . 'We are fully aware and conscious of this and how important it is and that it could affect our joint effort and we are trying our best. 'For Nato to take measures to reduce the risk of these attacks being repeated is a very natural thing. We totally understand it. 'But this should not be overstated because these are just some of the measures to reduce risk; they do not in any way represent a break in the partnership that exists on a day-to-day basis and this will continue.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:17 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 15:20 EST, 20 September 2012 . An innocent couple were accused of battering their month-old baby who was taken away and put up for adoption after the baby milk they fed him caused rickets. Social workers, experts and even a judge had assumed the child had been the victim of horrific abuse after he was found to have suffered broken bones. After hearing expert evidence in June . last year, a judge at Sheffield High Court ruled that one or other of . the parents must have been responsible for the injuries. London's Appeal Court heard there is evidence that the boy was born with a Vitamin D deficiency, inherited from his mother, and that this led to 'soft bones' and rickets . The same judge refused to change her mind earlier this year and freed the boy for adoption. Now, however, the parents have been given a final chance to get him back after lawyers had a 'light bulb moment' and understood the full significance of the youngsterâs medical records. Michael Shrimpton, for the family, from the Sheffield area, told Londonâs Appeal Court that there is evidence that the boy was born with a Vitamin D deficiency, inherited from his mother, and that this led to 'soft bones' and rickets. Although blood tests carried out when he was four weeks old were normal, the barrister said his congenital condition would by then have been 'masked' by the formula milk given to him by his mother - which contained Vitamin D supplements. Mr Shrimpton argued that rickets was the true explanation for multiple broken bones suffered by the baby boy which could have been caused during his difficult forceps birth, or even in-utero. He pointed to 'striking' medical records which showed severe abnormalities in the functioning of the baby boyâs liver, an organ instrumental in processing Vitamin D. Now Lord Justice McFarlane has intervened in the case, directing that the evidence be reviewed by a fresh medical expert. Mr Shrimpton said that one of the countryâs top endocrinologists, Professor Stephen Nussey, who has carried out pioneering work on the causes and effects of Vitamin D deficiency, will be instructed to carry out that task if he is available at short notice. Observing that medical knowledge on the causes of infant injuries is in a state of contant movement, the barrister added: 'This is an important case. It is starting to take on the appearance of a leading test case'. However, Lord Justice McFarlane observed: 'Medical knowledge of how some children may have bones that are more susceptible to injury than normal children has moved on'. He added that there was no evidence of emotional difficulties, domestic violence, alcohol or drug abuse, or any signs of dysfunction within the family, to indicate a risk of child abuse. Emphasising the extreme urgency of the case in light of plans for the boyâs imminent adoption, the judge gave the parents 28 days to obtain a report from Professor Nussey, or another expert, in support of their case. Recognising the parentsâ 'exceptionally awful' experience in having their child taken from them, he said the court would carefully examine whether the Vitamin D deficiency explanation for the boyâs injuries was 'more than an intellectual possibility'. The local authority involved in the case had informed the Appeal Court that suitable adoptive parents have already been found for the boy but no further steps in the process would be taken prior to the court ruling on the case. The case will return to the Appeal Court once the expert medical report has been obtained.","Social workers, experts and a judge had assumed the child had been the victim of horrific abuse .

A prison guard was killed and five of his colleagues were injured last night during a nine-hour riot as up to 300 inmates held dozens of hostages at a jail containing thousands of illegal immigrants. The unnamed 23-year-old is thought to have been fatally smashed over the head with a makeshift weapon during the melee at the Adams County Correctional Center near Natchez, Mississippi. Three inmates were also hurt - with one suffering stab wounds - during clashes which officials claim were sparked by a power struggle between gangs but prisoners blame on 'mistreatment' by guards. At one point during the standoff, 15 employees were freed after the guards, who do not have guns, opened a section of fence while this exit route was protected by armed law enforcement officers. Melee: Smoke rises above the Adams County Correctional Center in Natchez, Mississippi yesterday . No prisoners escaped during the melee in which prisoners lit several fires around the complex that burned well into the night. Smoke rose above the razor wire-rimmed private facility that holds more than 2,500 prisoners while clouds of choking pepper spray also clogged the air after the riot began at 2.40pm yesterday. The riot finally ended at around 11.30pm after Sheriff and SWAT teams caged all of the inmates, who armed themselves with trash can lids, mop handles and wood ripped from bunk beds and bleachers. Adams County Coroner James Lee confirmed that a guard died, but said he could not provide any other details until the officer's family was notified. The five injured guards were taken to a hospital and treated for injuries that weren't considered life-threatening. Among the hurt inmates, one was being treated for a stab wound, another concussion and a third rib injuries. An investigation has been launched to establish how the riot began and who is responsible for the death, injuries and damage to the prison owned by the Corrections Corporation of America. Night: Smoke rises from the prison where the riot lasted for nine hours after finally being ended at 11.30pm . Adams County Sheriff Chuck Mayfield, who said two dozen hostages were taken, told the Natchez Democrat newspaper the riot had an initially been attributed to a power struggle between inmates. But some prisoners have claimed the riot began amid a protest over the alleged mistreatment by guards. 'They always beat us and hit us. We just pay them back,' one inmate told WAPT TV News based in the state capital of Jackson. 'We are trying to get better food, medical programs, clothes, and we're trying to get some respect from the officers and lieutenants.' A SWAT team helicopter encircles the prison, were inmates are believed to have taken dozens of hostages . The 2,567-bed prison houses adult male illegal immigrants for the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Most will be deported once they have completed their sentences. CCA spokesman Steve Owen confirmed in an email âthere has been one employee deathâ but he said he could not provide more details immediately. He said in an email early Monday âit is my understanding that all staff are accounted for.â He said the company was investigating what prompted the uprising. Adams County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Emily Ham said no inmates had escaped the facility. After the uprising began, CCA's Special Response Team and the Mississippi Highway Patrol's SWAT team sought to quell activities within the prison while state and local law-enforcement officers secured the perimeter of the complex, Adams County Sheriff Chuck Mayfield said in a statement. Mayfield added that prison personnel had âgained total controlâ of the complex.","Young guard died after being 'smashed over the head' during riot in Natchez .

A Thai carer who bludgeoned to death her pensioner lover with a claw hammer after he changed his will to leave her Â£340,000 was today jailed for life. Bunthawee Rimmer, 49, launched the frenzied attack on veteran soldier Paul Norfolk with a 12oz hammer as he slept. She arrived in Britain in 1998 after her late husband Geoffrey Rimmer met her on a Thai beach while she was selling doughnuts. Mr Rimmer died in xxx and Bunthawee the started a sexual relationship with Mr Norfolk - her dead husband's best friend - in 2010 after she was employed to care for his sick wife Esme, who suffers from alzheimer's. Murder: Paul Norfolk, 77, was bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer by his Thai lover Bunthawee Rimmer, 49, after he left her everything in his will. She was today jailed for life . She savagely hacked her OAP lover to death just three months after he changed his will to leave her his entire Â£340,000 estate - instead of his frail wife. When police broke into Mr Norfolk's home on December 31 last year they found Rimmer lying on the bed next to his bloodied body. The killer, also known as Pacer, had slit her own throat, stabbed herself in the chest, taken an overdose and even drunk toilet cleaner in a failed bid to take her own life. She was taken to hospital but was arrested and taken into police custody on 31 December, when medics released her. Rimmer told police she believed Mr Norfolk planned to throw her out of his home, a claim which a judge rejected. Rimmer accepted . killing Mr Norfolk, but denied murder and claimed diminished . responsibility, blaming depression she was suffering from at the time. A juryÂ  found Rimmer guilty of murder by a majority verdict having deliberated for seven hours and 35 minutes. Rimmer leaves court after an earlier hearing. A jury convicted her today with a majority verdict . Jailing her at Ipswich Crown Court, with a minimum tariff of 11 years, Mr Justice John Saunders said Rimmer's attack had been 'wicked'. He said: 'I do not lose sight of the fact that a decent man has lost his life in a brutal fashion at the age of 77. 'Paul Norfolk was by all accounts a well liked, decent man. His death is a tragedy for his family, some of whom have given evidence and demonstrated admirable fairness and restraint in the way they did this. 'No-one should lose their life in the way that Paul Norfolk did. 'It was a wicked thing to do, as I am satisfied the defendant recognised and led to her trying to kill herself.' Mr Justice John Saunders added: 'I am satisfied that the defendant's account that Paul Norfolk was saying that he was going to dispense with her services as a carer was untrue. 'It is inconsistent with the rest of the evidence which was to the effect that Paul Norfolk was saying that he couldn't live without the defendant. 'In the early hours of the morning of the 30th December the defendant armed herself with her hammer and struck Paul Norfolk at least twelve fierce blows with the hammer. 'I will deal with the defendant on the basis that this was a determined attempt on her own life and she did cause herself significant injury. 'I do not know why she killed Paul Norfolk. Thereafter in prison I am satisfied that her mental state, which was affected by depression, deteriorated further.' Rimmer murdered Mr Norfolk in the early hours of December 30 last year by hitting him over the head 12 times with a claw hammer while he was asleep. The court heard she had heard voices when she got up in the night, saying: 'Dead, dead, dead.' The killer later admitted to 'vaguely' remembering making a cup of tea and going downstairs to pick up a hammer and three knives. During her trial prosecutors told the court she had moved into Mr Norfolk's home in Haverhill, Suffolk, in 2010, after her own husband died of natural causes. She carried on living in the semi-detached house after Mrs Norfolk, who she cared for, was moved into a care home. Later she started a sexual relationship with Mr Norfolk, who was a former employee of scent firm International Flowers and Fragrances (IFF), in Haverhill. The pensioner, who served in the army's Tank Regiment for three years from the age of 18, then changed his will three months before his death to leave his entire estate to Rimmer instead of his wife. Speaking through an interpreter, Rimmer, who has a son from a previous marriage, said that she had felt sad because Mr Norfolk told her he wanted to 'dump her'. Andrew Johnson, prosecuting, said: 'I put it to you that, for reasons that you do not want to tell this jury, you decided to kill Mr Norfolk.' Rimmer replied: 'I have never thought of killing Mr Norfolk. I love him. I have no reason to kill him.' When asked about her sexual relationship with Mr Norfolk, Rimmer replied: 'I did not really want to but I wanted to please him because I knew it would make him happy. When he was angry he would grab my shoulders.' When asked why she did not call an ambulance after Mr Norfolk was injured, she said that she was unaware of what had happened because of the pills she had taken. Following the sentence Mr Norfolk's family released a statement paying tribute to him. It read: 'Paul was the youngest of a family of four and had a happy childhood in the village of Ridgewell. We were a happy and united family. Paul was a popular and well liked member of the community. 'At eighteen years old, he joined the Tank Regiment and served in the army for three years. He was well-liked by his army friends and was still in touch with one of them at the time of his death. 'For thirty years he was employed at IFF in Haverhill. Upon marriage he settled into his house in Castle Lane, where he was still living at the time of his death. 'Paul was a very generous, kind and sympathetic man. He was liked and respected by everyone who knew him especially by his neighbours and their children by whom he was affectionately called 'Uncle'. He was always ready to help others. 'His brother and I (both in our eighties) are completely devastated by the wickedly cruel way in which our gentle, loving and much loved brother was taken from us. It was a blow from which we shall never recover. 'Our remaining years will be spent grieving for him, who brought joy and happiness into our lives and whom we shall always remember as our dearest Paul. With all our love, Peter and Pansy.'","Paul Norfolk bludgeoned to death with 12oz claw hammer as he slept .

Two dejected armed police officers stare blankly into space after smashing their Â£30,000 patrol car into an notorious set of rise-and-fall traffic bollards. The officers were driving along a restricted road when the electronically operated bollards - designed to only let buses through - rose up under their unmarked BMW. The front and underside of the 530i model was left a wreck after the accident on Market Street in Manchester. Embarrassed: Two armed police officers patiently wait for a recovery vehicle to remove their damaged patrol car after smashing it into a set of rise-and-fall traffic bollards . Notorious: The bollards on Market Street have written-off numerous cars since they were installed in 2006 . The male and female PC - both sporting body armour with guns in their holsters - had to wait two hours for a tow truck to take the vehicle away, an experience made all the more excruciating by laughing onlookers taking pictures with their mobile phones. The embarrassed male officer slumped against the grey patrol car looking at the floor while his female colleague sat on the kerb of the pavement. Both now face a carpeting from their superiors over their driving escapade amid fears the vehicle could be written off. Council bosses had previously warned that motorists who crash into the bollards could face legal action for causing damage under the Road Traffic Act. They said accidents were caused by cars tailgating the buses and branded guilty motorists 'selfish and silly'. Amused: Laughing passers-by gathered to take photos of the officers' misfortune on their mobile phones . One for the collection: These young men made sure they lined up a good shot of the accident . It is not known whether the two officers were following a bus when the accident occurred. The bollards are designed so that only buses and emergency vehicles can pass through by activating a sensor which lowers the posts. But the bollards rise again immediately after each vehicle has passed. As well as numerous road signs, motorists are alerted by flashing lights and audio warning messages. One onlooker said: 'The police officers were absolutely mortified at what happened and were clearly very embarrassed not least because shoppers and other onlookers were laughing at them. 'One old guy was giving them a lecture about driving properly in Manchester whilst another was shouting ""karma"" because he got fined the previous weeks for doing a U-turn. 'That wait for the tow truck must have been the most embarrassing moments of their lives.' Severe damage: The unmarked Â£30,000 vehicle is feared to have been written-off in the incident . The BMW is attached to a recovery truck. In the foreground are the bollards that rose up from beneath the car . The pair of 3ft-high telescopic posts were installed in Market Street in 2006 after it emerged that the road was one of the worst accident hotspots in the city. The bollards caused controversy when four cars were written off in five days as they tried to drive over them. In a recent interview, Manchester City Councillor Pat Karney said: 'I just cannot believe it that we have this precious piece of road which ensures maximum safety for pedestrians... but selfish and silly motorists think they can take on these bollards. 'Weâve got four warning signs here. What bit do they not get on the four warning signs? It really is, when it comes down to it, selfish behaviour.'","Two armed police officers spent an excruciating two hours ignoring the laughs of passers-by in central Manchester today after smashing their Â£30,000 patrol car into a notorious set of rise-and-fall traffic bollards ."

When it comes to baking, it seems there is nothing Mary Berry does not know â and cannot do. Yet the doyenne of the BBCâs Great British Bake Off has stunned fans by admitting that there is one challenge so tricky even she refuses to take it on: making filo pastry. Mary, 77, who trained at Le Cordon Bleu school in France when she was 17 and has published more than 70 cookery books, revealed that filo is the one thing she buys ready-made from shops. The paper-thin pastry is notoriously difficult to make from scratch as it needs to be so delicate you can read a page through it. Mary told The Mail on Sunday: âI never make filo pastry because it takes so much effort and I am short of time. âI think the last time I did make it from scratch was when I was a teenager training at cookery school. Instead, I buy it for about Â£2 from Greek shops in London. I then use what I need and keep the rest in the freezer. âHome-made filo takes too much time and skill. When I was a teenager at cookery school, I and the other students had so much fun learning to make it. We would slap it on the table and bang it about to work the gluten.â Mary hinted at purchasing the product on last weekâs show when contestants were tasked withÂ  baking strudel. While the contestants busily carried out the time-consuming preparation, Mary said: âItâs the one pastry that I have to confess I would buy.â Immediately following the admission, users of social network site Twitter voiced their surprise.

Itâs fantastic that more people are baking at home and if they can use something to cut a corner, then Iâve not got a problem with that.â Mary also told The Mail on Sunday . why she thinks the BBC show â where contestants strive to achieve a . âgood bakeâ and avoid the dreaded âsoggy bottomâ â has become such a . ratings success.

On the morning of June 26, Mrs Newbold told police she noticed a sliding glass door in the family's home was open and the girl wasn't in her bed. Authorities mounted a search and found the girl's pink pajamas and undergarments in a field a short distance away from the home. Her body was found floating face down in a canal one hour later. An autopsy revealed the girl was sexually assaulted and strangled but the official cause of death was drowning. Black was arrested on June 29 on suspicion of car theft and bank robbery.

A waffle restaurant in Washington, D.C. has gone under, and is blaming Groupon for its financial woes. Back Alley Waffles, which opened in April, said it was forced to shutter its doors because of Grouponâs sluggish reimbursement plan, co-owner Craig Nelsen claims. His site now advertises $450 waffles to make up for the lack of money flowing in, saying that heâd ârather have my hand slammed in a car door than honour your Groupon coupons.â Scroll down for full letter to Groupon holders . Out of luck: Washington, D.C. waffle shop Back Alley Waffles has gone out of business, and co-owner Craig Nelsen, pictured with his dog Buddy, blames Groupon . Grievances: Mr Nelsen is now offering waffles for $450 at his shop in the Shaw neighbhourhood of D.C. The restaurant, which was located in the Shaw neighbourhood of Washington, boasted a simple menu of fluffy waffles and fresh fruit smoothies, as well as coffees and chai. But because of Grouponâs reimbursement policy, Mr Nelsen lamented: âAfter taking a big chunk of the money as its share, Groupon holds onto the businessâ share, using it while the business waits. And waits. And waits,â according to Washington City Paperâs Young & Hungry blog, which first reported the story. Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler told MailOnline that their payments to Back Alley Waffles were up-to-date. Furthermore, she said, that only 18 per cent (or 132) Groupons had been redeemed, meaning that Groupon was paying the waffle shop 'aggressively' ahead of customers redeeming the deal. Ms Mossler added that in most cases, Groupon buyers bring in friends and spend beyond the value of the Groupon. Mr Nelsen said that he waited about a month for the first of three payments, saying that the money was issued as a check rather than being deposited electronically into a bank account. The check, he said, then arrived by snail mail. But, he said, all of his operating costs â buying ingredients, paying rent and his employees â were due up front, meaning that Mr Nelsen had to put money he didnât get until months later to pay for running his business. Groupon spokeswoman Julie Mossler told MailOnline in a statement: 'Mr Nelsen initially approached Groupon and our merchant advisors structured a deal to best encourage overspend and help his business grow. âWe also required Back Alley to cap the number of Groupons sold to ensure the feature was in the best interest of both consumers and the merchant. We scheduled his feature on his terms, on a date he selected, under a contract he reviewed and signed. According to our records, only 132 Groupons, or 18 per cent sold, have been redeemed since Back Alley ran two months ago, and Mr Nelson has received 2/3 of his share of the revenue to date. âWe always hate to hear that a local business has decided to close, but the math does not point to Groupon as the cause.' Fare enough: Back Alley waffles sold Belgium waffles, as well as fruit smoothies and coffee (stock photo) Mr Nelsen did not immediately responded to MailOnlineâs request for comment. Groupon demands payment as soon as coupons are sold to consumers. The company then keeps a share, and issues three separate instalments to the business, 25 to 30 days apart, according to the Wall Street Journal. However, not all business owners are happy with the payment model. Mark Grohman, who owns Meridian Restaurant in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, told the paper last November: âThe payment timing is so erratic you canât count on any of that money helping to pay your bills.â He said that it was difficult to keep his business going strong because money is needed immediately in the food business for payments to vendors and staff. LivingSocial and Amazon Local promise the full share in 15 days, while Google Offers says theyâll pay 80 per cent in the first four days, and the remaining 20 per cent over the next 90 days. However, Groupon spokesperson Julie Mossler told MailOnline that many businesses prefer the 33/33/33 model. They added that many times, they are paid more, because some customers do not redeem the Groupon before it expires. The former waffle restaurant owner told the Washington Post: âGroupon was a backbreakers. We couldnât pay staff or get food or anything. The world seemed very dark at that point.â Mr Nelsenâs restaurant was never free . from problems. Several reviewers on Yelp said that while the waffles . were incredible, it was hard to know when the breakfast treat would be . there. One Yelp reviewer who went to the . restaurant in July wrote: âEach time, I was greeted with a sign on the . door that said âRe-Opening at 12:30â because they were out of waffles.â The reviewer said there were always lines out the door, and even then, . they were sometimes turned away without explanation. However, Mr Nelsen puts some of the blame on himself. âI might have jumped without checking very well,â he told the Post. The $450 waffle offering is intentionally sardonic, and so far, Mr Nelsen hasnât had any takers. Other business owners found their Groupon deal less of a blessing, and more of a bane. Last November, the Daily Mail wrote of a cake shop owner in the U.K. who featured her specialty cupcakes at a 75 per cent discount. Need A Cake owner Rachel Brown said at the time that the deal was the worst decision she ever made, and took a $19,000 loss in staff overtime and supplies to make the gourmet cupcakes. She told the Daily Mail: âEven a much larger company would have difficulty coping, but my poor staff were having to slog away at oll hours â one of them even came in at 3am because she couldnât sleep for worry.â Investors were initially excited at Grouponâs IPO which, apart from Facebook, was the biggest in history. But the group deal site posted staggering losses to the tune of $42.7million. But now, Groupon stock is worth only $7.38 a share, more than 60 per cent lower than its IPO price. Its stock hit record lows the week of July 11th, with analysts citing the Euro crisis as a persistent problem. The cut was also driven by a reduction in estimates for the companyâs 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The companyâs estimated worth next year is now $718million, down from $930million, Reuters reported. Going public: Groupon CEO Andrew Mason seen speaking after Groupon's IPO last November . The system works as follows: subscribers log on to Grouponsâ âdeal-a-dayâ website where they can buy a voucher that offers a number of daily discount deals on anything from restaurant meals to spa treatments. The U.S.-based company uses collective buying power to negotiate bargain-bucket prices with retailers, which become available only if a minimum number of people sign up. Even though Groupon takes up to half the price of the vouchers, the retailers and restaurateurs participate in hopes of curating new, loyal customers. According to a study earlier this month by Rice University, the daily deal industry is thriving, contrary to some reports. The study claims that these deals by discount sites like LivingSocial, Groupon, BuyWithMe, and Amazon Local bring in 80 per cent new patrons to the business. However, the study notes that the daily deals are sustainable to only 30 per cent of businesses. Here's our Groupon story: . Groupon promises to send you lots of new customers. The customers buy 50% off coupons (two waffles for the price of one, for example). They send the money to Groupon, which issues them a code. The customer brings the code into the shop. The shop gives the customer the two waffles, collects the code, and then 'redeems', or verifies, the code with Groupon. Does Groupon then electronically deposit the money that the customer paid them for the coupon into the business' bank account overnight like credit card companies do? No. After taking a big chunk of the money as its share, Groupon holds on to the business' share, using it while the business waits. And waits. And waits. And waits. After about a month, Groupon issues the first of three payments to the business. By check. Then it has to ""process"" the check, which can take up to ten days. Then it snail mails the check. A month later, the process is repeated for your next installment. Then, a month later, the process is repeated again for your final installment. Now, keep in mind, the bulk of the Groupon activity (i.e., the big surge in customers) occurs at the outset of the Groupon campaign. That means the business has to lay out all the money (in our case food and labor) up front to service this expensive campaign, but it takes roughly a month for Groupon to send the (deeply discounted) payment for the waffles those customers ate. And even then its only half or less of what is owed. The business has to wait for most of the remainder of its money until two months after laying out the cost of the food and labor. And for some of the money, it will be three months after honoring the customer's Groupon coupon in the shop before the business is paid for that customer. That's the part that I didn't expect and the part that put our new business out of business.

Staunch criticism: Lord Turner, chairman of the FSA, is a frontrunner to replace Mervyn King at the Bank of England when he steps down next year . Banks rip off customers and give the impression that they serve only their own interests, Britainâs top regulator warned yesterday. Lord Turner, chairman of the Financial Services Authority, said millions have lost trust in the financial services industry. He said people were âangry with banks and bankersâ and added: âThey doubt banksâ values, and they doubt whether banks have their interests at heart.â In a speech in London yesterday, he criticised the culture in the City, singling out the example of bankers drinking champagne to celebrate fiddling the Libor interest rate. He said the incident had exposed âa dealing room culture of cynical greedâ. The only way to stop the view that these people are âbankstersâ â a pun on the word âgangstersâ coined by headline writers â is for bosses to make controlling dishonest behaviour their number one job. Huge bonuses have âamazed and bewilderedâ hard-working people, who can earn less in a lifetime than a City worker gets in a single bonus. Lord Turner, a front runner to become governor of the Bank of England when Sir Mervyn King steps down next year, told an audience of business leaders that a series of scandals had destroyed banksâ reputation. In recent weeks, Barclaysâ three most senior executives have resigned over its manipulation of the inter-bank lending rate, Libor, and it has emerged that HSBC laundered billions of pounds from rogue states and drug cartels. This is on top of the Â£9billion mis-selling of payment protection insurance. Scandalous: In recent weeks, Barclays' three . most senior executives have resigned over its manipulation of the . inter-bank lending rate, Libor . Lord Turner warned: âThere is far greater potential in retail financial services than in other sectors for producers to rip off consumers.â He questioned how some bankers can go home at night thinking they are âa fine upstanding member of societyâ when they have simply sold on toxic loans to âill-informed investorsâ. He added: âBanks are only likely to earn the trust of customers and the respect of society at large if, from the very top, there is a clear message. â[It is] that there are many things which may be profitable, which may be within the legal rules, and which neither the customer nor the supervisor will necessarily ever spot... but which go against firm values and which the bank therefore will not do.â He suggested that if a bank fails in the future, there should be âautomatic sanctionsâ against directors. They must prove their innocence, rather than the regulator having to prove his or her guilt. His comments came as Lord Green, the trade minister and former chairman of HSBC, yesterday admitted in a letter that he âregretsâ the bankâs serial money laundering. But Labourâs shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, Chris Leslie, said the letter âtotally fails to address questions about what he knew and whenâ. Mr Leslie said Lord Green must come to the House of Lords to explain.","Lord Turner criticises culture of the City, singling out dealers swigging champagne as they fiddled Libor rates .

Body in the bag spy Gareth Williams could have easily locked himself inside the holdall in which he died, an Army veteran revealed today. The inquest into the MI6 agentâs death heard how a number of experts unsuccessfully tried to lock themselves inside a bag up to 300 times. But Jim Fetherstonhaugh, 49 - a sergeant in the Royal Artillery for 22 years - discovered a simple method by which a holdall can be zipped up and locked from the inside without assistance. Scroll down for video . Demonstration: Jim Fetherstonhallgh shows how the M16 spy was able to lock himself in the bag . The technique is the reverse of a well-known trick used by airport thieves to steal from locked bags, as long as they are flexible and the sides can be pinched together. Intrigued by the mysterious case of the MI6 agent, he asked his daughter Izzy, 16, to climb inside an identical North Face bag to test his theory. The teenager, who at 5ft 5ins was 3ins shorter than Gareth, easily fitted inside the bag in the foetal position before partially closing it. She drew her legs up to her body and was able to draw the two zip pulls together while leaving a gap for her hands to protrude through and close the padlock. Izzy then tensed her body and the zip simply sealed itself leaving her successfully shut inside the bag holding the key to the padlock. Squeeze: Mr Fetherstonhaugh's daughter Izzy, 16, begins the process of getting inside the holdall . Inside: Izzy begins to do the zip up . But crucially, the procedure is said to be much easier in a bath where the occupant of the bag can push against the sides for assistance. Jim, of Shrewton, Wiltshire, served around the world as a sergeant with the 33 Regiment, Royal Artillery, for 22 years until he retired five years ago and has been a reservist ever since. He claims that, despite Mr Williams being taller than his daughter, this would not have made much difference. He said: âThe man on TV tried it 300 times and I was amazed he couldnât do it. âIâve told my friends and show them and their jaws drops - it is so obvious, maybe people are thinking too much into it. âShe is 5ft 5 and he was 5ft 8 but when youâre in the foetal position inside that height doesnât make much difference. âShe had a bit of a struggle pulling . the bag but she wouldnât have been as strong as him. I could easily see . that he would be able to do it. Nearly there: Izzy finishes off with the zipping process . Secured: Using a padlock, Izzy secures the bag . A similar technique is used to steal from locked holdalls, where the end of the bag can be squeezed together to create âslackâ in the zip. This creates enough room for an opening in the zip without unlocking the padlocks. However, one of the reasons why other experts said they couldn't zip themselves in bags was because there wasn't enough room to manoeuvre in a bathtub. Mr Fetherstonhaugh contacted the Met Police via the forceâs 101 number and he was provided with a serial number but they have yet to respond to him. A spokesman for the force refused to comment today. The revelation raises questions over the coronerâs findings, which concluded Mr Williamsâ death âunnatural and likely to have been criminally mediatedâ. Mysterious death: Gareth Williams was found dead inside a holdall in his bath . Failed: A reconstruction showing a yoga specialist trying to lock himself in a sports holdall shown at the inquest . Mr Williamsâ former landlords told the inquest how they once found him handcuffed alone to a bed, suggesting he had a fetish for restraint. To test the method,Â  reporter Claire Hayhurst, who is 5ft 4in tall and of slight build similar to Mr Williams, zipped herself into the bag without assistance. She repeated the task a number of times on video and was eventually able to do it in less than three minutes.

Fans of new Ewan MacGregor film Salmon Fishing in the Yemen have been bombarding the country's tourist board with requests to try out its angling scene. Yemeni officials have been 'inundated' with queries from people hoping to visit since the film's release - despite the fact the country is the scene of major unrest and does not have a climate suited to salmon fishing. Britain's Foreign Office has warned against all travel to Yemen, which lies on the Arabian Peninsula, citing 'violent clashes, a threat of kidnap by armed tribes, criminals and terrorists and activity by Al-Qaeda.' Fantasy: Salmon Fishing in the Yemen follows Scottish actor Ewan MacGregor as Dr Alfred Jones, who is asked to introduce salmon fishing to the rivers of Yemen by a wealthy sheikh played by Amr Waked . But the Yemen Tourism Promotion Board said the advice from the Foreign Office was 'excessive' and that some parts were 'very hospitable'. Yemen Tourism today insisted there were 'lots of similarities' between the Arabian country and Scotland, where the rest of the film is set. 'We're definitely looking to build some sort of connection between the two countries following the film, said UK spokesman Benjamin Carey. 'One . negative is that salmon fishing isn't actually that popular in Yemen, . but there are excellent sea fishing opportunities in the country.' The film, based on the popular book by Paul Torday, follows Scottish MacGregor as Dr Alfred Jones, who is asked to introduce salmon fishing to the rivers of Yemen by a wealthy sheikh. Mr Carey insisted the country was 'somewhere Scottish people might enjoy', adding: 'The bagpipes are popular in Yemen, . and they also have their very own version of haggis. 'The country of Yemen . is still very mysterious, which I think will also appeal to tourists.' Reality: The Foreign Office has warned against all travel to Yemen, pictured, because of 'continuing unrest and violent clashes, a threat of kidnap by armed tribes, criminals and terrorists and activity by Al-Qaeda' The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office last month issued a red warning over the Yemen, telling visitors to 'avoid all travel to the whole country'. Direct cargo and passenger flights from Yemen to the UK were suspended for security reasons two years ago following a failed attempt to bomb an aircraft. The Foreign Office website warns of the danger of reprisal attacks against westerners following the killing of Al-Qaeda Arabian Peninsula extremist Anwar al-Awlaki. It warns that attacks against western and British interests could be indiscriminate, including targets such as residential compounds, military and oil facilities, and transport and aviation interests. The EU is also warning against travel to the country. But Mr Carey said: 'There's been a real surge in visitors to our website since the film. There's been thousands of visits to our website. 'Unfortunately the EU is currently advising against travel to Yemen, which we think is excessive. 'Some places are very hospitable but I wouldn't advise people to go to certain places at this time.' Yemen was recently described as the 'poorest country in the Middle East' in a BBC review of the country, which also said it had 'become a haven for Islamic militants.' MacGregor, who appears alongside Emily Blunt and Kristin Scott Thomas, said: 'We learned how to salmon fish as it's a very particular style of fishing and it's quite complicated to move the line through the air. 'Amr Waked, who plays the sheik, and I had to learn. Because we are playing passionate fly fisherman. 'At the back of my mind - as is mentioned in the film - the British fisher folk are quite a passionate bunch. I can imagine all of them being horrified by my fly fishing. I did the best I could.'","However, tourist board insists the country has many similarities with Scotland .

A teen who has accused Lawrence Taylor of raping her when she was 16 cried on Tuesday as she described how the ex-New York Giant assaulted her before giving her $300 and asking that she turn off the TV on her way out. Taylor pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of sexual misconduct and patronizing an underage prostitute for having sex with her in 2010 and is serving six years of probation. The former NFL linebacker leaned forward in his chair to watch the 19-year-old testify in U.S. District Court. Trial: Former New York Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor is pictured as he leaves federal court on Tuesday after hearing testimony from his accuser . NFL icon: Taylor played for 13 seasons in the NFL and has two Super Bowl rings that he won with the New York Giants . The teen, Cristina Fierro, who has since married, told a Manhattan jury hearing her lawsuit that she didn't know who Taylor was when she found him naked on a bed in a hotel room in Montebello, just north of New York City. She says another man forced her to have sex with Taylor for $300. She said she brought the lawsuit to hold Taylor accountable. The Brooklyn-born Fierro, who grew up in Pennsylvania and New York, began weeping as she graphically described her meeting with Taylor, who says he believed she was 19 at the time. 'He said I had nice curly hair like his wife,' Fierro recalled. Accuser: Cristina Fierro, right, said she didn't know who Taylor was when she went to his hotel room and found him naked in bed in the 2010 incident . She said he told her she was pretty as he massaged her after she turned her back to him. Fierro said she went to a bathroom to call her uncle, who told her to dial 911. She said she did so and left the phone in her bag, 'waiting for shadows to come and banging on the door to come get me.' But the police never showed up. She said Taylor, who played in the NFL for 13 seasons and won two Super Bowls, got on top of her and she squirmed and tried to push him away but it 'felt like I wasn't making a difference because of how big he was compared to me.' Accused: Taylor, pictured with attorney Arthur Aidala shortly after his arrest in May 2010, was charged with sexual misconduct and prostitution charges . She said she told him it was her 'first time' and he replied, 'Just relax.' 'It was really rough and painful,' she testified, saying she felt suicidal several months later and began taking medication for depression, insomnia and anxiety. Fierro testified that when the sex was over Taylor 'just pulled out money and said, ""Here, can you turn the TV off on your way out?""' When she returned to the car of the Rasheed Davis, the man who had ordered her to have sex with Taylor, she said, she called her uncle and told him in Spanish that calling 911 didn't work. The police were waiting when Davis arrived back at the man's Bronx home. He was later sentenced to seven years in prison. Fall from grace: Taylor, who is considered to be one of the greatest linebackers in the history of the NFL, was charged with rape in May 2010 . Taylor's lawyer, Arthur Aidala, said in his opening statement that Taylor never used violence, never threatened Fierro and thought she was sent by a friend who offered 'female companionship.' Aidala tried to mitigate the circumstances by noting that Taylor 'did have sex with a woman who was 16 years, 11 months and three weeks old.' 'I am not condoning what he did,' Aidala said. 'It's a crime he's been punished for.' He said the lawsuit, seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, is 'a money grab' because of Taylor's fame. Hall of famer: Taylor, right, pictured with his son Lawrence Jr, was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999 . With cross-examination set to start Wednesday, Aidala asked the judge if he could tell the jury that a rape kit test showed the semen of two men including Taylor. The judge didn't immediately decide. Taylor, who lives in Broward County, Florida, led the Giants to Super Bowl titles in 1987 and 1991. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NFL's 75th Anniversary All-Time Team. He was expected to testify Wednesday. The Associated Press doesn't normally publish the names of accusers in sexual-assault cases unless they agree to be named or identify themselves publicly, as Fierro has done.","Victim Cristina Fierro, now 19, says she didn't know who Taylor was when she found him naked in bed in a New York hotel room .

A senior nurse was told by her boss that she was 'the wrong colour' to getÂ  a top job in nursing, a misconduct hearing was told. British-born Sarina Saiger, who has Indian heritage and a Phd, was advised to 'go back to where she came from' rather than try to become a director of nursing in Cumbria. The Nursing and Midwifery Council heard how Dr Saiger's boss, Bruce Skilbeck, made the remarks during a 2005 appraisal into her performance. Dr Saiger, who has already been awarded Â£115,000 in damages at an earlier tribunal after being sacked in 2008, said: âAfter we did a brief resume of the work I had been doing, I remember clearly he said technically I was the most brilliant nurse he had ever worked with. Victim: British, Dr Sarina Saiger, who has Indian heritage and a PhD, was labelled the 'wrong colour' to be a director of nursing in Cumbria . âBut I would never be a director of nursing in Cumbria because I was the wrong colour and wrong culture for the organisation. âHe said I needed to go back to where I came from to get a director of nursing position.â Skilbeck, who was the director of nursing for North Cumbria Acute Hospitals NHS Trust but has now retired, has been hauled before the NMC charged with two counts of misconduct against Dr Saiger which was allegedly âracially motivatedâ Halifax-born Dr Saiger had been parachuted into the trust in 2004 to raise standards as assistant director of nursing. She had excelled academically and harboured ambitions of going on to the top job, but was shot down by Skilbeck in the appraisal meeting on November 3, 2005, shortly after he joined the trust. Dr Saiger added: âI was just stunned, I have been a nurse since 1986 and Iâve faced many things in nursing. âItâs a difficult profession, but I never expected to hear that, not from someone who is supposed to be of an intellectually senior standing.â A tearful Dr Saiger told the hearing how she was studying for her PhD and raising her son Michael while working in an increasingly hostile environment. She said: âI was finding things out after the event, excluded from meetings. My PA Maria was absolutely loyal and would get me information because I wasnât kept informed. âI didnât have an office; I was working out of the back of my car. Other nurses and senior managers who were appointed after me were given an office and a desk, and access to equipment. âI was actually quite lonely.â Eventually, Dr Saiger launched a grievance against the trust, including the comments made by Skilbeck. But a prolonged investigation delivered a âwhitewashâ which absolved senior managers of blame, she said. She said: âIt was just a farce really. It completely and utterly absolved everyone and anything. âThey would find reasons, excuses, policies - everything I was saying was completely untrue.â Skilbeck is also accused of violently grabbing Dr Saiger by the arm and dragging her along a corridor, on May 31, 2007. Dr Saiger reported the incident, which left her with a badly bruised arm, to the police, but no charges were brought. She was sacked from her Â£42,000-a-year post in 2008, but launched an employment tribunal case which ruled she had been a victim of a campaign of racially-motivated discrimination and harassment. The tribunal found she had been subjected to an âintimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environmentâ. The tribunal upheld 16 of her 27 complaints and awarded her Â£115,000 in damages. Skilbeck, who is now retired, did not attend the hearing in central London today, but emailed papers to the NMC to support his case. The hearing into his alleged misconduct continues.

The inbound plane and one of the outbound planes began closing the 1.4 mile gap between them at a speed of 436 mph. When the controller realised her mistake, all three planes, which were carrying a a total of 192 passengers and crew members, were just 12 seconds apart. She immediately ordered one of the planes to change course. No one was hurt and all three planes reached their destinations without further issue.

Backed up: It is just the latest error made by air traffic controllers at increasingly busy airports . The mishap occurred as air traffic . controllers decided to change flight courses in a response to a storm . brewing just south of the airport. Controllers at Warrenton, Virginia changed the runway and direction . from which planes were landing and taking off at the airport, and told . the controller tower at the airport of the plan. The near miss at Reagan National Airport in Virginia is just one mistake of many recorded in recent years. The Federal Aviation Administration recorded a staggering 1,234 operational errors in 2009 and this jumped to 1,887 in 2010. Last year, there were 1,895 recorded mistakes. Among the 2011 figures, there were 50 of the 'most serious incidents' - those that put aircraft closest to each other or that have the greatest chance of causing collisions. Last year, the FAA took action against more than half a dozen controllers for mistakes after napping on the job during night shifts, including controllers at Reagan National. In another near-miss in 2010, a heavily-loaded United Airlines plane leaving San Francisco passed within a few hundred feet of a single-engine propeller plane. Last year, a controller put two jets on a collision course at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport before a supervisor spotted the mistake; the jets were just 225 feet apart in the air. 'The tower agreed, but they didnât pass it on to all the people they needed to pass it on to,' a federal official told the Post. When the controller at National realised the mistake, radio recordings show she ordered the pilot to make a quick turn to the south. 'We were cleared [for landing] at the river there,' the pilot said after the turn, the Post reported. 'What happened?' The controller simply responded: 'Stand by, weâre trying to figure this out.' When she told him to fly one more time around the airport to begin landing, he warned: 'We really donât have enough fuel . here for this. We have to get on the ground pretty quick.' The FAA said it is investigating the incident. 'During the switchover of operations, . miscommunication between the Tracon and the DCA tower led to a loss of . the required separation between two regional jets departing from Runway 1 . and a regional jet inbound for Runway 19,' FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown . told AFP.

In 2011, there was a minor increase to 1,895. Just last year, an air traffic controller at the same Virginia airport was found sleeping during theÂ  overnight shift, and several controllers were suspended or fired by the FAA after the revelation. A passenger as Reagan National Airport told ABC 7 he was not surprised by the near miss. 'You have to remember that people make mistakes and this is part of the problem,' Steve Wilson said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:41 EST, 19 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:59 EST, 19 May 2012 . An American woman who sent the Russian boy she adopted back to Moscow on a one-way flight has been ordered to pay tens of thousands of dollars in child support. Torry Hansen will have to pay a lump sum of $150,000 to the child she named Justin but later abandoned, as well as $1,000 per month until he is an adult. On Thursday a judge in Bedford County, Tennessee ruled that she must begin making the child support payments in June and continue to pay until the boy, who is now 10 years old, turns 18. Circuit Court Judge Lee Russell said the $150,000 Hansen must pay includes damages for breach of contract, legal fees and support for the boy. Tennessee nurse Torry Hansen took a trip to Russia in 2009 and met Artem, who she renamed Justin, in an orphanage. Their meeting is pictured here . Hansen sent Artem Saveliev back to Russia in April 2010 with a letter saying the child was disturbed and violent and she did not want him anymore. The case created an international uproar and prompted Russia to temporarily halt its adoption program with the U.S. The World Association for Children and Parents, which helped Hansen adopt the child, then filed a lawsuit seeking child support. Hansen has since moved to Redding, California and has failed to show up at any of the hearings, said Larry Crain, an attorney for the adoption agency. She has hired a series of three Tennessee lawyers to represent her but the most recent one, he said, has been granted permission to leave the case. She did, however, hire a court reporter to attend the hearing. Artem, who is now nearly ten, lives in a suburb of Moscow with his foster parents and other children who are having difficulties finding adoptive parents . Hansen filed a lawsuit last month in California against representatives of a Russian orphanage saying the Russian Federation Supreme Court annulled the adoption. 'In doing so, it denied defendants the ability to recover a sum of money in the form of child support from plaintiff,' the suit says. Hansen wants the California court to recognise the Russian decision. Adoption advocates hailed the Tennessee court order as a measure of justice for the boy, and said the judge's decision would show there are consequences to abandoning adopted children. Hansen apparently never told social workers that she was having problems with the boy. Worth forgetting: A swing set in Hansen's shared back yard in Tennessee is part of the life Artem hopes to forget. He no longer speaks any English and calls his foster mother Mama . Happier times: Artem now calls Vera Egorova, right, Mama. Pavel Astakhov, left, has a special interest in Artem's case and makes periodic visits to the SOS Village in Tomilino where Artem is living . The agency sued Hansen to deter others from doing anything similar and to show the Russians that 'you cannot do this in America and get away with it,' Mr Crain said. 'It has certainly caused concern on the part of Russian officials that unless there are consequences when a parent abandons a child placed in their home, there's a need for safeguards to make sure this never occurs,' he added. The judge said in his order that when Hansen adopted the boy she signed a contract acknowledging that it was possible the child could have physical, emotional or behaviour problems that were unreported and even unknown to the adoption agency. Lee said $58,000 of the $150,000 will pay for the past two years' worth of support and medical fees for the boy in Russia. Court documents say the boy was hospitalised for three weeks after he returned to Moscow, but they do not say what he was treated for. He was later moved to an orphanage and then sent to another institution.","Torry Hansen adopted Artem in 2009 and sent him back to Russia in 2010 .

Vile: Isle of Wight Crown court heard Anton Barnes, 22, pictured, met his victim years earlier and fantasised about having a sexual relationship with her . A rapist lured a woman to his house using a fake Facebook profile, before drugging, handcuffing and attacking her. Isle of Wight Crown court heard vile Anton Barnes, 22, met his victim years earlier and fantasised about having a sexual relationship with her. After years of no contact with his 22-year-old victim, Barnes searched for her on Facebook and created a false identity on the social networking site to befriend her. After developing a relationship they discussed the idea of her coming to the house, which he shared with his mother in Cowes, to have sex. Knowing that his mother would be out of the house, he told her to let herself in and have a 'cocktail' he had made her - which actually contained sleeping pills. Prosecuting, Anthony Bailey, said: 'There was no contact for five years, but the defendant had fantasised about having a sexual relationship with her.' 'He admitted searching for her on Facebook and creating a false profile to lure her to his house with the intention of having sex with her. He knew his mother would be out,' said Mr Bailey. They agreed to meet on a date in September last year, at around 4pm, but when she arrived at the house, she found no-one was home. She texted Barnes and he said he was out shopping, but she could let herself in. They previously discussed cocktails online and in his text he said he had left her a drink made from a 'home-made' recipe. Convicted: Barnes was jailed for six years at Isle of Wight Crown Court and will be released on licence in three . The drink was milky coloured and smelled of lemon. She was suspicious and texted him to ask if it was drugged. He said no and she drank it. The drink was later discovered to have contained four crushed Loprazalam tablets, a prescribed drug for insomnia that Barnes had taken from his grandfather. The concoction had an almost immediate effect, the prosecution said. She had difficulty moving and tried to text Barnes, but later told police her fingers would not work. She lost consciousness and awoke on the sofa in the living room, handcuffed with duct tape over her eyes, before she was carried upstairs and raped, said Mr Bailey. 'She felt stupid and dirty. The rape was unprotected and she had to wait for four months for an HIV test,' said Mr Bailey. Online trap: The rapist lied to the woman to lure her back for sex (posed by model) After the ordeal, Barnes loosened one of the restraints when she complained her watch was digging into her wrist. She was able to pull her blindfold down and see her attacker. 'He vision was blurred at first, but she immediately recognised him as the defendant, not the person she had been talking to on Facebook,' said Mr Bailey. He brought her clothes back into the bedroom. Still dazed by the drugs, she got dressed and left the house. She called a friend, who arranged for another friend to collect her and they went to the police. Barnes was arrested that night and police found masking tape, handcuffs and a restraint bar. He admitted he had 'gone after her' and after the attack he deactivated the Facebook account because he no longer needed it, the court heard. Barnes claimed his victim was not bound and blindfolded until after he had helped her upstairs, but he accepted she did not consent. He felt 'terrible' about his crime and pleaded guilty to spare her from appearing in court, said Oliver Thorne, defending. He said he felt stupid after the attack and that his victim would have felt betrayed. The court heard he was withdrawn and lacking in confidence because he had no job and lived with his mother. Barnes, of previous good character, was deemed a medium risk of committing further sexual offences. He was jailed for six years and will be released on licence in three. Judge Richard Hetherington said Barnes was a young man and a reduced sentence was appropriate.","Attacker pretended to be someone else on Facebook after fantasising about his victim .

Fast and furious, it is the Olympic sport that boils down to hundredths - even thousandths - of a second. So when your country is hosting the Games and everyone is looking at you to deliver the golds, every fraction you can gain is crucial. That's why Britain's track cycling team will be kitted out with a top secret weapon in the velodrome this week - battery-powered, self-heating 'hot pants'. Victoria Pendleton is among members of the British track cycling team who will wear the self-heating shorts during the Olympics . Sir Chris Hoy will also benefit from the technology, which has been in secret development for 18 months . Pendleton is going for three golds at London 2012 and believes the new technology will help her gain an edge . Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton and every member of the squad will sport individually-tailored and high-tech heating shorts before racing to gently warm theri leg muscles to the optimum temperature for success. While the other nations will be haring round the track and getting tired as they complete their warm-ups, the Brits will be gently toasting their thighs. The shorts - immediately and inevitably nicknamed the 'hot pants' by the British team - have been kept under wraps for the last 18 months, a secret collaboration between Adidas, British cycling and Loughborough University. Stylish: Victoria Pendleton puts on her leg warmers during a track cycling training session . The technology has the potential to change track cycling - and potentially other sports - forever. Quick release zips will allow the riders to rip off the shorts in a flash as they jump on their bikes before the start of the race, safe in the knowledge their muscles are at an optimum 38C. The technology was so secret that . designers didn't dare risk trialling it at the World Championships in . Melbourne earlier this year for fear someone might copy the technology. But . now the Games have started, the secret has been revealed - with members . of the team saying the 'hot pants' leave them 'ready to race.' Pendleton, . hoping to win gold in the individual sprint, team sprint and keirin, . said: âThe hot pants, as theyâve been nicknamed by the team, help us . keep warm during events. 'We can just put them on any time weâre in the . middle, which means we donât have to go on the bike as much. âWeâve had them for a couple of months . now, since the worlds. Weâve been trying them out in training. Theyâre . really good to use. 'They heat up almost instantaneously, you feel the . temperature on your quads and hamstrings, and it really makes the . difference. âAs a sprinter I . have lots of short events spread out through the day so itâs essential . that my muscles maintain temperature. 'The zips mean you can take them . off, literally at the last minute.Â  You can actuallyÂ  cycle in them too, . Iâve tried that. âAs a team we talk about marginal . gains a lot. Youâre making sure that every tiny detail is taken care of, . finding every advantage possible to make things run smoothly.â All the Team GB track cycling team will be kitted out with individually tailored 'hot pants' as they bid for a haul of medals in London . Hoy added: âI have definitely been feeling the benefit. As soon as you get them off, immediately before you do your standing start or flying effort, your legs feel like they are ready to go.

Britons feel they get the least value for money when purchasing birthday cards, takeaway pizzas and stamps whilst one in four cannot stand having to fork out for a colleagueâs birthday celebrations. However, good news for those in our tea-loving nation who like to sit down in front of the telly with a cuppa, the 'best value for money' list include semi-skimmed milk, kettles and flat screen televisions. These are the results of a survey carried out amongst 2,000 Britons into which products and services gave them the most - and the least - for their wages. It also emerged that on average, Brits feels they only get enough for their hard-earned pounds on about four in every ten purchases. Many popular outings such as going to a football game, taking the family to a theme park or watching the latest 3D-flick in the cinema were slated by those surveyed. Paying nearly Â£12 for a 3D cinema ticket was considered a rip-off as well as Â£43 theme park tickets and Â£45 to watch a premiership football match. Pub-goers are among those displeased with what they get for their cash. A medium glass of white wine purchased in . a pub was considered the seventh biggest rip-off and a pint of beer . came in at number 20. Un-happy birthday spendings: Birthday cards are Britain's biggest rip off, and adding a few quid to the birthday shindigs of a colleague was the only non-household cost which made the top-ten most hated payments . For those looking to cure their disappointment the following morning it is not looking good. Britons consider paying Â£16.99 for a takeaway pizza the fourth worst rip-off. Fortunately another Sunday morning essential â paracetamol â won the top spot as most value for money. To weigh up the second worst - train tickets - Brits consider both travel insurance and Â£4 all-day bus passes good buys. Those questioned also thought 69p for iPhone apps and broadband contracts for Â£18 a month were good deals. The study also concluded that Brits hate spending their money on everyday bills and car maintenance. 1. Birthday card - Â£32.

A protester who burst into the middle of the Leveson inquiry as Tony Blair gave evidence revealed today how it was 'surprisingly easy' to get past security into the court. David Lawley-Wakelin, 49, got into Court 73 at the Royal Courts of Justice through a 'secure corridor' and accused the former Prime Minister of being a war criminal. He shouted: âThis man should be arrested for war crimesâ, gesturing toÂ  Mr Blair. Scroll down for video . Embarrassing: David Lawley-Wakelin, dressed in a white shirt and chinos, then shouted to the stunned court, 'This man should be arrested for war crimes' Bundled out: Tony Blair (far left) appeared unfazed by the disruption. Lord Justice Leveson (standing to the right of the commotion, did not. Robert Jay QC (standing below Leveson) held his head in his hands . 'Completely untrue': After peace was restored to the courtroom, Mr Blair told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely and utterly untrue' Mr Lawley-Wakelin claimed that Mr . Blair had been âboughtâ by JP Morgan, and that the US investment bank . had profited from the Iraq War. He was then marched out of the court and into a van by police officers. Speaking on LBC radio today he claimed . that it 'surprisingly easy' to get into the court and described how he . managed to gain access to the inquiry. He told James O'Brien on LBC 97.3: . 'You go through the metal detectors, any member of the public can . actually go in, and I tried to get in through the front entrance of the . Leveson inquiry but was evicted as I don't have any press accreditation. Talk show: David Lawley-Wakelin told LBC presenter James O'Brien it was 'surprisingly easy' to break into the Leveson Inquiry . Protester: David Lawley-Wakelin was arrested but it wasn't his first Blair protest. He also interrupted a debate on the Iraq War on BBC's Question Time . 'But I figured out there must be a back way in as Lord Leveson himself must have one. 'When I got there I was surprised to . find out that there was no security at all and in fact the door to the . court was wide open in the same way that Lord Leveson himself would have . got in there.' Incredibly, Mr Lawley-Wakelin admitted he was more worried about upsetting his mother than getting arrested over his stunt. Earlier, Mr Blair cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the Royal Courts of Justice for his grilling at the Leveson Inquiry . Arrested: David Lawley-Wakelin said he was from the Alternative Iraq Enquiry as he was escorted from the Royal Courts of Justice . Police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against Mr Lawley-Wakelin . He said: 'I did lose my bottle at one point and telephoned my mother to ask if I should go in and she said 'go ahead'. 'I just checked she would back me up no matter what. So I decided to go up and give my evidence.' He added it was 'a little unnerving' to find himself suddenly in the spotlight but that he decided his 'beef . with Tony Blair is too great to miss this opportunity'. Echoes: The interruption was an embarrassing echo of the 'custard pie' incident when Rupert Murdoch was attacked during a Commons Select Committee last year and his wife, Wendi Deng, leapt to his defence and slapped the attacker . During Tony Blair's evidence to the . Leveson Inquiry, Mr Lawley-wakelin shouted to a stunned courtroom: 'JP . Morgan paid him off for the Iraq war. Three months after he invaded Iraq . they held up the Iraq bank for 20 billion. It was not the first televised anti-Blair protest by David Lawley-Wakelin. The filmmaker . and veteran Iraq-War protester launched a similar attack during an . episode of Question Time on the BBC (pictured above). Posing as a member of the public until he was passed the microphone, he yelled: 'This country is led by liars who are prepared to kill in the name of oil.' His outburst was met with rapturous applause. He later travelled to Iraq to make a short film in which he claimed 'to ask its citizens and military personnel whether they agreed with him'. The Alternative Iraq Enquiry then asks: 'Should Tony Blair be taken to the Hague and tried for crimes against peace?' Following a screening of the film at the Frontline Club in west London in 2010, he led a debate with former Labour MP Clare Short and Major General Tim Cross, who was commander of the British Army during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. According to the Internet Movie Database, the film and TV professional was an assistant director on 27 episodes of Time Team - hosted by Tony Robinson - and a first assistant director on a 2010 Everest documentary entitled The Wildest Dream. He is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called Saint Dracula 3D. He once also appeared with anti-Iraq war MP George Galloway in a TalkSport radio show last year. 'He was then paid six million dollars . every year and still is from JP Morgan six months after he left office. This man is a war criminal.' As chief counsel Robert Jay QC, who . had been leading Blair's grilling, held his head in his hands, security . guards jumped on the man to stifle the commotion and bundled him out of . the chamber. Mr Blair, who is a senior adviser at . JP Morgan on a reported salary of between Â£500,000 and Â£2.5million, . immediately told the court that the man's accusations were 'completely . and totally untrue'. Mr Lawley-Wakelin was arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace but released without charge after two hours. Police and prosecutors are now . deciding whether to press charges against Mr Lawley-Wakelin after the . Lord Justice Leveson ordered an investigation into how he breached . security. He said: 'A man by the name of David . Lawley Wakelin interrupted and disrupted the proceedings of this Inquiry . for purposes of his own. 'I directed that an inquiry should . take place and it has how been completed. Appropriate measures to . prevent any risk of repetition have been taken.

France is offering to pay local fisherman to cull sharks in the waters of its Indian Ocean isle Reunion. The nation's government is controversially pressing ahead with the plans despite a wave of protest from conservation groups. It is in response to a spike in deadly bull shark attacks on surfers and swimmers off the coast of the paradise island, the most recent being just last week. Fears: There are 40 different species of shark which frequent waters off RÃ©union Island, 10 of them are potentially dangerous and two - the bull shark (pictured) and great white - deadly . Animal rights groups are criticizing the culling plans, calling it 'extermination'. The local government has called the payments as unprecedented for the French-administered island and necessary to encourage shark killings. Fearsome: Both male and female bull sharks have the most testosterone of any animal on the planet . Paradise isle: Tens of thousands of tourists travel to Reunion Island every year in search of tropical sun, white sands and glistening seas . The amount being offered is still being decided upon, but the money would likely be paid out per kilo of shark meat. From 2000-2010 there were no shark attacks in the area and no need for culling. Bull sharks, or Carcharhinus leucas, are the Reunionâs top predator and, like other species, females tend to be larger than males.

Like great white sharks and tiger . sharks they have serrated teeth which allow them to tear apart their . meals and go after bigger prey. Bull sharks also like to swim in shallow, coastal waters and are unusual in their ability to survive in freshwater. They are typically solitary hunters, but occasionally hunt in pairs. They can accelerate rapidly and can be highly aggressive, particularly towards animals animals that enter their territory. A bull shark's diet consists mainly of bony fish and sharks, including other bull sharks, but can also include turtles, birds, dolphins, land mammals. Last week's tragedy, in which 22-year-old Alexandre Rassica died after a shark bit off his leg, was the seventh attack - . and the third fatality - since the start of 2011. In November last year, an experienced French surfer was killed by a shark in an horrific attack off the coast of Reunion.

A Lithuanian accountant who made Nazi salutes and aimed monkey chants at black players during an Olympic basketball match has insisted such behaviour is acceptable in his home country. Petras Lescinskas, 36, has been fined Â£2,500 after he was seen raising his arm several times while placing his other hand over his top lip to imitate Hitler's moustache. He was among a group of Lithuanians heard making obscene noises during their countryâs match against Nigeria on Tuesday. His conviction came only three days after a Lithuanian was pictured making similar gestures at black stewards during their team's match against Argentina on Sunday. Repulsive: Petras Lescinkas's conviction comes only three days after another Lithuanian supporter was caught on camera making a Nazi salute towards black stewards . Lescinskas admitted racially aggravated behaviour when he appeared at Stratford Magistrates' Court yesterday. His behaviour was so appalling that it forced some families to move seats inside the basketball arena, the court heard. But Lescinskas's solicitor told the hearing that his client believed his behaviour was acceptable in Lithuania and he had done it before at previous sports matches. The defence failed to impress District Judge Sonia Sims, who fined the Lithuanian Â£2,500 and ordered him to pay Â£85 costs. 'Your behaviour was despicable', the judge told him. 'You have been intolerant of a country in a racist fashion towards others who donât deserve abuse for their race, colour or creed. Offensive: Another basketball fan (centre) gives a Nazi salute during his team's match against Argentina on Sunday. The court heard from Lescinskas that such behaviour was acceptable in Lithuania . 'As for the gesture, which has been described as a Nazi salute, it is a direct insult to all of those who lost their lives in the Holocaust and the affect on generations since. 'I do not accept that this is acceptable behaviour in your country. 'That behaviour I am sure is unacceptable to your fellow countrymen who no doubt want to distance themselves from your actions. 'The Olympics is a wondrous event not only for Great Britain but for all the nations who are competing, participating or watching on television. 'This type of conduct tarnishes the whole ethos of the Games.' The court heard that Lescinskas was part of a group of rowdy Lithuanian fans supporting their team against Nigeria in the Olympic Park on July 31. He admitted having a drink before the basketball match, which his country won 72-53, but insisted he was not drunk when the players stepped on court. Becky Owen, prosecuting, said other fans were forced to move seats because of his behaviour. She said: 'The defendant was one of a large number of Lithuanian supporters being generally loud and offensive. 'In particular the group were heard at times to be making monkey-style noises when the Nigeria team had possession of the ball. 'He was arrested because he was seen making a Nazi salute on a number of occasions while placing his finger across the top of his lip.' Clash: Lescinskas was among a group of Lithuanians heard making obscene noises during their countryÂ¿s match against Nigeria . Police officers at the scene could not confirm he directly made monkey noises - but the court heard it was accepted he was part of the group that made them. Lescinskas, still dressed in his green Lithuanian basketball supporterâs tank top in court, apologised for his behaviour in his native language. Through an interpreter, he said: 'I regret my actions, I am sorry.' Ms Gill, defending, said her client believed that his actions were acceptable in his country and he had done it before at previous sports games. She said: 'He says he has travelled to other countries and supported in this way. He has realised it is not appropriate to behave in this way. 'He regrets his actions and is deeply remorseful.'

Sentenced: Tomas Speed, 19, of Axminster, Devon, admitted . three charges of raping a 12-year-old girl . A loner groomed a 12-year-old girl for sex after winning her trust through Facebook conversations about break-ups and bereavement. Tomas Speed, 19, of Kirby Close in Axminster, Devon, admitted three charges of raping the girl, as well as taking indecent images of her. The court heard Speed - described as 'naive and immature' by mental health workers - had become isolated from his friends and family following the deaths of his father, and later his step-father, in the years and months before he began an internet relationship with the young victim. The assaults happened after the pair agreed to meet at Speed's family home in September last year. Although both parties said intercourse was consensual, Speed was convicted of rape because his victim was under the age of 13, and therefore cannot be deemed to have granted consent. Speed admitted the offences and was given a two-year sentence at a young offendersâ institution when he appeared at Exeter Crown Court today. Prosecutor Richard Crabb said Speed began talking to his victim on Facebook last summer. 'Within a short time, the conversation turned to sex,' he said. 'They were aware of how old they were. He (Speed) asked how far she would go. 'There was an element of grooming.' They met for the first time two months later, when they had sex. They subsequently met again, at Speedâs family home, during which time he used his mobile phone to video sex acts. Mr Crabb said the police were called in after the victimâs mother discovered images with a sexual content on the girlâs phone. Speed, who told police he was 'a loner', was arrested and immediately made 'full and frank admissions', the court was told. Crime scene: The assaults happened after the pair agreed to meet at Speed's family home in Axminster, Devon, in September last year . Guilty: Prosecutor Richard Crabb said Speed began talking to his victim on Facebook last summer . Defending, Sarah Hornblower said Speedâs naivety had 'a huge impact' on why the incident had occurred. She told the court Speed said the victim 'presented as somebody very mature for her age' and that the conversation was initially based on 'break-ups and bereavements' in both families. Miss Hornblower said: 'He (Speed) had a very poor relationship with his mother. His father died when he (Speed) was 14, and he was angry that he had not listened to medical advice (relating to a terminal illness).' The court was told Speedâs mother formed a new relationship with a man the teenage boy was 'very close to'. However, the step-fatherâs death in May last year from cancer prompted Speed to become 'a recluse', the court was told. Miss Hornblower added: 'He sought solace from somebody who approached him on Facebook. 'He was naive and immature.'

Daphne Fishpool, 76, reversed her car into a space before heading off for Sunday lunch with her husband John Fishpool, 70. But Canterbury Coronerâs Court heard Mrs Fishpool  was not satisfied because the wheels were not straight and insisted on correcting them. The retired shop assistant went back to the car and leaned inside to put the key in the ignition, but the car jerked backwards and the open door knocked her to the ground. Mrs Fishpool died in hospital four days later from complications following a fracture to the left femur of her thigh. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Miss Cobb said: 'It is such a shame that she died as a result of trying to do something so simple.' Mrs Fishpool, from Herne Bay, Kent, had planned to have Sunday lunch at the Prince of Wales pub in Hoath, Kent, with her retired local government officer husband Mr FishpoolÂ  on May 20. Canterbury Coronerâs Court heard Mrs Fishpool reversed into a parking spot but she was not satisfied she had left the wheels straight and insisted on correcting them. She opened the car door and leaned inside, but as she put the key in the ignition, the car 'appeared to jump backwards' and the door knocked her to the ground. She was taken to hospital, where it was found she had suffered a fracture to the left femur of her thigh. The operation was delayed until May 22 because Mrs Fishpool was taking Warfarin for an irregular heart beat. Awful: Mrs Fishpool had planned to have Sunday lunch at the Prince of Wales pub in Hoath, Kent, pictured, with her husband when the tragic accident happened . The day after surgery, she became drowsy and her blood pressure was not recordable and she became short of breath. Doctors initially thought Mrs Fishpool, who passed away on May 24, might have suffered a stroke. But a post mortem examination revealed her death was due to septicaemia and pneumonia following the femur fracture which had been repaired. The inquest heard there had been no evidence Mrs Fishpool was suffering from a chest infection on admission, and hospital tests the day after the operation revealed her chest was clear. Mr Fishpool questioned the speed with which the pneumonia set in as his wife had only been immobile for less than two days after the operation. But pathologist Dr Salim Anjarwalla said the pneumonia could have been due to immobility following the operation and said the condition can develop rapidly. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Daphne Fishpool, 76, reversed her car into a space before heading off for Sunday lunch with her husband .

Every day, she worked from 9am to 6pm . to strengthen her joint, while at night she slept with a Â£3,500 ice . machine strapped to her left knee to stop the swelling. âIf you ask Beth to describe herself . in one word, that word would be stubborn,â said her father, Jerry, who . runs a successful plastics company. âShe doesnât do giving up.â Her mother Ann, who works on a . literacy programme, added: âWhen she got that injury, I thought that was . it. I was worried about it, but Beth just carried on. Iâll never know . how she slept with that ice around her leg â she said she just got used . to it.â Within weeks of her surgery, she was declared fit to compete. âThis is the best feeling in the . world,â Tweddle, from Liverpool, said yesterday. âAll I wanted was to . finish my career with an Olympic medal in my pocket â it didnât matter . what colour.â Beth's coach of 15 years, Amanda Reddin, congratulates the stunned-looking Olympian on her hard work . Tweddle came just 0.025 points from a medal at the Beijing Games and thought about retiring from the sport then . The cheer from the crowd at the O2 arena for Tweddle was no different to that of many Team GB gold medal winners . The delighted gymnast wiped away . tears of joy after seeing her score. She had dazzled the judges with a . complex and high-risk routine that drew gasps from the audience. There . were roars from the crowd as she finished the performance, which . included the special hand-crossing move which she invented and which has . officially been named âthe Tweddleâ by the International Gymnastics . Federation. âThere was one moment today where I . thought it was going to be exactly like Beijing,â she admitted. âBut . luckily this time I had done enough.â Rory Bremner . And as she stood on the podium, she . beamed at her proud father as he recorded on video the medal moment the . family had waited two decades to see. Tweddle, who grew up in Bunbury, . Cheshire, discovered her love of gymnastics when she was seven. After . doing her A-levels at the Â£3,500-a-term Queenâs School in Cheshire, she . threw herself fully into her training. She met coach Amanda Reddin when she was 12, and has stayed with her. Now, as Britainâs most decorated gymnast, she holds three world, six European and seven British titles, and is an MBE. She has deferred a physiotherapy . degree until next year so she can spend some time with family and . friends, not least boyfriend Steve Cryer, 30. When asked about the future, Tweddle . said: âI definitely wonât be back for Rio. My body canât take it and I . donât think my coach can either.â","Russia wins gold after Aliya Mustafina managed a score of 16.133 .

A Canadian teacher may have been cleared in a sexual assault case involving an ex-student, but her troubles are far from over as she looks to recover from a case that has cost her a job and her reputation. Mary Gowans, 43, of Toronto, had been accused of engaging in 'heavy petting' and make-out sessions with a former student whom she allegedly favoured while he was one of her eighth grade French students. The boy, now 18, testified that many of their encounters occurred while he was babysitting her five and nine-year-old children in 2009 and 2010. Cleared: Mary Gowans had been accused of engaging in 'heavy petting' and make-out sessions with a former student whom she allegedly favoured while he was one of her eighth grade French students . But a judge ruled on Friday that her alleged victim's inconsistent account of their sexual relationship caused the prosecution's case to collapse. She was found not guilty, but was rebuked by Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon for getting too close to a student. 'I would have thought that her 17 years of teaching experience, she would have realized... heâs spending a lot of time in her life. Alarm bells should have gone off,' McMahon said, according to the Toronto Star. More... Female teacher, 32, 'who drank alcohol, smoked marijuana and had threesome with girl student, 16, is the victim of a homophobic law' Couple caught having sex on a beach... and then charged for the drugs police found with them . Police turned a blind eye to sex grooming gangs for more than a decade, confidential files reveal . Appearing with her attorney outside the courthouse, Gowans said that she will now focus on fixing the mess her life has become since the allegations ruined her teaching career and her marriage. She said: âObviously Iâm very glad . this is over today. It has been a very very difficult week, and the last . three years of my life have unfortunately been destroyed as a result of . these allegations. Gowans . added: 'And Iâm glad it's over but at the same time I have the task of . rebuilding my life now. I just want to thank everybody for their support . - my family and my friends - and just let everybody know I didnât do . anything wrong. Iâm glad this is done.' Student's pet: Mary Gowans, 42, has denied . having a string of sexual encounters with a 15-year-old student and said . she was stunned when he made a move on her while he was babysitting her kids . Moving on: Gowans, pictured outside court on Friday, was found not guilty - but was rebuked by Ontario Superior Court Justice John McMahon for getting too close to a student . The victim, who was not identified, had told the court that he couldnât have been making up the affair with Gowans because he knows she had breast implants and other intimate details about the 42-year-old mother. Gowans denied they had ever had an affair and claimed the teenager, now 18, had kissed her and grabbed her crotch in January 2010, after he had graduated from Joseph Howe Sr. Public School. Defense lawyers painted the . 18-year-old as a bright but arrogant teen who became âobsessedâ with his . teacher, who has since lost her job and separated from her husband of . 17 years. After the judge's verdict came down, the victimâs family told the Toronto Star that they believe the teacher was lying. In court: She added that she took him home immediately and said he could not return to the house again . The teenâs mother told the paper: 'We're disappointed with the verdict but we believe our son, and Ms Gowans can live with her lies.' During her testimony, Gowans recounted how her son and daughter were playing hide-and-seek at the home when she leaned in to the teen to reveal where her son was hiding. But to her surprise, he kissed her on the lips and grabbed her crotch, she said. 'It took a second to realize what was going on. Then, I pushed him back and said, ""What are you doing? Stop!""' she said, according to the Toronto Sun. 'He looked a little shocked and I was . extremely shocked. This was right out of the blue for me. I had . absolutely no idea this was coming. I felt he had taken advantage of my . kindness.' Accusations: The teenager, now 18, told the court they had at least four sexual encounters after his teacher took a liking to him. He admitted he had had sexual fantasies about her . In the dock: Gowans said he had become a member of the family and they regularly exchanged texts . She said she gathered herself and then told her children they were driving the boy home. The next day, after coaching the boy in hockey practice, she told him he would never return to her home. 'It never occurred to me to report him to the police. I thought the consequences like that didnât seem fitting,' she said. 'My children loved him and it was hurtful when I heard (his testimony that) he didnât care for them,' said Gowans. 'I considered him like a member of our family.' They sent text messages to each other in the week afterwards and he repeatedly apologised and said he was worried she would tell his parents, she said. A communications company testified last week that Gowans and the boy exchanged 2,218 text messages over a year beginning in February 2009. A few days later, police knocked on her door and she was arrested in front of her children. Scene: She taught the boy French at Joseph Howe Sr. Public School in Toronto.

The London stock market staged a strong recovery today following yesterday's disappointment over the European Central Bank's failure to fire the âbig bazookaâ required to save the single currency. The FTSE 100 index was 52.37 points or 1 per cent up at 5,714.67 as the market got over theÂ  lacklustre statement from ECB president Mario Draghi. France's CAC 40 is 2.98 per cent up at 3,328.82, with Germany's DAX also up 3.46 per cent at 6,834.59. It also came as U.S. firms were revealed to have hired an extra 163,000 workers in July, beating economists' forecasts. Dithering: Financial markets and the euro dived after ECB's Mario Draghi failed to give details on how to save the single currency . But the U.S. unemployment rate rose . from 8.2 per cent to 8.3 per cent last month, as more people re-entered . the workforce but failed to find a job. Those factors were expected to prompt . the Federal Reserve to launch further stimulus measures, and are . believed to be behind the French and German blue-chip markets being up . 1.5 per cent. Last week Draghi vowed to do âwhatever . it takesâ to shore up the eurozone. He added: âBelieve me, it will be . enough.â That sparked speculation that the central bank would resume its . government bond-buying programme and bring down soaring borrowing costs . in troubled countries such as Spain and Italy. But Draghi struck a far more cautious note yesterday and â having left interest rates at 0.75 per cent â said the ECB would come up with ways to help struggling countries âover the coming weeksâ. Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said: âEuropean leaders have once again failed to rise to the occasion.â Vague: Mario Draghi said the ECB would come up with ways to help struggling countries 'over the coming weeks' Stock markets across Europe slammed . into reverse following the announcement, and the FTSE 100 index lost . more than 100 points in a matter of minutes. It closed down 50.52 at . 5662.30. The crucial . 10-year bond yield in Spain â the interest rate the Government pays to . borrow â lurched back above the 7 per cent level to 7.4 per cent. Italian borrowing costs hit 6.3 per cent. Marchel Alexandrovich, an economist at . investment bank Jefferies, said: âDraghiâs words are pushing the market . into outright meltdown.â Reservations: Jens Weidmann, head of Germany's central bank Bundesbank, opposes the bond-buying programme . Michael Hewson, an analyst at City firm CMC Markets, said: âDraghi came to London last week and said, âbelieve me, it will be enoughâ, so everyone has been expecting the big bazooka. But heâs turned up today and left the firing pin at home.â Draghi insisted the euro was âirreversibleâ and warned traders that âshorting the euro is pointlessâ. But the single currency tumbled against the pound and the dollar. David Buik, an analyst at Cantor Index, said: âThat was so disappointing. In fact, it was dreadful â just rhetoric, platitudes and veiled promises â exactly what the market was not prepared to put up with. The reaction was violent.â Bond yields above 7 per cent are considered unsustainable and proved a tipping point for Greece, Ireland and Portugal, forcing them to beg for international bailouts. Cyprus has also been rescued by its European neighbours and it is feared that Spain and Italy will be the next dominos to fall, leading to a chaotic break-up of the eurozone. Spain has already been granted Â£80billion of aid to prop up its broken banks but that is widely seen as a prelude to a full-blown state bailout. The ECB was under pressure to wade back into the bond market and snap up Spanish and Italian debt to cap borrowing costs. But Draghi said there would be no immediate intervention amid opposition to bond-buying from Germany and Jens Weidmann, head of its central bank, the Bundesbank. âItâs clear and itâs known that Mr Weidmann and the Bundesbank have their reservations about the programme of buying bonds,â said Draghi. Analysts said the failure to deliver on its promises seriously undermined the credibility of Draghi and the ECB. Craig Erlam, a market analyst at Alpari, said: âWhat he said last week was theyâll do whatever it takes. Today it was more like theyâll do whatever the Bundesbank allows them to. âDraghi looked like a man defeated in the press conference, which came shortly after his meeting with Jens Weidmann. Todayâs conference really has shown who is king.â Azad Zangana, European economist at Schroders, said: âAfter building up market expectations to near euphoric levels, Draghi failed to deliver the policy to back up his promises of âdoing whatever it takes to save the Euroâ. âIf the ECB does not follow up with some meaningful action in the near future, then there is a risk that markets lose all faith in Draghiâs ability to tackle this crisis. âDraghi warned investors not to bet against the euro, but the trouble is those that are doing so have done rather well so far this year.â","European markets stage strong recovery with three main indicators all up .

He was found guilty of owning a dog . that was dangerously out of control in a public place . A pitbull owner whose dog savaged five police officers - leaving a scene like 'the sickbay at the Battle of Trafalgar' - is facing two years in jail. Symieon Robinson-Pierre did nothing while his dog Poison sunk its teeth into four police officers in a 15 minute rampage that left three of them needing surgery. He ignored pleas to call his heavily built dog off terrified officers, telling them: 'It is not the dog's fault, you should have knocked and I would have let you in'. Despite the best efforts of officers to restrain the animal, the vicious attack was only curtailed when armed officers arrived on the scene and shot it four times with a shotgun. The dog, which weighed four-and-a-half stone, pounced on officers as they raided the house in Stratford, East London, in March this year. It clamped its jaws around one officer's thigh and tried to drag him to the ground as another officer repeatedly hit it in the head with a metal battering ram, to no effect. That officer eventually prised the animal's jaws open with his baton but the dog turned on him instead, grabbing hold of his right forearm. It went on to attack other officers in the front garden. He faces two years in jail which is the maximum sentence for owning a dangerously out of control dog in a public place. PC Duncan West said he had been with his colleague PC Steve Bones when they received a call to make their way to the Stratford address. He said when he arrived he saw a number of officers standing on a wall 'trying to get away from a large brown dog which was attacking them'. He hit it with a fire extinguisher. He said: 'I hit it as hard as I physically could. I hit the dog a second time and my colleagues were hitting it with their batons. The dog made no noise, it didn't seem to have any effect on it. 'PC Bones struck the dog with his baton across the head and it turned his attention to him rather than me. 'It tried to attack PC Bones. PC Bones went to the back of the vehicle, he was being followed by the dog. He continued to try and hit it and the dog made its way to the far side of the road.' Breaking down and struggling to carry on talking before being handed a glass of water, PC West added: 'PC Bones, in an act of selfless bravery, grabbed the dog by the back of the neck. It yelped. 'It had bitten him on the left hand. He managed to pin it to the floor. PC Bones had got an injury to his left hand and he was bleeding very heavily. Initially I thought it had cost him a finger.' Savage: Mobile phone footage shows a Met Police . officer having to to take evasive action on a wall, while another is set . upon by the five-stone pitbull Poison outside the Stratford home of Robinson-Pierre . Under attack: As the officer is mauled by the dog his colleague can do nothing but look on in terror . Battle: Officers who eventually restrained the dog had to shoot it four times before it finally gave in . Alarm: Locals said they heard voices shouting for help as the dog went on the rampage outside . Detective Constable Tom Boow, who had . arrived at the property to execute the warrant with the uniformed . officers, said that seconds after entering the house he heard PC Martin . Corderoy screaming as if 'something really bad' had happened. Describing . the moment his colleagues entered in front of him, he said: 'It seemed . to me I took one, maximum two steps forward before they came back and . hit me to stop me from going forward. 'I . didn't quite know why they had come back ... I then heard PC Corderoy . screaming. It was a scream you make when something really bad happens. I . thought he had been stabbed.

Running for cover: The dog mauls the leg of the officer as he flees across the road . Neutralised: Camera phone footage shows the . moment the dog was shot by armed police . The . dog then moved on to PC Marc Merritt's arm and was 'literally hanging . off' it as he swung around in an attempt to shake him off. Det Con Boow said the struggle . continued out of the front gate, adding: 'By this time, because there . was so much noise because we were all shouting and the officers who were . being bitten were screaming an in pain, members of the public were . coming out to see what was going on. People were videoing it on their . iPhones.' He said he saw two men come to the . front door, one of whom was owner Robinson-Pierre, and the . officers shouted at them to call the dog off. 'I . remember him saying something but I honestly can't remember what he . said,' Det Con Boow continued. 'I remember him shaking his head and . hurriedly going back inside the address.' Violence: The dog's blood spatters the road where armed police shot the pitbull four times with a shotgun, after it had inflicted severe . injuries on officers executing a search warrant on Robinson-Pierre's home . Extreme measures: The dog was killed with four . blasts from a shotgun after inflicting hand, arm and leg wounds on five officers who were unable to restrain it . After the attack, Pc Corderoy was rushed to hospital for surgery and was off work for 85 days. He was left permanently scarred by the attack and even now he feels twinges of pain in his leg. Describing the moment he was mauled, he said: 'Immediately the dog had bitten into my thigh the pressure and sharpness of the teeth going into my flesh was excruciating. PC Martin Corderoy . 'I never felt anything like that in my life. I was screaming in absolute agony. I never felt pain like that. I was screaming for help, thankfully my colleagues that I work with were on that dog trying to assist me. 'That dog was on me for about two minutes, it was shaking me about. It was ripping and pulling, I could feel its front and lower teeth ripping through my leg.' He said Pc Merritt managed to get the dog to release its grip on him and he sought refuge in a parked police van. From there he witnessed the dog attacking some of his other colleagues before one managed to scramble inside to join him. 'In the brief moment that we knew we were secure in the van, I could feel blood trickling down the back of my leg,' he said. 'I could feel in a couple of areas of my leg and my trousers were ripped. 'My first thought was quite shocked to see myself with these injuries. I was just thinking to myself how bad is this? What damage has been caused to me?' Brave: Left to right are PCs Marc Merritt, Lee . Bush and Martin Corderon who were all present during the attack and . gave evidence at London Crown Court against Robinson-Pierre . Amateur video footage of the attack showed police clambering onto a wall to try escape the crazed dog, with the mauling only ending when a police marksman killed the animal with four shots. The jury heard it left behind a scene of 'carnage' in the terraced street. Prosecutor Sam Brown told the jury: 'If you need a useful image in mind of the aftermath of the event, imagine the sickbay after the Battle of Trafalgar and that will give you an idea - carnage.' Robinson-Pierre, 25, who declined to give evidence, was found guilty of three counts of being the owner of a dog which caused injury whilst it was dangerously out of control in a public place. He admitted to owning a fighting dog. Judge Mark Bishop ordered that a fourth count should be dropped as the attack took place inside the house. Robinson-Pierre was remanded in custody to be sentenced at Inner London Crown Court on September 17.","Five-stone dog Poison sent officers fleeing in terror after they broke down the door of Symieon Robinson-Pierre's home in Stratford, East London .

When BBC bosses relocated from London to Salford, critics warned that the corporationâs flagship morning news show would struggle to attract high-profile guests. Now it appears those sceptical about the 200-mile move north might have been right â as it emerged yesterday that filming of BBC Breakfastâs âlight newsâ slot could be returned to the capital. Preliminary discussions have been held at the Corporation about whether to turn the latter segment of the BBC One show into a separate programme â possibly called Breakfast Extra â which could be based in the South. Hosts Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid presenting at the BBC's new home in Salford . Insiders suggest there are concerns the section of the show between 8.30am and 9.15am â described as âthe bridgeâ, after its transition from morning news into daytime schedules â is not working well enough. Among the concerns about the segment, which features celebrity interviews, are that its live guests are not of a high enough calibre. It was revealed in July that the show, hosted by Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid, was forced to conduct 12 interviews via video link in one week because guests were based in London. Among the ideas â said to be at an early stage â is to create an entirely separate show, which one executive suggested could be called Breakfast Extra. This would be similar to ITVâs Daybreak in which Lorraine Kelly has her own separate show after the news-based section has finished. Another option is to turn the last 45 minutes into a studio debate, or to dump this part of the programme altogether and âstick to more newsâ. Supporters of this point out that at the moment the BBC News channel stops taking footage from BBC Breakfast at 8.30am, when it could run through to 9.15am. It emerged in July that the BBC had to conduct 12 interviews via videolink from its Salford base in one week because guests were based in London . A senior BBC insider said: âThere has been a bit of discussion about what to do after 8.30am. One of the suggestions is a completely different programme for it â a Breakfast Extra. There are options. Should it be a separate programme, or not? And at what cost?â However, many believe the BBC will ultimately decide against returning the 45-minute slot to London, because it will look like âan admission of failureâ, another well-placed source at the broadcaster said. They added: âI would be surprised if they move [part of it back to London]. It does not look good after such a short amount of time of it being up there. âIt is a crucial part of the schedule so itâs important it works. The celebs are not brilliant and it doesnât feel quite right.â A BBC Breakfast spokesman said: âThere are no plans to move any part of BBC Breakfast back to London. On the contrary, the show is working very well from Salford and weâre delighted with the calibre of guests and experts regularly appearing.â","Corporation may move segment of BBC Breakfast back down south .

The original demand came in February and she thought she had cleared up the matter after the tax office admitted a mistake and paid her a Â£904 rebate. Enid, from Long Marton, Cumbria, said: 'My husband Donald said I should just pay it to get them off my back, but I said 'no' -Â  I knew I didn't owe them anything.'

A 'dynamo' boy of nine died from a severe asthma attack after he refused to let the condition spoil his love of playing with friends and family. Joshua Platt had been diagnosed with asthma at the age of one but whenever he got out of breath during football matches or other games he would take his inhaler and then carry on playing. Tragedy struck after Joshua returned home from his visiting his grandmother and he suffered a major attack. He tried to use an inhaler he was prescribed with to relieve the symptoms but his airways were already blocked. Joshua Platt, nine, refused to let his asthma from stopping him enjoying life . He died later in hospital despite the efforts of doctors to save him. It emerged the youngster had become too reliant on his blue inhaler and didn't think he had to use a brown inhaler which prevented asthma attacks taking place. Today his mother Joanna called for more awareness of asthma following an inquest into her son's death. Mother-of-three Joanna said: 'I think Josh had become laid back about his medication and thought that because he had his inhaler to use if he had an attack, he didn't need to worry about the other inhaler that would prevent it in the first place. 'Everyone else was reminding him to take it but he was not aware of how important it was. I think children who have asthma need to be better educated about the importance of all their medication. Teachers and parents should be given more advice. 'Parents need to be made aware that whether you have got the asthma in control or not that this can still happen. 'They need to educate their children as well. A lot of people are so laid back about it and think that you can just rely on your blue inhaler but once those tubes close that's it. 'To other parents with asthmatic children all I can say is don't take the inhalers for granted and keep on your child's back about taking the brown preventer. 'Josh lived life to the full and his illness never stopped him. He was loved by so many people and had a lot of friends.' Joshua was rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital in February after having a severe asthma attack, but died . Britain's five-million-plus asthmatics are normally issued with two types of inhaler. The brown model contains a low dose of steroids and is prescribed to stop attacks from starting and it is thought that it works best if taken regularly to build up resistance in the lungs, with many people using it daily. The second type, which is often blue, is filled with a drug that rapidly opens up the airways during an asthma attack. The Oldham hearing was told Joshua who was prescribed with both inhalers led an active life taking part in camping, swimming, football, basketball, judo and playing with his younger sisters Demi-Rae, four, and two-year-old Macie. If he ever felt out of breath he would use his inhaler and carry on and he would often accidentally leave it at his primary school. On the day Joshua died, he woke up with a very mild cough and a ""bit of a sniffle"" but nothing his mother was concerned about. He helped Joanna tidy up before going to his grandmother's house for the afternoon of February 12. He returned to his home in the Hollinwood area of Oldham at around 7pm and his mum gave him some Calpol children's medicine before he sat on the sofa and started to wheeze slightly. Joanna said he had experienced worse symptoms in the past but he asked for his inhaler and started rocking himself backwards and forwards and asked for his back to be rubbed. Joanna said: 'He was trying to take deep breaths while trying to talk to me at the same time but was struggling to do both. He was panicking and I was trying to guide him and try to get him to inhale slowly but he just couldn't.' Joshua was taking puffs from his inhaler but they didn't make any difference. He became unconscious and his mum dialled 999 and tried to resuscitate him while waiting for the ambulance.He was rushed to Royal Oldham Hospital but was pronounced dead at 8.30pm. Brown inhalers (left) are used for preventing asthma attacks, while blue inhalers are used during an episode . The inquest was told that although sudden severe attacks were common in those who did not manage their condition, the same could also happen to sufferers who think their illness is under control. A post-mortem examination confirmed that Joshua died of an asthma attack and his family were told there was nothing they could have done to prevent the tragedy. Consultant paediatrician Dr Abdul Rehman said a meeting between health professionals and police had been held following Joshua's death. The group agreed that as a result Joshua's GP, based at the Hollinwood Practice in Oldham, would change procedures - offering more education to the families of asthmatics on how to manage the condition and risks involved. Doctors would also stop repeat prescriptions of inhalers and opt to assess children each time to monitor their condition and compliance with the medication. Recording a verdict of death by natural causes coroner Simon Nelson urged teachers, parents and GPs across the borough to ensure sufferers understand the importance of their preventative medication. He added: 'Better education is hugely important. It doesn't surprise me at all to hear that Joshua was very laid back about his illness. Probably while everyone was fussing he was fussing less than anyone. 'Joshua was into everything and yet there was also a very tender side to him. I was particularly impressed with how he tidied up around the house. 'Everything I've heard about him is positive and that is a wonderful trait to have at the age of nine. 'I think at that age you feel that you are invincible - a bit like the superheroes that you look at in comics. It doesn't surprise me to hear that Joshua was very laid back about his condition.'

More than Â£25billion has been wiped off the FTSE 100 today as Spain moved closer to asking for a Â£238billion bailout. The index of the UK's most capitalised companies shed nearly 2 per cent of its value, and as the market drew to a close, it was trading down 107.4 points at 5,752.29. The market sell-off was triggered in the main by uncertainty over Spain's economic future and whether it will accept the terms of a Â£238billion eurozone bailout. Opposition: Peaceful demonstrators marched to the Spanish parliament to protest against austerity measures, but there were clashes with police elsewhere in the city . Markets across Europe reacted following anti-austerity protests . in both Athens and Madrid. The violent demonstrations in Spain and growing talk of secession in Catalonia have piled the pressure on Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy as he moves . closer to asking Europe for rescue money. In public, Mr Rajoy has been resisting calls from bankers at home and the . leaders of France and Italy to move quickly to request assistance, but . behind the scenes he is working hard to meet stringent conditions for aid. Tomorrow Rajoy . will present tough economic reforms and a money-saving 2013 budget aimed at persuading euro zone partners and investors that Spain is doing . its deficit-cutting homework despite a recession and 25 per cent . unemployment. Figures released yesterday suggested Spain will miss its public deficit . target of 6.3 percent of gross domestic product this year, and today the central bank said the economy continued to contract . sharply in the third quarter. Prime minister Mariano Rajoy has been resisting calls from bankers at home and the leaders of France and Italy to move quickly to request assistance .

On the same day, an independent audit of Spain's banks will reveal how . much money Madrid will need from a Â£79billionÂ  aid . package that Europe has already approved for the banks. There are also media reports that the IMF is reluctant to lend more to Athens without a new debt restructuring plan, and that Russia is getting cold feet about offering Cyprus a much-needed loan. Suki Mann, head of credit strategy at Societe Generale, said political rhetoric from all sides - Germans, IMF, Spanish politicians and the Catalans - was being ramped up ahead of the Spanish budget tomorrow and banking sector recapitalisation report on Friday. He said: 'But it's not all over unless the eurozone/currency falls apart. It's pulling hard against the seams right now. 'The bumbling political response at the eurozone level is something we have become accustomed to, but domestic political risk and escalating internal strife is another ball game.' Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets, said: 'Reality has bitten back hard today as markets have once again woken up to the political and economic realities of the policies being pursued in Europe. 'Austerity protests in Spain last . night have been followed by further protests and a general strike in . Greece as populations tire of bearing the burden of spending cuts and . tax rises against a backdrop of record unemployment and stagnant . economies. 'Images of tear . gas and rioting protesters on TV screens don't generally engender . confidence in investors that EU leaders have control of the situation in . Europe.' Prime Minister Rajoy today suggested in an interview that he would make . the move to ask for the bailout if debt financing costs remained too high for too long. 'I can assure you 100 percent that I would ask for this bailout,' he . told the Wall Street Journal, calling the situation he faces right now . 'fascinating'. He also said he had not made his mind up on whether to maintain . inflation indexation of pensions, which could cost the state an extra 6 . billion euros this year. 'We need to be sufficiently flexible in order not to create any further problems,' he said when asked about pensions. The interview, the central bank's warning on the third quarter and other . factors drove up Spain's borrowing costs, with the yield on the . benchmark ten-year bond jumping to 6 percent a level seen . as unsustainable in the medium term. Markets also reacted to a letter from Germany, Finland and the . Netherlands on Tuesday that implied that rescue funds Spain receives for . its banks will remain on its public debt.

A renowned comic artist who drew Judge Dredd tried to slash a police officerâs throat after he was called to a disturbance at his house, a court heard. Police went to investigate after hearing shouting and ranting coming from the west London home of Brett Ewins, 56, best known for his work on the Judge Dredd and Rogue Trooper strips in the acclaimed comic 2000 AD. They were confronted by Ewins wielding a four-inch kitchen knife when they went inside, Isleworth Crown Court was told. To defend themselves PC Andrew McKelvie and his partner Matthew Harries sprayed Ewins with pepper spray and hit him twice on the arm but he kept coming at them, a jury heard. Fearing for their lives one of the officerâs struck Ewins around the head with his baton but still Ewins came at them, the court was told. Ewins suffered a heart attack after finally being restrained, the court heard. David Allan, prosecuting, said: 'At that point Mr Ewins attempted to stab one of the officers in the throat, but in fact he stabbed him in the arm. 'It was with such force the knife was buried right up to the handle inside the officerâs arm.' Mr Allen added: 'This all happened on January 14 this year at around 8.30am on a Saturday morning. 'Two police officers were called to an . address in Hanwell, west London. While they were there they heard Mr . Ewins shouting and ranting next door. 'They went into his house to try to . prevent a beach of the peace. When the officerâs went inside the . defendant grabbed a kitchen knife, like the type used to cut vegetables, . and began to get very aggressive. 'The . officers sprayed him with CS spray but it had no effect. One of the . officers then struck him on the arm twice with his asp but still it did . not stop him. The artist, who is diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and takes medication, used to draw the Judge Dredd and Rogue Trooper cartoons . 'When the officer thought he was in imminent danger of being stabbed he struck him on the head. 'Mr Ewins stabbed towards his neck, but the officer put his arm up to try and protect himself and the knife plunged into his arm.' The court heard the injured officer was able to escape and PC Harries restrained Ewins on the floor until back up arrived. Mr Allan continued: 'As a result of that Mr Ewins suffered a cardiac arrest outside the property. The jury has heard how the artist 'attacked' the police officers who were investigating shouts . 'He was given CPR by the police officers and paramedics and taken to hospital where he remained for three weeks until he made a recovery.' When Ewins, who now walks with a walking stick, was interviewed about the incident he said he could not remember any of it. The artist, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and is on medication, is charged with grievous bodily harm with intent. He admits stabbing the officer, but claims he was acting involuntarily after being struck on the head. An expert witness for the defence will say the blow sent him into a state of unconsciousness similar to sleepwalking so he did not know what he was doing. Mr Allan told the jury: 'The defence are not going to be suggesting that he was insane rather he did not know what he was doing. 'We say you can infer from the way he was behaving and common sense that when he stabbed this officer in the arm he intended to cause him really serious bodily harm.' The trial continues.

"By . Peter Allen . PUBLISHED: . 05:25 EST, 11 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:19 EST, 12 September 2012 . In chilling detail, a French hiker who stumbled on the aftermath of the Alps massacre yesterday revealed how he was convinced one of the two girls who survived the shootings was dead. The 41-year-old man said he found Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, lying on the ground close to where her parents and grandmother had been executed in the family's BMW estate. Zainab, who was shot in the shoulder and suffered a fractured skull after being pistol-whipped, was showing no signs of life. Horrifying: Philippe, an experienced walker who lives locally, then ran up to the car park, where the bodies of the Al-Hilli family were all lying dead inside their BMW car . 'I then leaned over the little girl,' said the local man, who identified himself as 'Philippe D'. 'She did not reply to our calls. I clapped my hands, but she was not reacting. I even said a few words in English, as I saw the car had British licence plates, but nothing happened. As far as I was concerned she was dead.' As a French judge and prosecutor travel to Britain as part of their inquiries, Philippe is the first witness to speak publicly about the brutal murders of British engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Ikbal, 47, her mother SuhailaÂ  Al-Allaf, 74, and Sylvain Mollier, aÂ  45-year-old French cyclist. Each of the murder victims were shot twice in the head last Wednesday at a secluded spot on the outskirts of the village of Chevaline, close to Lake Annecy in eastern France. Grim discovery: Saad al-Hilli, 50, the father murdered near the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy, in the Haute-Savoie region of France . Philippe and two women friends were driving towards the scene about 4.10pm, when a 'terrified cyclist' came hurtling towards them. The cyclist was the unidentified retired British RAF veteran who had stumbled on the murder scene, but who had been unable to call for help. 'This man was in a panic and coming down the road,' said Philippe. 'He explained to me in bad French that there was a drama a little higher up. 'He was trying to call an ambulance. I did not know if he didn't have a mobile phone, or if his phone network was not connecting at this point.' Philippe ran up to the car park, where the bodies of the Al-Hilli family were inside their car. 'I understood what was happening straight away,' he told Le Parisien newspaper. 'I approached the car. I did not touch anything, but I could see there was nothing more to be done. There was no sign of life. 'There wasn't a sound - it was like in a movie, one of those TV series where everything begins with a murder. Except this time the actors were us, and we didn't have the remote control to change the channel. 'We did not know whether we were alone or not or whether we were in danger or not - whether the people who had done this were still there or not. We thought we were taking risks. The arrival of the emergency services reassured us.' Unbeknown to him, the Al-Hillis' four-year-old daughter Zeena was hiding under her mother's corpse in the BMW. It would be eight hours before she was discovered. Lying motionless nearby was Zainab, who is making a steady recovery from her injuries and is set to become the prime witness in the case. A few seconds after wrongly concluding she was dead, Philippe went back down the hill to call the emergency services. His was the first registered call to police. 'If we had been there a few minutes earlier it could have been us who were dead, rather than the French cyclist,' said Philippe. As he went up the forest road before discovering the carnage, Philippe said he had 'heard nothing and come across not a single person, no car, no bike'. This supports the theory that the gunman, or gunmen, may have been in place waiting to ambush their victims, or else had arrived by an isolated mountain path.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:06 EST, 11 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:36 EST, 11 September 2012 . A fugitive convicted of gang-raping an 11-year-old Texas girl has been caught after a massive manhunt. Police tracked down Eric McGowen, 20, to an apartment complex in Houston and handcuffed him while he was sitting on the toilet at around 9am on Tuesday. McGowen disappeared during his trial late last month but the shocking case continued without him. On trial: Eric McGowen, 20, pictured, is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland . McGowen was sentenced to 99 years in prison on August 30 after a jury found him guilty of aggravated sexual assault of a child in the first trial stemming from the horrific gang-rape of the 11-year-old Cleveland girl. Capt. Steve Greene of the Liberty County Sheriff's Office said McGowen was taken into custody without resisting after being apprehended by police. Greene thanked the Texas Rangers, U.S. Marshals Office, Gulf Coast Violent Offender Task Force, the Liberty County Sheriff's Office, Houston Police Department and Harris County Sheriff's Office for their roles in the arrest. According to ABC News, authorities had information that McGowen was hiding out with relatives. Officers pulled over a family member during a traffic stop, at which point that person confessed that McGowen had been staying with them. The relatives involved may face charges for harbouring a fugitive. Three other men accused in the girl's gang rape accepted plea deals last week rather than go to trial. McGowen . escaped during a break in proceedings on August 29 - the first day of his trial at the courthouse in Liberty - and had been missing since. Judge Mark Morefield chose to push . ahead with the trial without the defendant, calling the remaining . witnesses. Jurors deliberated for just 20 minutes before  finding the missing man guilty and after another 30 minutes they had decided his sentence. McGowen . was convicted for his part in . the shocking attacks, which saw the girl, now 13, gang-raped by 20 men . and boys on multiple occasions in an abandoned trailer. Missing: McGowen apparently escaped from the Liberty County Courthouse during a break in the trial . His lawyer didnât present any evidence or call witnesses at the trial. McGowen was one of 14 adults accused . of having sex with the girl. Six boys also are charged in the case. Greene said courthouse security wasn't required to follow McGowen when he fled the courtroom because he was out on bail. Greene . said the sheriff's office was notified by the court bailiff when the . defendant didn't return after the afternoon coffee break. At the time, he warned that . McGowen should be considered armed and dangerous. Judge Morefield issued a warrant for McGowen's arrest and hiked the man's bail from $35,000 to $250,000. Prosecutors and defense attorneys . huddled briefly with the judge in front of his bench . when the defendant, who was wearing a white shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, vanished after sitting through the bulk of the day's proceedings, including his victim's testimony. McGowen's attorney Matthew Poston said he thought his client was in the bathroom when he didn't return to his seat. Before McGowen vanished, the victim broke down in court as she watched a video of one of the painful attacks. Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 . The . girl, who authorities haven't named, testified against McGowen, describing the series of horrendous attacks that took . place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston. In court, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks. She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case. Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, police said . She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.' 'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked. 'Yes sir,' the girl said. The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified. She . mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the . floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding. She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants . called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that . continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer. Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.' Jurors . were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers . found inside and outside the house in the November incident. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl . Gang-rape: Xavier King, left, and Marcus Anthony Porchia, right, are among the 20 men and boys in the case . Three people who have pleaded guilty â two adults and a juvenile who has since turned 18 â also testified yesterday. Isaiah Ross, 22, told jurors he saw McGowen sexually assault the girl with a beer bottle. The other adult, Marcus Porchia, 28, and the teen testified they saw others assault the girl but not McGowen. Poston . questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked . whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never . had sex with McGowen. The girl said she didnât remember saying that. During . opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present . them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted . to raping the girl. 'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said. Alleged attacker: Jared Glenn McPherson, pictured, is one of the men accused of raping the 11-year-old . The prosecutor added that while the . girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, . these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things . against her best interests,' according to the Houston Chronicle. Authorities say the then 11-year-old was . assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December . 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student . to a 28-year-old. During the trial, . a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight . other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, . was shown in court, although jurors were not present. In the video, which McGowen's lawyers . argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially . denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told . investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston . Chronicle. Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen. The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer. Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records. The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions. It has been complicated by a belief among many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic. Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing. Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time. Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.","Eric McGowen, 20, caught by police yesterday while sitting on toilet in Houston apartment .

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:54 EST, 16 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:22 EST, 16 September 2012 . This picture shows the horrifying moment an Amish man grabbed the long, white beard of a 79-year-old Amish bishop in eastern Ohio and used his other hand to violently slice it off. The attacker in the image has been identified as defendant Johnny Mullet, the son of the alleged ringleader of a series of vicious beard-cutting ambushes on members of the community last year. As he chopped off the beard of Raymond Hershberger, pictured trying to push away his attacker, the bishop's wife screamed and a boy cried: 'Don't cut grandpa's beard,' according to his attorney. The image, which has now been released by the U.S. attorneys office, paints a horrifying picture of the fear inflicted by 16 aggressors by a breakaway Amish group. Attack: A shocking photo shows the moment Johnny Mullet allegedly cut off the beard of a fellow Amish man, Raymond Hershberger, in a hate attack 'rooted in religious differences' The sixteen defendants are accused of hate crimes in hair-cutting attacks on nine fellow Amish due to religious differences. Andy Hershberger testified that his father pleaded for the men not to shear him. But within minutes, the hair from his father's beard had been cut and scattered across the floor. He said clumps of hair were missing from his father's head and his scalp was bleeding. Hersherger described a chaotic scene, with the men holding him, his father, Raymond, and his brother down while his father was sheared. 'Attacker': The photo allegedly shows Johnny Mullet, pictured, holding down a bishop to cut off his hair . 'I saw the hair fly,' Andy Hershberger testified last month. Afterward, he said, his father 'was shaking all over.' 'The women and my dad were crying,' he said. Prosecutors say his father, Raymond Hershberger, was targeted because he was among several bishops who had religious disagreements with Mullet. For the Amish, hair holds religious significance as Amish women do not cut their hair and the men do not cut their beards after marriage. The testimony in the trial has now wrapped up and the men now await its result and possible sentencing. Mullet and his alleged co-conspirators are facing sentences of up to life in prison. The Amish world is known as stern and self-regulating and those who act out time and again by wearing the wrong clothing, going to movies or otherwise flouting the church's doctrine can find themselves utterly alone. Fellow Amish in rare instances won't break bread with them at the same table, won't work with them and won't worship with them under the religion's centuries-old practice of shunning. In stricter settlements, shunning can break apart families, cutting off all contact between parents and their children. The Amish take the tradition so seriously that most churches won't accept someone who has been shunned until they make it right with those who've disciplined them. At the root of Amish hair-cutting attacks in Ohio and the federal hate crime trial that followed, prosecutors say, was a dispute over religious differences and a decision by Amish bishops to overrule the leader of a breakaway group who had shunned his former followers. An Amish couple walks through a parking lot after leaving the U.S. courthouse in Cleveland on September 5; sixteen members of a breakaway sect, led by Sam Mullet, are on trial, accused of planning the attacks targeted the hair and beards of Amish bishops . Two Amish men talk to a security guard outside the United states Court House in Cleveland September 12, 2012. A jury heard closing arguments in a federal hate crimes trial . Amish scholars say taking away a bishop's edict was unheard of and stunned communities far and wide. Six years ago, about 300 Amish . bishops gathered in Pennsylvania to discuss the group's leader, Sam . Mullet Sr., who had ordered the shunning of families that left his . settlement near the West Virginia panhandle. Strict rules: Sam Mullet Sr, pictured in 2011, stands in the front yard of his home in Bergholz, Ohio. In the stern, self-regulating world of the Amish, those who act out time and again can find themselves utterly alone . Mullet had come to the attention of the . bishops because, according to witnesses at his trial, there were . concerns he was brain-washing community members. Prosecutors would later . say he forced men to sleep in chicken coops as punishment, and one . woman testified that Mullet coerced women at his settlement into having . sex with him so he could turn them into better wives. The bishops eventually vetoed Mullet's shunning of the others, infuriating him to the point that he sought revenge last fall in a series of five hair-cutting attacks, prosecutors say. They charged Mullet and 15 of his followers with hate crimes because they contend they acted over religious differences and targeted the hair and beards of the Amish because of its spiritual significance in the faith. All could face lengthy prison terms if convicted on the charges that also include conspiracy and obstructing justice. Jurors began deliberating in the trial Thursday morning. None of the defendants has denied that the hair-cuttings took place, but Mullet has insisted that he didn't plan what happened. In an interview last fall, he defended what he thinks is his right to punish people who break church laws. Shunning - also known as avoidance -is a rare happening in the Amish community. While outsiders might view it as punishment, the Amish consider it an act of love to help those who have strayed from their beliefs. Each individual church decides when to shun others and what kind of punishment they face. 'It's not like there's a rulebook,' said Steve Nolt, a history professor at Goshen College in Indiana. Only baptized church members can be shunned. And it almost always starts with a warning to stop breaking church rules - whether it's to quit drinking or stop talking on the telephone - and weeks or months of discussion. An Amish man waits for others to emerge from a taxi before entering the U.S. courthouse . 'Shunning is something the individual does to themselves,' said Karen Johnson-Weiner, a professor at the State University of New York in Potsdam who has written extensively about the Amish. 'It's community-wide tough love.' There also has to be agreement within the congregation, but the bishop has the most influence in revoking someone's church membership. 'That's a hard thing for a bishop to do,' said Andy Hershberger, who testified in the trial that Mullet's son was among a group that cut his father's hair last fall. His father was one of the bishops who overruled Mullet's shunning order. Furlong, who left her home church for good after a dispute with a bishop, said shunning gives Amish leaders too much control. 'They can use it like a hammer,' she said. Process: Only baptized church members can be shunned; it almost always starts with a warning to stop breaking church rules - and weeks or months of discussion . Because the Amish identify so closely with their faith, being shunned and faced with the loss of their salvation is extremely painful. 'It's such an intense thing. Nobody can really explain it,' said Furlong, who wrote a book called 'Why I Left the Amish' in 2011. 'That's a pretty tough thing to reckon with.' Matthew Schrock, who left Holmes County's Amish community in Ohio during the mid-1990s, wasn't formally shunned, but no one would hire him because he was fighting with his father, who was the bishop. 'There were a lot of people who wouldn't talk to me,' he said. 'No one was willing to risk the appearance of them siding with me.' Shunning has its roots in biblical teachings and is used in some Mennonite churches as well. Jehovah's Witnesses also practice a form of shunning. But it's essential to Amish beliefs. 'They want the person to see their error,' Schrock said. 'But under that, I think, is this desire to maintain the integrity of the group.'","Sixteen Amish men accused of cutting off bears in eastern Ohio last year .

These were the horrific injuries suffered by a pensioner after he was beaten in a 'cowardly and unprovoked attack' by a serving soldier who had just returned from Afghanistan. Gordon Glynn, 84, was left bleeding, bruised and needing 14 stitches after Joseph Dickinson knocked him off his chair and punched him. Defending his actions, the 21-year-old said he only carried out the attack to stop him from 'smacking' his own father, with whom he was furious. Attack: Gordon Glynn, left, suffered horrific injuries after he was punched by Joseph Dickinson, right . Dickinson had only returned from Afghanistan two days earlier and it was later found the soldier had been suffering from partial post-traumatic stress disorder. However, this did not stop a judge from jailing him for a year at Warrington Crown Court. Mr Glynn had been enjoying a quiet pint with friends at the Pack Horse Inn, Culcheth, Cheshire, a few days before Christmas last year when he was punched twice and knocked off his seat by Dickinson. The member of the Army Air Corps fled the pub and was only tracked down by police after sending texts to a friend telling her ânot to grass him upâ. Oliver King, prosecuting, said: 'The texts said he had smacked someone and he didnât know his name but it was either that or he smacked his dad. 'Mr Glynn was the closest person to him which was why he lashed out at him.' Judge Roger Dutton said during the sentencing at Warrington Crown Court (pictured) that the soldier had 'difficulties controlling his temper' Mr Glynn spent two days in hospital and was in so much pain he was unable to eat his Christmas dinner or wear his glasses to watch TV and read. Dickinson, who was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in October 2010, had the role of protecting the Queen in 2009 when he was involved with the Changing of the Guard outside Buckingham Palace. Michael Davies, defending, said psychological reports found Dickinson had partial post-traumatic stress disorder. 'The defendant is genuinely shocked and appalled at what he did that night' Michael Davies, defending Joseph Dickinson . He added: 'The defendant is genuinely shocked and appalled at what he did that night. He was horrified when he saw the pictures and was choking back the tears. 'His dad said there was a mist in his eyes and he had been a changed person since he had come back from Afghanistan.' Judge Roger Dutton said he had given him credit because he was a soldier but it was clear he had âdifficulties controlling his temperâ. He added: 'The career you have chosen exposed you to risks and danger but the severity of the attack and random nature means I canât suspend the sentence.' Dickinson sobbed as he was jailed for 12 months. Detective Constable Matt Gagen of Cheshire Police said: 'This was an unprovoked and cowardly attack against an 84-year-old man who was out enjoying a Christmas drink. 'The people of Warrington cannot fail to be appalled by the offenderâs actions, targeting a man four times his age, when he is supposed to be a disciplined member of the Armed Forces.

He . said he had been living in a forest with his father called Ryan for . five years but had buried him after his sudden death two weeks . previously. Berlin social . services paid for bed and board, clothing and German lessons for the . English-speaking Dutchman. They also gave him a staggering Â£200 a month . in pocket money. But in . reality he was a disaffected Dutch boy with a complicated home life and . an illegitimate child who simply wanted to disappear off the radar and . start a new life. Van Eslum had vanished from his hometown of Hengelo only days before his arrival in Berlin. After . ten months of living on taxpayer's money he was exposed after police . released a photo of him in June and his step-mother came forward. He . then disappeared again for three months and last week, neither his . stepmother, his ex-girlfriend from the town of Hengelo, German or Dutch . police said they knew where he was. His . stepmother Ellen told a Dutch newspaper last week: 'A day after his . unmasking he phoned me and asked if he could come home because he needed . to rest. 'Of course I said yes, you're welcome. 'He responded with the words: ""I'll call you tomorrow or the day after."" 'But I have heard nothing more. 'I was assuming that he would show up one day on the pavement outside, but nothing.' His stepmother added: 'I think he is . still in Germany but I don't know for sure. 'There were rumours he was . sighted in Hengelo, but Robin is smart enough to know that he would have . problems if that was the case.' Friends said Van Helsum left home because of 'personal problems' and to 'start a new life'. Berlin's youth authorities did believe he might have taken up with a community of . itinerant fruit pickers moving from village to village throughout the . summer. Expensive: 'Ray' was looked after for ten months after he walked into the city claiming to have lost his memory . Possessions: Van Helsum said his mother had died when he was 12 and cut contact with family and friends . Schoolmates in Hengelo, however, spotted him on the news when the pictures were published around the world. His step-mother identified him and asked him to come back home . But last night he was on the website of Europe's biggest paper serving up . burgers for one of the world's biggest fast food chains. A spokesman for Berlin's youth authorities said: 'It pleases us that he is working and will soon be able to pay us back.' Berlin prosecution authorities were not available to say if he has contacted them to start paying back the money for his care.

September 2012: Leaves McLaren signs new deal with Mercedes . Hamilton had spent weeks denying that . he was leaving after news broke last month that he was considering a . move away, after rumours of rifts with the team and regular mechanical . problems. It should earn him Â£45 million until 2016 plus a possible extra Â£15 million in bonuses. It will also allow him more freedom to make more money from sponsorship. McLaren, team principal Martin Whitmarsh paid tribute to the departing Hamilton. He said: 'Itâs entirely appropriate that I should take this opportunity . to pass on our thanks to Lewis. He wrote a huge chapter of his life and . career with us, and was, and always will be, a fine member of an . exclusive club: the McLaren world championsâ club.' McLaren have announced that Sauber driver Sergio Perez, 22, will replace Hamilton at the British outfit next season. The Mexican, a member of the Ferrari driver academy, said: 'Iâm thrilled and delighted to have become a Vodafone McLaren Mercedes driver. 'The McLaren name is one of the greatest in the history of Formula 1. For more than 40 years McLaren has been a team that every racing driver has aspired to drive for â I was brought up on the great stories of Ayrton Sennaâs many world championship triumphs for McLaren â and Iâm truly honoured that theyâve chosen me to partner Jenson from 2013 onwards,' he said. Hamiltonâs critics will say he is leaving for money but it is understood the offers on the table were similar. His basic Mercedes salary of around Â£15m â the same figure he is on at McLaren â will maintain his status as one of the gridâs top earners alongside Ferrariâs Fernando Alonso and possibly Red Bullâs Sebastian Vettel. That said, Mercedes willÂ  offer greater freedom than McLaren in letting Hamiltonâs management company, Simon Fullerâs XIX Entertainment, to strike personal endorsements for their man. More important than money â and Hamilton is known to be cautious with his finances â is his desire to improve on a return of one title in five completed seasons, a disappointing statistic for a driver who envisaged himself as a serial champion on his much-heralded arrival in Formula One.

The Briton led from pole position and kept his cool during four safety car periods to win his first race in F1. 2008 MONACO GRAND PRIXHamilton was desperate to follow in the steps of his hero Ayrton Senna by standing on the top step of the podium at Formula One's most glamorous event. In wet conditions a sixth-lap brush with the barrier saw Hamilton suffer a puncture, but he recovered masterfully to claim victory. 2008 BRITISH GRAND PRIXAnother wet-weather masterclass from Hamilton. Having stormed through from fourth on the grid to pass team-mate Heikki Kovalainen during the early stages. The Briton simply destroyed the field to win by 68 seconds - the biggest winning margin in a grand prix since 1995. 2008 BRAZILIAN GRAND PRIXHamilton knew fifth place would guarantee him the title even if rival Felipe Massa won the race. But as the Ferrari driver romped to victory, Hamilton dropped to sixth shortly after pitting during a late-race shower. All hope appeared to be lost until the McLaren passed the Toyota of Timo Glock, struggling on dry-weather tyres, at the very last corner. The will-he-wonât-he saga has captivated the sport for months but in the end the attraction of a fresh start, away from a team where he has always been treated with parental care, appears to have been too hard for the 27-year-old to resist. The other governing factor was his desire for a championship-winning car. Whitmarsh always claimed that staying put represented the best chance of success, but the evidence for that assertion is patchy: though they are regular race winners, McLaren have won just a single driversâ title since 1999. The question is whether Mercedes, who have support at board level in Germany but are run from Brackley, Northamptonshire, are better equipped to deliver.Â  They have only been back in the sport as manufacturers since 2010, though in their previous guise asÂ  Brawn won the title through Jenson Button. Ross Brawn, the engineering svengali behind all seven of Schumacherâs titles, remainsÂ  team principal and his presence is sure to have been a major lure for Hamilton with significant changes to the engine regulations due for the 2014 season. Brawn exploited a previous revamping of the technical blueprint in 2009, allowing Hamiltonâs McLaren team-mate Button to waltz to his championship success. With Mercedes as engine makers, Brawn is well placed to conjure another trick. Conversely, McLaren, who get their engines free from Mercedes as part of a long-term association, will have to pay for their supply from next year. That will put a strain on their budget. Old guard: Lewis will be replacing Michael Schumacher - who is expected to announce his retirement from the sport today . Disappointing: After his 2008 title win he has failed to secure another - a major reason why he is said to have moved on . New guy: Lewis Hamilton, left, celebrates on the podium with Sauber driver Sergio Perez, of Mexico, who is set to join McLaren . Mercedes have won one race this season to McLarenâs five but it is probable that Hamilton would extract more from even this existing car than the 43-year-old Schumacher and his team-mate Nico Rosberg. Hamilton is close to Norbert Haug, Mercedesâ head of motor sport, who often acted as an avuncular supporter of the young Briton back when the German manufacturers were in full partnership with McLaren. As for Schumacher, he has been a shadow of his formerly dominant self since coming out of his first retirement in 2010.

Louise Hastings, 45, was set to undergo surgery on the NHS at Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham this March in a bid to shed the pounds. The procedure, which shrinks the stomach and restricts the appetite is designed to help people with life-threatening obesity lose weight. It costs between Â£10,000 and Â£15,000. Louise Hastings, pictured with husband Mark, believes she could die if she isn't given a gastric bypass operation . But the grandmother-of-four said the operation is no longer going ahead as the medic has resigned . and there is no other surgeon available to perform the procedure. This is the second time her surgery has been cancelled, as the first time it was believed she wouldn't benefit and there were patients with greater need. Now Mrs Hastings, . from Birmingham, believes that she has been given a 'death sentence' and doctors are 'playing with my life'. She said: 'This was my last chance to have it . done. My asthma is getting worse and they won't do the operation if . things deteriorate anymore. 'I've been treated really badly. It's like they are playing with my life.'

Warren Sapp's entire collection of rare Air Jordans is up for auction as creditors claw back cash from the former NFL star who filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, according to TMZ. The epic collection of the classic shoe, designed and produced for Nike by now-retired basketball legend Michael Jordan, comprises 240 pairs, and is worth around $6,500. Some pairs are worn, some have never been touched. Sapp filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in April claiming he'd racked up millions of dollars in debts since he retired from the NFL.

Leaving a simple phone message could help spot the early signs of Parkinsonâs years before serious symptoms develop, say scientists. Researchers have discovered they can detect the disease through voice recordings with initial studies already showing a 99 per cent accuracy rate. A team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology has developed a computer programme that is able to recognise the tremors, breathiness and weakness in the voice, which are thought to be early indicators of the condition. The technology works partly by tracking the motion of the vocal cords and detecting any tremor . The voice analysis software can even provide an unprecedented level of detail that can distinguish how far along a patient is with the disease. The Parkinsonâs Voice Initiative led by British scientist Dr Max Little, is looking to see if the same results can be repeated with voice recordings taken over the telephone. Dr Littleâs wider study calls on healthy volunteers as well as patients with Parkinsonâs to take part in a three minute phone call where they are asked to say 'aah', speak a few sentences and answer some questions. Dr Little is creating a database of voices to help diagnose Parkinson's . If the research proves successful, it . could have the potential to offer hope to thousands of people and become . a quick and cheap diagnostic tool of the future that can be done from . the comfort of the home. Dr Little said: 'Science tells us voice impairment might be an early sign of Parkinsonâs. It sounds counterintuitive as Parkinsonâs is a movement disorder but the voice is a form of movement. 'We donât tend to think of the larynx and vocal chords but you are moving them when you make speech sounds. Itâs a complex sound of movement and it tends to degrade in Parkinsonâs. 'Neurologists look at changes in the ability to move, which is done with the limbs, but we are looking in the vocal organs - the sounds that come out of the mouth. 'We are fairly confident we can detect the disease over the telephone.' The breakthrough technology could alert doctors to prescribe early treatment, which could slow the progress of the disease. The current approach to a Parkinsonâs diagnosis can take years, as there is no blood test that detects it. Dr Kieran Breen, director of research at Parkinsonâs UK described the study as an 'exciting prospect'. Mr Little says combining voice recordings with computer technology can show exactly where someone lies between health and disease . He said: 'The Parkinsonâs Voice Initiative could lead to voice recognition tests that can diagnose and monitor Parkinsonâs. 'We . know that speech is often affected in people with Parkinsonâs - so . developing a test that can spot the earliest subtle changes is an . exciting prospect. 'At the moment we donât have a . definitive test to diagnose Parkinsonâs, and no reliable way to monitor . the development of the condition - which is a massive barrier to finding . a cure. Bob Hoskins has retired from acting after being diagnosed with Parkinson's . 'Finding simple and accurate ways to diagnose and monitor Parkinsonâs is one of our key research priorities.' There are 127,000 sufferers in the UK living with the incurable disease with the number set to soar due to the ageing population. Parkinsonâs disease often starts with hand tremors followed by symptoms including muscle rigidity or stiffness and slow movement. Sufferers donât have enough of a chemical called dopamine because some cells in their brain have died. Without dopamine people can find that their movements become slower so it takes longer to do things. Most people who get Parkinsonâs are over 50. American actor Michael J Fox, 51, was diagnosed in 1991 and boxing legend Muhammad Ali, 70, who appeared in the London Olympics opening ceremony, also has the condition. Veteran actor Bob Hoskins, 69, announced earlier this year he would be retiring from acting after being diagnosed with the disease.

A new backlog of more than 150,000 immigration cases has been uncovered by inspectors in the latest border shambles. The total â which is about the same as the population of Oxford â is increasing by nearly 100 every day. It is made up of migrants whose visas allowing them to stay in Britain have expired and who have been refused permission to stay on. A report has revealed the UK Border Agency has a backlog of more than 150,000 immigration cases . But border officials have no idea if they have actually left the country or are still living here illegally. And inspectors found the beleaguered UK Border Agency has no plan for finding out how many remain, or taking action to remove those who are still here. In 40 per cent of cases examined by inspectors, the migrants had not even been sent a letter telling them they must quit Britain. The 'significant' new backlog emerged in a report by John Vine, the chief inspector of the UK Border Agency. The report, published today, revealed that in mid-December, the total number of cases in the Migration Refusal Pool across the UK stood at 159,313.Â  In the preceding two months, it had increased by 5,492 â or nearly 100 cases a day. Cases put in the pool were foreign students or workers here legally who applied for their visas to be extended but were refused, and told they must leave within 28 days. Immigration Minister Damian Green, pictured at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport, said: 'We are also working closely with other government departments to create a hostile environment which makes it much harder for migrants to live in the UK illegally.' Mr Vine said urgent action was needed to tackle it because, currently, tracking down and removing such illegal migrants was not seen as a priority.' 'The agency does not know how many of these individuals have left the country or who are waiting to be removed,' he said. 'I also saw no evidence that there is a clear plan in place for the agency to deal with this stream of work to ensure this does not become another backlog.' Home Office officials last night refused to say what the total is now, saying they would not provide a 'running commentary'. Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the think-tank MigrationWatch, said: 'It is vital to the credibility of the whole immigration system that people who have no right to be in Britain should be removed. 'There clearly needs to be a much greater . focus on this. It is absurd, for example, that people who overstay . should not even be contacted to be told to go.' 'I am astonished that the UKBA has no . idea where 159,000 individuals â the size of a city like Oxford â have . gone since their application was rejected.' Labour MP Keith Vaz . The report looked specifically at immigration officials in Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, where immigration officials massively underestimated the number of such cases in their area. They put the total at between 400 to 600 but the real total was 1,893, more than three times higher. A detailed examination of a sample of cases revealed barely half were recorded as having left the country, and only one had been forcibly removed. Others had launched new appeals or could not be removed because of human rights or legal barriers. In 40 per cent of cases migrants were not even sent the legal letters telling them they must leave the country. The report said: 'The issue is a national problem. We believe the agency needs to be much more pro-active in providing a clear strategic direction for its staff to follow. This should stop the already significant backlog from increasing and ensure steps are taken to reduce it.' Immigration Minister Damian Green said: 'Under the last government there was no effective strategy in place to ensure migrants left at the end of their time in the UK. 'The UK Border Agency is now working through a group of potential over-stayers to identify those who have not left. We are also working closely with other government departments to create a hostile environment which makes it much harder for migrants to live in the UK illegally.' Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: 'I am astonished that the UKBA has no idea where 159,000 individuals â the size of a city like Oxford â have gone since their application was rejected. This is yet another group of cases we did not know about.'","Total is about the same as the population of Oxford .

JetBlue captain Clayton Frederick Osbon is pictured as he is escorted to a waiting vehicle by FBI agents after being released from The Pavilion at Northwest Texas Hospital in Amarillo in April . All parties, including the prosecutors, agreed to the report, seen by U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson in Amarillo, Texas. Last month, Judge Robinson declared . Osbon fit to stand trial, saying he was 'not now suffering from a mental . disease or defect' that would make it impossible for him to assist in . his own defense. Osbon had been examined by a . government-appointed psychologist who did not address whether he was . sane at the time of the March 27 incident. Judge Robinson ordered that Osbon be . taken to a prison in Fort Worth, Texas, for a mental examination, then . returned to court for an August 6 hearing, where his fate will be up to . the judge. Clayton Osbon, pictured right after being removed from the flight in restraints, and left, in his hometown, lost his father Ronald in a plane crash in April, 1995 . The veteran pilot, pictured, who has been a JetBlue captain for 12 years, started flying as a teenager with his father Ronald . Under federal law, people found not . guilty by reason of insanity can be incarcerated until they can . establish that they are entitled to be released. Several passengers on board the . flight have filed suit against JetBlue for gross negligence, saying the . airline should have known that he was unfit for duty as a pilot. Passengers aboard flight 191 watched . in horror asÂ  the 49-year-old ran through the aisle screaming 'say . your prayers' and banged on the cockpit door after being locked out by . his co-pilot Jason Dowd. He had tried to interfere with the plane's . controls and began rambling, saying, 'We're not going to Vegas,' and . warning the first officer that 'We're going to have to take a leap of . faith.' They said Osbon had to be wrestled to . the floor of the plane that was heading from New York to Las Vegas . after he began sprinting down the aisle, yelling that 'Things don't . matter,' and talking about Afghanistan, Iraq and al-Qaeda. He was restrained with seat belt extenders and zip tie handcuffs while the . first officer diverted the flight to land in Amarillo.

Tens of thousands of fish that washed up on Lake Erie's shore last week horrifying local residents and tourists died of natural causes, early test results have revealed. With their rotting bodies seen thickly lining 25 miles of the water's edge as well as bobbing at the shared Canadian and U.S. lake's surface, residents had vowed to stay far from the water then feared to be polluted. 'Samples back from the lab do not show any evidence of a manure spills or anything unusual in terms of contamination,' Ontario Ministry of the Environment spokesperson Kate Jordan told the Star on Friday. Mystery revealed: Tens of thousands of dead fish were found lining 25 miles of shoreline along Lake Erie this week with their death revealed to be natural according to early test results . 'The information that we have suggests the fish may have been killed as the result of natural causes,' she said, explaining it as heavy sediment depleting the water's oxygen. 'It was rank, so profoundly rank, that it was difficult to stay down there and the next morning we woke up to the smell,' Neville Knowles told the Chatham Daily News of her experience prior to the fish's death on Monday. It's what led her and many others to believe the water was contaminated. 'There was a really strong odour, not a fishy smell, almost a manure smell, and we waded to our chest and I said to the kids we're got to get out of here, there is something wrong with the water,' Frank Van den Boorn told the Daily News of his visit to the lake over the weekend. According to Ms Jordan, however, the smell described by Ms Knowles and Mr Van den Boorn matches that of a natural phenomenon called 'lake inversion.' Other cases: Dead tilapia fish are seen rotting on the northwest shore of California's Salton Sea in March after construction on a new residential community started . She explained it as when a change in wind kicks up sediment reducing the levels of oxygen in the water, potentially killing the fish as witnesses saw, in the thousands. According to Ms Jordan the wind did change last week and lake inversion has happened at Lake Eerie in the past. Officials are still awaiting more . intensive lab analysis results on the dead fish found at Lake Erie, . which included carp, sheepshead, perch, catfish and suckers. Adding to the mystery, however, was the mutual sight of dead seagulls who had been seen feasting on the fish before their death. Fishy occurrence: Millions of dead fish in the harbor area of Redondo Beach, south of Los Angeles, California are seen in March of 2011 . Dead birds: A veterinarian examines dead red-winged blackbirds in Little Rock, Arkansas after thousands fell dead out of the sky last year . It is not yet clear whether the birds died as a result of eating the dead fish, or whether there was some other cause. At this time, Canadian officials have not issued any health warnings, but as new information is discovered this could change. Earlier this month, thousands of dead fish washed ashore along the Texas . coast from the Colorado River to Galveston Island, Kens5 reported. Biologists suspected low oxygen levels caused the deaths. Last year thousands of dead birds were seen falling from the sky in Arkansas, and hundreds were discovered along a road in California. Dead birds were also reported in Italy and Sweden, and huge quantity of dead fish were found in New Zealand and Brazil.",Ontario's Ministry of the Environment: Deaths believed to be the result of 'lake inversion' that naturally depletes oxygen levels in the water .

China is yet to make animal cruelty illegal and dogs are still eaten in many parts of the country despite a growing anti-cruelty campaign. While many Chinese enjoy rich dog meat, especially during cold winters, some object to the practice in some regions of beating dogs to death to release the blood into the meat. Earlier this year, animal welfare volunteers and police in Chongqing, south-west China, discovered more than 1,500 malnourished and dehydrated dogs loaded inside cages so small they could not stand up. The animals were on trucks bound for the slaughterhouse and many were so frail they would not even have survived the 22-hour journey. Volunteers took them to a nearby farm where they were given food, water and emergency medical treatment, but many were too frail to survive. Although the Chinese were the first to domesticate the dog and keep them as pets, dog meat has been a source of food from at least the time of Confucius, and possibly even before.

One of Britainâs most luxurious hotels has reached new heights - by spending Â£7million building treehouses. The Chewton Glen in Hampshireâs New Forest is the only place in the country where guests can stay in such arboreal splendour. The five-star hotel managed to gain permission to branch out and build 12 huge suites upon stilts in a wooded valley - even though itâs next to a National Park. Scroll down for a mini tour of the treehouses!... Amongst the trees: A five-star hotel has spent millions building the treehouses next to a National Park . One of the treehouses in the wooded valley where guests can stay in arboreal splendour . Each suite, built upon stilts and surrounded by oak trees, has it's own spa . The suites are set in six luxury pods that nestle in treesâ canopy surrounded by wildlife. Breakfast arrives almost magically because staff quietly deliver a hamper each morning through a secret hatchway. The suites are done out in varying styles and furniture has been especially commissioned to complement the unique setting. Wooded valley: The cost to stay in the treehouse starts at Â£600 a night for two people and rises to well over Â£1,000 . Luxury: A bedroom facing the wooded area, with rose petals scattered on the bed . What a view: The bath looks out onto the trees and the nature that surrounds the five-star hotel .

Andrew Stembridge, managing director of Chewton Glen, said: 'The inevitable restrictions of building in such a picturesque and secluded valley actually helped shape the design, positioning and vista of each pod and the end result is one that has evolved organically over the course of time. 'Our strategy was to work hand in hand with the local council, the ecologists and arboriculturists and this ensured that everyone and everything was considered from the outset. 'Even the badgers were provided with a brand new five-star home - built out of oak - and other wildlife was politely asked to âstand asideâ for a few months whilst we undertook the construction in the most considerate manner. 'Not a tree was felled nor a tree-root disturbed.

Families are being hit by the highest mortgage repayments in more than three years, according to figures released yesterday. The standard variable rates that at least 1.5million families are on now average 4.27 per cent â a level not seen since March 2009. Homeowners are automatically moved to SVRs at the end of their initial deal â such as a two-year fixed loan or a three-year tracker. Tomorrow, Santander, the countryâs second biggest mortgage lender, will increase its variable rate from 4.24 per cent to 4.74 per cent, hitting 400,000 customers. The upward move comes despite the Bank of England having kept its base rate at an historic low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009. A Santander customer with a Â£150,000, 25-year loan will be forced to find an extra Â£42 per month â Â£504 a year. Many homeowners are trapped on an SVR because they do not have enough equity in their properties to secure a more competitive deal. The Bank of England figures published yesterday show the average variable rate has risen steadily this year. In March 2009 it was 4.06 per cent but then fell as low as 3.82 per cent before returning to a 42-month high of 4.27 per cent. Halifax, Yorkshire Bank, the Co-op and Bank of Ireland have all increased their rates in recent months. David Hollingworth, from the mortgage adviser, London & Country, said: âNo SVR is safe at the moment. There is every chance that there will be other banks and building societies which increase their rates in the next few weeks and months. âLenders are still feeling the pressure. The SVR is something that they can easily change.â It . is not known exactly how many homeowners are on an SVR deal, but the . number has increased sharply since the base rate was cut to 0.5 per . cent.

Possible increase: There is a risk that other banks and building societies will follow Santander and increase the rates for mortgages . âPeople tend to assume that the cost of funds to lenders equates to the base rate, but this is not the case,â she insisted.

Two teams of researchers have extended the reach of quantum teleportation to unprecedented lengths. The groundbreaking research could be a step towards creating quantum computers and other technology operating at speeds far in excess of current limits. And while teleporting humans may still be a long way off, researchers believe the latest work is a big step forward. Quantum researchers have managed to send a single proton 97km across a lake in China. It is hoped the work could lead to ultra fast communications systems. The team was able to teleport a qubit (a standard unit of data in quantum computing) 97 kilometers across a lake using a small set of photons without fiberoptic cables or other intermediaries. They used a complex laser targetting device for the experiment. Quantum teleportation relies on a phenomenon known as entanglement, . through which quantum particles share a fragile, invisible link across . space. Two entangled photons, for instance, can have correlated, opposite . polarization statesâif one photon is vertically polarized, for instance, . the other must be horizontally polarized. But, thanks to the intricacies of quantum mechanics, each photonâs . specific polarization remains undecided until one of them is measured. At that instant the other photonâs polarization snaps into its . opposing orientation, even if many kilometers have come between the . entangled pair. More... Rewriting the rules of the universe: Mysterious new atomic bond found in white dwarf stars could change computing forever . All the way up to 11: Nasa develops 'perfect' amplifier for listening to faint radio signals from space . This is the phenomenon that scientists believe can be harnessed for quantum teleportation. The group Chinese group created entangled photons by stimulating a crystal with ultraviolet light. This produces a pair of photons with the same wavelength, but opposite (and unknown) polarization values. One photon was sent 97km across Qinghai Lake (using a telescope to focus the beam), while the second was analysed locally, according to the team's research paper, published in Nature. The breakthrough could change the way we communicate by providing ultrafast communication without a need for cables . Using these photons, the researchers . copied the quantum state from the laboratory to the far station, . achieving quantum teleportation over a much larger distance than . previously obtained. The laser targeting device developed by Juan YinÂ  was necessary to counteract the minute seismic and atmosphere shifts that would otherwise break the link between the two remote locations. That distance surpasses the previous record, set by a group that included several of the same researchers, by 16 kilometers. However, a second team has already bettered it. A European and Canadian group claims to have teleported information from one of the Canary Islands to another, 143 kilometers away. However, the paper has not been peer-reviewed or published.","Team send a single proton 97km in China, while a second team in the Canary Islands claims to have reached 143km .

A new browser add-on offers users an estimate of how much 'free' internet services like Google and Facebook are making from their personal data. Just released for the Firefox and Chrome browsers, Privacyfix scans users' Google and Facebook accounts and shows how they are tracking and sharing your online activities to make money. The add-on then gives a rough estimate as to how valuable they are to these companies, based on their use of the services. 'We wanted people to understand, it is a value exchange,' said the program's creator Jim Brock. Not free, not at all: A new browser add-on gives users an estimate of how much money Facebook and Google are making from gathering and trading their personal data . To make its estimate, Privacyfix measures users' past 60 days of activity on Google, extrapolates that to a year, then uses a value-per-search estimate. Mr Brock, founder of Privacy Choice, an online privacy campaign, admits the estimates are rough, but added that the function is mainly there to help users understand the quid pro quo involved with the uses of the services. While Facebook and Google do not charge for access, both companies - as well as many other internet firms - make their money by taking their users' data and selling it on to advertisers. Mr Brock says his estimated annual Facebook value was just $1.68, but says his daughter's worth to the company was a rather more significant $12. His value to Google was significantly higher, at more than $700 a year. As well as giving these estimates, Privacyfix scans users' Google and Facebook privacy settings to highlight which need to be changed to indicate that you don't want your personal data shared with other companies. The extension then takes you to each site to make fixes, explaining the pros and cons of each change in clear, direct language. 'Default privacy settings on sites like Facebook are revenue- driven, not privacy-driven,' Mr Brock said. 'Privacyfix puts you back in control of your data.' How private is your Facebook profile? The service also takes users through the privacy settings of Google and Facebook showing which ones need to be changed to indicate that they don't want their data to be shared . The application promises to block tracking by over 1,000 sites, paying particular attention to Facebook and Google. It was developed with input from several hundred testers who helped with developing the user interface. Privacy Choice, Mr Brock's organisation, helps some one million people track their privacy with a range of apps and services. On the Privacy Choice blog, he warns: 'At least 1,200 companies now profile what you do across websites for ads and marketing. 'Social networks have managed to plant widgets everywhere that collect data about what you read and where you go. 'Anybody can target ads to you using your email address, fueling a robust business in matching your email to characteristics like your income level and your politics. 'Marketers now use IP addresses to link what you do on your phone with what you do on your laptop.' You are being watched: Privacyfix also promises to block tracking by over 1,000 other sites . Reviews of the Privacyfix app were largely positive. ReadWriteWeb writer Dave Copeland described the application's initial scan as 'eye-opening'. Users of mobile devices are rejecting or uninstalling some apps because of concerns about how much personal and private information is collected, a U.S. survey has shown . The Pew Internet Project survey found that 54 per cent of mobile users who download apps have decided to not install an app when they discovered how much personal information they would need to share in order to use it. Additionally, 30 per cent of app users have uninstalled an app that was already on their phone because they learned it was collecting personal information that they did not want to share. The survey came amid growing concern among lawmakers and civil liberties groups that personal information may be collected by phones and other mobile devices, often without their knowledge. 'I . had manually gone through my Facebook privacy settings earlier this . year, amping up my privacy and deleting apps I didnât use anymore,' he . wrote. 'PrivacyFix showed me that many of the apps had been reactivated on Facebook and several Facebook privacy settings - including the one that allows Facebook to use my likes in advertising - had reverted back to less-private settings. 'It told me that Facebook tracks on a whopping 86 per cent of the sites I have visited and makes, on average, about 16 cents per year on ads at my level of activity.' Joe Mullins, reviewing the app for ArsTechnica, who claimed to be a 'minimal user of Facebook' said he was nonetheless surprised to find the social network tracked him across 87 per cent of the internet. 'Privacyfix has a checklist for Facebook privacy settings, with orange warning signs near settings that users might want to take a look at,' he said. 'Unless you're a complete privacy hawk already - or you don't care at all - you'll probably find something new on that list that you weren't aware of.'",Privacyfix also helps users to change their profile settings for more privacy .

FACEBOOK has been accused of being a âfront for gamblingâ after it launched a bingo game that allows users to risk thousands to win jackpots in excess of Â£50,000. Users of Bingo Friendzy must stake a minimum of Â£10 on the virtual bingo machine â the siteâs first âreal moneyâ game â which was launched on the social networking site yesterday. It will only be available in the UK, where gaming laws are more relaxed than the US, and will be followed by a Las Vegas-style slot machine app created by the same gaming company. Bingo Frendzy is the first Facebook game where players can gamble with real cash, winning up to Â£5,000. However, it has come under fire for its cartoon-like logo, which some critic say targets children. Experts have warned of the dangers of . social gaming on Facebook, which is usedÂ  by almost two out of three . internet-users in the UK. And because Bingo Friendzy features . cartoon characters similar to those on the popular childrenâs internet . hit Moshi Monsters, fresh concerns have been raised that youngsters will . be encouraged to play. Both Facebook and gambling giant . Gamesys, operators of the Bingo Friendzy app, insist that its controls . will prevent anyone under the age of 18 â the legal age for gambling in . the UK â from accessing the real money games. A spokesperson for the firms said users must go through strict electoral register and credit card checks before being allowed to play. The new site plans to offer a range of bingo and slot machine games using real money . But children regularly bypass the . minimum age limit to have a Facebook profile simply by giving false . information. At present the website is under growing pressure to . increase its revenues. The company was valued at Â£67billion for its . stock market flotation in May but doubts over its money-making potential . saw Â£18.2billion vanish from its value in two weeks. Social gaming and real money gambling are seen as areas where Facebook can deliver rapid increases in revenue. More âreal moneyâ gambling sites are expected to be launched on the site within months. But Mark Griffiths, professor of . gambling studies at Nottingham Trent University, said: âIt is through . [virtual] gambling that children are introduced to the principles and . excitement of gambling.â He visited Bingo Friendzy yesterday . and said he was struck by the characters which appeared to target young . people. Professor Griffiths said: âI had extreme concerns about the . graphics and imagery. Like: Facebook hopes the gambling firms will help it make money . âThe whole thing about gambling is . that it should not appeal to children or adolescents in any way. How . that squares with the idea of not promoting gambling for children and . adolescents, Iâve no idea at all. âTheyâre effectively a front for a gambling operator.â When registering to Bingo Friendzy users can make a âquick depositâ from their debit or credit card of Â£10 up to Â£500.

From the stirring opening sequence to the wonderful art design, Darksiders 2 promises something special. And although it improves on its predecessor in almost every way, sadly a host of minor issues stop this fantasy adventure from becoming a classic. You play Death who is on a mission to clear his brother War's name for starting the Apocalypse early. Masterful: The brilliant art direction gives the RPG a unique feel and look . Defying the Charred Council, he sets out across the Nether Realms - a haunting place between Heaven and Hell - to seek help from the beings who dwell there. There's more than a slight nod to Zelda in Darksiders 2's dungeon-raiding design, which will see the campaign extend to well over 30 hours. However, the game adds its own flavour to the mechanic by focusing on loot. Each dungeon has treasure chests which can be found to upgrade Death's appearance and weapons. There are thousands of items to collect - each having their own ability. Unfortunately, the contents of each chest are completely unpredictable. You may dispatch a low-end enemy and get a powerful weapon, while defeat a hulking ice monster and get a pair of boots. This can jar with the entire experience, and can take away the incentive of searching out the vast dungeons on offer. Brutal: Weapons are plentiful in Darksiders 2, however, combat is repetitive . Combat is rather a middling affair, too. Although weapons range from swords, guns and dual scythes, it's all rather basic. You'll often find a simple yet effective combination, only to repeat it over and over again. There's so much going in fights that it's very hard to see what is going on, many battles turning into a flurry of blood, gore and flying orbs. The combat also highlights Death's rather robotic animations. A clever touch is his ability to transform into the Grim Reaper, which has devastating effects on enemies - but the bar takes so long to fill that it doesn't happen as much as you'd like. There is a skill tree that allows you to upgrade weapons, armour and magic, but sadly this does nothing to stave off the repetitive combat. Where Darksiders 2 shines, though, is in art direction. Joe Madureira from Marvel, has created a garish and ultimately convincing fantasy world, populated by memorable characters.

Even the most determined entrepreneur could falter in the face of outright ridicule from the hard-to-please investors on Dragonsâ Den. Not Guy Jeremiah. Two years after Theo Paphitis told him heâd rather stick pins in his eyes than back his idea for a collapsible water bottle, his invention is available in 16 countries â and he has sold 100,000 of them. And if that was not enough to convince the Dragons they had missed a trick, he has also signed a distribution deal with Marks & Spencer. Dismissive: Dragon Theo Paphitis was not impressed with Guy Jeremiah's collapsible plastic water bottle invention when the inventor appeared on the show two years ago . The chain is selling the bottle, called Aquatina, near checkouts and in its takeaway food sections.Manufactured in Sheffield, theÂ  âcollapsabottleâ is sold as a cheap and environmentally friendly alternative to buying bottled water. Mr Jeremiah originally presented his idea to the BBCâs five dragons â Mr Paphitis, Duncan Bannatyne, Peter Jones, Deborah Meaden and James Caan â in 2010. All five dismissed the idea, and even by the standards of the notoriously tough show, they gave Mr Jeremiah a grilling. An angry Mr Jones said the Aquatina would not take any sales from the bottled water market. âThis is not something that is going to sell in anything like the volume you think,â he said. Mr Bannatyne, who runs gyms, described the bottles as cumbersome â and got so angry that he threw one across the room. He said: âThis is a terrible invention. I just cannot see the point of this. Itâs ludicrous.â Confident: Guy Jeremiah makes his pitch for his collapsible plastic water bottle product on Dragons' Den in 2010 . Mr Paphitis was particularly dismissive and delivered the final blow, saying: âThis is one of those âIâd really want to stick pins in my eyesâ moments. Youâve got five sophisticated investors here who donât want to be treated like idiots. Iâm out.â The buyers at M&S, however, took a different view. Lesley Saunders, its âFood on the Moveâ expert, said: âThis is perfect for the summer months when youâre on the go and need a bottle of water to hand without the hassle of having to carry something heavy around. We are going to be stocking it near our till points and as part of our âFood on the Moveâ range so it can be easily picked up by our customers who we know like to buy food and drink they can enjoy when on the go.â The Aquatina is also on sale in 15 other countries, including Germany, Australia, Canada, Spain, Japan, Italy and Sweden. The plastic bottles have a concertina design so that, when compressed, they are only a third of their original size, small enough to be carried in a handbag or pocket. Mr Jeremiah said: â100,000 British pocket-bottles later, it seems the public and the Dragons reached very different verdicts. Popular: The Aquatina is on sale in the UK and 15 other countries. More than 100,000 collapsible bottles have now been sold . âItâs a real vote of confidence that M&S spotted the environmental and commercial benefits of collapsabottles. To have Aquatina collapsible bottles available nationwide, and internationally, means weâre now in that luxurious position of being able to cast the Dragons aside, and not vice versa. âItâs pretty clear that the Dragons were the only people who didnât understand the value of our product. Itâs handy, convenient and sustainable and makes a great alternative to buying bottled water.â The brightly coloured bottles, which expand to hold 500ml of water, cost Â£4.99. It is not the first time that an invention rejected on Dragonsâ Den has been picked up with great success by M&S. James Nashâs idea for a âcup-a-wineâ was dismissed by the showâs investors, but M&S later made him an offer, and in 2010 began selling a single-serve plastic cup of its Le Froglet wine. The cups, which have a tear-off lid, proved hugely popular, particularlyÂ  with concert-goers and picnickers, and initially sold out. M&S has since extended the range to include a four pack.

Georgia Keeling, from Norwich, died after being rushed to hospital on August 4, 2009, at the height of the swine flu pandemic. Her older sister, Charlie, had earlier been correctly diagnosed with the disease, contributing to the confusion.

Giving . evidence at an inquest in Norwich today, Ms Keeling said a paramedic . had arrived earlier in the day only to send an ambulance away because it . was 'another case of swine flu'. 'They gave me some Tamiflu and I was told all I had to do was get her temperature down,' she added. 'I felt relieved because I thought she had been diagnosed and had all the stuff she needed.' Georgiaâs condition continued to deteriorate throughout the day. Breaking down in tears, Ms Keeling said: 'I went to the toilet and she screamed out âmumâ to me. She sounded really distressed. 'Her eyes were glazed over and she wasnât breathing. I was trying to resuscitate her.' Ms Keeling called 999 immediately and an ambulance arrived at about 4pm.

She had a great character, even when she was naughty. 'You couldnât tell her off because she always made you laugh.' Mr Sewell said he rang NHS Direct and carried out the 'glass test' on the rash to see if Georgia was suffering from meningitis. The rash seemed to disappear, although the outline remained visible. He told the inquest: 'They said it was probably a virus which was going around. I felt reassured it wasnât life-threatening so I went to work.' Georgia had seemed healthy and happy until two days before her death, Ms Keeling said. But on August 3 she suddenly developed a high temperature, was 'off her food' and was restless when she went to bed.

Paramedic Patricia Perfect said she visited the family's home and made the swine flu diagnosis after a 45-minute examination . The cityâs West Earlham surgery told her no appointments were available for two days. Ms Keeling was told to contact the swine flu hotline, which had been introduced during the pandemic.

Jailed: Zanib Khan arriving at Southwark Crown Court whwre she was sentenced to 12 months for 'illicit relationships' with prisoners . A woman prison officer who admitted swapping erotic letters and phone calls with four serving convicts was jailed for 12 months yesterday. Zanib Khan, 27, made more than ten hours of amorous calls to drug dealers and robbers. One prison inmate said he could not forget âwalking through those gates and seeing my beautiful galâ. Another referred to kissing her âbeautiful lips and bodyâ and spoke about how he wanted to see the petite warderâs âsize 2 feetâ in the air as they made love. The letters, smuggled out of her workplace, HMP Brixton, were later found in her bedroom at her parentsâ home. After the arrest it emerged she had previously been disciplined for failing to disclose her father was serving a four-year sentence for immigration offences, and that her boyfriend was inside for robbery. Although Khan only admitted misconduct with four prisoners, police suspect she was conducting relationships with a further three inmates. Her defence counsel insisted that though the letters contained âsexual mattersâ, it was all fantasy. Robin Du Preez, prosecuting, said between March and November 2011: âMiss Khan developed an inappropriate intimate relationship with serving prisoners on A Wing at HMP Brixton. âThey were Timothy Iyegbe, Daryl Smith and Jason Graham. She was responsible for them at prison and she did not disclose any of the contact, contrary to the Prison Rules.â Smith and Iyegbe were both heroin dealers. Mr Du Preez, detailing Khanâs previous disciplinary offence, said: âHer father was a serving prisoner and she joined the prison service [in January 2009] 12 days after her fatherâs imprisonment. Also she did not disclose her relationship with a serving prisoner, Wahid Khalique.â Khanâs tangled love life came to light in October 7, 2011, when a mobile phone was found in Jason Grahamâs cell at Ford open prison. He had been an inmate at Brixton. Mr Du Preez said the phone had been in contact with Khan. A check revealed that the same number used by Khan had been used to call âa number of serving prisonersâ including Iyegbe and Smith. Between March 10 and November 22, 2011, there had been ten hours of calls between Khan and the prisoners. Affairs: Brixton Prison, south London, where Zanib Khan shared racy phone calls letters with two convicts as well as a third in an open prison . Mr Du Preez explained prisoners are allowed to make calls to a restricted number of approved numbers which are taped. Iyegbe had Khanâs number listed âas his motherâ and Smith had it listed on the system as âhis partnerâ. Police retrieved the tape of one three-and-a-half minute phone call between Iyegbe and Khan dated August 28, 2011. Mr Du Preez said Khan finished the call saying âI love you,â as he did to her. Khan was arrested on January 28, 2011 after her home in Ilford, East London was searched and the letters found. She resigned that day. The letters from Wahid Khalique were âof an innocent nature,â while the letters from Smith and Iyegbe were more graphic, the court heard. Khanâs counsel, Anand Beharrylal, said in mitigation the sexual content in the letters was âfantasy and flattery.â Judge David Higgins told Khan, who admitted misconduct in a public office: âYou undertook a knowing and sustained voluntary and gross breach of trust.â Until the 1980s women prison officers were restricted to working in women-only institutions.Similarly, male guards could not work outside all-male jails. However, since the ban was dropped, that division of labour has been broken down. There are now nearly 6,000 women prison officers in England and Wales, around one in four of the total. The Ministry of Justice could not provide a breakdown of how many women work specifically in menâs prisons. But Mark Leech, editor of the Prisonsâ Handbook, estimated that around 500 women officers were working in menâs prisons. There are very few rules restricting what work female prison officers can carry out. They can work in maximum security environments dealing with the most violent and dangerous criminals. Female officers cannot carry out body searches of male inmates, and there is a similar ban on searches of women prisoners by male officers. Pregnant female officers can be limited in their contact with inmates for their own safety. The only other restrictions are those imposed in individual prisons by governors if there is thought to be a particular risk with certain inmates.","Zanib Khan shared 'illicit relationships' including sexually explicit texts, phone calls and letters with drug dealers .

As the group explored the woods and chatted around a bonfire, it fell to Tigerlily Smith to bravely ask the question they all wanted to know the answer to. âWe asked how it felt to be a princess and she said it was very nice,â the eight-year-old girl said afterwards.

The children Kate met came from the King Solomon Academy Primary School which is based in North Westminster, London. An area of high deprivation, more than 70 per cent of children under 15 in the area live in a jobless household. For many of the children, aged between and eight and nine years old, it was the first time they had seen the countryside or been away from home. Quizzed: Some of the children asked Kate about her job and she replied: 'It's very busy and great fun but I am very well looked after' On their three-day residential course the children had learnt to sleep in tipi tents and take part in team-building activities including rope challenges, obstacle courses, campfire building and outdoor cooking. Zahid Shanvere, eight, made Kate roar with laughter as he held open his tent flap for her and said: 'After you.â âWhat a gentleman,â she said. She was in fits of giggles again when the children told her that they had been a little scared on their first night out under the stars. âWhat were you scared of? That a spider might creep in?â She asked. âA mole,â said Zahid, with enormous seriousness. Then it was out along a muddy path to the woods where the rest of the group were busy making shelters and camp fires. Fairytale: Another child on the camping trip asked the Duchess how long she would sit on the throne to which Kate said tactfully, 'It's not actually my job yet!' The Duchess marvelled at their efforts and even gamely crawled inside one of the shelters, sitting down in the dirt with the youngsters. One could be heard telling her he had been âdead scared to go to the toiletâ the night before.

Millions of hay fever sufferers have been warned to brace themselves for an extra month of discomfort due to Britain's chaotic weather. The unrelenting heavy rainfall has seen pollen-bearing weeds and grasses flourish. During the rare and fleeting warm spells the amount of pollen in the air has risen sharply â up to twice the levels seen during the last two years. Ingrid McCrudden strolls with son Callum, two, through a field of roses near Colchester, Essex, today, which bloomed a week later than usual due to the wet June . Experts say the freak weather will . mean the hay fever season, which normally ends in July signalling . blessed relief for the country's 16 million sufferers, could be extended . well into August. Compared to last year, NHS Direct has reported a surge of 20 per cent in calls from hay fever sufferers in the last couple of months. But while some plants have been boosted by the weather, one of the wettest, dullest and coldest Junes on record has decimated apple crops. The weather has been disastrous for Chris Dench, who owns a 25-acre apple orchard near Tunbridge Wells, Kent. Almost . all of his crop of Coxes and about 80 per cent of the usual Russets had . failed to grow this year due to the extreme fluctuations in the . weather. The shoreline of Derwentwater, Cumbria, would normally by full of tourists enjoying the summer sun, but bad weather and threatening skies have hit visitor numbers leaving it almost deserted today . Two rowers are wrapped up against the cold during a trip across Derwentwater, in Cumbria, today . âThe trees took a hammering, the bees . wouldnât leave the hives and the pollination never happened. When you . farm for a living, you have to accept that sometimes the weather isnât . going to be on your side, but to lose this much is extraordinary,â he . told the Sunday Telegraph. This evening the clouds should build across most of the country causing the occasional shower. Light, patchy rain will arrive in the west during the night spreading eastwards to most parts by morning. Some heavier bursts developing in the west. Minimum Temperature 13 Â°C. Monday will be generally cloudy with outbreaks of rain throughout the day, some of it heavy and rather persistent for a time. Feeling cool in the rain, and breezy along south coasts. Maximum Temperature 17 Â°C. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Generally unsettled and rather cloudy with only a few bright or sunny intervals. There will be showers or longer outbreaks of rain, which may be heavy at times. Itâs . the same desperate story across much of the south of England, which . accounts for 70per cent of the countryâs apple production. Many apple growers complaining this season is the worst they have seen in almost half a century. The dire outlook is set to push up the price of apples by 10p per pound by mid-autumn, experts fear. Provisional . data indicates that it was the wettest June since 1860, according to . forecasters. It was also the dullest since 1909 and the coldest since . 1991. Power has finally be reconnected to around 2,450 homes in the North East of England which were hit by black-outs after lightning strikes and storms damaged supply lines on Thursday due to a fierce storm. Northern Powergrid said engineers had restored electricity to all affected customers where access to their properties has been possible. The next few days are forecast to see sunshine and showers across all of the UK. The terrible weather also caused flowers, cultivated by the oldest growers in Britain, to bloom a week later than usual. The fields of fragrant flowers, grown . by Cants Roses, have blossomed more than a week later than usual this . year after an unusually wet June. Festival goers sit in their tent on the final day of the Hop Farm music festival in Paddock Wood, Kent, today, as dark rain clouds pass overhead today . Three day forecast: Few parts of Britain will escape showers - some heavy - over the next, according to the Met Office . 'It's a very different story to last year when the crop came out three weeks early, but now at last many of the varieties are in full flower,' said owner Roger Pawsey, who runs the 245-year-old business with his sister Angela and brother Martin. 'The crop is always very effected by the weather and ten days ago we were wondering when the flowers would come out. 'Now after a few days of sun and some warmer weather the rose fields have completely changed, the flowers have opened and they are looking really good.' Roger and his family grow a remarkable 40,000 roses in a two-and-a-half acre field near Colchester in Essex. They are direct descendants of the founders who began growing roses more than two centuries ago. In the early years the firm grew all sorts of plants, including azaleas, fuchsias, peaches and apricots. But in 1853 Ben Cant was introduced . by a friend to some new roses developed in France and as the popularity . of the flower was growing he decided to concentrate on it. By . 1880 Ben had emerged as the country's leading rose exhibitor and in one . month was reported to have won 54 prizes at major rose events all over . the country. Ingrid McCrudden and son Callum, two, pick on the the thousands of stunning flowers to have blossomed late in Colchester, Essex . Today the family grows all types and colours of roses and their field is open for visitors to wander through every day. The rose plants are then dug up in October for people to buy. 'The field smells fantastic at the moment with all the flowers blooming,' added Roger. Visitors have been making the most of better weather over the weekend to enjoy the rows of beautiful blooms. Much of the country enjoyed brighter spells of sunshine today, with temperatures reaching 21C in London. But the sunny weather does not look set to continue, with rain, cloud and thunderstorms expected during the first week of July. 'It is due to be unsettled again next week with rain across much of the country tomorrow and Tuesday,' said Helen Roberts, of the Met Office. 'They will be murky conditions for the start of the working week and the rain showers will continue as the week goes on.' The forecast means there is no respite in site for sun worshipers upset by months of rain. Average rainfall over England and Wales, including an estimated figure for June 30, was 157mm - 231per cent of the average for the period 1981 to 2010, and on a par with the 1860 readings. The equivalent figures for Scotland were 104mm and 171per cent of the normal amount, and for Northern Ireland 145mm and 224per cent. Monthly totals at routinely-available sites varied between 325mm at Capel Curig, in Caernarfon, and 34mm at Stornoway, on the Isle of Lewis. Average sunshine over England and Wales, including an estimated figure for June 30, was 123 hours, which is a mere 64per cent of the 1981-2010 average, making it the dullest June since 1909. The equivalent figures for Scotland were 123 hours and 74per cent, and for Northern Ireland 136 hours and 75per cent. Largest total in the UK was 167 hours at Tiree, Inner Hebrides, and the smallest just 57 hours at Eskdalemuir, in Dumfriesshire. Other low aggregates were 69 hours at Durham and 73 hours at Nottingham. 'Such monthly totals would not have been out of place in February,' the spokesman for said. Daytime temperatures were typically 1.5-2.5 degrees Celsius below the long-term average in most parts of the country, and the Central England Temperature of 13.6C (56F) was 0.9 degree Celsius below the average for 1981-2010 - the lowest in June since 1991.","Apple farmers say they are facing the worst season in half a century as they face having almost all this year's wiped out by fluctuating weather .

Labour MP John Mann said the 60-year-old American, who resigned last week, had âcalculatedly and deliberately misledâ MPs over the Libor rate-fixing scandal that has engulfed his company. The attack came after an explosive select committee hearing yesterday, . in which a damning letter from the Financial Services Authority to .

Severance: Barclays chairman Marcus Agius told the Treasury Select Committee that Bob Diamond has agreed to waive bonus awards and long-term incentive shares worth a potential Â£20 million . The letter was sent by FSA chairman Lord Turner to Barclays chairman . Marcus Agius on April 10 this year, and concerns the discovery that . Barclays had unethically tried to manipulate the Libor interbank lending . rate. It noted an âunfavourableâ impact on the âdegree of external trust in . Barclaysâ approachâ and accuses the bankâs bosses of being âat the . aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules and regulationsâ and trying to âspin its messages in an unhelpful fashionâ. Tory MP David Ruffley asked Mr Agius, 65, yesterday whether he had . received such a âdamningâ letter during his long career in the City.

Bob Diamond: Giving up his bonus . Senior Bank of England staff discussed buying bikes to get around the City as a strategy to cope with crisis, a former minister revealed yesterday. Lord Myners, who was Labourâs City minister from 2008 to 2010, recalled the plan, proposed before the financial crisis hit. Casting doubt on whether the Bank should be handed extra powers, the former member of its Court of Directors told peers of a meeting he attended in â2006 or 2007â. He said: âOne of the governors [there] proposed that as a mechanism to cope with crisis, the Bank should buy ... bicycles. âThis tells you a huge amount about where the Bank sits in terms of its understanding of the complexity of financial markets.â He raised the issue in the committee stage of the Financial Services Bill. The Governmentâs regulation shake-up will seeÂ  the Bank take over many responsibilities previously held by the Financial Services Authority.

The teenager leapt to his death from an apartment building in Otsu, central Japan, which has one of the world's highest suicide rates. His death has prompted a series of bomb threats against the school and local government over claims they didn't do enough to stop the taunts. There are also reports that his teacher apparently brushed off the abuse as a joke. Suicide: The teenager leapt to his death from an apartment building in Otsu, Japan (general view pictured) which has one of the world's highest suicide rates . A letter sent to the boy's school this week threatened that the building would be bombed unless the . pupils and teachers involved apologise, local authorities said. A local police officer said: 'The . school called police Monday after receiving a threat in the mail, which . demanded pupils and teachers involved in the bullying publicly . apologise'. Other threats included bombing . regional government buildings, a local education board and even the . police department, but it was unclear if one person was behind all the . threats, they said. A survey of 15 pupils at the school revealed that the boy was routinely subjected to a litany of abuse by bullies - but still nothing was done. It also revealed that his teacher was aware of problems but ignored them. They described how the victim, who has not been named, was beaten in a bathroom, forced to practise taking his own life, and told to put a dead sparrow in his mouth. He was also forced to shoplift for the bullies and extorted money from 'friends' and there were reports he was repeatedly held in a headlock and beaten, had his pants pulled down, and forced to eat dead bees. The boy's parents are trying to sue three students, their parents and the Otsu Municipal Government, seeking damages of 77.2 million yen - approximately $966,235 - following his death in October last year. The school has disputed any link between the allegedly abusive pupils and the boy's death while the local government admitted the boy had been bullied, but argued it could not be proved that the suicide was the result of the bullying. The boy was found dead on October 11, close to his home. He did not leave a suicide note. Police said at the time the cause of his death was suicide.","Boy's death prompted bomb threats against his Japanese school and local government .

Michael Austin, 48, was also branded a 'crafty butcher' - slang for homosexual - by his workmates, who were avid Newcastle United supporters. Newcastle employment tribunal heard that it was 'quite normal' in the North East for anyone who does not like football to be considered gay. Mr Austinâs interest in the arts and viewing of a documentary about surrealist painter Dali were taken as 'further evidence of his homosexuality'. Mr Austin, who is a married father-of-one, was also upset when he went to make a cup of tea - and then found porn had been put on his computer. When he was seriously ill with swine flu, his boss Ian Laidlaw texted him saying: âOink oink, lolâ. On his return to work at packaging firm Samuel Grant, his colleagues greeted him wearing surgical masks. In his very first week, one office worker pretended to suffer from Tourettes syndrome and swore at him endlessly. Mr Laidlaw and a quarter of the firmâs staff at its Jarrow offices were Jehovahâs Witnesses and tried to ram their religion down Mr Austinâs throat, the tribunal heard. He was encouraged to attend faith meetings and regularly lectured about religion. When Mr Austin made a formal complaint about bullying and inappropriate homophobic and religious remarks, he was summarily sacked from his Â£25,000-a-year post. The tribunal found that Mr Austin, of Durham, suffered 'atrocious' bullying by managing director Mr Laidlaw and fellow sales executive Tony Kozlowski. It found Leeds-based Samuel Grant guilty of harassment on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion and victimisation. The panel awarded Mr Austin Â£43,755 for loss of earnings and injury to feelings.

In its judgment, it ruled: 'It was a series of treatment by two people over a period of several months during which Mr Austin was treated atrociously, by being referred constantly to being gay, homosexual and a crafty butcher. 'It was extreme, frequent and very unpleasant. All he wanted to do was get out and get on with his job. 'He was subjected to unwanted religious discussions, then when he made a complaint was dismissed. 'It has obviously had a deep-seated emotional effect on Mr Austin.' The tribunal also ordered that the companyâs directors and managers must receive diversity training within six months. Speaking after the recent judgment, Mr Austin said: 'The level of compensation was a pleasant surprise but this was never about the money. It was about me getting justice for what happened to me at Samuel Grant. 'I have always worked as a sales rep for blue chip companies. I thought it would make a nice change to work for a small, family-run business and make a big impact there. 'I was really looking forward to it but it was an absolutely unbearable, dreadful nightmare from day one. The only thing I can compare it to was the tough comprehensive school I attended in the 1970s. 'There was an atmosphere of fear generated by Mr Laidlaw and Mr Kozlowski and everyone was watching their backs. It got to the point where I could not stand it any more. I thought I had nothing to lose by making a formal complaint. 'But they had a meeting in Leeds and decided to get rid of me. If theyâd apologised, handed me a monthâs pay and wished me all the best for the future, I would have walked away. 'Instead, they were arrogant and lied every step of the way. They got staff who had worked with me to lie at the tribunal. 'The tribunal was the most stressful time of my life but it was really embarrassing for them because everything came out.' Mr Austin joined the firm as a sales executive in September 2010. On his first day Mr Laidlaw told Mr Austin that Mr Kozlowski suffered from Touretteâs and to 'just ignore him'. Mr Kozlowski admitted to the tribunal that his constant swearing had been 'crass and out of order'. Warm welcome: Newcastle fans taunt their former hero Andy Carroll on his return to the North East . Mr Austin was asked whether he liked football. When he said he was not interested in it he was told 'youâre gay then'. Mr Laidlaw and Mr Kozlowski also told him he was 'not a real man'. The tribunal panel noted: 'Both Mr Laidlaw and Mr Kozlowski, in their evidence, say that such an expression is quite normal in north east England football circles, in that anybody who does not like football must accordingly be homosexual.' Mr Kozlowski equated Mr Austinâs willingness to do household chores with him being gay. Mr Laidlaw also sent 'overtly sexist and racist' emails to staff, the tribunal found. He and Mr Kozlowski would quote tracts from the Bible and brand anyone with an alternative religious view 'a Pagan'. In March last year Mr Austin formally complained of bullying by Mr Laidlaw and Mr Kozlowski. Just over two weeks later Mr Austin was marched out of the building and summarily dismissed. Neither of the culprits were suspended with their behaviour later dismissed as 'banter'. The firm claimed that Mr Austin was sacked for poor performance but the tribunal found the real reason was Mr Austinâs complaint. One . of the offices of packaging firm Samuel Grant. A tribunal has found . that the Leeds-based firm is guilty of harassment and must pay Mr Austin . Â£44,000 . It ruled that Mr Laidlaw and Mr Kozlowski 'colluded' with other employees and that their evidence was 'unconvincing and contrived'. It found that Mr Laidlaw was responsible for an office culture of sexism, racism and religious discussion. It said: 'This conduct is led by the managing director who sets the tone of the culture within the office by his own behaviour and by accepting the behaviour of others.' Mr Austin was fired because 'Mr Laidlaw knew serious complaints had been made and, with proper investigation, could be proved.' The tribunal heard that Mr Austin declined his GPâs offer of medication for work-related stress. But he broke down while on a walk with his daughter and wept several times while giving his evidence to the tribunal. The tribunal heard that Mr Austin has been unable to find another job. He has now set up his own business.","Michael Austin was branded a 'crafty butcher' by his workmates .

In the two years heâs been lining up alongside plaster cast pals including Nessie, a crocodile and a meerkat, Norman the gnome has had his share of scrapes. When the wind knocked him down, for example, it took some loving emergency repair work by owner Lorraine Dearing to glue his hand back in place. Now, however, Norman finds himself in an altogether stickier situation, kidnapped and held to ransom in what appears to be a bad taste practical joke. And Mrs Dearing has yet to see the funny side. Have you seen this gnome? Lorraine Dearing was shocked to receive this photo of her beloved gnome Norman being held at knife point . The first she knew of her gnomeâs disappearance was when she discovered a scrawled ransom note on blue card demanding â1,000pâ for Normanâs safe return by today. It was accompanied by a picture of a kitchen knife held under his throat and a threat to âbeheadâ him. The note read: âI know you wouldnât want this to happen so listen to me. âLeave the money in your beautiful hanging baskets! If itâs not there then you donât want to know what will happen to them!â Mrs Dearing, 49, of Swindon, said she was âshockedâ by the threats but would not bow to the demands â particularly as Norman had cost just Â£5 when he was new. Chilling: The photograph came with a ransom note scrawled on blue card. It demanded Mrs Dearing leave 1,000p in her hanging baskets or her gnome would be beheaded . The mother of one said: âI just want him back and I donât know what to do. He is a part of my garden. It just doesnât look the same with him gone. [caption . âI got home from work and didnât notice he was missing, but then I looked through the post and saw the note. âIt was written in quite scruffy handwriting and there was a picture of Norman with a kitchen knife next to his throat. I couldnât believe what I was seeing. âWe have about 12 other ornaments in the garden and there are some really interesting ones that are worth more money. âI donât understand why anyone would take Norman. He was just standing by himself on a piece of grass by the living room window. âThereâs no way that Iâm paying the ransom. Theyâve also asked for the money in my hanging baskets in 1,000 pennies. If I put 1,000 pennies in them theyâd fall down, it would be too heavy for them.â Newspaper sales executive Mrs Dearing, who lives with husband Leslie, 47, a tyre-fitter, discovered that Norman was missing on Tuesday. The couple began filling their front garden with ornaments five years ago and their collection includes a Loch Ness monster and even singing birds. Mrs Dearing added: âI donât know who would do anything like this. Iâm just hoping whoever it is has the heart to return him to me. Iâd hate to think of anything awful happening to him.â She said she had not reported the incident to the police as she hoped Norman would be returned.","Gnome owner Lorraine Dearing has until tomorrow to pay ransom, say thieves .

Bosses of the airline, formally known as Virgin Blue, believe cabin crew have become too casual with customers and want to inject a more sophisticated air. The edict is among a raft of changes that include etiquette classes and a ban on using the traditional Aussie greeting 'mate' without written permission. The cabin crew of Virgin Australia have been asked to participate in a program called Elevate, an etiquette, wine-appreciation, grooming and body language class . A source, who asked not to be named, told Australia's Herald Sun: 'They want us to get away from that 'sex' look that's been attached to the company.' The overhaul is a far cry from the casual, almost cheeky attitude staff . adopted after the airline was founded in 2000 by Sir Richard Branson. Last year the company - then Virgin Blue - even employed supermodel Elle Macpherson to lead 60 employees in a glamorous catwalk show to showcase their new sis-inspired uniforms.

All staff will undergo rigorous lessons in wine tasting, grooming and body language and will only be permitted to use the term 'mate' with frequent flyers who have given their consent on the airline's database.

China is becoming a âsecurity riskâ because of the militaryâs growing influence on the government, the Japanese government has claimed. A power shift between generals and politicians in Beijing is a âmatter of concernâ, according to an annual defence assessment in Tokyo. It highlighted how the Chinese Peopleâs Liberation Army had spoken out more frequently on foreign policy. Fear: There is concern across east Asia over China's growing military strength . And amid mounting unrest over the lack of political and social reform, the Communist government has been forced to tighten its vice-like grip on the population â a clampdown for which it relies on the Army. Chinaâs annual defence spending is said to have risen drastically, from Â£19billion in 2000 to Â£76billion in 2010. On present trends the defence spending of China, the worldâs most populous nation with 1.4billion inhabitants, could overtake Americaâs after 2035. The Japanese assessment, which will be studied carefully in Whitehall, said: âThe degree of military influence on foreign policy decisions has been changing. âThis situation calls for attention as a risk-management issue.â Tensions between Beijing and Tokyo surfaced again last month after Chinese vessels entered waters near disputed resource-rich isles in the East China Sea. The rise of China has prompted the US to focus military resources on the Pacific instead of Europe.China insisted its military modernisation was not aimed at any other nation and criticisedÂ  âirresponsible statementsâ by Japanese officials. The report comes as China's senior officers, intelligence agencies and maritime chiefs are increasingly outspoken in calling for Beijing to take a tougher line in regional territorial disputes. Such disputes include a long-simmering row with Japan in the East China Sea. Last year, Japan welcomed China's growing role on the world stage, while noting its increasingly aggressive moves, saying: 'China has responded to conflicting issues involving Japan and other neighbouring countries in a way that has been criticised as assertive, raising worries about its future direction.' Defence: Japan is set to allow U.S. Osprey helicopter/plane hybrid vehicles to be based in Okinawa . Just like a year ago, Tokyo also noted China's rapid military build-up, particularly that of its navy, pointing out that Beijing's defence budget has risen 30-fold in the past 24 years. Defence Minister Satoshi Morimoto said the sense of caution is shared by many countries in the region. He said: 'It is not that caution has been rising. But it is true that there exists a certain sense of caution not only in Japan but across East Asia regarding which way China is headed.' A Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman repeated the country's standard line that its military modernisation is both transparent and not aimed at any other country. But spokesman Geng Yansheng criticised 'irresponsible statements' by Japanese officials over the disputed islands in the East China Sea, called Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China, and said China would defend its rights. He declared: 'Protecting national sovereignty and maritime rights and interests is the common responsibility of all concerned departments, including the military, and we will closely coordinate with other departments in conscientiously discharging our responsibilities.' New concern: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un . Tensions with China have also risen in the South China Sea as Beijing becomes more assertive in its claim to the area. The stakes have risen in the region as the U.S. military has shifted its attention and resources back to Asia in the past year. In the white paper, Tokyo reaffirmed the importance of its alliance with the United States, saying: 'The presence of U.S. forces stationed in Japan functions as deterrent against regional contingencies, and it brings the sense of security to countries in the region.' The official reassurance comes against a backdrop of public protests against the planned deployment of U.S. Osprey military hybrid helicopter-planes to a U.S. base in Okinawa, because of concerns about their safety. And in its first defence white paper since Kim Jong-un took over the reins of power in North Korea, Japan said the aspiring nuclear power remained a major security threat. 'After the death of National Defence Commission Chairman Kim Jong-il, First Chairman Kim Jong-un frequently visited the military and referred to the importance of the military. Its stance of regarding the military as important and relying on it will likely be maintained,' it said.","Relations between Chinese military and political leaders 'complex'

After a marathon campaign the former principal oboist from the Welsh National Opera has proved he was unfairly sacked. Now judges at the Court of Appeal have urged the warring woodwind section of the company to return to harmony after they ruled that Murray 'Sandy' Johnston was unfairly dismissed. Talented Mr Johnston, 63, was sacked after 34 years in the ranks of the WNO on grounds that the sound of his instrument did not 'blend' with the rest of the orchestra. Clash: Murray Johnson (left) was unfairly dismissed, following long term difficulties with Carlo Rizzi (right) He was made to go through auditions to prove that his instrument was acceptable to the orchestra. But the musician claimed his career with WNO began to wane following a personality clash with former musical director, Carlo Rizzi. After long-term 'difficulties' in the . relationship between the oboeist and Mr Rizzi, Mr Johnston had satisfied . assessors, including the then music director, that his 'intonation' and . 'emission of sound' came up to scratch during auditions. Murray Johnston has finally proved he was unfairly dismissed . However, he continued to face . criticism of his perceived shortcomings in 'ensemble' situations and the . 'blending of sound' between his instrument and the orchestra. His dismissal came after the WNO said . that aspect of his playing could not be tested by audition with a . pianist to accompany him but only in 'full ensemble conditions'. Although the WNO purported to follow . the disciplinary procedure laid down in its handbook, it did not comply . with the operaâs agreement with the Musicians Union, which was designed . to protect musicians from 'too subjective an assessment' of their . artistic performance. The judge, sitting with Lords Justice . Moore-Bick and Sullivan, said it was 'inevitable' that it would be found . that the disciplinary procedure to which Mr Johnston was subjected for . his perceived artistic failings was 'procedurally unfair'. Lord Justice Kay said: 'To subject Mr . Johnston to the handbook disciplinary procedure, minus the requirements . of oral, written and final warnings, was procedurally unfair, even if . the concern was to save him from additional stress.' After today's decision the case will now return to an employment tribunal for the amount of compensation payable by the WNO to Mr Johnston to be assessed. However, after pointing to the massive cost of three previous contested hearing, Lord Justice Maurice Kay said: 'I hope that the parties will give active consideration to the possibility of a negotiated settlement, if necessary through mediation'. After ruling that the disciplinary procedure followed lacked the element of objectivity that would have made it fair, the judge concluded: 'It was not a reasonable response to the problem that had arisen... I consider that a finding of procedural unfairness is inevitable'.

Roving reporter: Jimmy Fallon tweeted this picture of himself outside Radio City in Manhatten . Jimmy Fallon recorded his show in an empty studio with no audience . The pair both used the situation for comedic value in their opening monologues, with Letterman kicking off: 'We're in the middle of Hurricane Sandy and we have no studio audience, but we do have quite a show for you tonight. Thank you for joining us in the Ed Sullivan Shelter.' Referring to the hurricane, which caused devastation up and down the East Coast, Letterman told his viewers: 'If I were home, I'd be boarding up your television sets, because this is the stuff that's gonna hurt somebody.'

He told the viewers: 'I'm hoping, if you're watching, you are at home, you're safe, you're warm...But we're here.' Continuing his monologue as he headed inside, the camera then panned around to show the audience-free studio. Earlier, Fallon messaged guests Padma Lakshmi, Seth Meyers and Imagine Dragons: 'Midtown NYC is empty, but we are still doing a live show! Might be a sleepover.'

A smiling Josef Kazzan, 9, who has died in a tragic accident in his garden in Cleckheaton, West Yorks . A nine-year-old boy died after he accidentally hanged himself on a play rope in his garden. It is thought Josef Kazzan â known as Joe â was climbing the rope tied to a large tree when he slipped and his neck became trapped in a loop at the bottom. Joeâs parents told yesterday how they found him caught in the rope and pulled him down to resuscitate him. Paramedics managed to restart his heart but he died in hospital two days later. His mother Rachel Cullen, 43, said the family has been left âbrokenâ by Joeâs death. They had been to church on the morning of Sunday, July 15, and were having lunch. But Joe wanted to play outside because of the good weather. Miss Cullen said: âJoe loved playing in the garden, but it had been raining for weeks, so as soon as the sun came out he was desperate to play outside.â The full-time mother of three, of Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, said she was looking after Joeâs brother Sam, five, when she went to check on him. âIâm the sort of mum whoâs always worrying about where my kids are, what theyâre doing,â she said. âI wondered where Joe had gone.

Extra staff have been hired, opening hours extended and the streets decked in Union Jacks â but the Olympic tourism boom has failed to materialise. Attractions, retailers, restaurants and theatres are reporting a disastrous drop in custom. Normally the summer holidays would see long queues outside sites such as the Tower of London, Madame Tussauds, the London Dungeon and the London Eye. Regent Street: Flags may be out for the Olympics but the normally bustling pavements of this prime shopping street were almost empty yesterday . This year, amid dire warnings of chaos on the Tube system and gridlock on the roads, the once busy streets seem more like a ghost town. The evidence of these pictures contradicts Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who this week dismissed complaints of a fall in trade as âabsolute nonsenseâ. In fact, he insisted: âI think anyone who has a business anywhere in London is frankly quids in.â Tourism industry leaders blame the Government and Transport for London for exaggerating the difficulties of getting around during the Olympics. A Government edict that civil servants would be allowed to work from home for weeks on end to escape the chaos that never arrived fuelled the sense of panic. In reality, the warnings have backfired, leaving many businesses seriously out of pocket and now forced to take emergency measures. West End stores, which had extended opening hours and taken on extra staff, have decided to fund a six-figure advertising campaign to woo shoppers back into London. Leading attractions are handing out leaflets to those visiting the Olympic park, and restaurants are running hundreds of discounts. Visitor numbers to the Tower of London are down by around 50 per cent compared to a year ago â a drop that is thought to have been mirrored across other attractions. On the rack: The queues have disappeared, and visitor numbers are down by 50 per cent . Attractions such as the Tower of London, above, are usually magnets for tourists at this time of year . A spokesman for Historic Royal Palaces, the independent charity which runs the Tower of London as well as Hampton Court, Kensington Palace, Kew Palace and the Banqueting House in Whitehall, said: âOverall the visitor figures across the palaces for the week ending July 29 are down 52 per cent on last year.â Restaurant takings in central London are down by an average of 40 per cent, while Theatreland has also suffered. Bosses at Merlin Entertainments, the worldâs second largest theme park company, which runs Madame Tussauds, the London Eye, the London Dungeon and the Sea Life centre in the Olympic sailing venue of Weymouth, have been bitterly disappointed by the fall in visitor numbers. It had extended the opening hours of the London Eye from 9pm until midnight, however the expected flood of people has not materialised. A spokesman said: âUndoubtedly the level of early Government warnings telling people to stay out of the capital and other Olympic locations like Weymouth have significantly impacted normal visitation patterns.â Merlin has introduced a two-for-one ticket offer on its leading London attractions to try to boost trade. Bare: An empty Westfield shopping centre at Shepherds Bush this week . The company was among businesses which took part in an emergency summit organised by London Mayor Boris Johnson where it was agreed that there would be a new public relations and marketing initiative designed to entice people to âcome backâ to London. Jon Copestake, a retail analyst from the Economist Intelligence Unit, said: âThere is no doubt that the Olympics, far from providing a boost to London retailers, are detracting from the traditional shopping hubs in the West End.â But he predicted that the impact of the new advertising campaign would be âmarginalâ, adding: âRetailers must hope that consumers drift back after realising that London is not as overcrowded as expected.â","Shops and tourist attractions hired extra staff in anticipation of bigger crowds .

Hasan Aydemir, 28, (pictured outside court earlier this week) was unhappy when sister Hatice decided to tie the knot without the family's blessing, a court heard . A Turk who tried to stop his sister marrying her jobless fiance by sending a fake bomb as a wedding present was jailed for four years yesterday. Hasan Aydemir, 28, was unhappy when his younger sister, student Hatice, decided to tie the knot with Menderes Atici without her familyâs blessing. Three days before the ceremony in Istanbul, he mocked up his bomb with a clock, electrical wiring and putty made to look like plastic explosives. He carefully wrapped the device in a presentation box and even neatly tied it with a red ribbon before posting it from a branch of UPS in Camden, north London. It was addressed to the wedding hall in the Gungoren area of Istanbul where his sister was due to be married three days later, and included instructions for it to be placed on the top table. Attached to the package was a piece of white paper bearing the words which translated into English as: 'Leave the package on the table of the bride and groom on 20/03/2011. The package is my gift to Hatice-Metin.' Aydemir, of Tottenham, north London, also phoned the reception hall to ensure that his instructions to take delivery of the parcel were carried out. The package, which had been listed as containing a teddy bear and a wrist watch, was intercepted by a customs official at Ataturk airport in Istanbul . Bomb disposal experts were called before the item was declared to be a hoax. Detectives from the Metropolitan Policeâs Counter Terrorism Command investigated the incident and identified the sender of the parcel as Aydemir. Although he had used false details on the forms, they were able to identify him through CCTV footage and phone records and officers arrested him at his home address on March 23 last year. Detectives seized a mobile phone during the search of the house, which contained text messages demonstrating his opposition to the marriage. Three days before the ceremony in Istanbul, Hasan Aydemir mocked up his bomb with a clock, electrical wiring and putty made to look like plastic explosives . Jurors heard that when Aydemir sent the parcel on March 17 last year, he was locked in a family dispute about his sisterâs wedding and hoped to disrupt the service by sending the hoax bomb. Jailing Aydemir at Blackfriars Crown Court, Judge Ian Karsten QC said: âIt's hard to think of a nastier or more horrid thing to do. âIt was because of your strong feelings about your sisterâs wedding that you concocted these extremely vindictive and cruel plans. âIt is a very serious case of bomb hoaxing as it took a very serious amount of planning. âI accept though that it came about from a misguided attempt to protect your sister.â The court heard Aydemirâs family were outraged at the prospect of Haticeâs nuptials. His brother-in-law Secki Kocack said: âMy wifeâs family were very displeased with Menderes as it is traditional to ask a girlâs family for permission to court her,â he said. âHe had not done this, he did not have a job and the family did not know him, so they were against Hatice travelling to Turkey to wed him. âShe was at university at the time and they thought that she had not thought through her decisions. âIt also brought shame on their family.â Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, senior national co-ordinator of counter terrorism, said: 'Hasan Aydemir had clearly gone to great lengths to make a realistic-looking hoax device, which was designed to deceive anyone seeing it into thinking that it was a bomb. 'His actions were extremely irresponsible and wasted valuable police resources both in Turkey and in London. 'We hope that the sentence will reinforce the message that the police investigate all incidents of hoaxes thoroughly and bring those responsible before the court.' Aydemir denied dispatching an article with intent. Blackfriars Crown Court heard that when it became clear the parcel was harmless, the couple were married .","Hasan Aydemir, 28, was unhappy when .

Tamara Jackson, 31, was convicted of several charges, including second-degree assault, for her part in the March 29, 2010 incident in suburban Washington, D.C. Her accomplice Tikia Anderson was also convicted of charges against her, including possession of a deadly weapon with intent to injure. She was the one who poured the powerful chemical on the two, and is currently serving an eight-year sentence. Scroll down for video .

Victims: Katrina Watts and her daughter, pictured in a handout family photo before the attack, both received bad chemical burns in the attack . Jackson was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Friday, after a jury found her guilty of conspiracy to commit first-degree assault in May. Prosecutors said that she was primarily motivated by jealousy, for the express reason that the woman, Katrina Watts, had recently began dating Jacksonâs ex-boyfriend. According to a Patch article from last year, Jackson and Anderson drove to Oxon Hill, Maryland and waited in a parking lot for the boyfriendâs new girlfriend to come home. When they saw Ms Watts approaching, Jackson took a bottle of the liquid Drano, opened it, and poured some of its contents into a cup, police said.

BBC's Panorama caught them attacking disabled patients, with shocking footage showing victims being slapped, kicked, sat on and drenched with water at Winterbourne View care home in Bristol. And now a year on from those disturbing revelations these workers have admitted cruelty charges, and will be sentenced later this year. Scroll down to see the shocking footage . Abusers: (Left to right) Kelvin Fore, Michael Ezenagu, Neil Ferguson, Sookalingun Appoo and Wayne Rogers. (Bottom left to right) Alison Dove, Charlotte Cotterell, Danny Brake, Graham Doyle, Holly Draper and Jason Gardiner. The final and now 11th former worker . arrested, Michael Ezenagu, 28, pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court . today to the ill treatment of patients. Wayne . Rogers, 31, Graham Doyle, 25, Allison Dove, 24, Jason Gardiner, . 42, Charlotte Cotterell, 21, Holly Draper, 22, all admitted similar . offences. While Kelvin Fore, 32, Sookalingun Appoo, 58, and Danny Brake, . 26, and Neil Ferguson, 28, have also previously admitted neglect. A five-week undercover investigation, screened last June, filmed abuse at the privately-owned, purpose-built, 24-bed facility, on the outskirts of Bristol. Following today's case Avon and Somerset Police released mugshots of the 11 defendants for the first time. Detective Chief Superintendent Louisa Rolfe said: 'I wish to acknowledge the support and patience of the victims and their families throughout our inquiry. Inquiry: Panorama filmed residents at Winterbourne View being assaulted and bullied. This poor woman was dragged across the floor . 'We were shocked by the Panorama programme as many people were. The voice of the victim has been central to our investigation into this case. 'The investigation has always been about the criminal actions of eleven individuals working at Winterbourne View. 'The 11 individuals abused the trust of victims and that of their relatives and friends. 'They have all pleaded guilty to criminal offences of ill treatment and neglect as detailed within the Mental Health Act. 'Had it not been for the actions of individuals who raised concerns about the neglect and cruelty suffered by the victims at Winterbourne View, this wholly unacceptable behaviour would have continued unchecked. 'We now await sentencing which will bring the criminal justice process to a final conclusion.' Police launched an inquiry after being shown footage of disabled adults being violated at Winterbourne View care home - run by Castlebeck Care. Disgusting: Staff played games with the patients, shown here placing one person under furniture with the other sat in the seat above . Whistle-blower Terry Bryan, a former senior nurse at Winterbourne, tipped off the BBC after his repeated approaches to authorities appeared to fall on deaf ears. Panorama journalist Joe Casey wore a secret camera to film apparent shocking scenes of abuse on patients by staff - who were meant to be looking after them. The reporter captured footage of some of the hospital's most vulnerable patients, who suffer from autism and learning difficulties, being repeatedly pinned down. Some were slapped and dragged into showers while fully clothed, others were taunted and teased. Horrific: This member of staff stamps on the patients hand in yet another shocking image from the now-closed home . Mr Casey told the BBC documentary: 'On a near-daily basis, I watched as some of the very people entrusted with the care of society's most vulnerable targeted patients - often, it seemed, for their own amusement. Brave: The abuse at Winterbourne was uncovered after this whistleblower spoke out . 'They are scenes of torment that are not easily forgotten.' Andrew McDonnell, a leading expert in working with adults with mental disabilities, labelled some of the examples captured on film 'torture'. Mr McDonnell, a clinical psychologist, said he was shocked by the treatment of vulnerable patients at the hands of those charged with their care. Castlebeck Care - which has 24 locations across the country - closed Winterbourne View on June 24, after transferring all patients to alternative services. The controversial care home was found to have 'systematically failed' to protect patients from abuse, a damning report ruled in July. Ann Redropp, head of the CPS Complex Case Team, said: 'Safety and security, and the ability to live free from fear and harassment, are fundamental human rights. 'The kind of offending that took place at Winterbourne View undermined these rights in an appalling and systematically brutal way. 'The CPS has treated these as Disability Hate Crimes, which we regard as particularly serious. 'Disability Hate Crimes are based on ignorance, prejudice and hate. 'Disabled people can be victims of crime due to their perceived vulnerability, particularly where there is an unequal relationship, such as where the perpetrator is the victim's carer. 'At Winterbourne View, people who should have been able to trust their carers had that trust cruelly and repeatedly abused.'

Jaycee Dugard, who is suing federal officials over her 18-year rape and kidnapping ordeal, has accused the government of tampering with the sole expert witness in her case. Miss Dugard claims that convicted rapist Phillip Garrido should have had his parole revoked by the Department of Justice before he abducted her. Garrido and his wife snatched 11-year-old Jaycee . from a street in South Lake Tahoe in June 1991 while on her way to . school. She was held captive in a compound behind their Antioch house where Garrido repeatedly . raped and drugged the girl. During her captivity, Dugard gave birth to . two daughters fathered by Garrido. Vulnerable: Jaycee Dugard, now 32, is suing the federal government over failures to check up on convicted rapist Phillip Garrido who snatched her while he was out on bail in 1991 . Dugard's lawsuit . claims that federal agents failed to meet with Garrido as frequently as . required and to properly report his frequent . marijuana use. He was on parole after serving 11 years of a 50-year sentence when she was kidnapped. A verdict in Dugard's favor in the federal compensation suit would leave a jury to determine the amount of damages. In court papers filed on Monday, Dugard's lawyers complained the Department of Justice fouled up their case by contacting their sole expert witness. Attorney Dale Kinsella said his legal team spent more than 50 hours . over three months working with Carol Getty, who was prepared to testify . on Miss Dugard's behalf. Getty served as chair of the U.S. Parole Commission . from 1991 to 1992. Mr Kinsella alleged that government lawyers called Getty on August 1 and told her that . it was improper to serve as an expert witness because she served on the . commission during the some of the time in question. Failed by the system: Jaycee Dugard was 11 when she was kidnapped by a convicted rapist who was out on bail in California . Later that same day, Ms Getty told Dugard's lawyers she wanted nothing more to do with the case. Mr Kinsella said that 'it comes . as no surprise that her name appears on a commission document during . that time period' but that there is no evidence that she was directly . involved in Garrido's case. He added: 'In fact, one of the main . claims of the lawsuit is that agents failed to report Garrido's . marijuana use to the commission so it could decide whether to revocate . his parole.' Miss Dugard's lawyer argued that the government's strong-arm tactics was part of a plan to prevent an . expert witness which would bolster the kidnap victim's case. Mr Kinsella says that DOJ has told . him it intends to seek a judicial order barring Dugard's legal team from . hiring any former government workers to serve as expert witnesses. He added that such an order would be 'dire' for Dugard's case because there are no other experts available. Locked up: Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy are serving 431 years and . 36 years respectively for abducting Jaycee and hiding her in the . backyard of their home. Jaycee had two children by Phillip Garrido . Held: Garrido, a registered sex offender, kept Jaycee Dugard at his Antioch home, pictured, for 18 years . Justice Department officials were unavailable for comment. A hearing has been scheduled for September 10. Miss Dugard, now 32, and her two children have received a $20 million settlement from state of California. Jaycee was rescued in 2009, when two . female police officers became suspicious of Garrido, a convicted rapist, . and summoned the family - including Jaycee's two daughters - to a . parole meeting. Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to . life for the kidnap and rape of Miss Dugard. His wife Nancy was . sentenced to 36 years to life.","Miss Dugard holds federal parole board responsible for failing to properly check up on convicted rapist Phillip Garrido .

"PUBLISHED: . 03:02 EST, 11 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 11 August 2012 . Jailed: Jordan Flattery went on the run after stabbing a father of two to death at a house party . A teenager who stabbed a disabled man to death following a row at a party has been jailed for 10 years for manslaughter. Jordan Flattery, 19, knifed Graham Snowden, a father of two who was partially blind and had mobility problems after being seriously injured in a car crash. The killing happened while the pair were at a house party in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, in January. Mr Snowden, 36, had tried to get up from a sofa but was pushed back by Flattery. The two men were asked to leave the house, but Flattery stabbed Mr Snowden as they were in the hallway. Flattery was arrested two days later after going on the run. Flattery, of Hitchin, was sentenced yesterday after being convicted last month. He had been charged with murder, but a jury found him guilty of manslaughter after a trial at Croydon Crown Court. After the sentencing hearing, Mr Snowden's family said in a statement that their 'world ended' when he 'had his life cruelly taken from him'. They said: 'The court has sentenced Jordan Flattery to 10 years in custody after he was found guilty of the manslaughter of Graham, but it is us, Graham's family, who continue to serve a life sentence, as no sentence passed today can ever bring him back. 'Graham was a fighter, he survived a horrific car accident eight years ago which sadly took the life of his friend and colleague, and left Graham fighting for his own. 'He sustained life changing injuries in the collision which left him with limited sight and mobility problems. 'Cruelly taken': Relatives of manslaughter victim Graham Snowden said he so much to live for . 'He fought for an hour to stay alive the night he suffered that fatal stab wound inflicted on him by Jordan Flattery and we know he did not want to leave this world as he had so much to live for.' Detective Inspector Neil Langford, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'Firstly, our thoughts remain with the family of Graham Snowden who have shown incredible bravery throughout this process. 'Our thoughts remain with them through what continues to be an extremely difficult time for them. 'The actions of Jordan Flattery on January 8th were cowardly - he took a man's life and then fled from the scene. 'He deliberately carried a knife on him prior to this incident and this should act as a warning to those who commit such an offence, that you will be caught and dealt with. 'The sentence passed on him cannot bring Graham back but I hope it offers some closure to his family, who continue to live with the legacy the actions of Flattery have left behind from that night.'","Jordan Flattery, 19, went on the run after stabbing father-of-two Graham Snowden in a house in Hitchin, Hertfordshire .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 18:17 EST, 12 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:52 EST, 12 August 2012 . The live-in boyfriend of an Indiana mom who disappeared last year has been charged with her murder even though the womanâs body has never been found. The alarm was only raised about Kelly Armstrong, 28, when her sister conducted her own search after not having heard from her in weeks. Armstrongâs boyfriend and father of her child, Travis Funke, now 34, eventually confessed to police that he killed Armstrong by hitting her in the head with a hammer but he thought it was all a dream. Missing: Though Kelly Armstrong's boyfriend admitted that he killed her, no physical evidence has ever been found except from some blood stains on the carpeting of the Indiana trailer the couple shared . The case against Funke has been complicated as police have been reluctant to follow up due to a lack of hard evidence- and diminishing resources. The latest change has been an upgrade in Funkeâs charge, as he originally faced a voluntary manslaughter charge but now heads to court with a full murder charge. Adding to the problematic twists in the case is the well-being of Armstrong and Funkeâs child, who has been in care of Armstrongâs family since Funke was arrested for an unrelated crime in late September of last year. Armstrongâs sister Shelly Rush travelled to Armstrongâs home in Kokomo, Indiana in August 2011 after she hadnât heard from her sister in an unusually long amount of time. On top of that, Armstrongâs boyfriend Funke was giving Rush unclear answers, continuing to say that when Rush called, Armstrong had just stepped out of the house, or was unavailable to speak, and he never knew when she would be back. Charged: Now Travis Funke, 34, is charged with Kelly Anderson's murder, months after he admitted to hitting her repeatedly with a hammer though he initially thought it was only a dream . Though she alerted Kokomo police that she was concerned about her sisterâs welfare during that August trip, no real breaks in the case came until September 28, 2011 when police responded to the home where Armstrong and Funke lived. At the time, Funke was wearing an . ankle monitoring bracelet for criminal activity that has yet to be . released, and police arrived at the home because the bracelet had been . cut off. Funke was taken into police custody, charged with attempted . escape, and sent to the Howard County jail. The Kokomo Tribune reports that in October, Funke told a fellow inmate that he tried to kill Armstrong. That . tip prompted a search warrant of the trailer that Armstrong and Funke . shared and police found blood stains on the carpet and bedroom that . matched that of Armstrong. For . some unknown reason, police only interviewed Funke directly in January, . and that was the first time that he confessed to killing Armstrong . directly to authorities. The . affidavit states that Funke told police that âhe and Kelly had been . fighting for three daysâ leading up to her reported death around July 1, . 2011. WISH TV reports that the fight was over prescription pills. âFunke . stated that he fell asleep on the couch and he awoke to Kelly hitting . the couch with a hammer. Funke stated that he believes that Kelly hit . him on the head with the hammer and knocked him out. âFunke . stated that, when he came to, Kelly was dead on the floor and bleeding . from the head. Funke said that he has memories of hitting her in the . head with a hammer but thought that it was a dream.â The Huffington Post . reports that he told police that he put a plastic bag over her head, . wrapped her body in a tarp, and put it in a garbage container that was . picked up later that day. Trouble: The two-year-old child shared by Anderson and Funke was used as a part of a now-revoked plea deal that police had offered Funke in exchange for more clues about Anderson's body . During the interrogation process, Funke directed police to a local landfill and after the spent six days looking through 6,000 tons of trash, they still found no clues relating to the case. Because the body has never been found, Funke was originally charged with voluntary manslaughter. Another aspect of the case has been the coupleâs son, and Funke tried to bargain with prosecutors over releasing further details about the murder in order to secure custody of the 2-year-old child. After learning of the prospect that the child may go back into the care of the accused murderer, Armstrongâs family were predictably upset and petitioned the courts for the plea deal to be taken off the table. The next formal verdicts in the case will come when it goes to a jury trial on August 21, but until then the fight between the Armstrong family and the local police will likely continue to play out, as they blame Howard County Prosecutor Mark McCann with failing to properly inform the Armstrongs about the details of the plea deal. âThis case is so screwed up,â Kellyâs father David Armstrong told the Kokomo Tribune. âSomething needs to be done.â","Kelly Anderson, 28, went missing in August 2011 from her trailer home in Kokomo, Indiana .

It was once a grand 18th century canal - the hub of a thriving salt trade which brought wealth to the townsfolk of Droitwich in Worcestershire. But by 1939, unable to compete with the rise of railways, it lay abandoned and gradually became overgrown and silted up. Now, a team of volunteers who restored the waterway after removing 300,000 tons of mud have won an English Heritage Angels award for their efforts. From silted-up sorrow... Droitwich Canal, once a bustling 18th century waterway trading in salt, lay in ruin since 1939. Pictured above is one of its twisted and broken locks . ... now restored to glory . During a 38-year project, a team of volunteers restored the waterway after removing 300,000 tons of mud. Campaigner Max Sinclair received an English Heritage Angels award in honour of their achievement . The annual competition celebrates . the work of local people striving to save England's heritage and is sponsored by . Andrew Lloyd Webber. Max Sinclair, who began a campaign to restore the Droitwich Canals in 1963, was presented with the prize for Best Rescue of a Historic Industrial Building or Site at the Palace Theatre in London yesterday. This year's judging panel included Melvyn Bragg and historian Bettany Hughes, the Daily Telegraph reported. The Droitwich Barge Canal opened in 1771, linking Droitwich Spa to the River Severn. In 1854, the Droitwich Junction Canal - a narrow waterway linking to the Worcester and Birmingham CanalÂ  - was opened. The Barge section was initially a commercial success. 1771: Barge Canal section of Droitwich waterway opens. 1854: Second section, Junction Canal opens. 1939: Decline in economic viability leads to canals' abandonment. 1963: Max Sinclair begins his restoration campaign . 1973: Droitwich Canals Trust established; volunteer work begins . 2000: Three locks on Junction Canal completed . By 2011: Droitwich Canals finally reopen . However, by 1830, business began to decline when a source of brine was found at Stoke Prior, to the north-east of Droitwich. Much of the salt was transported more economically overland towards the north. In 1973, Mr Sinclair's lobbying led to the creation of the Droitwich Canals Trust. Since then, thousands of volunteers from the trust have undertaken management of the channel and towpath and raised funds for the restoration. In 2000, the first three locks on the Junction Canal were fully completed. Further funding, including Â£12.7million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, saw the restoration of nine broad locks, the building of a new bridge, just over half a mile of new canal and four new locks. In addition, five miles of canal were dredged, and a 5.5 hectare reed bed was made. Finally, after 38 years of restoration, the Droitwich Canals were opened in July 2011. The canals form part of a navigable 27-mile ring passing through Worcester and Droitwich. More than 3,000 boats have used the canal and there has been a 30 per cent increase in towpath users and 50 per cent in visitors to the local tourist information centre. It is predicted that the fruits of the restoration scheme will attract a further 330,000 visitors to the area within five years. Speaking in 2003, James Thompson, . British Waterways' Droitwich then project manager, said: 'This is one of . our flagship restoration projects, demonstrating the active role that . canals can play in helping boost the local economy and regenerate . surrounding areas. 'This . scheme will make Droitwich the fifth most visited tourist attraction in . Worcestershire, helping to place the town at the forefront of the . region's growing tourist economy.'

He has been dubbed Britain's 'invisible man' after seemingly severing contact with his coach and the outside world. But despite concerns about his fitness, gold medal hopeful Phillips Idowu says he is ready and raring to go ahead of this week's Olympic triple jump. Ever since the 33-year-old failed to join Team GB at a training camp in Portugal last month, there have been concerns over whether he would appear at the Games. Last week, Britain's head coach Charles van Commenee even accused the star of 'turning his back' on his trainer. And he has not been seen in the Olympic village with the other competitors. But the silver medalist at the Beijing Olympics has been tracked down to a north London sports centre where has been training. Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said: 'I've been training every day. The game is around the corner. I can't afford to not train.' Idowu has not competed since June after picking up a foot injury in America. The London-born star also released a full statement on Twitter yesterday, insisting he had not disappeared. He said: 'I'm in London where I have been for the last few wks (sic), finalising my prep and receiving therapy, My coach knew about this and it has not been a secret. 'I have to give notification of my whereabouts everyday for doping purposes, so impossible to completely disappear. 'The appropriate people can contact me with ease. There is no story here at all. 'I've only heard about the hysteria about my whereabouts today as I've been on a media lockdown, I'm into the village on Sunday as was planned months ago.' Worries: Ever since the 33-year-old failed to join Team GB at a training camp in Portugal last month, there have been concerns over whether he would appear at the Games . Despite insisting that he has been working with his coaching team, according to The Sunday Times there was no sign of his trainer Aston Moore as he trained at New River Sports Centre in Wood Green. The triple-jumper will no doubt be keen to follow on with the already astonishing success of Team GB. Britain's best Olympic day in a century took place yesterday with Team GB triumphing in six separate events at London 2012. It started with the men's coxless four team and women's lightweight double sculls, who topped the podium in front of an ecstatic Eton Dorney crowd early in the day.

Felix Sanchez, who had just won gold in the Olympic 400m hurdles for the second time, sobbed throughout his country's national anthem, unable to restrain the flow of tears. But this was not just an athlete overcome with joy at the fulfillment of an Olympic dream - it was the end of a tough four-year journey that began the day he failed to even make the final at Beijing. There his hopes of defending the title he had won in Athens took a massive blow when news of the death of his grandmother reached him on the day of his heat. Overcome: The hurdler struggled to control his tears as his national anthem played after he was awarded the gold medal . 'I got news on the morning of the first round in Beijing that she had died,' he explained. 'That affected me. I cried the whole . day. 'I ran but I ran badly and I made a promise that day that I would . win a medal for her. It took me four years.' And he did it in style, winning the race in 47.63 seconds - the exact same time he ran when taking the title in Athens eight years ago. And as light rain fell last night as he waited to receive his second Olympic gold, Sanchez said he had felt his grandmother Lillian was there with him in the stadium. 'It started to rain. It made me feel like she was crying tears of joy with me,' Sanchez, little over three weeks away from his 35th birthday, told a news conference. 'I've been emotional all week, thinking about her, thinking if I could win.' A giant screen at the stadium displays a picture of Felix Sanchez in tears as the Olympic Flame burns . The occasion all got too much for Sanchez as he was awarded his medal, eight years after taking the gold in Athens . Emotional: Gold medallist Felix Sanchez sobbed uncontrollably after winning the 400 metres hurdles . Sanchez had pinned a picture of his grandmother behind his race bib and ran with her name on his spikes. 'We got here and I pinned her picture under my bib so she could run close to my heart. I wrote her name - at least what I called her in Spanish - on my spikes. 'Just as a motivator and just as a reminder of how special she was to and how much this Games meant to me being how old I was.' Unsurprisingly his blubbing performance on the podium did not go unnoticed on Twitter. Sally . Bercow, wife of the Commons Speaker John Bercow, tweeted: 'Loved Felix . Sanchez sobbing as he got Gold. Stiff upper lip over-rated. It means a . lot to him & he's not ashamed to show it :)' British . rowing hero Matthew Pinsent, who won gold at four Olympics, posted: . 'One chance, one day. Totally life changing if you do it once never mind . twice. Well done Felix Sanchez.'Sanchez's . tears reminded viewers of some of Britain's very own Olympic champions, . whose reactions to clinching gold earlier this week won fans' hearts. Since 2004, Sanchez - who had dominated the event in the three years up to Athens - has had his career hit by injury. But he said he never lost hope of being the best again. 'I've had a lot of setbacks in the last eight years. I really wondered if I could come back. 'But I was dominant for so long. When you are so dominant you have a sense of confidence,' he said. History joy: There were no tears when Sanchez won gold in Athens in 2004 .

Buying a whole chicken at the supermarket or ordering a bucket of wings at your local fast food eatery may soon cost more than just a few months ago, and all due to the devastating drought that has wiped out one-sixth of the country's corn crop in the Midwest. Corn makes up 70 per cent of chicken feed. Since the beginning of June, price on corn has gone up 40 per cent, forcing poultry producers to spend more money on each chicken they grow. âWe have no choice but to pass it on to the consumer,â Ron Joyce, a high-end chicken farmer from North Carolina, told NBC. âWe have to raise out prices or not produce the birds.â Costly livestock: Poultry farmers have been spending 40 per cent more to feed each chicken they grow . The U.S. Department of Agriculture . estimates that prices at the grocery store will jump next year by 4-5 . per cent for beef,Â  3.5-4.5 per cent for chicken and turkey and 3.5- 4.5 . per cent for dairy products, including milk, cheese and eggs. The poultry giant Purdue is now considering cutting the amount of corn in its feed to 55 per cent, which could result in underfed, low-weight animals. North Carolina, the nationâs second biggest poultry producer, has long been considered a bellwether for the livestock farming industry. âAs goes North Carolina livestock production meat prices, so go national meat prices,â said Kelly Zering, an associate professor and extension specialist at North Carolina State University. Seeking alternatives: Corn makes up 70 per cent of chicken feed, but now poultry producers are considering partially substituting the pricey commodity . More than 65 per cent of North Carolinaâs agricultural income comes from livestock, and local growers import more than two-thirds of the corn, wheat and soybeans they use to feed their animals, according to the News & Observer. While feed prices have been on the rise for the past decade, this year they have reached an unprecedented benchmark of $8-$9 for a bushel of corn. While feed prices have gone up threefold or more, the price farmers get for meat has not evenÂ  doubled, forcing some growers to cull their herds or get in debt to stay in business. But North Carolina is not the only poultry-producing state whose corn crops have taken a serious hit this year, sending prices through the roof. Skyrocketing cost: This year, corn prices have reached $8-$9 for a bushel, up from $3 or $4 . Nearly 80 per cent of Georgia is under conditions that are at least abnormally dry, according to the National Drought Mitigation Centerâs U.S. Drought Monitor cited by the Henry Daily Herald. The most recent drought report revealed more than 24 per cent of the state is experiencing exceptional drought conditions - the highest measure of drought reported by the center. As a result, Mary Kathryn Yearta, public affairs director with the Georgia Department of Agriculture, confirmed to the Herlad that that poultry prices could begin rising in the fall by as much as 3 per cent. Devastating drought: Aleast 1,369 counties across 31 states declared disaster areas by the U.S. Department of Agriculture . The hottest July in U.S. history has caused irreparable damage to crops, forcing corn farmers to abandon fields greater in area than Belgium and Luxembourg. At least 1,369 counties across 31 states declared disaster areas by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Soybeans, which are used for animal feed and to make vegetable oil, have also been affected, with this harvest likely to be the worst for five years. The crisis has prompted the US . Department of Agriculture (USDA) to forecast record-breaking price . rises, and some of the world's largest food manufacturers, including . Kraft, Tyson and Nestle, have already indicated that they will pass on . the increase to consumers. Damaged: The worst drought for half a century in the U.S. has destroyed one-sixth of the country's expected corn crop . USDA now expects 10.8billion bushels of corn to be produced this year - 2.2billion bushels less than the projection it made last month. USDA chief economist Joseph Glauber told the Financial Times: 'We're going to see very high prices.' The problem could have far-reaching consequences internationally. In 2007-08, high food costs led to . riots in more than 30 countries, but Jose Graziano da Silva, the . director general of the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization, said the . current crisis was not as severe. 'We do not have the demand pressure from China and India as five years ago.' Poor corn: The US Department of Agriculture has significantly reduced its forecasts for crop harvests . The situation has worsened since the week ending July 29, when USDA found that 48 per cent of the nation's corn crop was either poor or very poor. The department said 47 per cent of the soybean crop was in very poor or poor . condition. They were the worst ratings since the drought of 1988, which cut production by . 20 per cent and cost the economy tens of billions of dollars. With grazing pastures also parched and feed prices at record highs, . many ranchers are sending their animals to slaughter early because it is . too costly to keep them until full size. Help for farmers: The US Agriculture Department has unveiled new help for frustrated, cash-strapped farmers and crop insurers have agreed to provide farmers with a 30 day grace period on premiums . Crisis: Disaster areas have been declared in 31 U.S. states after the worst drought for decades . President Barack Obama's . administration has opened up protected US land to help farmers and . ranchers and has encouraged crop insurance companies to forgo charging . interest. It has also provided emergency . low-interest loans to farmers in 31 states, where disaster areas have been declared due to the drought.","The USDA estimates that prices will jump next year by 3.5-4.5 per cent for chicken and turkey .

Surrounded by tales of fire-breathing dragons and white-bearded wizards, Tintagel Castle was perhaps the most appropriate place to spot a real-life gargoyle. Or at least that's what Angela Smith thought she saw, when a sinister face appeared from the undergrowth, close to the legendary birthplace of King Arthur in Cornwall. But the dog walker from Poole, Dorset, heaved a sigh of relief when she realised it was just the remains of a moss-covered tree stump, albeit one with a menacing 'face' and 'wing'. Moss monster: Angela Smith spotted the tree stump peering out of undergrowth close to Tintagel Castle, Cornwall . Describing it as a cross between Harry Potter's nemesis Lord Voldemort and a flying monkey from The Wizard of Oz, the alarmed holidaymaker said: . 'When I first saw the tree stump I did a . double take, as it gave me such a shock. 'Its ugly, angry face reminded . me exactly of the gargoyles you see on top of old buildings in gothic . films. 'I love nature and also architecture, so . I am always looking at the world around me, including the shapes and colours of . plants and trees, as well as the designs on the exteriors of buildings. 'But I certainly didn't expect to see something like this!' Popular with tourists, Tintagel Castle stands upon a dramatic setting on the north Cornwall coast and has been linked to the legends of King Arthur since the 12th Century. Strange resemblance: The 'face' on the stump has been likened to Lord Voldermort and an evil flying monkey from the Wizard of Oz . Tintagel . Castle is a medieval fortification located . on the peninsula of Tintagel Island, close to the village of Tintagel . in Cornwall, England. The castle has a long association with the Arthurian legends, going back to the 12th century. In the Historia Regum Britanniae, a fictional account of British history written by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Tintagel is described as the place where Arthur was conceived. According to the tale, Arthur's father, King Uther Pendragon, was disguised by Merlin's sorcery to look like Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall and the husband of Ygerna, Arthur's mother. The book was extremely popular and other Arthurian tales were produced in the late medieval period which claimed the king was actually born at Tintagel. Merlin the magician was also said to live below the castle in a cave. Legendary: Tintagel Castle in Cornwall has strong links with the legend of King Arthur . In his Idylls of the King, Lord Alfred Tennyson also refers to the links between Tintagel and Arthur. Despite these literary connections, no archaeologist has been able to find proof at the site that King Arthur existed or that the castle was linked to the legendary king. The archaeologist C A Ralegh Radford declared in 1935 that: 'No evidence whatsoever has been found to support the legendary connection of the Castle with King Arthur'. Many historians believe King Arthur was a completely mythical character, but others disagree, saying he may be based upon a British leader in the fifth century. In the . 13th century, during the later medieval period, a castle was built on the site by . Richard, Earl of Cornwall, which later fell into disrepair and ruin. Archaeologists in the 19th Century took interest in the site as it became a tourist attraction, with visitors coming to see the ruins of Richard's castle. Excavations in 1998 unearthed pottery from the 5th and 6th centuries at Tintagel Castle. Today Tintagel Castle is a popular tourist destination managed by English Heritage.","Dog walker 'shocked' when she discovered gargoyle-like tree stump .

Endurance athlete Diana Nyad launched another bid on Saturday to set an open-water record by swimming 103 miles (166 kilometers) from Havana to the Florida Keys without a protective shark cage. Under a blazing afternoon sun at the Hemingway Marina in the Cuban capital, Nyad adjusted her cap and goggles, pointed to the open water, blew a bugle and cried: 'Adios amigos! Courage!' Then she leaped in feet first and stroked out toward her supportboat. Less than a week before she turns . 63-years-old, the Los Angeles woman is attempting a feat that even the . fittest of human beings would find daunting. It's a dream that has taken . three years of marathon open-water training swims and seen multiple . aborted attempts at the crossing. Scroll down for video . Adios: U.S. swimmer Diana Nyad jumps into the water in Havana, Cuba on Saturday in a bid to set an open-water record by swimming from Havana to the Florida Keys without a protective shark cage . Splashing start: The 62-year-old endurance athlete has tried three times to swim the route, once with a protective cage and twice without . In the summer of 2010, unfavorable . weather kept her from even setting out. Last year, first a debilitating . asthma attack and then painful, dangerous stings from box jellyfish . forced her from the water on two separate attempts. This . time Nyad is banking on a custom-made swimsuit to protect her from the . jellyfish. It covers her head-to-toe with a pantyhose face and holes . only for the eyes, nose and mouth. It's . non-buoyant but still creates drag in the water, so she hopes to don it . only at night when jellyfish are more likely to rise to the surface. 'You have to learn from your mistakes. You don't do it the first time,' Nyad said at a news conference, deeply . tanned with goggle-rings around her eyes. 'We need some luck, but we do . feel like we've solved all the problems.' Team Nyad: Supporters gather around Diana Nyad as she prepares for her 103 mile swim . On her second try last summer to swim without a cage, her third total attempt, Nyad . lasted 41 hours before calling it quits. She estimated it will take at . least 60 hours to complete the swim to the Keys, and said the Straits of . Florida were forecast to remain calm in the coming days. Go-time . had been planned for Sunday around dawn, but shifting weather forecasts . prompted a last-minute change. The water north of Havana was slightly . choppy on Saturday, but expected to quiet down. 'This . isn't perfect. You can go out and see some little whitecaps,' Nyad . said. 'But I feel strong in the beginning, so why not get a few hours . out and tonight it's going to calm.' Hoping: Diana Nyad last attempted the Cuba-Florida swim in 2011, she lasted 41 hours before calling it quits . A member of Nyad's team posted a message on her blog late Saturday saying one of her shark divers received a painful jellyfish sting, but said nothing about the swimmer herself being stung. An online tracker hosted on Nyad's website showed her charting an initial course west-northwest from Havana, presumably with the goal of entering into the Gulf Stream current at a favorable point. An on board navigator constantly checks conditions and re-calibrates her bearings every 15 minutes, Nyad said earlier. 'Instead of staying on the couch for a lifetime... be fiercely bold, and go out and chase your dreams' In June, Australian endurance swimmer . Penny Palfrey made it 79 miles of the way before throwing in the towel . in the face of strong currents. A fiercely driven competitor, Nyad acknowledged it was hard to watch Palfrey come close to snatching away her long-held goal. 'If . she had succeeded I would have congratulated her, because I know how . difficult it is, more than anybody. And after all, this is not my . ocean,' Nyad said. 'But it is my dream... Frankly - how can I lie? - I'm . glad that I still have the chance to be first.' Nyad first tried to cross the Straits of Florida in 1978 as a 28-year-old, but fell short. Live the dream: Diana Nyad, resting before beginning her arduous swim, says she has to chase her dream . For . that attempt Nyad swam inside a steel cage, which she said not only . protects from sharks and softens the waves but even creates a current . that propels a swimmer forward. On . her third bid at a cageless swim, a 50-person support team including . navigators, weather gurus and a shark handler from Australia were . accompanying Nyad on five vessels. She planned to take short, periodic . breaks for rest and nourishment. Support: A 50-person support team, including navigators, weather gurus and a shark handler, will accompany Diana Nyad on five vessels. She plans to take short, periodic breaks for rest and nourishment . In lieu of a cage, a kayaker will paddle . alongside dangling an apparatus in the water that creates an electrical . field designed to repel sharks. A team of shark handlers will carefully . scan the surrounding waters from the roof of her main support boat, . ready to dive in and gently nudge away any predators that make it . through the shield. Nyad confessed to sleeping poorly the . night before and to feeling nerves, in addition to confidence, as she . set out: 'My heart is going to beat fast because this is history in . front of me.' After falling short in the past she has vowed not to try again, but each time the siren call of the Straits proved too great. Asked . whether she would make another attempt if the weather, currents and . marine life all cooperate but she is physically not up to the task, Nyad . did not categorically rule out a fourth try. But she suggested that even she has a limit. So long: U.S. swimmer Diana Nyad sets out from the Ernest Hemingway Nautical Club in Havana on her way to Florida . 'Sitting here, I can't address that,' Nyad said. 'I have to say, it's too much. I've asked too many people to put in too much. We know what we're doing. This has to be it. It just has to be.' Nyad set a world mark for open-water swimming without a wetsuit in 1979 by crossing 102 miles from the Bahamas to Florida. A writer, journalist and motivational speaker, she said she hopes to inspire people of all ages to live active lives. 'Instead of staying on the couch for a lifetime and letting this precious time go by, why not be bold?' she said. 'Be fiercely bold, and go out and chase your dreams.'","Diana Nyad hopes to set a record by swimming the Florida strait without any protection from sharks .

Undead?: Pub landlord John Teagle, who was accused of being a vampire at his wife Elsa's village . A pub landlord accused of being a vampire by superstitious villagers in the Philippines  has finally won a battle to clear his name. For the last five years John Teagle, the landlord of the Walmer Castle Pub in Margate, Kent, has been viewed with suspicion by the residents of Argawanon, on Cebu Island in the Philippines. Werina Onpoc, the aunt of his wife Elsa, who was born on the island, spread the vicious rumour after he refused to lend her cash in 2007. The 68-year-old dad-of-three, who married Elsa after meeting her 23 years ago through a lonely hearts ad, was shunned after the aunt told local radio that he was a âdescendant of Draculaâ and drank . the blood of children. The aunt even told villagers that scars on Mr Teagleâs body - caused by operations to treat colon cancer - were wounds he suffered as he bolted from police hunting him for being one of the undead. Mr Teagle, who owns a holiday home on the island and regularly visits, said: 'It made me laugh at first - then I realised how serious it was.' Now his ordeal is over after Argawanon's Barrio Capitan - a kind of councillor - stepped in after the radio broadcast inflamed the situation. He interrogated the aunt and others who had made the claims against Mr Teagle at a 500-strong âcouncil meetingâ on the island. The chief reprimanded those responsible for the vampire rumours and ordered them to stop. Mr Teagle said he was âvery relievedâ, but fears that some villagers still have a sneaking suspicion that he is a supernatural creature of the night. He told the Thanet Times: 'They were severely reprimanded but it still left a very bad taste. 'The deed was done. Itâs gone away a lot now, but itâs not dead.' Elsa Teagle said that villagers in the Philippines . thought he was coming over from the UK to 'suck their blood' and take it back to the UK to sell to other vampires. The 49-year-old schoolteacher has three children with John including 22-year-old John Jnr, who helps run the pub, 21-year-old university student Oriana and schoolgirl Asia, 16.

Bloodsucker: Left, Christopher Lee as Dracula and right, the Philippine island of Cebu . Cebu, situated in the middle of the islands, is the most densely populated of the Philippines . It is just 250 km from north to south and 45 km across at its widest point . Its eastern coastline is popular hub for divers and the island's largest city, Cebu City, has an international port . Filipinos are known for being superstitious and the existence of Aswang, vampire-like creatures, is a centuries-long legend throughout the islands . While many use it as a story to tell children, some adorn their homes with garlic bulbs to keep them away . Mysteries, including kidnapped children, and tragedies such as miscarriages, are blamed on Aswang by the superstitious . She said: 'Many of my family - . including my mum and dad - still live on the island and it has been very . difficult for the last five years after John was accused of being a . vampire. 'Some people are very ignorant and when my aunt watched a vampire film on TV five years ago she thought it made everything true.

'It is very difficult for everyone, but the village is very superstitious and the rumours will take a long time to go away.' Last week Mr Teagle and Elsa were . visited by Father Ely Suico of St Vincentâs Parish in Bogo City, who had . defended them during the uproar in Argawanon. Father Suico said: 'In the Philippines there are still a lot of superstitious beliefs and lots of fears about things which cannot be seen. 'Especially now there have been films which have shown vampires, they really believe these must be true.

A baby who died following an outbreak of a killer superbug at a . hospital neo-natal unit has been named as Oliver Hannon. Oliver, who was born prematurely, and 12 other newborns in the baby intensive care unit at . Southmead Hospital in Bristol, had been infected after an outbreak of . the water-borne bacteria pseudomonas, it was revealed last night. Traces of the superbug - linked to a series of baby deaths across the UK - were found in the water system. His devastated mother Jenna Hannon has now spoken of the heartbreaking moment her son passed away in her arms at the hospital in August. Jenna and Andrew Hannon, both 24, whose son Oliver died from the hospital superbug pseudomonas while in the neo-natal intensive care unit at Southmead Hospital in Bristol . Ms Hannon and her husband Andrew's tiny son was born at just 24 weeks but was making good progress at the neo-natal intensive care unit. He died just hours after doctors told his parents he was doing 'fantastically'. The mother-of-two told how she raced back to the unit and arrived just in time to cradle her week-old son as he died. She is now taking legal action against the hospital, which has admitted the bug contributed his death and put in new measures to prevent another outbreak. Eight of the other babies infected have since been discharged home; one has had treatment for a minor infection; and three with the bacteria on their skin remain in the unit in isolation. Hospital officials said Oliver died in August and 12 others tested positive for the bacteria . Ms Hannon said: 'We weren't expecting it when he died. We were told he was doing really well. 'Then all of a sudden he went downhill. The doctors told me there was nothing more they could do and I just held him until he died in my arms. 'A doctor rang us up after he died and told us that he would still be here if he had not got the infection, and they didn't expect it at all. 'It has been a major shock - I am heartbroken.' Ms Hannon was rushed to Southmead Hospital on August 17 after she experienced labour pains just 24 weeks into her pregnancy. Baby Oliver was safely delivered by caesarean section and immediately taken to the neo-natal intensive care unit. He responded well to treatment and plans were made to transfer him to the Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton, close to the couple's home in Tidworth, Wiltshire. Jenna and Andrew Hannon also have a daughter Abigail, 11 months, and son Drew, three (pictured). Oliver died just hours after doctors told his parents he was doing 'fantastically' But Oliver's condition suddenly deteriorated shortly after Ms Hannon and her husband, a Lance Corporal in the King's Royal Hussars, were making their way home on August 24. They received a phone call from the hospital telling them to come back - but by the time they arrived there was nothing doctors could do to save him. Ms Hannon, who has son Drew, three, and daughter Abigail, 11 months, said: 'We got the phone call to say he was deteriorating rapidly and turned around immediately. 'When we were about five minutes away from the hospital, we got another phone call telling us they needed us back now. 'When we arrived, they were performing CPR on him and then they told me that there was nothing more they could do. 'They just handed him to me and I held him in my arms until he died.' A few days later they received a phone call from a doctor who told them that Oliver had died from a blood infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a common bacteria which can cause disease in many animals, including humans. It . is most commonly found in soil and groundwater and is most dangerous to . people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients and . premature babies. It lives on the skin but can spread through medical equipment such as catheters and feeding tubes inserted into the body. The . main symptoms include inflammation and sepsis and if it infects the . body's main organs, such as the lungs and kidneys, it can lead to death. It does not usually cause illness in healthy people. He said the pseudomonas bacteria was the same as the bacteria which led to the deaths of four newborns at Belfast's Royal Hospital in January. Ms Hannon said: 'He said he was really sorry and it should never have happened. 'He told us that the only way Oliver could have caught the infection was through being in neonatal unit. 'We were told that Oliver would still be here if he had not got the infection and they didn't expect it at all. 'I've lost my little boy now. He was a right little pickle and a little rascal.' The couple were only officially informed that Oliver had died of the bacteria just minutes before the hospital released a statement yesterday. They have now instructed lawyers to begin legal proceedings for compensation and are due to meet hospital staff. Hospital officials said Oliver died in August and a dozen others tested positive for the bacteria. Due to his early arrival, he was vulnerable because of his weak immune system. Dr Chris Burton, medical director of the North Bristol NHS Trust, said: 'In August a premature baby sadly died in Southmead Hospital neonatal intensive care unit and pseudomonas infection contributed to the death. 'In light of experience in other neonatal ICUs where this has happened North Bristol NHS Trust immediately put in place measures to review infection control procedures in the unit and minimise the risk to other babies.' Dr Burton said other babies at the unit had been tested and 12 were found to have pseudomonas bacteria on the skin. 'On its own this does not cause illness or require treatment but presents a risk if bacteria gets into the blood stream,' he said. 'One baby has had treatment for a minor infection but the others remain well and eight have been discharged home. 'Three babies with the bacteria on their skin remain in the unit but are being treated in isolation.' The trust said pseudomonas bacteria has been found in the water supply in the neonatal intensive care unit. 'This is the most common source when similar events have happened in other units,' Dr Burton said. 'To minimise the risk to patients, strict infection control measures have been instituted for staff, parents and visitors. 'Babies are washed in sterile water and the tap water is being filtered to ensure that any pseudomonas bacteria is removed. 'Other measures that have been adopted include more regular testing and enhanced cleaning regimes. 'Whilst these measures have reduced the risk to babies, the hospital estates team are reviewing the water supply and considering other work that could be done to reduce the risk of pseudomonas.' Dr Burton said that parents of babies in the unit had been given information about the infection. He also said admissions to the unit had currently been reduced. The superbug is found widely in soil and stagnant water but does not usually cause illness in healthy people. Dr Mark Evans, from the Health Protection Agency, said: 'Following the discovery of the bacteria, the agency has provided advice and support to North Bristol NHS Trust to help protect the health of babies in the unit. Killer: Oliver Hannon died after an outbreak of the water-borne bacteria pseudomonas, pictured, in the baby intensive care unit . 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa is commonly . found in soil and groundwater and it is a recognised healthcare . associated infection that affects people with weakened immune systems. 'The . people most at risk are those with depleted immune systems such as . cancer patients, people with severe burns and premature babies in . neonatal units. 'The bacteria can be spread by contaminated water, inhalation of aerosols, touching contaminated surfaces or person-to-person through poor hand hygiene. 'The HPA has provided advice to the trust on measures to reduce the risk to other babies in the unit and we will continue to work with the trust to monitor the situation until confident that the risk has been minimised. 'The infection can be treated effectively with antibiotics, especially if treatment is started immediately after confirming the diagnosis.' Pseudomonas aeruginosa lives on the skin but can spread through medical equipment such as catheters and feeding tubes inserted into the body. Earlier this year four babies died after an outbreak of the superbug at two hospitals in Belfast and Londonderry. Three babies died from the bacterial infection at Belfastâs Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital in January. Another baby also died at Altnagelvin Hospital, Londonderry, from a different strain of the infection. The infection can be treated effectively with antibiotics, especially if treatment is started immediately after confirming the diagnosis.","Oliver Hannon died in August after outbreak of .

A violent robber who mugged Prince Harryâs friend as he chatted with the prince on a mobile phone has been jailed. Winful Taylor, 27, was on bail for an identical attack and wearing an electronic tag when he targeted Thomas van Straubenzee, 29, grabbing him by the throat, pushing him to the ground and threatening him with a knife. He was jailed for two years but could be released in just nine months. Harry listened in horror on the phoneÂ  as his old school friend was pinned down by Taylor and an unnamed accomplice. They knelt on his neck and coveredÂ  his mouth before stealing two phonesÂ  and a wallet. The prince raced to the scene in Battersea, South London, with his protection officer and scoured the streets for his friend. When he could not find him HarryÂ  caused great surprise by turning up at the local police station. There he found a shaken Mr van Straubenzee who had been takenÂ  there by officers after a passerby contacted police. Both the prince and Mr van Straubenzee gave statements. It is thought to be the first time a senior member of the royal family has walked into a station to report an offence. The attack, which happened on November 30 last year, sparked a security scare after it emerged that one of the phones contained telephone numbers of several members of the royal family. Mr van Straubenzee is close friends with Prince William as well.

Caught out: Warrant Officer William Donaldson, 43, stole military equipment from his RAF base and sold it on eBay with his wife Melanie . A Royal Air Force serviceman who stole life-saving military equipment before selling it on internet auction site eBay has been jailed. Warrant Officer William Donaldson took more than Â£15,000 pounds worth of tourniquets - most often used to reduce blood loss of soldiers involved in bomb blasts - from stores at the base where he served. The 43-year-old, who has toured the world with the RAF, would then sell the equipment on the mass auction website for discounted prices with the help of his wife, Melanie. Today WO Donaldson was described as a 'thoroughly dishonest man' before being sentenced to 15 months in prison. But, unrepentantly, as he was led to the cells he turned to an MoD investigator and shouted: 'Are you happy now?' In total the couple, who have two children, aged 12 and eight years, made just short of Â£10,000 after selling 925 of the items over a three-year period. The combat action tourniquets are used by battlefield medics in war zones to tie up extremities where limbs have been badly damaged or lost. The equipment is one of the first items applied in emergencies and helps keep injured personnel alive as they are evacuated to field hospitals or surgical stations. The court heard WO Donaldson, who had been in the RAF since the age of 17, would use his position and rank at RAF Halton, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to take the items from the equipment store room. His wife, who had retired from the RAF after the pair married and is now a dental nurse, would store the items at their military-owned accommodation in the married quarters of the base, before selling them on the internet. Donaldson used his position to steal items from the equipment room at RAF Halton, Buckinghamshire . WO Donaldson was sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court to 15 months in prison after being found guilty of theft and converting criminal property between November 2008 and May 2011. His wife, 40, was jailed for seven months after being found guilty of converting criminal property by a jury at their trial in July. Judge Francis Sheridan, in sentencing the pair, said: 'For the last time you will be addressed as Warrant Officer Donaldson, as it is inevitable you will lose this position because you cannot be trusted. Donaldson took more than Â£15,000 of tourniquets from the base where he served . 'The RAF is an honourable service and depends on honour from servicemen. What they didnât get from you was honour. 'You stole and preyed on the fact that the whole operation relied on trust. 'The items you stole operate to protect the armed forces when they are oversees defending our country. 'Mrs Donaldson, your role was to store the items in the home and then match and dispatch on ebay for the profit of both of you. 'You, Mr Donaldson, were a thoroughly dishonest man. 'You . were deployed across the world in service to your country and up until . you were exposed as a thief you were highly respected. 'It was a stellar downfall. You were fully responsible for this and the downfall of your wife. 'Both . of you decided on a thoroughly dishonest life, the consequences of . which hasnât just impacted on you but your jobs, home and family. 'Mrs Donaldson, you served with the RAF up until you married, when you retired. Melanie Donaldson arrives at Aylesbury Crown Court, Buckinghamshire. She was sentenced to seven months imprisonment . 'You were living in RAF accommodation and you were using this accommodation to store the items before selling. 'During this case the trail of paperwork at the MoD was criticised and it was far from perfect. But when the request goes in to deploy the equipment, it goes immediately and the paperwork catches up.' Whilst being led from the dock into the holding cells, greying WO Donaldson turned to the investigating officer in the case, Detective Sergeant James Marrs, of the Ministry of Defence Police, and made his outburst. He and his dark-haired wife had shown no emotion during the sentencing hearing. After the hearing Detective Sergeant Marrs said: 'The MoD police takes a robust approach to any theft from the Defence estate which has the potential to harm the effectiveness of our Armed Forces. 'We are particularly pleased with the successful convictions of these offenders as the tourniquets they stole are vital battlefield medical supplies. 'The Donaldsonâs deceit did not stop these supplies from getting through to the frontline but nonetheless they stole these items without any thought for the effect they might have. 'Most military equipment is specifically designed for their use and we will seek to prosecute any suspects whose actions deprive them of it. 'Buyers of such items also need to be aware. There is a thriving market in military goods but it is their responsibility to check that the items they are buying are being sold legally.'","RAF serviceman and his wife made close to Â£10,000 by selling the life-saving equipment .

A Royal Navy sailor âbulliedâ by senior officers over his best friendâs suicide killed himself in the exact same circumstances, an inquest heard. Samuel Hatton, 20, blasted himself in the head with an SA80 rifle on the minehunter Cattistock. The weapons engineer had been devastated by the death of close friend Matthew Webster, 23, who shot himself on HMS Hurworth seven months earlier. He had sought counselling and was taking sleeping pills and anti-depressants. But in the days leading up to his own death in September 2010 he faced cruel taunts from senior crew including: âNot shot yourself yet?â, Portsmouth Coronerâs Court heard yesterday. He did not have the right to access ammunition, but was given keys to the storage area while on cleaning duties. He left a suicide note in his bunk and texted his girlfriend Nicola Evans, previously Mr Websterâs partner, saying: âIâm sorry.â Leading engineering technician Nathan Senior told how his friend was heartbroken by Mr Websterâs suicide at Scotlandâs Faslane submarine base in February 2010. âHe said there were people on board who had made comments to him,â he said. âIf what he said to me was true then I would say he felt he was being bullied.â Sam - known as Ricky to his mates after the boxer - was given the keys to the weapons store because cleaning the weapons formed part of his usual responsibilities.

He was already dead. The . keys and padlock to the store were found on a cabinet near his body and . his iPhone was blasting ""Live Forever"" by Oasis through its speaker. He had also sent a text message to his girlfriend saying ""I'm sorry."" Detective Sergeant Gary Cable, from Hampshire Constabulary, told the inquest a handwritten suicide note was found in Sam's bunk. It said: 'To all my friends and family. I'm sorry. I love you all. Sorry for all the trouble I have caused. Greg, look after my sister.' Detective Sergeant Cable continued: 'During Sam's joining interview it was revealed he had a difficult childhood. 'His mother was a drug addict and he was born dependent on heroin. His father had issues with alcohol, resulting in domestic violence. 'Sam's mother died when he was 11 and he was taken into care, moving from foster home to foster home. 'He had recently separated from his girlfriend, Sophie Asher, who was pregnant with his child.

He added: 'The death of Webster and having no family support caused concern within the Navy.'Sam was on medication that would allow him to serve on board and he was under constant review. 'His mental welfare was closely monitored.' The court heard Sam had dropped out of a weapons training course in May 2010 because he found it emotionally difficult firing a gun so soon after his friend's death. He also went AWOL for a couple of days on May 20 and 21 as he tried to come to terms with it. Crew mates on board the ship spoke of their 'shock' and 'bewilderment' at Sam's death. Sam's friend Lieutenant Nathan Senior, who had served with him on HMS Illustrious, said Sam had reacted badly to news of Matthew's death. He said: 'Sam said he was not too good because of what happened to Matthew. He said he had gone to speak to the chaplain and other people about it. 'He was broken-hearted about his friend taking his life. His body language and tonality of his voice concerned me. Mid-conversation he would go into himself as if he was thinking about his friend.'His whole demeanour came across as someone who was very sad. 'He also said he was not happy about comments being made about him.'He said there were people who had made comments about his friend committing suicide and if he was going to repeat his friend's actions.'The people he was talking about were those in management rather than in his mess.'They were flippant comments such as ''When are you going to shoot yourself?'. 'He felt he was being unfairly treated.' Lt Sean McClean, a gunnery officer onboard HMS Cattistock, said he had heard somebody taunting Sam about Matthew's death.He said: ""I heard a comment from a male. The comment was 'Not shot yourself yet Ricky?""'He replied, 'No, not yet.' and left it there. 'I asked Sam if he was OK and he replied ''Yes, no problem boss'' Sam - who was described as being 'sometimes bubbly and sometimes withdrawn' - had joined the ship in May 2010.

Two terraced houses have partially collapsed after scrap metal thieves broke into them and stole their cast iron window frames. Emergency services sealed off the properties after neighbours reported hearing 'rumbling noises' and found rubble and debris on the pavement. Witnesses suggested that the stolen metal would only have been worth about Â£20, but the damage to the buildings in Burnley, Lancashire, is much more costly. Damaged: Debris and rubble lie on the pavement outside two homes in Burnley, Lancashire, which were targeted by scrap metal thieves . As well as taking out the window frames, which had been installed so the properties could be boarded up, the thieves removed stonework, making the buildings structurally unsafe. The thefts were today being investigated by Lancashire Police. Neighbour Danny Howarth, 25, said the area was often targeted by thieves hoping to steal copper and lead. Describing the moment the window frames were taken, he added: 'I heard a bang and saw someone run out of the window and then the house started collapsing. 'The fire engines and police came and cordoned it all off. I think they must have been getting the copper and pipes, the fireplace is still inside though. Crime scene: Thieves caused this damage to the properties as they stole cast iron window frames . 'They were meant to be knocking all this area down but weâve not heard anything since. 'It used to be a really nice area when my grandparents moved her thirty years ago. Now itâs just a hell hole.' James Burns, 73, who lives near the damaged houses, said the thieves struck at about 9pm on Monday. 'I was just sat in the living room and I saw flashing lights and so I went outside and saw two fire engines and a police car, he said. 'I went down and saw all the debris. 'They were going for the cast iron windows. They must have got in through the inside and were trying to knock it out. 'It would have been a hefty job - even though the house was in a bad state anyway. 'Itâs the metal thieves who are dragging this place down.' Builder James Slattery, 45, said: 'A lot of these houses are just boarded up now and itâs leading to criminal damage. Out of bounds: The empty properties in Burnley, Lancashire, which had been boarded up, were cordoned off by emergency services . 'The thieves would have been lucky to get only got Â£20 for that scrap iron, itâs not worth it. In fact theyâd be lucky to get that. 'Scrap is good money overall but it is the damage afterwards which people are left with.' Another neighbour, Wendy Jones, 48, said: 'There has been a lot of people roaming around and Iâve seen them stealing concrete slabs. 'These houses want knocking down before the scrap thieves pull it down themselves.' Firefighter Neil Ashworth said three fire crews attended the incident, and warned that such crimes 'drained' the emergency services' valuable resources. 'The fronts of the houses started to collapse due to thieves taking out the cast iron window sets,' he said. 'They had completely removed one and one was left hanging out.' He added: 'This was a major drain on resources with three appliances attending. How the street used to look: The house on the left of this photograph was one of the properties targeted by the thieves. The picture, taken before the raid, gives an indication of the scale of the damage that the criminals caused . 'We are used to attending unoccupied homes that have been targeted by thieves but this was a new level for us. 'They have endangered their own lives and the lives of others. 'It is ridiculous they are prepared to risk so much for what seems so little.' Burnley Council said it was trying to contact the owners of the properties. The authority's leader, Julie Cooper, said: 'It is amazing the lengths people will go to steal items like this. 'It is a growing issue and one that has been on my radar for a while. 'When the Shadow Home Secretary visited in April we went to some Calico properties that had pipes, radiators, and everything ripped out for metal thefts. 'It is growing on a grand scale, and I think it will continue to do so until we have some proper controls over scrap dealers. 'If they couldnât take cash payments then there wouldnât be as big a market for this kind of thing.'","Residents heard 'rumbling noises' after criminals targeted the properties in Burnley, Lancashire .

An investigation has been launched into the death of a teenager who was stabbed by her jealous ex-boyfriend moments after she was refused a police escort. Samantha Laney, 19, had asked for assistance so she could collect her belongings from the flat she used to share with her partner Thomas Dalton. Her killer had already been spoken to by police for smashing up their home and he had previously threatened to 'slice her open' if she went to the property. But when Samantha rang officers for a police escort, she was told there were not enough police officers available. Samantha Laney (left) was stabbed to death by jealous ex-boyfriend Thomas Dalton (right) moments after she pleaded with police for an escort to collect her belongings from the flat she used to share with her killer . Shortly afterwards, Dalton, 19, armed himself with a kitchen knife and cycled over to the home of Samanthaâs father in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffs. He laid in wait for her outside for 45 minutes and when she arrived back, he burst in and stabbed Samantha in the back. As she bled to death, Dalton then fought with Samanthaâs father who wrestled the knife from him. Tests showed the knife blade punctured her lung and cut across her aorta, causing her to bleed to death a short time later. Yesterday, an independent inquiry was underway into the tragedy after Dalton was found guilty of murdering Samantha but found not guilty of the attempted murder of her father Steven Laney, 53. He was due to be sentenced later. A mandatory referral has made to the . Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) because there had been previous . police contact with the victim. The IPCC asked Staffordshire Police to . carry out a supervised investigation, which is ongoing. Samantha with her father Steve, who wrestled the knife from Dalton as his daughter bled to death at his home . Stafford Crown Court was told the . couple had been childhood sweethearts after they started dating when . they were 15 but they split up last February after a series of rows and . she moved in with Mr Laney. Dalton was so upset he threatened to kill her during a telephone conversation the day after she had walked out and began bombarding her with abusive and threatening messages on Facebook. During one angry phone call he began smashing a coffee table and Samantha called police saying she was concerned her ex was wrecking the whole flat, where they had a joint tenancy. A policewoman went to the house but no further action was taken after finding no evidence of damage inside the flat. Ten days later, Samantha telephoned Dalton to arrange a visit to the flat in Kidsgrove, to pick up her belongings - but he said he would kill Samantha saying: 'If you keep pestering me Iâm going to hurt you.' Samanthaâs aunt Sylvia Proctor who overheard the phone call said: 'He was not a happy person. He was very angry. I could hear him shouting. I took the phone. He was swearing and ranting. 'I said it didnât matter if he wasnât at home, as the police were going to come and help her get her stuff out. Thatâs when he said he was going to kill Sam and kill Steve. 'I told him that was stupid, as heâd just made me a witness. I was being sarcastic, because I didnât think he would actually do it. If I did I would have called the police myself.' Dalton lay in wait outside Samantha's father's house (pictured) and stabbed her in the back when she entered the property . Dalton also sent a text message to a neighbour saying: 'Sam is coming over, so if thereâs bang and murder, just ignore it. Lol.' Philip Bennetts QC said: 'Samantha rang the police, asking for a police escort. She was told there were not enough police officers available. 'Samantha went to her auntâs home. Dalton rang, ranting down the phone. He said if she or Steven went to their flat, he was going to slice them open.' Dalton then updated his Facebook page, saying: 'Some things got to be done in life.' Samantha returned to her father's house with Mr Laney and her best friend following a shopping trip - not realising Dalton was waiting to ambush her. As she walked through the door, Dalton burst in and plunged the knife into her back. Mr Laney who is deaf testified in sign language saying: 'I turned round and saw Sam, who was leaning over with an expression of great pain on her face. A forensic tent at the scene of the stabbing. Dalton had previously threatened to kill Samantha during a telephone conversation the day after she had walked out on him . 'Then I saw Dalton. He had a knife in his hand. I made the decision to get him out of the house. He tried to knife me. 'He had the knife at the front of my abdomen, pointing it towards me. I felt that had I not get hold of his arm he would have undoubtedly stabbed me too.' Dalton was arrested whilst walking up the A34. He confessed his guilt to prison staff whilst on remand saying: 'I meant to kill them all and kill myself. 'I just wished I had killed him as well. Even if I got 25 years, I would get the father and kill him.' Dalton denied murder and attempted murder claiming he was not in control of his actions. He told the jury: 'I asked when she was coming back. She said she wasnât coming back. 'I asked her how could she do this to me. I was devastated. 'It was while I was talking to her on the phone. Thatâs when I picked up the knife. I just wanted to hurt her, because sheâd hurt me. 'I wanted to hurt her, just to make her feel how I felt. As soon as I stabbed her I looked at the knife and it was like Iâd just woken up. I thought, âWhat have I done?â.' After the verdict Det Insp Glyn Pattinson, who led the inquiry, said: 'Our investigation proved this was a premeditated crime. Dalton travelled to Clayton with the intention of causing serious injury to his former partner. 'What followed was the fatal stabbing of Samantha in front of people who were powerless to stop him. Dalton chose to make ""no comment"" in relation to the questions put to him and he has shown no remorse for the crime he committed.' In a statement, Samanthaâs family said: 'No prison sentence will ever be enough to compensate the deep loss we all feel. 'Samantha was a wonderful daughter and sister with her whole life ahead of her. She was a joy to be around and always had time for her family and friends. 'Samantha was a ray of sunshine in our lives. Thomas Dalton has extinguished that light and taken away our precious Samantha.

French Interior Minister Manuel Valls today ordered police to destroy a Roma camp in his political powerbase and to deport illegal immigrants living there. Officers armed with truncheons and shields moved in to the settlement in the Paris suburb of Evry, where he was mayor for 11 years from 2001. By late morning more than 70 people including women and children had been evicted from caravans and makeshift huts, with most expected to be returned to Romania. On the move: A man carried a foam mattress and other belongings after members of the Roma gang were ordered to move on today . Kicked out: Women and children were also among the 70 people moved on from Evry this morning . On guard: Police stand in line in front of the city hall in Evry, Paris, after the Roma community were expelled . Time to go: A Roma couple prepare to gather their possessions together in Evry as their ramshackle camp was dismantled . The raid is particularly significant because it shows the Socialist firebrand is determined to âclean up illegal immigrants in his own back yardâ, said a party colleague. The source added: âValls particularly wants to end the Roma problem â by breaking up a camp in his constituency he is showing he means business.â A deportation order for residents of the camp was signed by the local Socialist mayor Francis Chouat who said: âIn addition to being unhealthy, the site is extremely dangerousness.â The suburb of Paris from which the gang were ejected was the same area where Manuel Valls served as mayor for 11 years . Packing their bags: The ejection is particularly important as Valls had vowed to 'clean up illegal immigrants from his own back yard' The Roma gang were forced to move on after French police arrived in the Paris suburb at 5am this morning . Hitting the road: Minister Manuel Valls ordered the police to take action after declaring that Roma gipsy camps are a 'challenge' to 'people living together' Temporary housing: Many had expected France's new socialist government to have a relaxed approach to illegal immigrants, but Manuel Valls was quick to act against the Roma community who appeared in the Paris suburb where he used to be mayor . The . swift evacuation of the Roma gipsy camp in Evry, Paris, by Manuel Valls (above) today was the . latest crackdown by the French government after similiar action in Lyon . and other Lille earlier this month. France's new socialist government . appears to have 'declared war' on illegal immigrants and followed . through with action originally proposed by previous Premier Nicolas . Sarkozy. Many expected the more liberal . socialists to show a more relaxed attitude toward immigrants, especially . those from European Union member states. But Mr Valls said the camps were a âchallengeâ to âpeople living togetherâ. He insisted the police would uphold all court orders aimed at dismantling them. Mr Sarkozy started a purge on Romas . in the summer of 2010, pointing to the fact that up to 15,000 were . living in camps across France. Mr Sarkozy even proposed that police travel to Romania to fight trafficking and other crimes committed there by Roma. In turn, Roma groups accused Mr . Sarkozy of âethnic cleansingâ, pointing to the fact that gipsies had . been targeted by the Nazis during the Second World War. They said that the purge was all . part of a generally racist strategy adopted by Mr Sarkozy against all . foreign groups, including some six million Muslims living in France. Mr Chouat said the site overlapped a . commuter train route into Paris, and was close to potentially fatal . power lines. At 7am young children could be seen dragging suitcases and . bags away from the site, along with bicyles. âThe . police arrived at 5am,â a 22-year-old Romanian called Lakatos told . French radio. âI do not know where to go now - perhaps to a hotel, . perhaps to a charity.â Hundreds of other Roma left a nearby wooded camp on Ministry of Interior land after receiving an eviction order on Sunday. Mr Valls ordered the destruction of numerous Roma camps across France earlier this month, with sites broken up in Lille, Lyon and Marseilles, as well as Paris. The policy being pursued by Franceâs socialist government was formulated by former conservative president Nicolas Sarkozy, who was frequently accused of pandering to the far right. His government linked Roma camps with crime, suggesting that many of the thieves and muggers operating in big cities were homeless Romanians. Neighbours of the camps often complained about noise and anti-social behaviour, as well as serious crimes, said Mr Valls. Humanitarian organisations have also linked the camps to ill health, including serious diseases such as tuberculosis. Mr Sarkozy started a purge on Romas in the summer of 2010 in France, where up to 15,000 live. In turn, Roma groups accused Mr Sarkozy of âethnic cleansingâ, pointing to the fact that gipsies had been targeted by the Nazis during the Second World War. They said that the purge was all part of a generally racist strategy adopted by Mr Sarkozy against all foreign groups, including some six million Muslims living in France. Romania has been a full member of the European Union since 2007, and its citizens can enter France without a visa. But they must get residency permits if they want to settle long term and work.

Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has called for a European Council . meeting to make decisions âat the European levelâ on the Roma - many of . whom also come from Bulgaria Bulgaria. Despite . the evictions and deportations, Mr Ayrault has pledged to make it . easier for those Roma who are allowed to stay in France to get jobs. Last . Thursday the Romanian government issued a statement welcoming âthe . French governmentâs decision to ease the Romanian and Bulgarian . citizensâ access to the French labour market.â Evry is a new town which was built in the 1960s to accommodate overspill from Parisâs growing immigrant community. It . now has one of the youngest populations in France â the average age is . just 26 â with many residents coming from African and North African Arab . backgrounds. Despite . the ethnic mix, and the fact that it is viewed as a âSocialist townâ, . locals in Evry frequently complain about non-regulated accommodation, . which includes a large number of squats, as well as the kind of Roma . camp which was shut down. Manuel . Valls â who is nicknamed âthe Sarkozy of the Leftâ â was returned as . mayor of Evry during 2008 elections with 70 per cent of the vote. This . was further evidence of Evry being the safest Socialist constituency in . France. The legal method by which the French authorities are able to clear the camps is by claiming they are a hazard to the local community. In the Evry case, the local mayor acted on local concerns by arguing that the settlement created public health problems, and was also dangerously close to a commuter railways line.

In reality, the Interior Minister would have the ultimate say on whether camps should or should not be shut down. Of the Roma kicked off sites in . cities like Lyon and Lille earlier this month, some 90 per cent have . since been deported by plane. Adults returning to Bucharest receive 300 euros, while children receive 150 euros. This means that a small, impoverished family can easily âearnâ more than 1000 euros from a single deportation. Accordingly, many families are more than happy to be deported for a few weeks, before returning to France at a later date.

A Foreign Office spokesman in London said: âWe are aware of the hospitalisation of two British nationals.â The official STA news agency said two hot air balloons were in the air at the time of the crash.

Jamiroquai's Jay Kay was robbed of thousands of dollars during a break-in in Ibiza . Pop star Jay Kay had thousands of pounds and a Rolex watch stolen from his villa in Ibiza just hours after flying to the party island. A gang broke into the rented mountain-top home while he was out clubbing on the first night of a ten- day break. The Jamiroquai frontman returned from the Spice nightclub to find that the villa had been broken into. But the thieves spurned the eccentric starâs designer gear and instead took the Rolex, which belonged to his security man, and the cash. Police were called to the holiday villa near the upmarket resort of Cala Carbo on the west coast butÂ  the singer opted against making a formal complaint. He later discovered the Â£12,000-a-week property had already been burgled three times before. Detectives confirmed last night they were investigating three other recent thefts at the same property â and that the suspects were stillÂ  at large. Last night a spokesman for the singer told The Mail on Sunday: âJay had a pretty unpleasant experience. When we booked the villa they didnât tell us that they had previously been robbed. We wish they had, as Jay would have been more vigilant. âHe had literally arrived at the villa and gone straight out. When he returned the villa had been robbed so the thieves must have seen them arriving. Jay felt very violated but he didnât want a full-scale police investigation â he didnât want the hassle or the publicity. âJay stayed at the villa for theÂ  rest of the trip because they upped the security.â Break-in: The villa, west of Ibiza town on the party island, was broken in to and the thieves got away with cash and a security guard's Rolex .

It lies at the end of a dirt track and offers spectacular views of the Mediterranean. Online luxury travel agency Paradizo, the agency Kay booked through, failed to respond to an enquiry about the earlier thefts. One local, who asked not to be named, said: âCriminals of all sorts make a beeline for Ibiza every summer because they know there are rich pickings to be had. âThere are always problems with break-ins at luxury villas but this year weâre hearing itâs been particularly bad.â","Thieves broke into luxury villa on Ibiza .

Hundreds of headteachers stepped into the row over GCSE grades yesterday demanding a 'total re-mark' of all English papers taken by their students this year. The move comes amid growing optimism within the teaching profession that thousands of pupils will, in the end, be awarded higher grades in English than those they were awarded on Thursday, amid claims they were unfairly marked down. One of Michael Gove's favourite headteachers, Joan McVittie, who is the outgoing president of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said she had been contacted by more than 100 secondary heads in recent days. They said they were so furious they were now demanding re-marks of all English papers. Headteacher Joan Mcvittie who teaches at the White Hart Lane School in Tottenham, London, said she has heard from more than 100 headteachers who demand a total re-mark of English exams . Glenys Stacey, the chief regulator of Ofqual, wrote to head teachers to say that there were 'questions about how grade boundaries were set' in units . She told The Observer: 'The authorities will not be able to handle that. 'There is huge anger out there. The whole thing is so unfair on pupils whose lives will be affected by these results.' Meanwhile Glenys Stacey, the chief . regulator of Ofqual, wrote to head teachers to say that there were . âquestions about how grade boundaries were setâ in units.

In a devastating book, Valerie . Trierweiler is portrayed as an emotional woman who relies on alcohol to . steady herself for public appearances. She earned the nickname The . Rottweiler earlier this year when she tweeted her support for a . candidate running for election against Segolene Royal, Mr Hollandeâs ex. Hell hath no fury: SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal, right, summoned Francois Hollande's then secret lover Valerie Trierweiler, left, to her office and demanded she break of the affair, a new book claims . Miss Royal, the mother of Mr Hollandeâs four children, described the message as a âpoisonous stab in the backâ. However, Miss Trierweiler, 47, a . journalist with Paris Match magazine, is still looking for revenge after . Miss Royal warned her off the French presidentÂ  when she learned of . their affair in 2005. Miss Royal, a senior Socialist Party . politician at the time, allegedly called the reporter into her office . and said: âEveryone says you are Francoisâs mistress â it is unbearable . for me.â She then tried to get Miss . Trierweiler sacked from her job covering the Socialists, so the . journalist would not have any excuse to approach Mr Hollande. But Miss Trierweiler ignored the . plea, and continued the affair until Mr Hollande and Miss Royal . officially split after 30 years together in 2007. The book, Entre Deux Feux (Between . Two Fires), by investigative journalists Anne Rosencher and Anna Cabana, . confirms that President Hollandeâs messy love life was almost . impossible to manage. At one point in 2007 he even . considered trying to get back together with Miss Royal while she was . running for the French presidency. Miss Cabana said Miss Trierweilerâs . tweet supporting Olivier Falorni over Miss Royal in parliamentary . elections earlier this year was the âumpteenth act in a drama which has . been going on for ten yearsâ. Impossible love life: Book Entre deux Feux claims that President Hollande's messy love life was almost impossible to manage . âValerie Trierweiler suffered in the shadows and was in fear of Segolene Royal, who threatened her professionally â she tried to get her fired â and personally. âUntil the summer of 2007, Hollande floated between the two women. Today (Miss Trierweiler) has won but the thirst for revenge continues. The tweet is a symptom of this.â Although Mr Hollandeâs own âpsychodramaâ love triangle hasÂ  already spawned three books, Entre Deux Feux is seen by many as the best sourced, with contacts at the heart of the French presidency. Miss Trierweiler is depicted throughout as a nervous, paranoid woman who, on the advice of a friend, drinks at least half a glass of wine before public appearances. Former conservative minister Rachida Dati also points out that Nicolas Sarkozy always held his wifeâs hand in public, whereas Mr Hollande barely touches Miss Trierweiler. Hand holding: Former conservative minister Rachida Dati pointed out that Nicolas Sarkozy always held his wife Carla Bruni's hand in public, whereas Mr Hollande barely touches Miss Trierweiler . If Miss Trierweiler did not feel as though she was getting enough attention from the president she would âdramatically disappearâ, with Mr Hollande continually asking: âWhereâs Valerie?â, says the book. It also reveals the infamous tweet was sent from her Elysee Palace office after she argued with Mr Hollande because he wanted to give Miss Royal a job in his government. The book even claims the journalist has âbannedâ Mr Hollande from making Miss Royal a minister. Miss Trierweiler has kept a low profile in recent weeks, carrying out few duties and making no public statements.","New book charts French President's tumultuous love life .

He took to social media to explain why the tabloid newspaper became the first British publication to print the images of the prince partying in Las Vegas, before going on to claim he supported the humiliated royal.

But according to a source reported in the Independent, Mr Murdoch told News International chief executive Tom Mockridge: 'There is a principle here. I know this is about Leveson but this is humiliating. 'We can't carry on like this. We should run them, do it and say to Leveson, we are doing it for press freedom.' Later, however, Mr Murdoch echoed the view of a large proportion of the public by insisting he sympathised with Harry. He tweeted: 'Prince Harry. Give him a break. He may . be on the public payroll one way or another, but the public loves him, . even to enjoy Las Vegas.' More than 850 complaints have been made . to press watchdog the PCC about the publication of photographs of the . prince frolicking naked with a young woman in Fridayâs edition of The Sun. Nearly all are about invasion of privacy and are to be investigated in due course. In a Twitter exchange with former deputy . prime minister John Prescott, Mr Murdoch denied the claims, writing: 'Decision was rightly that of the editor, and I support. I was in Silicon Valley far removed.' The Sun argued that . printing the images was in the public interest and a 'crucial' test of . the countryâs free press. 'First amendment': Mr Murdoch tweets his explanation for why The Sun needed to print the naked photos of the 27-year-old Prince . Finger on the pulse: Mr Murdoch, 81, followed up by echoing the thoughts of much of the public by expressing support for the wayward Prince . Mr Murdoch later added on Twitter: . 'Simple equation: free, open uncontrollable Internet versus shackled . newspapers equals no newspapers. Let's get real.' He concluded the discussion with the advice: 'Only lesson for Prince Harry: avoid playmates with cameras!' TMZ, the celebrity gossip website that first published the pictures, said they were taken last Friday after . Harry and his entourage met a group of young women in a hotel bar and invited them . up to the royalâs suite.

Just two days after reports of a lion on the loose in Essex, commuters at one London Underground station have been warned about a gang of rampaging mice which have apparently been 'attacking' their feet as they wait for trains. The problem has got so bad that a message appeared on a whiteboard at Farringdon Station yesterday urging passengers to 'tuck the bottom of their trousers into their socks'. The sign, handwritten on a whiteboard in black pen, informed passengers of the 'attacks' and said they should 'avoid being a victim'. Warning: TfL says the sign was not written by any of its staff and it's believed to be a joke by a member of the public urging passengers to 'avoid being a victim' It comes as David Cameron's cat Larry caught his first ever rodent today - more than a year . after the five-year-old moggie was brought into help curb the mouse . problem at No 10. The reluctant mouser was finally spotted playing . with the dead mouse this morning before . he proudly dumped its body on the grass. However, the problem at Farringdon station could be too big a challenge for Larry, who, like his owner, is known to enjoy long periods of time 'chill-axing' instead of stalking the corridors of power for vermin. Amusing: Mystery surrounds who is responsible for the sign which has been seen by thousands of people on Twitter today .

The number of homes where no one works has fallen by nearly a quarter of a million over the past two years, figures showed yesterday. It means more people are taking jobs rather than living on state benefits, suggesting the Coalitionâs welfare reforms may be having an effect. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has tried to cut back on the misuse of disability and sickness benefits and has capped Housing Benefit, while trying to get those dependent on benefits into the job market. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show that the number of households living on benefits has fallen to its lowest level since the recession began to bite four years ago. Never worked households: Official figures show this number has nearly always gone up for 16 years and is currently at 340,000 in 2012 . The number of jobless households in . April, May and June was down 153,000 on the same period last year and . was 244,000 fewer than the spring of 2010. But there were still 3,676,000 jobless households in the period, according to the figures. Some 17.9 per cent of all homes now . have no one with a job, down from 19.2 per cent when the Coalition came . to power. But five million adults still live in homes without work. Around 1.75million children lived in . households where no one worked, 60,000 fewer than last year. And the . number of homes â apart from student households â where no one has ever . had a job fell to 265,000, down 26,000 from last spring. Excluding student households, where everyone is aged 16 to 24 and in full-time education, there were 265,000 households containing only people that have never worked. This represents 1.3 per cent of all households in the UK. War of words: Stephen Timms, left, says that the Government is not getting to grips with unemployment but minister Chris Grayling, right, says that it shows the Coalition's benefits reforms are working . Experts warn that the issue often leads to social problems as families . with no history . of work are most likely to be involved in crime and their children are . most likely to slip into a cycle of truancy, drug abuse and disorder. Labour told MailOnline today that the Government was failing to get to grips with the problem. Shadow . Employment Secretary Stephen Timms said: 'Todayâs slight fall in the . number of workless households is welcome but after two years of failure . this government is barely scratching the surface of Britainâs jobs . crisis. 'There are . still far too many workless households but ministers seem incapable of . getting to grips with the problem. Their back to work schemes arenât . delivering and our economy remains stuck in a double dip recession of . this governmentâs making.' Shock: Britain's dole queue is dropping slowly but there is a worrying number of households where none of the residents have ever had a job . Overall, official Government figures . released today show the number of households where there are no people . in employment, including those who have worked previously, has gone down . by 0.8 per cent. The . Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this was 3.7 million in 2012 - . down 153,000 on a year earlier. But it is still higher than the . pre-recession level of 3.4 million. Depressing: ONS figures show here the number of households containing whole families who have never had a job . It means almost one in five homes have no employed adults. Sickness continues to be the main reason for being out of work in the long-term. The Government said today that these drops showed their welfare reforms are working. Chris Grayling, the employment minister, said: 'These are encouraging . figures. Through our welfare reforms more people are entering the . workplace and more children are living in a household that works. 'However, . we can't be complacent. The economy remains a substantial challenge, . which is why we need the right employment support to ensure that those . living in workless households and their children are given the . opportunities and help to succeed.' The data also reveals a worrying north-south divide, where in some areas up to a quarter of households are out of work. The North East had the highest rate of workless households at . 24.5 per cent, while the South East had the lowest at 14.1 per cent. For the UK as a whole in 2012, around . 17.9 per cent of households were in that position, but seven areas of . the UK that were above that average. 'There are some stark differences across the country. For example, in the north-east of the country, 24.5 per cent of households are workless and in the south-east, just over 14%,' ONS expert Jamie Jenkins said. Out of work: The majority of people who are long-term unemployed are suffering from health problems . The latest data released by the Office . for National Statistics (ONS) also showed that the number of households . where all adults that live in it work has also fallen. From . April to June this year there were 10.9 million such households, . representing 53 per cent and a fall of 36,000 of homes with at least one . person aged 16 to 64 where all adult members are in employment. During . the same period there were 3.7 million UK households with at least one . member aged 16 to 64 where no one was in work, representing 17.9 per . cent of households. This was the second consecutive fall, compared to . 2010 when almost four million UK households had no adults in work. Sickness, both long-term and temporary, was the main reason given for not working by those people aged 16 to 64 living in workless households, accounting for 1.45 million or around three in every 10 workless people. The second most common reason given was . being unemployed, accounting for 1.03 million, or around one in five. The next three most common reasons were looking after the family, . retirement and study. North-south divide: The north-east has the highest number of unemployed households, many more than in the south . If fully retired and student households are removed, the number of households in the UK that are workless goes down to 2.92 million. The ONS said there was a rise of 246,000 in mixed households - those containing some people in work and some who are not. The number stood at 5.97 million, or 29.1% of the total. The lowest number of workless households was in 2006, two years before the economic downturn hit the UK. Then the number of workless households was 3.4 million or 17.3% - 0.6% lower than this year.","This figure is almost double the amount in 1996, official figures show .

'This was a bad day, not only for us, but for human . rights, humanity, the rule of law and the country of Israel. 'We believe Rachel Corrie was seen. Everything through this process confirmed at least one soldier saw her. 'We believe the bulldozer driver had the ability and responsibility to see what was in front of his machine.' Corrie and other members of the International Solidarity Movement had been acting as human shields to prevent the bulldozing of Palestinian homes in Rafah on the Gaza-Egypt border. The Israeli army said the buildings were being used to attack Israeli soldiers and as covers for entrances to weapons smuggling tunnels beneath the border. Judge Oded Gershon dismissed a civil lawsuit brought by Corrieâs family against the state of Israel claiming symbolic damages of $1. 'I reject the suit,' the judge said. 'There is no justification to demand the state pay any damages.' Reading from his 162-page verdict, the . judge told the Haifa District Court that Corrieâs death was a .

When the family of an 89-year-old woman feared she was being mistreated in her care home, they hid a small CCTV camera in an alarm clock to check up on her. And their worst worries came true when two carers were caught on camera committing 'sickening' acts of verbal and physical abuse, a court heard yesterday. Ivy Robinson, who has dementia, was hit, shaken, sworn at, dragged across the bedroom floor and not given the correct doses of her medication by the staff who were supposed to be looking after her. Scroll down for video . Abuse: CCTV captures Ivy Robinson, 89, being dragged from a chair to her bed as she looks in pain. Ivy was subjected to a catalogue of abuse by her carers before her family captured her mistreatment on a hidden camera . The shocking footage led to senior . carer Emma Bryan, 29, and colleague Katherine Wallis, 45, being arrested . for the appalling acts of neglect. Yesterday Bryan was jailed for four . months at Leeds Crown Court and Wallis given a 12-month community order . after admitting mistreating Mrs RobinsonÂ  at Oakfoss House Residential . CareÂ  Home in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, last November. Passing sentence, Judge Guy Kearl, QC, told them: 'This neglect and ill-treatment is unforgivable and unacceptable. 'You failed to accord for the respect and dignity of this respectful and elderly lady.' The judge said the victim's daughter, . Angela Wood, 'had believed she had placed her mother in a safe . environment' and it 'turned out to be anything but'. Richard Butters, prosecuting, told the . court the footage captured over aÂ  five-day period showed Mrs Robinson . was subjected to an array of 'utterly undignified' treatment. Mrs .

Mrs Robinson often . cried and asked her daughter not to go. To allay their suspicions Mr Wood set up the spy camera in his mother-in-law's bedroom and the damning footage showed: . â âBoth Bryan and Wallis dragging Mrs Robinson from a chair to her bed, with the pensioner 'shrieking' as they did it; . â âMrs Robinson being called a 'horrible old lady', a 'silly old t***' and a 'nasty old cow' by Bryan; . â âThe same carer striking Mrs Robinson on the hand and shaking her before telling her to 'p*** off'. Mr Butters said the footage showed . both carers manhandling Mrs Robinson 'in a totally unauthorised manner', . using a banned method of lifting. A training instructor was shown the video and what she saw left her 'completely shocked' and 'physically upset'. 'In her opinion this was the worst . case of ill treatment and neglect and abuse of trust that she has ever . seen in her years in thisÂ  profession,' he added. Mr Butters told the court Mrs . Robinson's daughter 'is sickened and horrified by the treatment . administered to her mother', adding: 'She can't stop thinking about it, . she often bursts into tears.'

A disgruntled investor from Atlanta spent nearly three decades trying to get law enforcement to help him get possession of his stolen car. And considering the car in question is a specific model of 1962 Ferrari of which there were only four made ever, it makes sense why he has not given up on the case. Because of some detective work and the collection of verified owner's certificates, it looks like said stolen car may now be in the possession of billionaire Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee. Because of its rarity, the car is valued at around $15million. Rare: This is one of the four 1962 Ferrari 330 LM-B. The one shown here was at a Connecticut car show this year . The tale of Ivars Blumenau and his stolen red Ferrari 330 LeMans-Berlinetta is part Grand Theft Auto and part wild goose chase as it reportedly involves multiple resales, museum displays in broad daylight, and questionable car dealers. Every wrinkle in the multi-faceted case was laid out by Jalopnik, who had an lengthy interview with Mr Blumenau. Current owner: Billionaire Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee is thought to have bought the stolen car in the 1990s . He sent the site documentation proving that he did, in fact own the car which was one of only four made. What also makes this particular style special is that it was the last front-engined racing Ferrari, making its theft even more stinging. The story began when Mr Blumenau bought a 330 LMBs from a mechanic and dealer in Atlanta named Donlad Fong, a Ferrari specialist who was well-known within the car collecting community. Mr Blumenau stored the car with Fong, and it was stolen from Fong's facility in 1977. Police documentation proves its theft, though it incorrectly lists Fong as the owner. Using a third party, the car was resold to a man in Chicago before leaving the country and finding homes in German and the Netherlands among other places. In those homes were wealthy car enthusiasts, one of whom apparently bought the car at auction for $4.7million in 1989. The highest profile appearance of the car came when it was displayed at the Blackhawk Museum in Danville, California. According to Jalopnik, Lee Kun-hee, the billionaire chairman of Samsung bought the car in the mid-1990s. While Mr Kun-hee is based in South Korea- where he is one of the most powerful people in the country- he is thought to have initially left the car in America to avoid high import taxes, though there is speculation that the car eventually made its way over the Ocean and out of American legal jurisdiction. The case is currently ongoing and has open files in the local Atlanta police files, in the FBI and in Interpol. Proof: This is the record which shows the car was stolen while under the possession of dealer Donald Fong .","One of the only four 1962 Ferrari 330 LM-B ever created was stolen in Atlanta in 1977 .
That racing model was the last of the brand to have a front-engine and is currently valued at $15million .

If youâve arranged a romantic meal at a swanky restaurant but canât tell a Pinot Noir from a Merlot, thereâs a device that could spare you your blushes â and impress your other half. An app for smartphones promises to match your meal with the perfect wine. Developed by a lecturer in wine studies from University College Birmingham, the app requires users to simply type in the food they are about to eat and the most suitable wine is recommended. Helping hand: Lecturer Amy Hollier who has designed an app for matching wine with food . Creator Amy Hollier said she hoped the app, called Wine Find, would put a stop to the snobbery surrounding wine. For 69p and the investment of a small amount of time, it is possible to transform your knowledge of grape varieties and drinking styles in order to get the best out of the dining experience. Amy Hollier's app provides a wine for almost every conceivable dish. You can also search by wine to find the right dish to go with your selected bottle. Here are some examples: . FURRED GAME (including venison, hare, wild boar and rabbit: The app suggests wines made with mourvhdre and cabernet franc grapes or a syrah-based Cornas from the Rhone .

University College Birmingham and takes wine studies and a senior role . in training budding waiters and waitresses in front of house service. The app, developed in partnership with Halesown-based Smartphone Media, works as both a training tool for hospitality students, a point of reference for industry professionals and a bank of knowledge for anyone who loves food and wine but isnât sure how to get the best out of both. The beauty of having a âportableâ app is that diners can check for recommendations while sitting in a restaurant. If you donât want to let anyone else in on where your amazing knowledge of the flavours and the food-matching potential of sangiovese, petit verdot and mourvhdre comes from, simply excuse yourself from the table, nip to the loos and hit Wine Find on your iPhone. Amy saw a gap in the market after discovering that the majority of wine apps were American-based. They were great at matching zinfandel to hot dogs but not so helpful with recommending what to glug with rabbit stew. Amyâs app, incidentally, has a comprehensive section of âfurred gameâ (as well as âfeathered gameâ) including venison, hare, wild boar and rabbit (for which she suggests wines made with mourvhdre and cabernet franc grapes or a syrah-based Cornas from the Rhone). Explaining her motivation for the project, Amy says: âPeople are always phoning me or texting me and saying âWhat is a nice bottle of wine?â and âWhat will it go with?â and I thought there must be a way round it.â Ask the expert: The app, shown here on an iPad screen, lets you pick either wines or foods to find parings for .

Wine is about socialising and enjoying what you are drinking. A lot of effort goes into making wine so it is nice to find out more about it.â Prof Ray Linforth, UCB principal, who backed Amyâs project, says: âAlongside being a fun, lifestyle app for wine enthusiasts, Wine Find will be a very useful educational teaching tool to help hospitality students improve their knowledge and ultimately enhance their confidence when advising diners and creating menus.â","An app for smartphones has been developed to match wines to food .

The remains of a young female body found in a shallow grave in 1969 have been identified as those of a 14-year-old girl who vanished a year before, in 1968. Cold case detectives announced yesterday that they identified the remains of Elizabeth Ernstein through DNA matching. The teenager vanished in March of 1968 while walking home from school, and left no clues as to what happened. The case of the missing girl sparked national attention as Ernsteinâs parents launched a desperate search for their young daughter. Her parents, Ruth and Norman Ernstein, spent thousands of dollars in the months following their daughterâs disappearance to alert the media of Elizabethâs story. Mrs Ernsteine told a newspaper in December of 1968: âI can face the daytime better than the night,â adding, âAt night, I find myself asking: is she safe? Is she warm? Is she being fed? And finallyâ¦is she alive?â A coronerâs personal statement issued Friday read: âThe case took on national attention with news media covering the story from across the nation. Her disappearance went unsolved.â Sent out: Ernstein's parents Norman and Ruth, centre right and far right, sent out 10,200 letters to newspapers throughout the U.S. and Canada in hopes of finding their daughter . Fated afternoon: She was walking back from Moore Junior High School in Redlands, only two miles from her house, but never returned home . According to the Redlands-LomaLinda Patch, the unidentified remains were exhumed in 2011 and DNA tested. Authorities knew the body belonged to a young person, but had few other leads. It wasnât until this year that detectives tested Ernsteinâs siblings for a possible DNA match. Desperate: Ernstein's family offered thousands of dollars in reward money for any information . The coronerâs report states that her siblingsâ DNA was a match to the remains found in the shallow grave in 1969. Investigators did not reveal how Ernstein died, but they said that it is a murder case. On March 18, 1968, Ernstein was walking home from Moore Junior High School in Redlands, California. She was wearing a khaki jacket, blue dress, tennis shoes, and a gold necklace with a blue star, according to reports at the time. Her walk should have been a peaceful one â she lived two miles away, and her closest route was through an orange grove. But Ernstein never returned home. Her disappearance was one that would haunt Redlands for decades. Mrs Ernstein once said the months of uncertainty âare the deepest anguish a person can go through. Itâs a shock so deep â you become wooden.â Mr Ernstein added: âThis is the second tragedy in our lives, is even greater because of the uncertainty. I can accept anything, even the worst, which Iâm resigned to, but I must know.â In 1952, the couple lost a son to polio. Always searching: The Ernsteins sent out 10,200 letters to newspapers around the country, garnering national attention . Mr Ernstein worked as a chemical engineer for Lockheed, and his wife worked as a psychiatric social worker. At the time, they had posted a $5,000 reward for any information concerning their daughterâs whereabouts. They also sent out 10,200 letters to newspapers throughout the U.S. and Canada to reach the largest audience possible. According to a census report, Mr Ernstein died in 1997 in San Bernadino. No records were available for Mrs Ernstein.","Elizabeth Ernstein vanished in 1968 while walking home from school .

House prices rose by a 'surprising' 1.3 per cent - the biggest monthly increase in more than two-and-a-half years. Figures released by Nationwide revealed that the average house price is now Â£164,729,Â  reversing declines recorded over the previous two months. It is the biggest monthly increase since January 2010, the building society said. Increase: House prices rose by a 'surprising' 1.3 per cent - the biggest monthly increase in more than two-and-a-half years . However, prices are still 0.7 per cent lower than they were a year ago and the market remains volatile against the tough economic backdrop. Britain's biggest building . society also highlighted how many first-time buyers continue to be . prevented from getting onto the property ladder by big deposit demands. The . average new homeowner currently has to put down a 20 per cent deposit - . double the level seen before the financial crisis hit. Recent house price studies have highlighted the difficult and unpredictable nature of the market, often with strong regional variations. Rise: Figures released by Nationwide also revealed that the average house price is now Â£164,729. This is a file picture of a woman looking to buy a house . Property analyst Hometrack predicted earlier this week that prices will come under downward pressure for the rest of the year due to relatively weak buyer demand compared with the number of homes on the market. Analysts have said they have seen little evidence so far that a recently-launched funding for lending scheme by the Bank of England and the Treasury has done much to increase the availability of mortgages for people with lower deposits and first-time buyers, with the choice available shrinking back over the last six months. The scheme has not stopped Nationwide and Santander announcing some increases to their mortgage rates. In an indication of what is to come, Bank of England figures published yesterday showed that mortgage approvals increased slightly in July compared with an 18-month low recorded in June. Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: 'Given the difficult economic backdrop, the extent of the rebound in August is a little surprising. 'However, we should never read too much into one month's data, especially since monthly price changes have been impacted by a number of one-off factors this year, such as the ending of the stamp duty holiday for first time buyers.' He said the fact that the annual . decline has slowed down from a 2.6 per cent drop recorded in July . provides some evidence that the market is 'fairly stable'. Mr . Gardner said: 'This may be explained by the surprising resilience . evident in the UK labour market, with further increases in employment in . recent months, even though the UK economy has remained in recession.' Flatlining: House prices have remained relatively stable after the bounce back from the 2008 to 2009 lows ended. Mr Gardner said that the future of the housing market will be strongly affected by what happens in the labour market. He said: 'House prices are expected to . remain fairly stable over the next two years, while incomes are likely . to continue to rise gradually, which will also help to support . affordability.' Nationwide . highlighted the 'marked differences' between today's market, where the . average first-time buyer needs to raise a 20 per cent deposit, compared . with conditions between 2005 and 2007, when a 10 per cent deposit was . typically put down. Then and now: How the market compares for first-time buyers . The number of mortgage approvals is running at around 50,000 a month, roughly half the level between 2005 and 2007. For those who manage to get on the property ladder, low interest rates and house price falls mean that monthly repayments for a first-time buyer with a 20 per cent deposit have declined to around 29 per cent of take home pay typically, down from 40 per cent before the financial crisis struck, Nationwide said. More affordable: Property is slightly cheaper than the 2005 to 2007 average and mortgage rates are lower.","Figures released by Nationwide revealed the average house price is now Â£164,729 - the biggest monthly increase since January 2010 .

Similarities: A number of parents are concerned because their 'beautiful' girls look just like Suri Cruise and they fear that their daughters will be mistaken for the young star . With the first day of school for Suri Cruise only a week away, the famous youngster has surely planned out what shoes match her new uniform. But it isn't the dress code that has parents at the elite Avenues school concerned, as they fear that their own children are going to be overwrought with media attention once the school year begins. 'I had two different parents call to tell me their children are beautiful young girls that look like Suri,' education consultant Dana Haddad said. 'The girls will all be in uniforms, and they're worried their daughters will be mistaken for Suri by the paparazzi outside the school,' she told the New York Post's Page Six magazine. The concern comes from parents who are paying $39,750-per-year to send their children to the brand-new Avenues school which will open next week in the Chelsea highline, just blocks from the apartment where Suri and her mother Katie holmes share since Holmes filed for divorce from ex-husband Tom Cruise. Aimed at the children of the jetsetting elite 'The World School' enables pupils to follow their parents around the globe without being tied to school vacation schedules. A source told Life & Style magazine: 'Katie has eagerly been telling Suri all about the lunchrooms, basketball courts and different activities Avenues offers. Suri's really excited about it.' The imposing school building will have a rooftop playground,Â  along with a main gym that includes full-size basketball and volleyball courts. Start of school: Suri will attend Avenues, a brand-new school on Chelsea's high line, which will be one of many that will span five continents allowing children to travel according to their parents schedules . Suri had been expected to attend an exclusive Catholic school but her mother's choice has certain advantages. The website boasts that it is a step better than 'national' schools such as Britain's Eton. 'If ""local"" schools are the first step in the evolution of schooling and ""national"" schools are the second step, the decades ahead are likely to bring the third step: global schools. 'Thirty years from now there will likely be a number of such organizations. Avenues plans to be the best of this new breed of educational institution - hence its subtitle: The World School.' And with campuses planned for China, India, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australia Suri will certainly be able to study around the globe. Along with high academic standards the school claims it will also teach pupils life skills, an advantage to children as sheltered as Suri. New York ladies: Since her split from Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes and Suri have been seen around Manhattan, and the young girl has taken gymnastics classes at Chelsea Piers (right) 'Avenues will embrace practical matters so often ignored by academic institutions,' it says. 'Students will become comfortable with a variety of life skills, including practical matters such as time management and technological competency.' The youngster is no stranger to travel, with her father Tom Cruise shuttling her around in his private jet and helicopter. He is also looking to find a new 'secluded' property in New York, so that he can spend plenty of time with Suri following his divorce from Katie. A source previously said: 'He wants something extremely secluded where Suri can play without paparazzi watching. There are lots of them in these towns.' Although the Hollywood superstar is keeping the couple'sÂ  former home in Beverly Hills - which he shares with his 17-year-old son Connor - he is determined to have a permanent base in New York for his time with Suri.","Parents think that their daughters look just like Suri Cruise and will be mistaken for the young star because they will all be wearing uniforms .

A record 2.2million customers complained to Britainâs biggest banks in the first six months of the year â an average of one every seven seconds. The big high street names â Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Santander and HSBC â were deluged with complaints about mis-sold insurance, investments and mortgages, official figures revealed yesterday. The biggest offender was Lloyds Banking Group, which includes Lloyds TSB, Halifax and Bank of Scotland. Under fire: A record 2.2m customers complained to Britain's biggest banks in the first six months of the year with the biggest offender being Lloyds Banking Group . Complaints leapt between January and June this year to 858,850 â a 145 per cent increase on the same period in 2011. And state-backed rival RBS, which owns NatWest, received 491,735 complaints in the same period. Customer confidence in Britainâs scandal hit banks is at an all-time low. They have been forced to compensate millions of customers sold useless payment protection insurance â a type of cover taken out with loans and credit cards. Barclays has been found guilty of rigging interbank lending rates and fined Â£290million. It also faces a Serious Fraud Office investigation into its Â£4.5million capital injection from Qatari investors during the credit crunch. In June up to 12million RBS customers were locked out of their current accounts after a computer problem. Justin Modray, of financial website CandidMoney, said: âBanks seem to have a total disregard for their customers. âThey might project a friendly face, but behind the scenes theyâre pressuring staff to hit ambitious sales targets which inevitably leads to mis-selling, a key cause for complaint. âThereâs too much focus on short term profits to support fat bonuses and appease impatient shareholders. Until that culture changes the complaints will keep on rolling in.â Poor performer: RBS, which owns NatWest, received 491,735 complaints between January and June this year . Marc Gander, founder of campaigning organisation the Consumer Action Group, said: âOnce again complaints have reached new record levels, yet the banks try to tell us that everything is better than it really is. âBanks treat us as cash cows and take us for fools but no one is surprised anymore. We need some real competition on the high street.â The Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, requires banks to publish the number of complaints they have received every six months. The latest figures, for January to June this year, reflect the millions of customers who have complained about mis-sold PPI. Banks have set aside an estimated Â£9billion to refund these customers. Barclays, which this week announced a new chief executive, Antony Jenkins, on an Â£8.6million pay package, received 442,266 complaints, an increase of 76 per cent. Mr Jenkins was boss of the bankâs credit card arm, Barclaycard, during the time of the PPI mis-selling. Spanish bank Santander received 240,597 complaints, and HSBC 170,926 complaints. This week, customers of Ulster Bank â part of RBS âÂ  were offered Â£19 compensation after the computer crash in June left customers locked out of their accounts for a whole month. The small payouts will be handed over to personal current account holders who were forced to visit a branch to carry out a transaction during the IT crisis between June 19 and July 18. In contrast, Ross McEwan, its new retail banking boss who will oversee current accounts and other products, is to receive a Â£3.2million golden hello. The banks argue many of the complaints about payment protection insurance are not valid and are submitted by customers who are hoping for a compensation pay out but were not mis-sold their policies. A spokesman for the British Bankersâ Association said: âBanks take customer complaints very seriously and are working hard to ensure they offer customers high quality products and services. âBut, despite all efforts and in an industry which processes millions of transactions every single day, things regrettably can sometimes go wrong. âNo one likes to feel they have let their customers down but there is much to be learned from complaints data and our members will be using the information to help make things better.â",Grievances about Lloyds leap 145% from January to June compared to last year .

Manchester City footballer Courtney Meppen-Walter has been released on bail after being arrested over the deaths of a brother and sister in a road crash, police said. Driver Kulwant Singh, 32, was killed with his sister Ravel-Kaur Singh, 37, when their red Nissan Micra collided with a silver Mercedes which the Premier League player, 18, was driving. A second man, aged 19, who was driving a grey Volkswagen Golf, was also arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and has been bailed.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'Two men arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving following a fatal collision in north Manchester have been bailed.' Ms Singh's sons, named by relatives as Amjit, 17, and Harveen, 16, were in the back seat of the Nissan Micra during the crash, and both suffered head injuries. Amjit was last night in a critical condition at Salford Royal Hospital, but his younger brotherâs head injury was not thought to be life-threatening. The teenagers are understood to have lost their father some years ago. Meppen-Walter, who turned 18 last month, had written on Twitter about passing his driving test at the first attempt and his excitement about getting his first car.

Tragic: Dominick Andujor, six, died in his bed after an attacker broke into his house and slashed his throat . A six-year-old boy has been killed and his 12-year-old sister left in critical condition on her birthday after their throats were slashed open by an intruder while they slept in their beds. Police say the attacker broke into the children's house in Camden, New Jersey, about 2.30am and stole into an upstairs bedroom, where he savaged the two children. After she was attacked, Amber Andujor ran through her neighborhood screaming for help - her throat cut open and bleeding profusely. She was rushed to the hospital, where she was fighting for her life in critical condition on her birthday. Her brother Dominick, six, died in the house. Amber identified her attacker as 'Popi,' the son of a local preacher who is often seen playing with neighborhood children, NBC Philadelphia reported. The man, in his earlier 20s, lives just a few doors down from the children. Police arrested him Sunday evening after a massive city-wide manhunt. Neighbors told the TV station that the man had a dispute with the children's mother two months ago. She was at a hospital for surgery on Sunday and was not home at the time of the attack. The children's 14-year-old sister was looking after them. She was asleep at the time. A third sister in the house was also uninjured. After the attack, the girl ran out of the house and began pounding on doors, screaming for help. Scroll down for video . Manhunt: Police searched for the attacker all Sunday before finally tracking him down in the evening and arresting him . Shocking: The attack deeply shook resident of Camden, New Jersey, the murder capital of the nation . She banged on several doors until neighbor Nakyta McCray woke up and found her, barely alive. 'I went to the house and saw her sitting there with her throat cut open and barely breathing,' she told ABC Philadelphia. Even gravely injured, Amber was able to identify her attacker, authorities said. Popi is a well-known figure in the neighborhood, who lives at the end of the block where the attack occurred. Neighbors say he often gives children haircuts and is trusted by parents. 'Everybody knows him. Heâs on this block everyday; playing with the kids, talking to some of the adults. Itâs very shocking,' Ms McCray told CBS Philadelphia. Horrific: The 12-year-old ran door to door in her neighborhood screaming for help after she had her throat cut open . Even in Camden, a beleaguered city with the highest murder rate in the United States, this brutal attack shocked residents. 'I can't sleep. It could have been anybody's child, not just her. My prayers go out to the family. I'm praying for her, I just hope that she makes it,' Karina Mejia told ABC Philadelphia. A makeshift memorial of flowers and teddy bears sprang up on the block where Dominick was murdered. Dominick and his sisters spent much of the summer at the local community center, where he had breakfast and lunch and liked doing arts and crafts. 'He had fun all summer.

New rules: Powers to make it easier for head teachers in England to sack under performing staff are to be introduced this week . Earlier this year Mr Gove vowed to crack down on what he called the âdance of the lemonsâ, where failed teachers turn up at a new school and get a job by presenting well at an interview. âIt is only after a term or two the head recognises they have taken on a lemon,â he added. If you are applying for a job when youâve been subject to capability procedures, youâll have to say so under new legislation. âThe single most important thing in a childâs performance is the quality of the teacher. Making sure a child spends the maximum amount of time with inspirational teachers is the most important thing. âThe evidence is quite clear: if youâre with a bad teacher, you can go back a year; if youâre with a good teacher you can leap ahead a year.â The Sunday Telegraph reported that out of the 5,000 schools inspected last year, 36 per cent of primary schools and 34 per cent of secondaries were deemed 'satisfactoryâ or below. The quality of teaching was not good enough in 38 per cent and poor in 3 per cent. Primary school children will be required to read to inspectors in a shakeup of the Ofsted regime, to ensure by the time they reach secondary school their reading level will be satisfactory. Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the newspaper: 'No other profession would accept this level of scrutiny and mistrust. When news of the crackdown surfaced earlier this yearÂ  Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, the largest teaching union, said: âThis is yet another depressingly predictable announcement from a Government seemingly intent on destroying the teaching profession and state education. âThe draconian measures announced today are totally unnecessary. There is no evidence which demonstrates that there are problems with the current system. âThis announcement will only serve further to devastate teacher morale and endanger future recruitment to the profession and the retention of existing teachers.â","Children of all ages in primary school will read to Ofsted inspectors .

A police officer in Miami-Dade has been arrested by FBI agents for allegedly pulling over women drivers without probable cause so he could have âsexually suggestive conversationsâ with them. Prabhainjana Dwivedi, a seven-year veteran of the police force, was apprehended at police headquarters, putting him squarely on the other side of the law. The complaint states that the 33-year-old deprived people of their civil rights after asking multiple women to expose their breasts and invite him into their homes â and never issue a citation. Scroll down for video . Inappropriate questioning: Prabhainjana Dwivedi has been charged by FBI officials with civil rights violations after allegedly asking women to expose their breasts . According to the complaint obtained by the Maim Herald, Dwivedi had been acting in this reprobate manner for some time, keeping female drivers for âunreasonableâ amounts of time and then not issuing a citation. In some cases, he didnât even ask for licence and registration. The FBI complaint states that last spring, the officer stopped a young woman leaving a night club. She told investigators that he claimed her headlights were not on and that she was drunk, though she denied both claims. According to the complaint, Dwivdi asked her to sit in the back of his patrol car and unzip her dress to her mid-section, partially exposing her breasts. The woman, identified as A.R., said that he kept her for an hour and a half before eventually letting her go without a citation. According to the Herald, he did not list the stop on his nightly activity report. On the same night, he stopped a bartender who was driving home after a late night of work. The woman, identified as M.F., said that Dwivdi asked if she had any pictures of her surgically-enhanced breasts, the complaint reads. Walk of shame: Exclusive video footage shot by CBS Miami shows the Miami-Dade officer walking out of federal court, using court papers to partially cover his face . Apprehended: He was arrested at the Miami-Dade police headquarters on Wednesday . He then followed up by asking her to see the scars from her breast-enhancement surgery, M.F. said. The woman told FBI investigators that the police officer then touched her breast, and at one point during the encounter, pulled the zipper to his trousers down. The affidavit then reads that Dwivdi told M.F. he was going to follow her home to make sure she got back safely, but then asked for a drink once she arrived. M.F. said that he stayed for an hour, discussing his personal life. Another complaint from June of 2011 alleges that he held two women and their boyfriends after accusing them of trespassing. A woman, M.M. said that he then asked what kind of underwear she was wearing and pointed his flashlight at her cleavage. The alleged civil rights violations took place between May and June of 2011. A spokesperson for the Miami-Dade police department told CBS Miami that the officer has been relieved of his duty, but his pay is pending based on the juryâs decision.

The Implanon device slowly releases a hormone into the bloodstream which gives contraceptive protection for up to three years . Hundreds of women have had their fertility put in jeopardy after a popular contraceptive implant was apparently 'lost' in their bodies. The problem with the Implanon device could also force hundreds more to delay their dreams of motherhood. The implant, which is used by hundreds of thousands of women in the U.S. and abroad, is the size of a matchstick and is inserted under the skin of the upper arm, in a procedure that needs to be carried out by a trained doctor. After use, the device is meant to be removed. It can also be taken out of the body sooner if the woman desires to try and get pregnant, or for health reasons. However, a number of worried women have . revealed on online forums that doctors have been unable to locate their . implants - raising fears they may never be able to conceive. One woman wrote on Yahoo last year that a doctor couldnât find the implant after a half hour of digging around, and told her to return later. When she did, the doctor tried finding the birth control for another 40 minutes, to no avail.The woman, identified as Carrie P., wrote: âMy arm is bruised, so sore, infected, and swollen. They said they had to find a special ultra sound to find it because a regular ultrasound or X-ray will not pick it up.â She said she was worried about the possibility of having another surgery from all of the scar tissue. Another user who had the implant for eight months responded that her implant was deeply embedded in her arm, and it took the doctor nearly two hours to get it out. She said she still felt the effects of the implant even after it was taken out, citing irregular periods. Not perfect: While Implanon is one of the most effective forms of birth control, there are several things that can go wrong, especially during insertion . One user wrote on the Baby-Gaga forum that they decided to remove the implant because of weight gain, a possible side effect from the hormones. She wrote of the ordeal to get it out, which included two visits to her doctor and painful healing. Licensed in 1999, Implanon has become a Â­popular form of Â­contraception. The device, which costs around $400, is a flexible rod the size of a matchstick that is inserted under the skin of the upper arm. It gradually releases the hormone progesterone, which stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and makes the womb less receptive to fertilized eggs. It provides protection against pregnancy for up to three years and properly inserted it is 99.95 per cent effective among all users, compared with 99.7 per cent for the Pill. But investigations showed in some cases the implant was not released from the pre-loaded applicator and never inserted into the arm of the patient. In other women it was delivered too deep to work properly. Side effects of the implant are most often irregular bleeding, though some women reported more serious side effects, such as irregular bleeding, weight gain, change in appetite and sex drive, depression, scarring on skin, nausea, nervousness, pain at site of implant, and headache. The woman concluded: âI really liked . the implant but I was never warned of the position I could now be in. I . am awaiting a plastic surgeon to have a go, but to be honest don't hold . out much help. If anyone had warned me that my fertility could have been . at risk before I had this procedure I would have stayed on the pill.â Nici, a woman living in the U.K., . told the Sun that she picked the implant because her doctor said it was . highly effective and easily reversible. However, when Nici, 37, wanted it . removed because she wanted children, the doctor could not find it to . remove the implant. A second doctor had no luck either. She told the Sun that her hopes for a . baby were dwindling. âThe implant can last five years,â she lamented. âI am left with no chance of having children.â A representative from Merck said in a statement to MailOnline: 'On the rare occasion that an implant cannot be located by the doctor or nurse feeling for the implant prior to an attempted removal and an ENG (hormone) test is positive, indicating that an implant has previously been inserted, there are various methods which can be used to help locate the implant. 'These include ultra-sound and MRI scanning. MSD would always advise women with any concerns to contact their healthcare professional or call the implant helpline number on the user card given to women when they have the implant inserted.' It is the latest setback for the . contraceptive method, which is manufactured by Merck, after a number of women using the device last year . found they still became pregnant. Over three years Implanon releases the hormone progesterone into the blood, which stops the ovaries from releasing eggs and makes the . womb less receptive. But almost 600 pregnancies were reported by women who had used the contraceptive method. The rod is made from a biodegradable . synthetic material, which experts say should not cause any health . problems, however a number of women have expressed their fears over . potential problems that might arise. The controversial implants first hit . the news last year when a group of women launched legal action after . they received the device but still became pregnant. A total of 584 women who had the small rod inserted in their . arms reported unwanted pregnancies to the Medicines and Healthcare . Regulatory Agency â a watchdog group for drugs and medical devices in the United Kingdom. The MHRA found in some cases that the device had not been inserted at all. Invisible: The synthetic device is just over an inch long and doesn't show up under X-rays . The watchdog received 1,607 complaints about the . implant going wrong, some from doctors deeply concerned that it is impossible to check if they are . correctly installed because they are invisible to X-rays. Implanonâs . manufacturer MSD, a subsidiary of global pharmaceutical giant Merck, . has now replaced it with an updated product called Nexplanon, which has a . new pre-loaded applicator and contains barium so it can be detected by X-ray or CT scan. However, it has not recalled the existing stock of Implanon, meaning women are still being given it. Bedsider.org, a private nonprofit organization, confirms there have been reports of problems with inserting and removing Implanon. However, the website advises that women who feel uncomfortable their implant to seek their OB/GYN for assistance. A spokesman for Implanon's U.S manufacturer Merck, told The Sun: 'On . the rare occasion that the implant cannot be located by the doctor or . nurse feeling for the implant prior to its removal, there are various . methods which can be used to help locate the implant such as ultra-sound . scanning and MRI.

'We . would always advise women to contact their healthcare professional or . call the implant helpline number on the user card given to women when . they have the implant inserted.'

They say a pot of gold lies at the end of every rainbow - but finding a hoard of 200-year-old silver in a pile of rubbish has got to be almost as unlikely. That's exactly what lucky gardener Chris Allen did when he decided to clear up litter dumped near his allotment in Derbyshire. While he was removing the plastic bags the bottom fell out of one to reveal a collection of high quality Georgian silverware worth hundreds of pounds. Hoard: Gardener Chris Allen could not believe his luck when he found this stash of beautiful silverware in a bag of rubbish . Sparkling: The collection included an assortment of decorative dinnerware . The haul included a 48-piece dinner service of dessert spoons, dessert forks, table forks, and serving spoons, as well as grape scissors, a mustard spoon a pearl-handled button hook and solid silver shoe horn. Honest Mr Allen, of Ashbourne, Derbyshire, handed it all in to police as lost property back in March but it went unclaimed. He decided to auction the collection off, and split the proceeds between two charities - the Derbyshire Air Ambulance and Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station, in Wales, where he and wife Noreen often holiday. 'As I picked up one of the bags the bottom fell out and what I had assumed to be a bag full of rubbish turned out to be a carrier bag full of Georgian silver,â said Chris, a former Marine. 'I was of course amazed to think that these beautiful pieces of silver had been lying forgotten in a field and I took them all immediately to the police station. 'It was the summer we had in March and I was working in the field and there was just polystyrene and chip wrappers lying about. 'I thought while it was nice itâs a shame for it to make a mess, so I thought Iâll just tidy the place up a little bit. I picked up this carrier bag and it burst and all this silver fell out.' Honest: Mr Allen took the hoard to the police in case the owner came forward - but was eventually given it back. Among the items found was a silver shoehorn (pictured) Mr Allen continued to try to find the owner of the silver after nobody came forward to claim it from the police. 'I carried on making inquiries on the internet and on our local radio and in our local newspaper, but still no one seemed to know anything about the silver,' he said. 'I decided then to do something worthwhile with my find and took the whole lot of silver to be auctioned at our local auctioneers Fiddler and Taylor.' Mr Allen said the auctioneers were so impressed with his story that they did not charge any commission. Generous: He eventually auctioned off the collection and donated the money to charity. Here Mr Allen (left, holding the cheque) and his wife Noreen (far left) hand over a cheque for Â£400 to Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station . The items were sold off to collectors in different lots and the silver eventually made Â£530 at auction, with donations bringing the total up to Â£800. 'My wife Noreen and I love coming to Aberdyfi on holiday so we decided to donate half the amount - Â£400 - to Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station and the other Â£400 to our home Air Ambulance of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Rutland,' said Mr Allen. 'We are very pleased that this unexpected find will benefit some very worthwhile causes and we would also like to thank everyone who made a donation.' Dave Williams, operations manager of Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station, said: '[We] are especially pleased that Chris and Noreen Allen wanted to give something to Aberdyfi Lifeboat Station with the proceeds from this very unexpected find and we are very grateful to them.'","Georgian silverware falls out of bag of rubbish .

In court: Ian Chaundy (left - pictured today), 48, is accused of shoving Paul Carscadden (right), 40, off a pavement in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, following âteasing and banterâ on a night in June 2011 . The couple, who shared a Â£600,000 Georgian house in the town, had been on a night out with two male friends when they argued over their pet pooch. Alan Kent QC, prosecuting, said: âThis is the case of a man in his early 40s, killed by his partner, the defendant, in what was undoubtedly a moment of madness he will regret for the rest of his life. âPaul Carscadden left the restaurant early. The defendant (Chaundy) did not want him to leave, so he followed him. The defendant told him they were only going to leave in 10 minutes so he should stay. âThe friends they were out with had come all the way from Devon to come out with them, but Paul Carscadden wanted to leave to make sure the pet Beagle was OK. âThey argued, the defendant still did . not want him to leave, but he did. The defendant pushed him, causing him . to fall into the road, right in the path of an oncoming bus. He was . killed almost instantly.â The bus driver and onlookers called . police and paramedics straight away. Chaundy ran back into the . restaurant to get help and friends comforted him as he cried, Mr Kent . told the court. Scene: The Indian restaurant - Ali's Curry House - in Royal Leamington Spa where the incident took place . The court was told that Chaundy said: âI . killed him, I killed him, I pushed him, I love him, I didnât mean to . kill him, I killed him. We were so happy, then we started arguing and I . pushed him, I did it, I pushed him, heâs dead, I killed him.â 'I killed him, I killed him, I pushed . him, I love him, I didnât mean to kill him, I killed him. We were so . happy, then we started arguing and I pushed him, I did it, I pushed him, . heâs dead, I killed him' What court was told Ian Chaundy said after death of lover Paul Carscadden . Mr Kent added that âa deliberate push by the defendant causing his partner to fallâ was caught on CCTV - but Chaundy, who stands 10 inches taller than Mr Carscadden, could not remember this. He said Chaundy told the police in . interview that he couldnât recall the push, but âassumed he did push . himâ, before later saying he didnât âspecifically remember pushing himâ. The jury saw CCTV footage from a . nearby tattoo parlour of the moment Chaundy is accused of pushing his . lover of 10 years to his death. As . the footage was shown Mr Carscaddenâs family wept in the public . gallery. Chaundy meanwhile - wearing a black suit, blue shirt and blue . tie - stared at the floor. It showed two men facing each other . as cars passed along the road. One of the men started to walk past the . other and was pushed into the road just at the bus appeared. The bus driver, Felicabella Marquez, tried to swerve to avoid hitting Mr Carscadden but he was killed instantly. Ian Chaundy's son, Hayden, 20, whom . he fathered before he met Mr Carscadden, told the court the couple were . âvery lovingâ, although they had the âodd argument over petty little . thingsâ. 'This is the case of a man in his early 40s, killed by his partner, the defendant, in what was undoubtedly a moment of madness he will regret for the rest of his life' Alan Kent QC, prosecuting . He said: âThey loved each other very much - I could tell that from the moment I met Paul. I lived with them for a year-and-a-half and my father and Paul were devoted to each other.â Hayden told the court he had been with the couple on the night of the murder, when they had enjoyed a few drinks in the pub before heading to the Indian restaurant. He added: âLater on, just after the bill had arrived, Paul said he was going to go home and as he left the building, he turned the wrong way for the house. So I told my dad to go and get him. âIt was only about 15 seconds later when he ran back in and said that Paul had gone under a bus. He was distraught. I went outside and saw Paul under the bus. âDad went away around the corner as he was in tears. One of the group told me Paul had died and I should go break the news to my dad, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him that.â A friend who had also been there that . night, Dennis Leabrook, told the court he had seen Chaundy with his hand . on the victim's face when they were outside the restaurant. 'I had known them for many years each, they loved each other very much. They were just a brilliant, brilliant couple. Paul had a wicked sense of humour' Dennis Leabrook, friend . He said: âI had known them for many years each, they loved each other very much. They were just a brilliant, brilliant couple. Paul had a wicked sense of humour. âPaul used to like a drink, vodka and red wine normally, and Ian would sometimes frogmarch him out of the pub when it was time to go and Paul didn't want to leave. âThat night we'd had a lovely evening, Paul left - I didn't hear why - Ian followed him outside and I glanced them there in front of the window having a conversation. âThey briefly disappeared and then came back and then I think I saw Ian's hand on Paul's chin, his hand across the front with a thumb one cheek and his fingers the other. âI didn't see them again until Ian came running in saying âPaul's gone under a busâ. I took Ian and Hayden away because Ian was just beside himself with grief - he didn't know what to do.â Chaundy, who was on bail, denies murder and manslaughter. The trial continues.

A family doctor has been accused of forcing a vulnerable patient to have sex with him in return for a sick note that would allow her to continue claiming benefits. Dr Abdulrazaq Abdullah has been suspended over claims he rubbed the woman's breasts and told her the only way he would sign her off sick was if she had sex with him at his Rainham Health Centre, in Essex. The woman, who is reportedly a victim of domestic violence, said she submitted to the 60-year-old . GPâs will, but refused to have sex with him a second time. Dr Abdulrazaq Abdullah was accused of rubbing a patient's breasts and telling her the only way he would sign her off sick was if she had sex with him at his Rainham Health Centre, in Essex (pictured) She claimed Dr Adbullah, who today failed in a High Court bid to get back to work, paid her Â£40 and told her to come to him if she needed money. Dr Abdullah, who has a blemish-free professional record, absolutely denies the womanâs claims which he says left him 'extremely shocked'. Pointing to inconsistencies in her account, he says it is so 'full of holes' and 'patently flawed' that it simply cannot be believed. After a criminal investigation of the womanâs claims, police said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Dr Abdullah for rape or any other sexual offence and the local primary care trust also decided not to suspend him, Londonâs High Court heard . However, the General Medical Council (GMC) took a different view and, in July, suspended the GP from practising medicine for 18 months pending a full disciplinary investigation. Top judge, Mr Justice Lindblom, has now rejected Dr Abdullahâs appeal against his suspension - which he ruled proportionate and necessary for the protection of the public - but reduced the period of his suspension from 18 to 12 months. Emphasising that the womanâs claims are 'at the moment mere allegations' which had not been proved, the judge said whether or not she is telling the truth will emerge when she is put to the test at a full GMC disciplinary hearing. Pointing to the overriding need to maintain public confidence in the medical profession, the judge said the allegations faced by the GP were 'indisputably very serious' and were not so vague or inconsistent as to justify no action being taken. He concluded: 'In my view, therefore, the decision to suspend in this case was sound. Its rationale is cogent and I agree with it'. However, going on to reduce the period Dr Abdullahâs suspension, the judge said the 18-month order made in July was 'excessive' and any longer than 12 months would be disproportionate.","Police said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute .

But now online abuse and identify theft have become so common that social media users are being sold specialist insurance to help protect their reputation in case of an attack. Hacking of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media accounts - where another user logs in and posts derogatory or offensive messages - can cause huge damage to an individual or businessâs image. Protection: Hacking of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social media accounts can cause huge damage to an individual or business's image . A UK-based information privacy company has launched the countryâs first social media insurance to specifically protect against reputational damage, account jacking and ID theft. Justin Basini, CEO of the company providing the service, ALLOW, said that insurance âperhaps wouldnât have been needed a few years ago.â He added: âThatâs all changed now. Every internet user faces a certain level of risk that one day a digital criminal will target them or that they will suffer damage to their reputation.â The cover - at a cost of Â£3.99 a month - will pay for legal advice and support if someone suffers an online attack and seeks some form of redress. It includes the cost of disabling accounts, suppressing offensive material and stopping any legal action triggered by hacking, for example if a hacker posts illegal material under a victimâs name. Mother-of-one Nicola Brookes was hounded for nine months by anonymous bullies who set up a Facebook profile in her name and set explicit messages to children, after she wrote an innocent message of support for an X Factor contestant online. Social networks: Online abuse and identify theft are so common that social media users are being sold specialist insurance to help protect their reputation . The fake profile, which featured her picture and email address, falsely described her as a drug dealer, prostitute and child abuser. Her email address was also hacked and her home address was published by internet trolls. 'My name is my brand. If someone were to impersonate me online then it would cause damage to my business. It would really help to have experts on call in that sort of situation, because youâd just want the damage repaired ASAP' Ian Giles, marketing consultant . Miss Brookes, 45, won a landmark legal case to compel Facebook to release the bulliesâ details in June and hopes to bring private prosecutions against them. Her legal action would have cost her Â£5,000 but her solicitors Bains Cohen agreed to represent her for free because of her horrific ordeal. As the number of similar cases rises and the likelihood of solicitors taking on more work pro bono diminishes, more people may be tempted to pay for insurance. Ian Giles, a marketing consultant from Surrey, has signed up to the insurance. He runs his business under his name and is concerned that it could be ruined if his social media accounts were hacked. âMy name is my brand,â he said. âIf someone were to impersonate me online then it would cause damage to my business.

A police officer and former U.S. Marine who survived two tours of duty in Iraq was gunned down on Thursday while pursuing a hit-and-run driver in Plymouth Township, Pennsylvania, a day before his 35th birthday. According to officials, Brad Fox was running down a suspect, identified as 44-year-old Andrew Charles Thomas, following a car accident when he was shot in the head - becoming the first officer from his department to be killed in the line of duty. Thomas was later found dead after apparently turning the gun on himself, according to police. Partners: Officer Brad Fox was killed in the line of duty while pursuing a suspect in a hit-and-run crash, while his K-9 dog, Nick, was injured . Hero: Fox, a former combat Marine, served two tours of duty in Iraq before attending a Philadelphia K-9 school and joining the Plymouth Township police force . Fox, a seven-year veteran on the force who had just graduated from a Philadelphia K-9 school, leaves behind a wife pregnant with their second child, and a five-month-old daughter. 'There are just no words that can begin to express the magnitude of this tragedy,' said Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman during a Thursday night press conference. 'Officer Fox served two tours of duty in Iraq. He put his life on the line day in and day out. Men around him lost their lives. 'He was able to come back from that service, come back to the comfort of his country and to lose his life so senselessly today. There are just no words to explain how horrific it is, how senseless it is,' Ferman said. Hectic scene: Fox and other officers responded to the scene of an accident involving an SUV that drove off after smashing into another car . Hot pursuit: Fox spotted the SUV abandoned and chased the driver on foot into an industrial area . Ambush: Police say the suspect fired at least four rounds at Fox from a hiding place on a hill, striking him in the head at this spot now marked by flags . The tragedy began unfolding at around 5:16pm Thursday when officers responded to a three-car accident on East Ridge Pike in the Conshohocken section of the suburb, according to WFMZ. About half-an-hour later, officers on the scene spotted a 2006 Infiniti SUV speeding past other cars in the opposing lane of traffic. Fox and his fellow officers followed the SUV as it slammed into another vehicle and drove off, according to investigators. Fox, accompanied by his K-9 dog, Nick, found the SUV abandoned on Ernest Station Road and went in pursuit of the driver on foot into an industrial area along the Schuylkill River Trail. Shortly after, responding officers came across Fox lying in the grass with a gunshot wound to the head, His dog was also grazed by a bullet, but survived. The 34-year-old was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died soon after. Suicide: Police found the killer in the grass next to train tracks with two self-inflicted gunshot wounds to the chest . No. 1 suspect: Fox's suspected killer, Andrew Charles Thomas, left, was questioned in the 1999 disappearance of his fiance, Maria Procopio, right, but was never chagred in that case . Officers scoured the area and found the suspected killer on the other side of the train tracks with two fatal gunshot wounds to the chest, according to police. A .9mm Beretta gun was discovered next to his body. âThis was a senseless, senseless act for a car accident,â Plymouth Township Police Chief Joseph Lawrence said. A preliminary investigation has revealed that Thomas ambushed Fox from his hiding place on the hill above the train tracks and fired at least four shots at the officer and his dog. Thomas has been a fugitive on a forgery charge for seven years before he was captured this May. He pleaded guilty to the count which stemmed from him using $140 worth of counterfeit Acme gift certificates in 2005, according to police. Family tragedy: Fox leaves behind a wife, who is pregnant with their second child . Family man: Fox was the proud father of a five-month-old baby girl . Last honors: Police gather to salute the body of slain Plymouth Township canine officer Brad Fox, on Thursday Sept. 13, 2012, at Montgomery Hospital in Norristown . Solemn procession: Fox's fellow officers formed an honor guard in a motorcade transporting his body to a funeral home . Thomas was on probation for theft and had assaulted a police officer in the past during an arrest. However, beside the small-time crimes, the 44-year-old had been the prime suspect in the 1999 high-profile disappearance of his fiance, 34-year-old Maria Procopio, according to NBC10. Loyal friend: Nick, Fox's K-9 partner, was grazed by a bullet, but is expected to recover . Procopio went missing in September of 1999 after leaving her shift at QVC in West Chester, Pennsylvania. Her body was never found, and Thomas was never charged in the case. Officials say that while serving time for the assault, Thomas told officers to dig up a wooded area in Whitemarsh Township, where a cache of weapons was unearthed. Thomas used up to 40 different aliases and social security numbers during his life, police said. On Thursday evening, Fox's fellow officers rode in a motorcade to escort his body from the Medical Examiner's Office to the funeral home. Fox, who was described by Police ChiefÂ  Lawrence as a hero, was an organ donor, so even in his death he will help save lives.

New York City's Board of Health opened up a new, experimental front in the war on obesity Thursday, passing a rule banning sales of big sodas and other sugary drinks at restaurants, concession stands, and other eateries. The regulation, which was proposed in the spring by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and approved by a panel of health experts after several months of review, puts a 16-ounce size limit on cups and bottles of non-diet soda, sweetened teas, and other calorie-packed beverages. The ban will apply in fast-food joints, movie houses and Broadway theatres, workplace cafeterias, and most other places selling prepared food. Scroll down for video . Banned: A McDonald's worker is seen preparing an order with a large beverage, possibly the last of its kind if in New York City with a new rule banning sales of big sodas and other sugary drinks . It doesn't cover beverages sold in supermarkets or most convenience stores. The restaurant and beverage industries have assailed that the plan is misguided. They say the city's health experts are exaggerating the role sugary beverages have played in making Americans fat. Should New York City put a 16-ounce size limit on sugary sodas? One board member, Dr Sixto R. Caro, abstained from voting. The other 8 board members voted yes. 'I am still sceptical. This is not comprehensive enough,' Caro said. Some New Yorkers have also ridiculed the . rule as a gross government intrusion and tens of thousands signed a . petition, circulated by the industry, voicing their opposition. Too sweet: In war on obesity, the city's attack on sugary beverages, started last spring, concluded on Thursday with a unanimous vote to ban those over 16 ounces . Growing: Recently called Nanny Bloomberg over the mayor's efforts to closer monitor its residents' health and wellbeing, his office released graphs like this one, showing how the size of Coca-Cola has grown . The unprecedented regulation would follow other ambitious health moves on Bloomberg's watch. Some have proven to be national pacesetters, such as making chain restaurants post calorie counts prominently on their menus; McDonald's announced on Wednesday that it would start displaying the information nationwide next week, before a federal requirement that could force all major chains to do so next year. New York City also has barred artificial . trans fats from restaurant food and taken aggressive steps to . discourage smoking. Starting this month, dozens of city hospitals are . asking mothers of newborns to listen to talks about why they should . breast-feed instead of using formula. Upset: Andrea Hebert of New York, protests the soda-ban while holding a 7-Eleven Big Gulp, one of the few exceptions to the ban due to the store considered a grocery and convenience store . Still here: A Double Gulp is pictured, the largest of 20 to 50 ounce beverages sold at 7-Eleven stores with the Double Gulp when filled with Coca-Cola supplying 600 calories . Bloomberg and other advocates for the . soda plan â who include a roster of doctors and such food figures as . chef Jamie Oliver â see it as another pioneering step for public health. They say the proposal strikes at a leading cause of obesity simply by giving people a built-in reason to stop at 16 ounces: 200 calories, if it's a regular Coke, compared to 240 in a 20-ounce size. For someone who drinks a soda a day, the difference amounts to 14,600 calories a year, or the equivalent of 70 Hershey bars, enough to add about four pounds of fat to a person's body. Beyond the numbers, some doctors and nutrition experts say the proposal starts a conversation that could change attitudes toward overeating. While there are many factors in obesity, 'ultimately it does come down to culture, and it comes down to taking some first steps,' said Dr Jeffrey Mechanick, a Mount Sinai School of Medicine professor who has studied the effect of government regulation on the obesity epidemic. Soda makers and sellers say the plan . unfairly singles out soft drinks as culprits for the nation's fat . problem, represents an overweening government effort to regulate . behaviour and is so patchy as to be pointless. Because of the web of who . regulates what, it would affect a belly-buster regular soda sold at a . sports arena but not a 7-Eleven Big Gulp, for instance. An . average New Yorker goes to the movies about four times per year and . buys concessions only twice, said Sun Dee Larson, a spokeswoman for the . AMC Theatres chain. Arguments: Critics say the city's health experts working with the mayor, pictured, are exaggerating the role sugary beverages have played in making Americans fat . Challenge: Dr Lisa Young, a researcher on portion sizes, speaks in support of the ban in front of the Board of Health at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene though Thursday's vote is unlikely to go unchallenged . 'We firmly believe the choices made . during the other 363 days have a much greater impact on public health,' she said in a statement. Thursday's vote is unlikely to be the final word on the proposal. A soft-drink industry sponsored group called New Yorkers for Beverage Choices â which says it has gathered more than 250,000 signatures on petitions opposing the soda plan â is considering a lawsuit and exploring legislative options for challenging the plan if it passes, spokesman Eliot Hoff said. It's not clear what legislative routes there may be: City Council Speaker Christine Quinn said Wednesday she's not interested in trying to block the expected health board vote, though she has said she isn't a fan of the soda idea. The rule wouldn't apply to lower-calorie drinks, such as water or diet soda, or to alcoholic beverages or drinks that are more than half milk or 70 per cent juice. Enforcement would be conducted by an existing corps of city restaurant inspectors. A violation would lead to a $200 fine.","Vote by city's Board of Health will prohibit the sale of sodas and other sugary drinks over 16-ounces at restaurants and concession stands .

Mr Glebov had embarked on a spear-hunting dive in the rough waters off the Rockaways area of New York and had been hunting giant bass without an air tank. He was found dead in his diving gear by a crew aboard a tugboat. Police officers stand over the body of freediver Yevgeniy 'Eugene' Glebov, from Staten Island, who was discovered yesterday, four days after he was swept out to sea . Mr Glebov's wife is due to give birth to their first child in just days . The 29-year-old Brighton Beach lifeguard who had planned to stop diving after the pending birth of his daughter, was still wearing his fins, wetsuit and depth gauge when his body was spotted close toÂ  Beach 217th Street about three miles from where he had disappeared on Friday. Aunt Sonya Kordonsky told the New York Post: 'His wife is having a baby in two weeks. This is terrible. He loved life; he loved people.' Mr Glebov's cousin, Anna Andreyeva, 24, added, 'The baby will be named after him: Eugenia. He was excited to be a father. He wanted to drop his passion for a new passion.' The diver was a seasoned participant in the pastime and spent every summer's day exploring deep waters, without the use of any breathing apparatus. He was supposed to meet a friend on Friday to dive for striped bass, but seemingly went in alone. By 3pm, the friend reported him missing. Mr Glebov had embarked on a spear-hunting dive in the rough waters off the Rockaways area of New York and had been hunting giant bass without an air tank . The experienced diver may have died from a condition called shallow- water blackout . triggered by a lack of carbon dioxide combined with a drop in oxygen . levels . Authorities said there were no obvious signs of trauma on his body and yesterday family members including Mr Glebov's mother Valentina, 54, and his father Valeriy, 65, hugged and cried on a pier in Riis Park, close to the New York Police Department's harbour boat. Valeriy Glebov said: 'Two weeks ago, he rescued a girl . . . stuck in a fishing net. We were hoping for a miracle. We were really hoping he would be found alive.' Former NYPD scuba instructor Bill Reddan said Glebov may have died from a condition called shallow- water blackout triggered by a lack of carbon dioxide combined with a drop in oxygen levels which usually happens about five feet below the surface. However Mr Reddan also speculated that the diver may have become tangled up in some sort of netting and thought lack of visibility may have been a factor.","Yevgeniy 'Eugene' Glebov had been freediving for ten years and was due to quit sport in a few days .

Missing: Charles Dowd, 69, was on his way to Montreal from California via Amtrak when he vanished somewhere between Denver and Chicago . His son talked to him on Thursday evening when the train was in the Denver area - the last time he heard from Mr Dowd. But concern is growing for the missing man as Amtrak said this week that he may have become disoriented during the trip, opened a door while the train was moving, and fell out. Amtrak officials told KMTV that passengers discovered an exterior door was ajar at about 11pm on Thursday night and reported it to train workers the following morning. Another passenger reportedly said that they saw Mr Dowd by the door at about 10pm on Thursday night. Family man: Mr Dowd is a retired firefighter who was on his way to visit his son and granchildren in Montreal . That timeline puts the train between . Fort Collins, Colorado, and McCook, Nebraska, at the time of Mr Dowd's . disappearance - cities that are about 160 miles apart. His family traveled to Omaha, Nebraska, on Monday to begin a search and hand out flyers with Mr Dowd's picture. His daughter Jennifer Dowd told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'This is not in my dad's character at all. This is a big mystery. We're very worried about him.' Family members said that they are worried that Dowd may become disoriented without his medication. Jennifer Dowd told the Chronicle: 'He just got approval from his doctor to take this trip. We never, ever would have let him travel cross-country if we thought he was in any danger.' Daughter: Jennifer Dowd, shown speaking to a reporter over the weekend, says her father got approval from his doctor to take the trip . The family told ABC affiliate KGO that Mr Dowd also takes medication for high blood pressure, heart disease and diabetes. Cops are also investigating a tip that Mr Dowd became confused during the train ride, and told an Amtrak employee that he didnât believe he was on a train. He is believed to have told a conductor at one point that he thought he was in an apartment and needed to find the front door. Dowd is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs about 175 pounds.

A multi-millionaire alcohol tycoon was found dead by the swimming pool of his mansion after years of excessive drinking, an inquest heard. John Halewood, 64, who was nicknamed âMr Lambriniâ after launching the cheap sparkling wine and a host of other popular drinks, died of heart failure. He left behind a Â£175million fortune accumulated through hisÂ  global drinks empire. Tragedy: Drinks magnate John Halewood (pictured left) was found dead in the swimming pool area of his home near Chester, Cheshire by his partner Judy (right). An inquest heard that he had a history of binge drinking . The court heard the businessman had . heart problems that were made worse by his drinking, and he had been . warned by his doctor justÂ  a year before his death that his alcohol . intake was âdamagingÂ  his healthâ. But Judy Halewood, his partner of 17 . years, told the court he would drink a bottle of wine a day âon averageâ and âsometimesâ binge drink. She told how she discovered his body . at their home in Hatton Heath, Cheshire, after returning from Southport . in October last year. Miss Halewood, who changed her surname . to match Mr Halewoodâs, told Cheshire Coronerâs Court: âI went into the . houseââ¦âand I looked for John and I couldnât find him anywhere. âI looked all over the house, like the . bedroom, anywhere he might have been. Then I went to the swimming pool . where he used to swim and use the gym and things, thatâs where I found . him.â Mr Halewood was found with three times . the drink-drive limit of alcohol in his blood, following a drinking . session the day before. Andrew Smallman, managing director at Halewood . International, based at Huyton, Liverpool, said Mr Halewood had . contacted him the previous afternoon to tell him he needed to be driven . home from a restaurant because he had drunk too much at lunch. Mr . Smallman settled the âsubstantialâ bill but, instead of going home, the . pair went to a nearby pub to talk business and then on to see racehorse . trainer Donald McCain. Success: Mr Halewood (pictured, left) was nicknamed 'Mr Lambrini' after he launched the popular fizzy perry drink (pictured right) during the 1990s . Mr Halewood was passionate about horse . racing. He owned Amberleigh House, the winner of the 2004 Grand . National, which was trained by Mr McCainâs late father, Ginger. After . the visit, the men went to another pub. They were driven home before . 7pm. Asked by the coroner if it was usual . for Mr Halewood to be so drunk, Mr Smallman said: âI have seen him like . that before but not for some time. It is very difficult being a man at . the top and running a multinational business and when things were . putting pressure on him, that was his release.â It is unknown when Mr Halewood died but the lights were switched on in the pool area at 6.39am on the Saturday. Assistant deputy coroner Dr Geoff . Roberts said drinking was part of Mr Halewoodâs âmechanism for coping . with the strains and stressesâ of running Halewood International. He concluded that the heart muscle . disease cardiomyopathy, as well as other known heart defects, were the . cause of Mr Halewoodâs death. He listed chronic excessive alcohol consumption among the contributing factors. A verdict of natural causes was recorded. Mr Halewood set up the company, then known as Halewood Vintners, with his mother Eileen in 1978. It now has a turnover of around . Â£270million, employing more than 1,500 people worldwide. The firm also . owns a 850-acre vineyard in Romania. Its drinks brands include Lambrini, . Crabbieâs ginger beer and Lambâs Navy Rum. Lambrini was brought out in the 1980s . and came to dominate the perry market, with the slogan âLambrini girls . just wanna have funâ. Lambrini has achieved cult status since it was first launched by John Halewood in 1994. The light perry drink, which is still manufactured in Liverpool by Mr Halewood's firm Halewood International Limited, was once famously advertised with the slogan:Â  'Lambrini girls just wanna have fun.' The tipple is now available in eight varieties: Original, Light, Cherry, Peach, Cream, Bubbly, Pink Bubbly, Bucks Fizz and Still, ranging from 7.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent in strength. Marketing: One advert for the drink (seen here on You Tube) used the slogan 'Lambrini Girls Just Wanna be Original' Halewood International, was told to tone . down one advert for Lambrini by the Advertising Standards Authority in . 2005 to avoid linking women's drinking with sexual success. In September 2007, Lambrini started a television advertising campaign featuring Northern Soul anthem 'The Snake' by singer Al Wilson with the slogan, 'Do The Lambrini.' In a more recent advert the slogan used by the firm was 'Lambrini Girls Just Wanna Be Original (pictured above). Mr Halewood set up his company, then known as Halewood Vintners, with his mother Eileen in 1978. Halewood International now has a multimillion pound turnover and employs more than 1,500 people worldwide. Other alcoholic drinks made and distributed by the company include Lamb's Navy Rum, Tsingtao Chinese Beer and Red Square vodka. Mr Halewood's passion outside work was horse racing, and his horse Amberleigh House won the Grand National in 2004.

A former drug and alcohol addict is suing a Scientology-based clinic after he jumped off a third-floor balcony and suffered 'severe injuries'. William Sweeney has accused the Pur Detox clinic in Dana Point, California, of negligence, medical malpractice and negligent supervision. He claims that the clinic tried to wean him off his prescribed medication - which included an anti-psychotic and an anti-opiate - too quickly, following only a 20-minute interview. Angry: William Sweeney is suing the Pur Detox rehab clinic (pictured) for negligence and malpractice after suffering multiple fractures . The live-in rehab centre runs a programme called a 'purification rundown', which uses exercise, vitamins and long stints in the sauna to treat patients. The 'detoxification' programme was developed by the founder of Scientology, Ron Hubbard. No medicine: Dr Allan Sosin allegedly gave Mr Sweeney only a 20-minute consultation and did not see him at all while he was being weaned off his prescribed drugs . Mr Sweeney claims that in the week after his consultation with Dr Allan Sosin, as he was weaned off his medication in a 'quick taper', he was often left unsupervised and saw the doctor only once. He says he was was never asked if he was suffering any withdrawal symptoms, according toÂ Courthouse News. On December 11 last year, he claims, he was led to the third-floor balcony and told to do 'visualisation exercises'. He was then taken back downstairs and allegedly left alone while a staff member assigned to him went to sleep on another floor. 'At approximately 6pm plaintiff returned to the unsecured . third-floor, went out on to the unsecured balcony through an unlocked and . unalarmed sliding door, and attempted suicide by jumping off the . balcony,' reads his complaint. Sweeney says the fall left him with multiple fractures and a 4-week stay in a hospital. He is seeking punitive damages at Orange . County Superior Court, medical and incidental costs, and lost and . impaired future earnings. 'Non-medical programme': Stacy Murphy, 20, and Hillary Holton, 21, both died at Scientology-linked Narconon Arrowhead, Oklahoma - where seven people have died since 2005 . Just last month, another rehab centre linked with Scientology was blamed for the death of three patients who allegedly spent five hours a day in a sauna for 30 days and were given mega-doses of vitamins. Devastating: Gabriel Graves also died at Narconon, whose practices have been questioned by his family . NBC revealed that seven people had died at Narconon Arrowhead in Oklahoma since 2005. The three recent most deaths of Stacy Murphy, 20, Hillary Holton, 21, and Gabriel Graves, 32, have attracted negative publicity and triggered an inquiry into practices at the clinic. The 'non-profit, non-medical' rehab programme is also based on Hubbard's methods and is based on the idea that drugs are stored in the body's fatty tissues for years, but can be flushed out through a strict detox plan. Fees can be anything between $12,000 and $20,000. According to a then-patient at Narconon, . Stacy was allegedly sent to a withdrawal facility after returning from . day release high on opiates. He patient alleged that the drugs that . might have saved her life were either not available or that no one there . at the 'unit' knew how to administer them. Now, the string of deaths has raised fresh questions about this global network of rehab centres and the families of the deceased are demanding answers.

An English landlord who produced a gun after a row with customers at his village pub in Wales when they ordered their drinks in Welsh has escaped jail. Gareth James Sale, 26, had denied possessing a firearm - an air rifle - with intent to cause fear of violence at the Royal Oak, Penrhyndeudraeth in the early hours of June 18 last year, but admitted the lesser charge of possessing a firearm in a public place. Caernarfon Crown Court heard the row started after Salesâ partner Sheridan Graham told customers to 'order their drinks in English.' Under new management : The Royal Oak in Penrhyndeudraeth, where Gareth Sale threatened customers with an air rifle . Sale had drunk eight units of vodka and his partner 'significantly more' between 3pm and midnight that day. Prosecutor Sitn Ap Mihangel said: 'She became very aggressive and it eventually culminated with the Welsh drinkers being told to leave.' Sale went upstairs and returned with an air rifle - causing alarm to three customers who had remained in another bar - but he denied loading the gun or threatening anybody. Witness Alys Owen, who was in another bar, said she saw Sale inserting a 'silver bullet' - an air cannister - in the gun and asked him: âWhy have you got a gun?â He said: ""I just want to ******* scare them"" - the people outside.' Sentenced: Sales admitted the lesser charge of possessing a firearm in a public place, having previously denied the charges . Andrew Green who defended Sale, said . the 6-8 locals who had been ejected began 'banging on the windows and . kicking a door in a threatening and intimidating manner.' He said Ms Graham was 'at the centre of the storm and rash behaviour which caused alarm to Miss Owen.' Sentencing Sales to a 32-week suspended jail sentence, Judge Peter Heywood said: 'It would appear Miss Graham was struggling to understand customers who were ordering their drinks in their first language of Welsh. 'It seems that the matter was not handled sensitively and she (Ms Graham) introduced a house rule customers had to order in English.' Judge Heywood did concede that Saleâs behaviour was out of character, but said 'You over-reacted. Anybody who produces a weapon in a pub clearly commits a serious offense. 'The use of weapons by somebody who was intoxicated in a charged atmosphere could have led to an injury or a loss of life.' In addition to the 32-week suspended jail sentence, Sale was handed a 12-month supervision order; told to carry out 200 hours unpaid work and pay Â£250 court costs. The Royal Oak is now under new management. However, Sale, who split up with . Ms Graham before he appeared in court, and had been removed from the pub by his employers Relief Managers Suppliers (RMS), has been given a second chance.

'Little princess': Lia Green's death was not caused by a playground accident but by 'significant violence' The death of a three-year-old girl amid claims she fell from a child's swing was 'most definitely not an accident', police believe. Lia Green - described as a 'little princess' - was rushed to hospital from her home in Preston last month after she collapsed in front of her parents. The youngster died on arrival at Royal Preston Hospital in Lancashire as a result of significant internal injuries, despite attempts by paramedics to save her. Lia's parents Richard Green, 22, and Natalie Critchley, 20, were arrested on suspicion of murder, before being freed on bail pending further investigations. The couple have protested their innocence. Detectives leading the investigation into Lia's death have now said their inquiry is being hampered by suggestions her injuries were caused by a playground fall, and insisted 'this most definitely was not an accident'. Detective Superintendent Dermott Horrigan, who is leading the investigation, said: 'There may well have been a fall from the swing but what I'm saying, and what I've been told, is the injuries did not arise as a result of that fall. 'They were inflicted upon her by somebody using significant violence. The injuries are to her internal organs around her abdominal region.' He added: 'These are not injuries that cause instantaneous death but do cause death over a period of time.'Lia, said by her family to be a 'normal, healthy' three-year-old girl, collapsed in front of her parents at 8am on August 30 and was rushed to hospital after they dialled 999, where she later died. The couple were arrested and questioned for up to four days by police after tests showed Lia died as a result of 'significant internal injuries caused by violence'. 'Hampered': Det Supt Dermott Horrigan from Lancashire Police said the inquiry was being hampered by a belief in the community that Lia's death was a tragic accident . They later went into hiding after getting death threats on Facebook. But they insisted they were innocent amid claims Lia may have injured herself whilst toddling around a childrenâs playground the day before she died. At the time Green posted a misspelt message on his Facebook page saying: 'Going off fb now as i said i aint descussed the case. dnt believe wt u hear cus it aint true.' A further post-mortem was due to take place on Thursday at the request of lawyers acting for the pair. But Det. Supt. Horrigan said: 'Our investigations have, to a degree, been hampered by the fact that many people in the community, many associates believe that Liaâs death was due to a tragic accident and specifically that she had fallen off a swing in the day or so before her death and that this resulted in her death. 'That is not the case - this most definitely was not an accident for cause of death, it was very much the fact that somebody has inflicted violence upon her and we need to identify who that person is.' Appeal: Lancashire Police are now urging people in Preston to come forward with information that may help them to solve the murder investigation . The officer went on: 'As a result of Liaâs death a post-mortem was undertaken by a home office pathologist and determined the cause of death was a result of significant violence that was inflicted upon Lia, and that this in turn had caused significant internal injuries to her, resulting in her death.â 'We have conducted a complex and thorough investigation into Liaâs death and weâve spoken to many people about sightings of Lia, who Lia was with, and are particularly interested in looking at the two days prior to Liaâs death. 'I would like to know where she was, who she was with, what she looked like - anything that anybody can tell us about her.' The three-year-old spent time at a playground in Brooke Street, Preston, with her father, her one-year-old sister, and another unidentified individual the day before she was rushed to hospital. The playground was at Brooke Street, Preston, where she was playing the day before with her father and her one-year-old sister and another unindentified individual. Earlier this month Liaâs grandfather Steve Rimmer, 47, said the girl's parents were staying at a hotel and 'just wanted to be left alone to grieve', but claimed they feared for their safety because they had received death threats online.'Nothing is adding up at the moment,' Mr Rimmer said at the time. 'Why would Lia be running around in a park if she was feeling so ill? There are so many things which donât make sense. 'I only saw Lia two weeks ago at a family christening. She was a normal healthy three-year-old girl - a lovely girl so full of life. 'It just seems so unreal at the moment and no-one can quite get their head around how this has happened.' The couple will answer bail in Preston on October 16. The family are understood to have been known to police and social services, but there was nothing of 'significant concern'. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Lia Green died in hospital after collapsing in front of her parents at home in Preston, Lancashire .

With the centre not due to open for several hours, the dog was left shivering and close to death outside the shelter, abandoned by his owner in what RSPCA staff are saying is one of the worst cases of animal cruelty they have ever encountered.

The Rottweiler, named Harris by staff, was discovered the next morning by a worker at the centre, and was later found to be so riddled with huge cancerous tumours that he had to be put down.

The family pet, described as 'helpless and gentle' by RSPCA staff, was then discovered by a worker when she arrived at 7.30am, finding him unable to walk, dangerously thin from malnourishment and in a complete state of collapse. Centre staff rushed the helpless dog to a vetâs surgery where he was immediately put on a drip as he was seriously dehydrated. His swollen front leg had a tumour that stretched from his shoulder to his knee and staff said it had surely been there for months as his bony frame was covered in pressure sores. Sadly x-rays revealed Harris was . suffering from bone cancer which surrounded his entire leg bone and he . was also showing signs of secondary cancer in his chest, meaning he had . to be put down. The RSPCA has appealed for information as to the ownersâ identity of what they said was a premeditated act of neglect.

'Hard as it is failing to act only causes more suffering for the poor animal. I urge anyone who may have information regarding the owner of this dog to come forward.' A spokeperson for the RSPCA added: 'We are appealing for information as to the owners of this animal who had obviously allowed him to suffer for several weeks and finally extending that suffering by leaving him for dead on the Animal Centreâs doorstep.

The private company at the centre of the Olympics security shambles should be blacklisted by the Government and stripped of its Â£57million taxpayer-funded management fee, MPs have said. G4S must also pay those people it trained but then failed to use due to management failings during its disastrous attempt to protect the public and venues at London 2012, according to an influential Commons committee. The blame for the debacle, which saw thousands of troops brought in at the last minute to help secure the Games, lies 'firmly and solely' with G4S, a damning report has found. It was promised Â£57million of taxpayers' money for a 'management fee' - which the company claims it needs to cover its costs. Scroll down for video . Drafted . in: The military brought in 4,700 . soldiers after the security firm said it could not provide . its contracted number of Olympic guards . Embattled: G4S admitted only two weeks ago it would not be able to supply its 10,400 contracted guards for the Olympic venues . G4S only told organisers two weeks . before the start of the Games that problems with its scheduling system . meant it could not guarantee it would be able to supply enough guards to . secure the Olympics. The firm, which has contracts with 10 . central Government departments and agencies and 14 police forces in . England and Wales, was contracted to train and accredit 10,400 staff and . manage 13,000 others - but failed. Exonerating Olympic organisers Locog, the Home Office and everybody else, the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said even G4S agreed it was the only one at fault. The firm, which has already taken a Â£50 million loss on the Games, must now 'look to the bigger picture, and its long-standing relationship with its biggest client in the UK: the taxpayer', the committeeâs report said. 'By waiving the Â£57 million management fee in its entirety, a small fraction of the Â£759 million that it receives from the British taxpayer every year, G4S would send a strong signal to the public that it is serious about offering fair and reasonable redress when things go badly wrong.' The move would help draw a line under its failure, it added. Problems: The army was drafted in because the government could 'leave nothing to chance' following security problems . On patrol: Armed forces patrol the Lee Valley White Water Centre during the Games . New home: Soldiers were temporarily housed in barracks in Tobacco Dock, a former shopping centre in east London, as the government came to terms with the G4S security shortfall . 'Parliament and the general public would regard it as absurd for the company to be claiming a management fee which was clearly negotiated on the basis of the delivery of services which were not delivered.' The 'apparent reluctance' of G4S chief executive Nick Buckles to grasp this point shocked the committee, the MPs added. They went on: 'The Government should not be in the business of rewarding failure with taxpayersâ money. 'We recommend that the Government establish a register of high-risk providers, who have a track-record of failure in the delivery of public services. Aftermath: G4S Chief Executive, Nick Buckles, has been dragged in front of MPs on several occasions to explain his company's failings . 'This would provide a single source of information for those conducting procurement exercises about companies which are failing or have failed in the delivery of public contracts.' In future, Government departments, police forces and other public bodies 'must not place too much weight on a companyâs size and reputation alone', the report added. And people who were ready and willing to work but not offered a time and place to start should be paid for the training they attended, the MPs said. 'We can understand a company wishing to recover costs if an individual benefits from training but then fails to turn up for work without good reason, but when the lack of shifts work is entirely due to the companyâs failure to provide employment, this is an entirely different matter. 'We expect the company to make public a means by which people can be recompensed in such circumstances and to be quick and generous in settling such claims.' Some 4,700 extra servicemen and women were drafted in at the last minute, taking the militaryâs contribution to 18,200 personnel, and more police were needed to boost venue security too. The day after the Olympics closing ceremony, August 13, was the first date on which the number of staff supplied by G4S met Locogâs demand, the report found. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: 'Since day one this Government has been determined to reform how we spend taxpayersâ money on goods and services. 'Thatâs why we have introduced unprecedented and comprehensive reforms across all areas of procurement. 'In June we announced that - like many businesses - we will take the performance history of our suppliers into account during the procurement process. 'While we will not publicly name the companies involved it will mean that suppliers with poor performance may find it more difficult to secure work with government in future.â Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayersâ Alliance, said: 'The Home Affairs Select Committee is absolutely right to say that the Government must never use taxpayersâ money to reward failure. 'It is vital that G4S pays the price for its mistakes whilst ministers must ensure that not a single penny of taxpayersâ money is used to clear up the mess G4S caused.' Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the report showed 'the huge scale of G4Sâs failure and how the company seemed willing to dupe the Home Secretary about the numbers they could provide'.âBut the Government also needs to show it has learnt lessons from G4S and the Olympics.' A G4S spokesman said the firm's board and management took 'responsibility for the inability of the company to deliver, in full, on the Olympic security contract and apologise for this failure'. Findings of a review into what went wrong will be announced within the next 10 days, he added. The firm has also 'consistently made clear that the British taxpayer will not bear any additional costs'. 'As explained by both G4S and Locog to the committee, the Â£57 million 'management fee' is not a profit,' he added. 'It relates substantially to real costs which have been incurred such as wages, property and IT expenditure. The final financial settlement is currently under discussion with Locog.' He added the firm has 'agreed a process, in conjunction with the GMB union, for compensating those candidates who completed training and accreditation or made a significant journey through the recruitment process, but were unable to work at the Games'. He went on: 'G4S has a long-standing track record of delivering on Government contracts to a consistently high standard. 'Everyone connected with the company is extremely disappointed that G4S was unable to deliver on its full commitments on this contract, but this does not reflect the high standards G4S delivers continuously in its other work for the UK Government every day.'

But yesterday, Conservative-run Lincolnshire Council came out against the plans â warning that a ârash of extensionsâ could increase the risk of flooding in the low-lying county. The councillor in charge of planning, Eddy Poll, urged district councils in Lincolnshire to follow the lead of Richmond Council in London, which voted on Tuesday night to oppose the plans. One of Lincolnshireâs districts, East Lindsey, immediately backed the call. Lambeth Council, also in the capital, yesterday joined the growing rebellion against the proposed âplanning free-for-allâ â saying it would put residentsâ privacy at risk. Last night, the leader of the Tory-run Kensington and Chelsea council also attacked the proposals. Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the Local Government Association, said any changes must ensure councils are still able to take action to maintain the character of neighbourhoods. Homeowners are currently allowed to build a single-storey 10ft extension if they live in a terraced property and one of 13ft if they live in a detached house.

'What they . donât realise is that once you get it to bouncing, especially if there . are multiple users, it can be dangerous.

Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) revealed the 75 per cent of trampoline injuries happen when there is more than one person jumping on one. And it's the younger, smaller children at greater risk of significant injuries, including fractures of the legs and worse, the spine. NEISS reported that 37 to 39 per cent of all its recorded injuries were caused by falls from a trampoline.

The Colorado movie theater where 12 people were gunned down and another 58 wounded will reopen for business as early as the New Year. The Century Aurora 16 has been closed since July 20 when James Holmes allegedly attacked a sold-out screening of the Dark Knight Rises in a shooting rampage that horrified the nation. Theater executives say a survey conducted by the city of Aurora shows most residents want the 16-screen megaplex to reopen. However, they have announced no plans for a memorial to remember the victims of the terrifying attack and city officials have removed the makeshift marker that was installed by mourners. Back online: Theater executives hope to have the Century Aurora 16 re-opened by the New Year -- five months after the shooting that claimed 12 lives . Packed up: The City of Aurora cleared out the makeshift memorial that mourners erected across the street from the theater . The company's motivations for the quick . turn-around are likely financial -- ticket sales at the other . theaters in town have soared since the closure. On Friday, as the theater re-opening date was announced, victims filed two new lawsuits against the theater, alleging the company should have done more to protect spectators by hiring security guards and preventing access to back door entrances on the night of the blockbuster premier. The lawsuits were filed by two of the men who were wounded in the shooting allegedly committed by the 24-year-old neurosciences student. Charged: James Holmes, 24, smiles for his new mug shot. His lawyers claim he was insane during the theater shootings . Karie Bible, a movie theater analyst with Exhibitor Relations in Los Angeles, told the Denver Post that theaters rake in cash during the fall and early winter seasons, when most Oscar contenders debut on the big screen. Mayor Steven Hogan said on Friday that residents were overwhelmingly supportive of re-opening the theater, though the city has not shared the results of the online poll. Ticket sales at Aurora's remaining six movie theaters slumped in the days following the shooting. However, the weekend after the tragedy, they surged 90 percent as resident turned out in droves to see movies. Executives with Texas-based Cinemark, which owns the Century Aurora 16, said they plan to 'remodel and reconfigure' the theater. However, at least some residents are uneasy with the speed of the re-opening. 'I would feel much better about this had I heard just ONE thing about a memorial being placed there. I don't like the fact that it seems like they are taking everything away. The built memorial is now gone, and zero talk of the theatre putting one in,' Aurora resident Peggy Jean posted on the city's Facebook page. On Thursday, city officials removed a makeshift memorial from a vacant lot across the street from the theater, boxing up the 12 white crosses and assorted teddy bears, and shipping them to a city warehouse. All that remains to remind passersby of the tragedy that occurred at the theater is a simple sign that reads 'Thank you for the outpouring of love and support for the victims of the 7/20 Tragedy. Always remember.' All that remains: This sign is the only memorial to the victims of the deadly rampage that is currently standing in Aurora . The city says it is currently discussing plans for a permanent memorial. However, the theater company has not released any plans for a marker commemorating the victims. Greg Medek, whose daughter Micayla, 23, was killed during the rampage, said the owners must do something to remember the dozen people who died. He says a portion or theater profits should go to the families of the victims to help them cope with the lifelong trauma of the tragedy.","City workers removed the makeshift memorial across the street from the Century Aurora 16 and boxed it up .

For the first time in Bolton, a closure order for a privately owned house was imposed on his house at Bolton Magistratesâ Court yesterday after police and Bolton Council took him to court under crackhouse closure laws. Police officers then boarded up the property with shutters to stop anyone entering the house for the next three months.

He also told the court that he lost some of his hearing as a result of the bomb blast. Next-door neighbour John Falch told the court of several incidents which occurred over the last year. Mr Falch said he spent thousands of pounds on his home trying to block out the loud bass music Mr Harvey allegedly played. He said he asked Harvey to turn the music down which he did at first, before allegedly ignoring later pleas for quiet. Mr Falch kept a diary of incidents and said that his conservatory roof had been damaged by burning cigarettes allegedly being thrown onto it. He also claimed that human excrement had also been thrown on the roof one day. First time: Police prepare to shut up Harvey's house after a closure order was put on Harvey's house for three months, the first privately owned house in the area to have such restrictions .

Mr Clegg said any future cuts in taxation must pass âone clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by?â Scroll down for video . Standing firm: Making his keynote address at the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton, Nick Clegg said there could be 'no question' of further reducing the income tax charged on earnings over Â£150,000 . His intervention will dismay the Tory Right, who believe the top rate of tax â brought down from 50p earlier this year â should be returned to 40p to encourage the rich to come or remain in Britain. Conservatives will, however, be cheered by Mr Cleggâs steadfast backing for the Governmentâs attempts to rein in public spending. Britain must accept âfurther belt-tighteningâ beyond the next election as expenditure is out of control, he suggested â pointing out the country is still borrowing Â£1billion every three days. The Deputy Prime Minister even suggested state spending had âunderminedâ Britainâs prosperity, pointing to the sevenfold increase in the welfare budget over the last 50 years while the economy grew only threefold. Mr Clegg said Labour had âplunged Britain into austerityâ by âcrashing the economy and racking up record debtsâ. Thoughts: Mr Clegg said any future cuts in taxation must pass 'one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by?' He singled out Shadow Chancellor Ed . Balls for particular criticism, accusing him of inhabiting a âfantasy . world where there is no boom and bust and the money never runs outâ. The Deputy Prime Minister painted an . apocalyptic picture of the potential consequences unless the West . responds by dealing with its debts and tackling economic weaknesses. âOur influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance â all are in the balance,â he said. âFor power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world, but within it too; from moderates to hardliners, from internationalists to isolationists, from those committed to the politics of co-operation to those hell-bent on confrontation. âIf history has taught us anything, it is that extremists thrive in tough times. So to those who ask, incredulously, what we â the Liberal Democrats â are doing cutting public spending, I simply say this: Who suffers most when governments go bust? When they can no longer pay salaries, benefits and pensions? Not the bankers and the hedge fund managers, thatâs for sure. No, it would be the poor, the old, the infirm â those with the least to fall back on.â Couple: Nick Clegg (right) with his wife Miriam (left) following his keynote speech at the conference in Brighton .

Mr Justice Fulford described the raid as an act of 'cultural vandalism' as he passed sentence a Cambridge Crown Court. He said: 'This resulted in the loss to the museum and the public at large, not only in this country but across the world, of pieces of incalculable cultural significance and many millions of pounds in monetary value. 'The likelihood is they passed into private hands and will not be seen again for many generations, if at all.

The haul has never been recovered and some of the items may have been damaged as the gang fled, the court heard. Defence counsel told the court 'others higher up the chain', who have not been identified, recruited the men to target the jade exhibits. Among the items stolen were six pieces from the Ming dynasty, including a 16th century carved jade buffalo, a carved horse from the 17th century and a green and brown jade elephant. A jade cup and vase, which is carved with bronze designs, was also stolen, along with an opaque jade brush washer. 'The case has caused tremendous shock to the staff. They are concerned in case there is a further burglary' David Scrase, acting director of the Fitzwilliam . David Scrase, acting director of the Fitzwilliam, said in a statement read to the court that the raid had damaged the museumâs precious reputation for 'guarding treasures'. He added that staff had been shocked by the 'brutal' destruction of the Chinese gallery. Mr Scrase said: 'The case has caused tremendous shock to the staff. They are concerned in case there is a further burglary, certainly if it were to take place during the daytime.' The museum has spent nearly Â£16,000 repairing the damage. Prosecutor Peter Gair said none of the defendants had helped police identify where the artefacts might be. Mr Gair said: 'The conspiracy clearly involved others not known to the prosecution. 'It is very difficult to value these items but various estimates place the value at between Â£5 million and Â£15 million. Lost forever? Historians fear the artefacts - 12 of which are pictured here - will never be seen again . 'Clearly many of these items were deliberately targeted by the defendants because others which could have been taken were not.' He added that a disc cutter was used to create a hole in a metal shutter before smashing a window. Two men entered the building where they forced open two reinforced display cases. All of the group, apart from Simos, had been caught on CCTV before the raid, examining the cabinets. They were traced using this footage, a fingerprint taken from a brochure which had been handled by the 29-year-old the day before the burglary, and DNA evidence linked to Simos. Mitigating, Alexander Taylor-Camara . said the 29-year-old claimed he had been pressurised into taking part . and was not a 'professional burglar'.

He had been released from prison for another offence just eight days before the burglary. Beata Kopel said her client, Smith, was of limited intellect and had never attended secondary school. He was not physically involved in the burglary but took part in its planning. Simos accepted that he had breached two earlier conditional discharges. His barrister, Peter Caldwell, said: 'He did not enter the building. He was recruited the afternoon before the burglary and does not know what happened after it. 'He was thoroughly exploited and was selected for his naivety.' Each of the men had previous convictions. The court heard that the amount of compensation being sought was around Â£60 million to take account of interest.","Four-strong gang broke into Cambridge University's Fitzwilliam Museum in a professionally-planned raid .

HTC's Android Evo 4G phone: British phone users will be able to enjoy a new ultra-fast '4G' network far sooner than thought . British phone users will be able to enjoy a new ultra-fast '4G' network far sooner than thought. Carriers Vodafone and O2 will fast-track the service after banding together to launch the hi-tech network, which offers download speeds akin to the ones on home broadband connections. No release date was given for the new 'next generation' network to launch. The current model of the iPad has a 4G aerial, but there are no national networks in the UK for 4G. It's also not clear whether any UK network would work with iPad, as there are several competing standards for the technology. Phone company Everything Everywhere . has submitted an application to Ofcom to use its existing 1800MHz . 'slice' of mobile spectrum to deliver 4G services in the UK. But . it's a slightly different frequency to the U.S. networks the new iPad . is built to work on - and it's not clear whether Apple will update its . tablet to work with the UK's network. '4G' is used widely in the U.S., and is the successor to the current 3G network, but built from the ground up for high-speed data. Vodafone and O2 already have a more . basic sharing agreement in Britain, and the deal to pool basic network . infrastructure will increase their national coverage to 98 percent by . 2015 and speed up the roll-out of fourth-generation services, they . said. Vodafone estimates that around . two-thirds of the population currently have access to third-generation . indoor mobile coverage, and the government has been calling on operators . to increase that reach to make the country more efficient to boost the . economy. âFaced with a host of macro-economic and . sector threats, the European Telecom sector is finally addressing some . of the basic business model problems they face and laying the groundwork . for a much more profitable recovery,â Bernstein analyst Robin . Bienenstock said. Olaf Swantee, CEO at Everything Everywhere, said earlier this year, Â¿Everything EverywhereÂ¿s vision is to launch 4G for Britain as soon as possible.' Bigger, faster: The third version of the iPad, pictured above is the first to offer a 4G connection - but users in the UK and other territories could miss out, as our networks may not work with new machine . Vodafone and O2, which is owned by Spain's Telefonica , said they would form a joint venture in Britain to pool their infrastructure to improve coverage and speed up the roll-out of a fourth-generation network. Analysts said the pair's move could be replicated in other European markets such as Spain and Germany, which could have a knock-on effect on other operators struggling with fierce competition, regulatory pressure and weak consumer spending. âThis will create two stronger players who will compete with each other and with other operators to bring the benefits of mobile internet services to consumers and businesses across the country,â Vodafone UK Chief Executive Guy Laurence said, adding that it would give Britain the 4G networks it will need tomorrow. The super-fast 4G aerial in the new iPad will allow users to connect to the web at near-broadband speeds - but UK users might miss out . The agreement will also help O2 and Vodafone, ranked second and third respectively in Britain, to compete with market leader Everything Everywhere, which runs the Orange and T-Mobile brands, in the fight to have the best network.

Adult ants are able to identify potential rivals before they emerge from their pupae, a study has revealed. Constant patrolling of the nest . ensures that a male Cardiocondyla obscurior ant is able to bite or chemically tag a rival as soon . as he is born. Chemically tagged ants are then quickly . destroyed by workers in 'death squads', according to researchers from University of Regensburg and IST Austria. An adult male Cardiocondyla obscurior ant (left) fights a newborn 'rival'. Constant patrolling of the nest ensures that the adult is able to bite or chemically tag a rival as soon as he is born . When ants emerge from their pupae - or eclosion - they are vulnerable to attack because their exoskeleton has . not yet hardened to protect them and their mandibles are also too weak . to bite an attacker. And a rival is easy to spot because male  Cardiocondyla obscurior ants are diphenic, either winged or wingless. The dominant wingless male ant, therefore, keeps an eye out for newborn winged ants. The researchers investigated the behaviour of male ergatoid . C. obscurior ants in response to newly pupated males and females, as well . as their interaction with developing pupae. It would be advantageous for newly emerged males to hide from attackers. However, . while winged males use chemical female mimicry to avoid being detected, . young wingless males are easily detected and attacked by older males. If . the fight occurs during the first day after eclosion the older male . will always win, but once the younger male's exoskeleton hardens his . chances of surviving rises to 14 per cent. Nearly 50 per cent of fights . between older and two-day old males results in the death of both . combatants. In addition to biting, the males also smeared each other with secretions from their anuses which encouraged worker aggression. The . older males were more likely to chemically tag two-day-olds than . younger rivals - presumably recognising that they needed help to win the . fight. However, since both males end up being tagged they both suffer . worker attacks. The winners . of these fights smear more and are attacked less by workers. So . although this tactic overall may provide an 'edge' it is a risky . strategy. Lead researcher Dr Sylvia Cremer, . from IST Austria, said: 'Older ergatoid male . ants are able to distinguish pupae containing females by their chemical . scent from those containing males. 'Pupae . containing males are often bitten while those containing females, or . winged males disguised as females, elicit a mating response. 'However, . the chances of mistakenly killing a female or worker possibly prevents . older males from attempting to completely destroy all rival males before . they emerge from their pupae.' C. obscurior ants produce sexual females and ergatoid males throughout the . year. In terms of colony survival this ensures that if the old dominant . male dies there is a new male ready to replace him. The study is published in BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Ecology.","Constant patrolling of the nest ensures that a male Cardiocondyla obscurior ant is able to bite or chemically tag a rival as soon as he is born .

Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, has given a rare interview slamming conspiracy theorists who believe he did not travel to the lunar surface. The reclusive astronaut decided to open his heart about the mission to an unusual source - an Australian accountancy magazine. The 82-year-old has only granted a handful of interviews since his 1969 mission. When asked about the conspiracy theories, Armstrong laughed and said that there's no way the 800,000 Nasa staff working on the project could have kept a secret. âPeople love conspiracy theories, they're very attractive,â he said. âBut they were never a concern to me, because I know someone is going to fly back up there and pick up the camera I left there.â Conspiracy theorists claim the landings were staged as a propaganda effort for the U.S. government, and that landing on the moon would have been impossible with 1969 technology. The Certified Practicing Accountants of Australia convinced him to film an hour-long one-on-one in which he talks about the landing and his famous first steps on the moon. âA month before the launch of Apollo 11, we decided we were confident enough we could try and attempt... a descent to the surface,âsaid Armstrong in the video which appeared on the CPA website this week after the interview last year. âI thought we had a 90 percent chance of getting back safely to Earth on that flight but only a 50-50 chance of making a landing on that first attempt.â As a child, Armstrong said he had âbecome fascinated with the world of flight, as an elementary school student, and determined that,somehow, I wanted to be involved in that.â Astronaut Neil Armstrong photographed on moon as mission commander for the Apollo 11 moon landing on 20 July 1969 .

Apple has moved to ban Samsung's new Galaxy S3 handset in the U.S., saying it infringes two Apple patents. The companies have been locked in a patent battle on several continents for years - but Apple's latest move targets a key handset for Samsung, seen also as a 'standard bearer' for Google's Android operating system. The handset is due to launch on June 21 in America, and has been seen as a considerable threat to Apple's iPhone 4S, as it offers faster processing and a bigger screen. Apple is widely expected to launch a new iPhone later this summer. Samsung said it will vigorously oppose Apple's request for a court to ban sales of the Galaxy S III smartphone and still plans to go ahead with the device's scheduled release in the U.S. on June 21. The South Korean company said in a statement that it will 'demonstrate to the court that the Galaxy S III is innovative and distinctive.' On Tuesday, Apple Inc. asked a U.S. district court to temporarily ban sales of the S III smartphone before its launch in the United States. The maker of the iPhone accused Samsung of infringing two Apple patents. The request, if accepted by the U.S. District Court for Northern California, would deal a blow to Samsung's attempt to get a headstart on sales of Apple's next iPhone. The SIII smartphone went on sale in Europe on May 29 and will be offered by around 300 mobile carriers in Asia and North America later this month. The early launch puts Samsung in a favorable position to take a bigger chunk of the lucrative smartphone market. While Apple is keeping mum on its annual iPhone upgrade, many analysts expect the new iPhone to go on sale as early as July.

First: Maryland students believe they achieved the first human-powered helicopter flight with a female pilot . Gamera - named after a huge . flying turtle from Japanese films - was designed with lightweight . materials and weighed only 140lbs without the pilot. We did it: Take-off was scheduled for Wednesday morning, but they eventually succeeded on Thursday . âIt was beautiful,â Brandon Bush, 29, a doctoral student and project manager said. âIt jumped up, and it stayed there,â he told the Washington Post.

A Japanese team of engineers have come closest, flying their helicopter in 1994 for 19.46 seconds at a height of 8in. It is difficult to achieve flight with a human-powered helicopter because they do not have a fixed wing, like planes. By pedalling, pilots can gather enough . thrust to overcome the drag holding them back and lift forward into the . air.
