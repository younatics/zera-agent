The artist, whose work has been shown around the world, died on Wednesday after suffering a heart attack. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota described him as ‘one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years’. Caro, who was born in Surrey,  studied sculpture in London and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. Oustanding: Sir Anthony Caro, the renowned sculptor, died yesterday after suffering a heart attack. He made his name with a 1963 show at the Whitechapel Gallery and his distinctive work, often made of steel, has been on show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and Tate Britain in London where his piece Early One Morning is on display. He also taught at Saint Martin’s School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981 where his pupils included artistic duo Gilbert and . George. A major exhibition of his work is on show in Venice at The Museo Correr. Caro married the painter Sheila Girling in 1949 and they had two sons, Tim and Paul, and three grandchildren . Barnabas, Benjamin and Emma. Serota said: 'Anthony Caro was one of the outstanding sculptors of the past fifty years alongside David Smith, Eduardo Chillida, Donald Judd and Richard Serra. In the sixties he established a new language for sculpture in a series of elegant, arresting, abstract steel sculptures placed directly on the ground. Man of steel: Sir Anthony, pictured in 2004, poses with his 1962 work Sculpture Two . 'Enormously influential': Sir Anthony poses in 2006 with one of his works in Valencia . 'His development of this vocabulary, building on the legacy of Picasso, but introducing brilliant colour and a refined use of shape and line, was enormously influential in Europe and America. 'Caro admired the sculpture of ancient cultures and Greece and from the eighties onwards produced a series of large scale abstract works that reflected a continuing interest in the human body, but also a growing fascination with architecture. 'Caro was a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of ninety, was still evident in the most recent work shown in exhibitions in Venice and London earlier this year.'","Sir Anthony died after suffering a heart attack on Wednesday .

Basketball great Shaquille O’Neal has endorsed the re-election of New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie, describing him as a 'great man', in a new television advertisement. While Christie is expected to win the November 5 election, commentators say Shaq's public show of support could help to seal the deal. The NBA star - who was born in Newark, New Jersey but lives in Florida - makes his case for why voters should back 'The Governor' in the 30-second ad. Scroll down for video . Supportive: NBA great Shaquille O?Neal has endorsed New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie in a new television ad . Good timing: The 30-second ad was unveiled days before the start of the NBA season and the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Sandy . 'I don’t endorse many politicians. But Chris Christie is different,' Shaq, 41, says. 'He’s working with me to bring jobs back to our cities and on a new program to help kids in tough neighborhoods get ahead. 'Governor Christie’s provided more funding for schools, given parents more choices in what schools their kids can go to, and merit pay for good teachers. 'He’s a good man. Excuse me, he’s a great man. Please join me in supporting Chris Christie – the Governor.' The clip was revealed days before the start of the basketball season and the first anniversary of Hurricane Sandy. Ambassador: Shaquille O'Neal launches a back-to-school campaign, becoming a New Jersey youth ambassador, with the backing of Governor Chris Christie . Winning streak: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie (center) is expected to be re-elected on November 5 . Shaq and Christie met in March to talk about how O'Neal might help with the New . Jersey's ongoing gun buyback programs being led by the attorney general, . according to NJ.com. Shaq has used his profile to campaign for better education outcomes and healthy eating for children, including by executive producing a six-part reality series, Shaq's Big Challenge. Commentators say Shaq's support illustrates Christie's ability to 'pull together unexpected coalitions', including African American voters. The governor's election strategy has been to reach out to traditionally Democratic voters in minority communities, according to NJ.com. Politico reported Christie is going into the election race with strong favorability ratings among African Americans. The latest Fairleigh-Dickinson poll . shows 53 percent of non-white voters approve of Christie’s job in . office, while only 34 percent disapprove, according to The Daily Beast. And he's beating his Democratic opponent Barbara Buono among . non-white voters by an eight-point margin. While Christie won only nine percent of the . African American vote when he first ran in 2009, he has more than . tripled his support after four years in office. Not according to plan: Clint Eastwood's 'invisible Obama' routine at a Republican National Convention last year didn't go down well . So far, Christie has received the support of 25 . prominent African-American elected officials and pastors from across New . Jersey in addition to 52 Democratic politicos. Driving that is the governor's backing of school choice and The Opportunity Scholarship Act, which would have . funded a pilot program offering state scholarships to low income . students so they could leave dodgy public schools. Democrats . blocked the bill in the statehouse. Shaq’s endorsement . specifically emphasizes Christie's work in this area. However, as The Daily Beast reports, some celebrity endorsements backfire spectacularly, including Clint Eastwood’s . rambling performance at last year's Republican National Convention. The Hollywood legend confused attendees and sparked a social media storm after talking to an empty stool and telling an imaginary President Barack Obama, 'I'm not going to shut up.'","Shaquille O’Neal has endorsed the re-election of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in a new television ad .

Original: Otto was one of the original ""Rosie the Riveter"" girls who supported the war effort by filling tens of thousands of jobs because able-bodied men had joined the fighting overseas. When Elinor Otto entered an aircraft assembly factory during World War II, she never imagined that she would still be working as a riveter more than 70 years later. The 93-year-old first joined the workforce as a single mom in 1942, piecing together planes at Rohr Aircraft Corporation in Chula Vista to support the war effort. But rather than dip out of work or take a traditionally 'female' job at the war's end like other 'Rosie the Riveter' women, Otto returned to the plane assembly line where she felt most productive. She worked at the Ryan Aeronautical Co. in San Diego for 14 years, before moving to her current job at Long Beach's C-17 plant, . the state's last large military aircraft production line. 'I'm a working person, I guess. I like . to work. I like to be around people that work,' she told NBC News. 'I like to get up, get out . of the house, get something accomplished during the day.' She said retiring at the standard age was never an option, because she had to care for her son and mother, and she had 'endless energy'. Although when Boeing finishes off its last contract for the cargo planes, she will probably have to call it a day. While the Long Beach resident admits . that riveting is not an occupation in which you'd expect to find an . elderly woman, the work helps to keep her on her toes. She is out of bed every morning at 4am and gets a coffee and newspaper, before starting work by 6am. She parks as far away from the plant as possible so she can walk over - her morning exercise. 'Gotta keep moving!' she chirps. The great grandmother's dedication and longevity have made her a local legend, with her boss admitting he sometimes turns to her for professional advice. 'She's an inspiration,' colleague Craig Ryba, a structural mechanic, said. 'She just enjoys working and enjoys life.' Rosie the Riveter: Elinor Otto, 93, inserts rivets into the wing sections of C-17 cargo planes at a Californian Boeing plant - a job she's done since 1942. Expert: Otto works on the US Air Force Boeing C-17 Globemaster III cargo aircraft . Legendary: Otto, a great grandmother, has become a legend among her co-workers on the state's last large military aircraft production line . Strong: Otto's colleagues are impressed at her stamina . Otto . was recently honored when Long Beach opened Rosie the Riveter Park next . to the site of the former Douglas Aircraft Co. plant, where women . worked during World War II, according to LA Times. It celebrates not only the Rosie the . Riveter era, but the later women's empowerment movement propelled by the . slogan attached to the iconic Rosie wartime poster, 'We Can Do It!' Otto is one of the original women who took up thousands of factory jobs vacated by men sent to fight overseas. In its heyday, the C-17 plant was fully staffed with a parking lot so big that workers put flags on their cars to find them in the sea of vehicles, Otto told LA Times. Long Beach's aerospace industry has shrunk markedly since the war, causing production to dwindle and many jobs becoming more mechanized. The fact that Otto kept her job well beyond retirement age when others were losing theirs is testament to her skill and legendary status. Glamorous: When Otto joined a small group of women at Rohr Aircraft Corp. in Chula Vista during World War II, the bosses threatened to give demerits to the men who stood around trying to talk to her . Friendly: Otto, center, with her colleagues at one of several factories she worked at . J. Howard Miller's poster, created for Westinghouse, has become one of the most iconic images of World War II . However Otto overcame numerous hurdles on the way to fame. LA Times reported Otto was newly single with a young son when she joined the war effort with her two sisters. 'During those days, we could hardly find an apartment that would let you rent with kids. My goodness, they're going to go to war someday and they can't even live in an apartment,' she said. In her first job, she earned just 65 cents an hour - her son's childcare cost $20 a month. Her male colleagues resented her at first, but eventually accepted that women could do the same job just as well - if not better. Otto's grandson, John Perry, said his grandmother made history. 'You've saved American lives and you've been saving American lives your whole life,' Perry said he told Otto. 'It's a powerful story, a positive story, and one hell of a tribute to the female work force.' While Otto expects she will retire soon, she admits her energy is boundless. 'When I go to heaven,' she laughed. 'I hope God keeps me busy!'","Elinor Otto, 93, works as a riveter at a Californian Boeing plant .

An aspiring wildlife photographer has put together an astonishing collection of photographs which reveal the close similarities between humans and primates. Joshua Arlington, 22, took the pictures on a visit to his local zoo in Erie, Pennsylvania. Joshua, who was born in Germany, began the project as an investigation into anthropomorphism, the tendency to find human traits in animals. But after spending the last year in such close proximity to the animals, he has forged some close friendships. Twenty-two-year-old Joshua Arlington, an aspiring wildlife photographer, captured the animals at his local zoo in Erie, Pennsylvania . The former psychology student said he started the project as an investigation into anthropomorphism in which animals display human traits such as emotion . Joshua's close up images of orangutans Joe (left) and Dasa (right) reveal their facial expressions are perhaps more human-like than expected . Two of the animals with which he has developed strong bonds are 28-year-old orangutan Joe and his two-year-old son, Ollie. 'It's amazing really,' said Joshua. 'I started this project to see how people attribute their own personality in these animals, only to find they are sometimes better at expressing their emotions than we are. 'That, I think, is what has been the most fascinating part of this whole experience - really coming to understand these animals do in fact have individual personalities and traits. 'Their body language and reactions to various stimuli, if paid attention to, really defines each one as a unique individual.' However, despite their growing connection, the photographer is all-too-aware that the gap between him and the animals can never be fully overcome. 'I am absolutely fascinated with my growing relationship with each individual, but I also realise that there will always be a barrier between us, and one not made of reinforced glass and metal bars,' Joshua added. 'I would give anything to have a conversation with them, to truly understand how they think and feel and cope with a life so estranged from nature.' After spending significant amounts of time with the animals however Joshua began to develop strong bonds, like with Ollie, the two-year-old orangutan . 'They are sometimes better at expressing emotions than we are' said Joshue upon reflection of the project which he has been working on over the past year . Posing primates: Aspiring photographer Joshua said he would love to be able to have a conversation with the animals to truly know what they were feeling . Two of the animals with which Joshua bonded were orangutans, two-year-old Ollie, pictured here resting, and his 28-year-old father Joe . 28-year-old orangutan Joe (left) stares down the camera's lens as Dasa, a female orangutan (right) sits quietly at the zoo . After being diagnosed with chronic cluster headaches, Joshua gave up his psychology course at the Rochester Institute of Technology to purse his passion for photography. Born in Bitburg, Germany, where his father was stationed in the U.S. Air Force, he has dreams of becoming a wildlife photographer. 'Living in the city in America, I'm not exactly close to any rainforests, my wildlife experience is usually limited to the unlucky deer on the side of the road,' he said. 'The zoo is a place where I can escape for a few hours and, if only for a moment, live my dream'. Joshua is hopeful his images of captive primates will help animal conservation efforts. 'The . palm oil industry is wiping their habitat off the face of the earth, . and it hurts me to think that in a generation or two, someone with a . dream similar to mine will have no choice but to photograph these . amazing animals behind glass and brick,' said the photographer. 'I . would give anything to be able to photograph them in the wild someday, . and it scares me that I may never have that opportunity.' Dasa the female orangutan peers out from beneath a sheet at the zoo. Joshua is hopeful his project will help raise awareness for animal conservation initiatives . A Geoffroy's tamarin sticks its tongue out while another stares angrily to the ground. Joshua decided to put the collection together after being diagnosed with cluster headaches and dropping out of a psychology course . Joshua is grateful for the local zoo which allows him a rare glimpse into animals' emotions as, living in the city, he cannot see them in their natural habitat .","Joshua Arlington began project as an investigation into animals displaying human traits .

On this occasion, however, Rowan Atkinson’s choice of vehicle seemed more suited to his bumbling comic creation Mr Bean than the suave millionaire he really is. The 58-year-old actor popped out for a spot of shopping in a relatively modest £18,000 Skoda Superb, a brand once the butt of countless jokes about poor performance. Rowan Atkinson, who owns a Jaguar Mk7, an Aston Martin DB2 and a vintage Ford Falcon, has been spotted driving the latest edition to his highly enviable car collection, an £18,000 Skoda Superb . Atkinson also owns a 240mph McClaren F1 which he bought for £643,000 in 1997, now worth £3million . It is in stark contrast to the £3million McLaren F1 supercar he also owns. But perhaps he wanted something a little more conservative before getting back behind the wheel of his prized F1 – for which he paid £634,500 in 1997 – after crashing it into a tree in 2011. Earlier this year the Blackadder star successfully claimed £910,000 from his insurers to fix the supercar – the highest repair bill ever recorded in Britain. The crash, on the A605 near Peterborough, was so bad that Atkinson was forced to claim £910,000 on his insurance - making it Britain's highest ever repair bill . He lost control of the 240mph car, which . has soared in value to more than £3million in recent years, after . veering off a slippery section of the A605 near Peterborough. It hit a . tree and burst into flames. Atkinson escaped from the wreckage with a broken shoulder, although his vehicle – one of only 64 models in the world – was a virtual write-off. Most of the back of the car was destroyed while the 6.1litre engine ended up 20 yards away. His insurers spent almost eight months considering the claim, before agreeing the massive payout following more than a year of specialist repairs at McLaren’s base in Woking, Surrey. It was estimated that the star’s car insurance premium will have risen to up to £60,000 a year as a result of the expensive crash, which was Atkinson’s second accident in the supercar; in 1999 he ploughed it into the back of a Rover Metro. His insurance for the Skoda is thought to cost about £2,000 a year. Atkinson, said to be worth £71million, owns an impressive collection that includes a Honda NSX, a Jaguar Mk7, an Aston Martin DB2, a vintage Ford Falcon, a 1939 BMW 328 and a Rolls-Royce Phantom Coupe. The McLaren F1 is the fastest non-turbo . charged production car in the world at 240mph. It does just six miles to . the gallon and the engine bay is lined with 25g of gold foil. Skoda, meanwhile, was for many years the . subject of ridicule. One popular joke was: Why do Skodas have heated . rear windows? To keep your hands warm when you’re pushing them. But in recent years the manufacturer has enjoyed a change in reputation and in 2011 it was named the most satisfying car to own in Britain. Not only did Skoda top the league table of most popular car-makers – beating Porsche and Lexus – but four of its individual cars finished in the top ten most satisfying individual models. While Atkinson usually aims for laughs, as he did during the opening ceremony of the London Olympics (pictured), he is unlikely to appreciate jokes made at the expense of his new car .","Rowan Atkinson was spotted driving £18,000 saloon car to the shops .

British women now spend a staggering £450 a year EACH on their nails as they copy stars from the cast of TOWIE to music icons like Rihanna, new research reveals. And they are spending more on their nails than their hair as the trend for gel and acrylic extensions continues to boom across the country, it added. It is now so popular that more women go out wearing fake nails than their real ones, whether it is for night on the town to a job interview. Groomed: British women now spend an average of £450 each on getting their nails done . Beauty industry experts, Original Additions, surveyed 1,500 women aged between 20 and 45 and spoke to 2,000 salon owners for their research. While many women will get their nails . done every time they prepare for a night out on the town, it is not just . for social reasons that fake nails and manicures are booming. The increase in tablet computers and . smartphones, texting and emails, not to mention PC keyboards at work, . mean a lot more wear and tear on the fingers of millions of women. Celebrities . are a growing influence with the perma-tanned . stars of reality TV shows like TOWIE and Geordie Shore to A-listers . like Rihanna and Beyonce among those mentioned. So addicted to perfectly groomed nails are celebrities, that Victoria . Beckham even flew UK nail technician Michelle Class all the way to the . US to work on the nails of models wearing the ex-Spice Girl's designs . during New York fashion week. Hollywood style: Celebrities such as Rita Ora and Victoria Beckham are part of the reason for the boom . Glamorous: The seriously groomed girls from The Only Way is Essex have also influenced British consumers . Class said: 'Due to the recent . boom in high street nail bars women are now consistently incorporating . manicures into their grooming routine. 'Nails have become an essential expression of individual style and are now considered the defining accessory of an outfit. For instance, my client Rita Ora is now synonymous with long, red stiletto nails. 'Women . have realised that your nails speak volumes about how much pride and . care you take in your appearance and so more than ever, everyone is . getting affordable, professional looking nails in salon and at home.' More than seven in ten women would not go on a date without attractive nails and 86 per cent . would not attend an interview with chipped nails. An overwhelming 96 per cent of women say they feel better about themselves when they have had their nails done. Boom: British women now spend more on their nails - good news for brands like Elegant Touch . The average woman goes . to a nail salon twice a month and the most popular treatment is for a French manicure. Women in London are most likely to stick . to plain red nails while those elsewhere are more likely to try wacky or innovative designs. Many also supplement the look with less . expensive, press on nails by brands such as Elegant Touch, or Nail Rock, which can cost as little as £6 a set. A spokesperson from Original Addition’s gel polish brand Gellux added: ‘Nail polish is a way to express yourself. 'Your favourite polish hue says a lot about you and what image you want to present to the world.' Colour choice varies wildly depending on which part of the UK you live in. According to the Original Additions survey, Londoners favoured classic red and nudes, while Liverpool ladies love bright coral pink. The white-tipped French manicure topped the charts in Essex, while those living in the rest of the home counties tended to choose fuschia pink. Surprisingly, Newcastle's favourite colour was demure pale pink, while Manchester girls chose two chic shades: scarlet and taupe. So what does your colour choice say about you? The Gellux experts have the answer: . Red: Scarlet nails have a regal feel and are worn by glamorous women, who tend to want to get noticed by men. Most popular in London and South Manchester. Coral: If you sport bright nails, you are an energetic and confident girl who isn't afraid of the spotlight. Most popular in Liverpool and London. Taupe: If you rock dove grey or . taupe nails, you're an androgynous, cool, fashion girl, who almost certainly lives in a big city. Most popular in London, Leeds and Manchester. French manicure: The classic . French tip has been revamped and is blingier than ever. No prizes for guessing that Essex loves this look more than anywhere else, with many TOWIE types adding Swarovski . crystals to the tips. Most popular in Essex, London and Birmingham. Hot pink: Fuchsia pink nails are for . the classy and composed girl. This 'no-nonsense' nail enhances the act . of flipping through fashion magazines and organising school events. Most popular in the Home counties and Leicester. Pale pink: Pink nails are for light-hearted, optimistic girls who want their hands to reflect their fun side.

The mother of the Belgian transsexual who chose euthanasia after a botched sex change left him a 'monster' says she's 'not bothered' by her child's decision. Nathan Verhelst, 44, died on Monday afternoon after being allowed have his life ended on the grounds of 'unbearable psychological suffering'. Mr Verhelst, who was born a girl named Nancy, before his death told how he had been an unwanted child - a pain which had affected him deeply that was today confirmed by his mother. Scarred: Nathan Verhelst, 44, who died yesterday afternoon after finding life unbearable since his sex change operation. The scars from his surgeries on his chest and forearm are visible in this photograph . 'When I first saw ""Nancy"", my dream . was shattered. She was so ugly,' she told Belgium's Het Laatste Nieuws. 'I had a ghost birth. Her death does not bother me.' She . said the farewell letter that Mr Verhelst had written to her explaining his . reasons for choosing euthanasia had not yet arrived, adding: 'I will . definitely read it, but it will be full of lies. 'For . me, this chapter closed. Her death does not bother me. I feel no . sorrow, no doubt or remorse. We never had a bond which could therefore . not be broken.' Hours before . his death Mr Verhelst had spoken of how, as a child, he 'was the girl . that nobody wanted', describing how his mother had complained that she'd . wished he'd been born a boy. Rejected . by his parents as a girl, he became a tomboy and later a lesbian. His . transformation into a man in 2009 began with hormone therapy, followed . by a mastectomy and finally an operation to construct a penis last year. But the procedures did not go according to plan. Heartbreaking end: It is understood to be the first time someone in Belgium has chosen euthanasia after a sex-change, and comes soon after it emerged that it is now the cause of nearly one in 50 deaths in the country . In the hours before his death he told Het Laatse Nieuws: 'I was ready to celebrate my new birth. But when I looked in the mirror, I was disgusted with myself. In 2002 Belgium became the second country in the world, after The Netherlands, to legalise euthanasia. Since then, an increasing number of people have chosen to die using this method. In 2012, 1,432 people were allowed to go through assisted suicide indicating a 25 per cent increase in the number of assisted deaths. Guidelines set out by the country's parliament mean patients wishing to end their own lives must be conscious when they ask to die. They also have to be under a 'constant and unbearable physical or psychological pain' resulting from an 'accident or incurable illness'. A survey earlier this year found 32 per cent of assisted deaths are done without request and 47% of the assisted deaths go unreported. In one case, a 44-year-old woman with chronic anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder, was euthanised, along with a 64-year-old woman who was suffering from chronic depression. The Belgian parliament is reportedly on the verge of passing legislation that would allow people under 18  to consent to euthanasia. 'My new breasts did not match my expectations and my new penis had symptoms of rejection. I do not want to be... a monster.' Mr Verhelst's decision comes amid a . fierce debate over euthanasia in Belgium, where the number of deaths due . to the controversial practice soared by 25 per cent last year.' Official figures showed the numbers . opting to end their lives leap from 1,133 in 2011 to 1,432 in 2012, a . figure representing about two per cent of all deaths in the country. Euthanasia . is legal under Belgian law if those making the decision can make their . wishes clear and are suffering unbearable pain, according to a doctor's . judgement. The Belgian law differs from that of Switzerland, famous for its Dignitas clinic, where only 'assisted suicide' is permitted. This means patients must play an active role in the administration of the drug that ends their lives. Wim . Distelmans, a cancer specialist who carried out the euthanasia of Mr . Verhelst, is the same doctor who last year ended the lives of deaf twins . Marc and Eddy Verbessem, who were both going blind. The . 45-year-olds, from the village of Putte, near the city of Mechelen, had . lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with . the outside world. The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: . In contrast to Belgian rules, under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - meaning patients must take an active role in . administering the drug that ends their lives . Suicide rates among transsexuals and those who have undergone gender reassignment surgery are high with some suggesting the rate may be as high as 31 per cent. Chris Hyde, professor at the University of Exeter, who has studied the issues surrounding sex change operations, told MailOnline: ‘Research we conducted a decade ago found there is huge uncertainty over whether changing someone's sex is a good or a bad thing. ‘While no doubt great care is taken to ensure that appropriate patients undergo gender reassignment, there's still a large number of people who have the surgery but remain traumatised - often to the point of committing suicide. ‘While we haven’t looked at the situation since then, given the difficulties in researching this area, it is likely that the same issues remain today.’ Their . brother, Dirk Verbessem, said at the time that they were terrified of . never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence . in an institution. Professor . Distelmans agreed to end their lives - again on grounds of 'unbearable . psychological suffering' - after their local hospital had denied their . request for euthanasia. Dr Distelmans told the Telegraph: 'The choice of Nathan Verhelst has nothing to do with fatigue of life. 'There . are other factors that meant he was in a situation with incurable, . unbearable suffering. Unbearable suffering for euthanasia can be both . physical and psychological. 'This was a case that clearly met the conditions demanded by the law. Nathan underwent counseling for six months.' Last . week it emerged that a staggering one in 30 deaths in the Netherlands . are now from euthanasia, after Dutch government allowed mobile death . squads to kill sick and elderly people in their homes.

Brigitte Tee-Hillman, who supplies Michele Roux Jr's London restaurant, says this year has been 'phenomenal' for wild mushrooms . Foragers are heralding a bumper year for wild mushrooms after the hot summer and mild autumn brought about a glut of the woodland delicacies. The perfect conditions has produced the best crop of wild mushrooms in eight years, according to one of the UK’s leading mushroom experts. Veteran forager Brigitte Tee, the only person in the country licensed to pick mushrooms commercially in the New Forest, said conditions this year were 'phenomenal'. The 71-year-old said above average temperatures were to thank for the abundance of the much sought-after fungi in forests and fields around Britain. It is a stark contrast to last year when heavy rain and cold temperatures in autumn and winter all but wiped out the country’s wild mushrooms. This year’s mushroom haul has been so prevalent it has sparked a rise in the number of guerilla pickers pillaging certain rural areas. Mrs Tee, who supplies wild mushrooms to London’s top restaurants including Michel Roux Jr’s Le Gavroche, said: 'It has been an absolutely bumper year for mushrooms and it’s not over yet. 'Last year was the worst year for mushrooms in a long time. 'Some mushrooms grew but most were completely waterlogged, submerged in an inch and a half of rain water. Thankfully it is all change this year. 'The difference is that we have had a good, long summer and the soil is still warm. 'Phenomenal years like this one only come round once every eight years - that seems to be the growing cycle of mushrooms. 'Next year is likely to be just an average year so we are making the most of it now. 'Already there have been loads of beefsteak mushrooms and the ceps are so prevalent it is likely they will go on until December. 'But this year will go down as the year of the hen of the wood, quite an unusual mushroom that you won’t find in supermarkets. 'This year it has been plentiful. One special year like this one I picked 75 kilograms of mushrooms in three hours on Christmas Eve.' German-born Mrs Tee started picking mushrooms in the New Forest in 1973 after turning her back on a career as an air steward with Pan Am. Ms Tee says the usual crop of mushrooms were almost all wiped out last year and predicts and average year for 2014 . In 2002 she was arrested while picking mushrooms in the New Forest and charged with theft. Thirty two court appearances later, over four years, the case was thrown out at a cost of £1million of taxpayers’ money. She also won a civil suit against the Forestry Commission and was granted a unique licence from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs. Mrs Tee is now the only person in the country who can legally pick more than the allotted 3lbs of mushrooms in the New Forest. She added: 'Unlike some, I make sure the mushrooms don’t die off by cutting their stalks instead of pulling their roots off. 'By doing that you can return to a patch of mushrooms 10 days later and they will have grown back. 'Some people come and pick truckloads of mushrooms and then sell them on illegally while others leave their rubbish all over the forest. 'I don’t do that - I look after nature. Foraging for mushrooms is a lovely way of life. I think of it as going out to look for old friends. 'Mushrooms were among the earliest forms of life on earth and I always say that when I die I will come back as a mushroom because I am indestructible.'","Brigitte Tee is only person allowed to forage commercially in New Forest .

Britain’s ageing population is more to . blame for the nation’s housing crisis than the influx of immigrants, . the government has claimed. Tory minister Nick Boles said the rise . of great-grandparents meant more homes were needed to accommodate more . generations of families who do not want to live together. He said that two thirds of growth in population was ‘not from immigration but from ageing’. Pressure: Britain's ageing population is responsible for the bulk of housing demand because different generations of families do not want to live together, the government claimed . The planning minister's claim came as . Tory MPs staged a revolt against plans to build thousands  of homes on . the Green Belt, saying  it would lead to ‘planning anarchy’ and lose . them votes at the next election. Angry backbenchers criticised Planning . Minister Nick Boles for forcing a major building programme on councils . to meet a chronic housing shortage. But he said they had to respond to a . housing crisis caused by an ageing population and uncontrolled . immigration under the last Labour government. Mr Boles conceded that one source of population growth was immigration ‘which was uncontrolled for a long time’. Warning: Planning Minister Nick Boles said the population has grown, and Britain has not built enough houses to keep pace . He went on: ‘We as a party rightly criticised that, and are now doing something to control it. ‘However, it is important to remember . that the majority—about two thirds—of the growth in population and in . the number of households in the country has resulted not from . immigration but from ageing. ‘One way that I ask people to think . about it is by considering how many people now are part of families in . which four generations are alive. ‘Quite a lot of them are. It used to . be rare to have a great-grandparent or great-grandchild in a family; it . is now common, because people are living longer, and they do not all . want to live in the same house.’ Last year, Mr Boles told councils to find the land to build 270,000 homes by 2018. He has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis. Yesterday he told MPs it was better to . build on former industrial land, but this could only be used for 70 per . cent of the homes needed, adding: ‘Our population has grown, and we . have not built enough houses to keep pace. He was backed by Tory MP Damian Hinds . who said that ‘not all, or even nearly all’ of increased demand for . homes is about immigration. ‘If we strip out future net migration, . the projected requirement is still 149,000: people are living longer; . households are smaller, for all sorts of wider social reasons; kids live . away at university and have a place at home; hardly anyone has a lodger . anymore; and so on,’ Mr Hinds said. ‘There are lots of pressures, and they will not go away.’ Meanwhile backbenchers said ministers had promised that they could decide where to build homes and draw up local plans. But they claimed developers were . being allowed to ride roughshod over the wishes of local planners and . foist housing developments on unsuitable areas. Under threat: Mr Boles has claimed an area of greenfield land the size of London must be built on to solve the crisis . Former planning minister Sir Tony .

Sir Tony said the decisions ‘rode a . coach and horses though protection for the Green Belt’, adding: ‘This is . not a sensible planning policy, this is planning anarchy.’ Laurence Robertson, MP for .

Confident: Edward Davey said Cumbria's withdrawal will not stop the waste management programme being successful . Britain’s long-term nuclear plans have been thrown into disarray after the only county willing to store radioactive waste pulled out of the running. Cumbria County Council voted against studying the possibility of building a £12billion underground dump in the region, over fears it could damage tourism. Ministers branded the decision disappointing, while unions representing nuclear workers said the move was ‘short-sighted’. The decision is a blow to the coalition’s plans to develop a new generation of nuclear reactors, as it will have to either convince another authority to host the site or hope that Cumbria will change its mind. Although radioactive waste is currently kept in surface storage, the Government is committed to creating a long-term underground facility. It has also pledged that future nuclear power station would only be built if ‘effective arrangements’ for dumping were in place. Proponents of nuclear power fear that without these plans for waste burial, any new stations would almost certainly be subject to legal challenges. Speaking after yesterday’s decision, Cumbria council leader Eddie Martin said: ‘Cumbria is not the best place geologically in the UK - the Government’s efforts need to be focused on disposing of the waste underground in the safest place, not the easiest.’ He added: ‘Cumbria has a unique and world-renowned landscape which needs to be cherished and protected. 'While Sellafield and the Lake District have co-existed side by side successfully for decades, we fear that if the area becomes known in the national conscience as the place where nuclear waste is stored underground, the Lake District’s reputation may not be so resilient.’ If the area becomes associated with nuclear waste 'the Lake District's reputation may not be so resilient' says council boss . Cumbria Council Leader Eddie Martin said as Cumbria already has Sellafield nuclear plant, any more nuclear facilities in the area could damage the Lake District's reputation . Energy secretary Edward Davey said: ‘I am confident that the programme to manage radioactive waste safely will ultimately be successful, and that the decisions made in Cumbria today will not undermine prospects for new nuclear power stations.’ He added: ‘We remain firmly committed to geological disposal as the right policy for the long-term, safe and secure management of radioactive waste. 'We also remain committed to the principles of voluntarism and a community-led approach.’ Britain currently has ten nuclear power stations, generating a total of ten gigawatts of electricity, around 19 per cent of Britain’s electricity needs. By 2023, all but one - Sizewell B in Suffolk - will have become obsolete. This could trigger an energy crisis, as one third of Britain’s old-fashioned coal-fired and oil-fired power stations will effectively be outlawed by environmental legislation at the same time. In October, Japanese engineering giant Hitachi paid £700million to take on a project to construct plants in Wales and Gloucestershire, boosting Government plans for a new network of atomic power stations. But Greenpeace energy campaigner Leila Deen last night warned that without adequate waste facilities, no new plants can be built. ‘Even the Prime Minister admits we need a plan to store waste before we can build a single new plant. This decision shows that dumping waste in uncertain geology near one of the country’s most pristine national parks is not a solution,’ she said. ‘Ministers must now re-consider their nuclear ambitions and turn their attention instead to clean, sustainable and renewable energy.’","Cumbria was the only county left in the running to host an underground nuclear waste facility .

The Tory Party was plunged into a farcical leadership crisis yesterday as little-known MP Adam Afriyie was touted as David Cameron’s replacement. The multi-millionaire MP for Windsor was forced to declare his loyalty to the Prime Minister ‘for now’ as it emerged that an ‘organised’ group of backers has called on MPs to support him as leader if Mr Cameron loses the 2015 general election. Allies of the mixed race MP – who has drawn comparisons with Barack Obama – have dubbed themselves the ‘Windsor set’, aping Mr Cameron’s ‘Notting Hill set’ of allies. Insiders said the plans were evidence that Mr Cameron is unpopular with some backbench MPs and a figure ‘untainted’ by serving as a Coalition minister would be needed to replace him. The Daily Mail can reveal that ‘armed camps’ of MPs are now forming to support future leadership bids by Boris Johnson, Theresa May, backbencher Jesse Norman and George Osborne. But the secret campaign on behalf of Mr Afriyie, who has not served as a minister, was denounced as ‘loopy’ and ‘deranged’ last night as MPs condemned the plotting against Mr Cameron in the same week that his promise of a referendum on Europe restored Tory fortunes. One senior Conservative said: ‘Oh good. We’re back to being the stupid party.’ Several MPs confirmed that friends of Mr Afriyie have been asked to support him as leader – but they stressed that this would only be after 2015. But with his cover blown, Mr Afriyie took to Sky News to issue qualified support for the PM. ‘Right now we’re 100 per cent behind David Cameron,’ he said, indicating that could change, before pledging: ‘I would never stand against David Cameron.’ Mr Afriyie would not need to stand against Mr Cameron because a leadership election is triggered only if 46 Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence, which would spark Mr Cameron’s resignation were he to lose. Mr Afriyie added: ‘Of course we talk . about the long-term future of the party and the long-term success of the . party, because we think it’s the best thing for the British people.’ He claimed the comparisons with Mr Obama were unfounded but pointed out: ‘We share the same birthday.’ MP allies such as Mark Field and Eurosceptic Chris Heaton-Harris are said to be impressed by the way he rose from a single parent home on a council estate to make a fortune put at £100million. Adam Afriyie (left) MP for Windsor was forced to declare his loyalty to the Prime Minister (right) Boris dines with Rupert . Mr Heaton-Harris was yesterday also . forced to issue a declaration of loyalty. ‘I want and expect David . Cameron, who I admire hugely and support as party leader completely, to . lead the Conservative Party into the next General Election and I also . fully expect us to win that election,’ he said. Mr Afriyie, 47, vehemently opposed the creation of the Coalition, calling on Mr Cameron to run a minority administration. He also assiduously courted fellow Tories by proposing the abolition of expenses watchdog IPSA. Nadine Dorries, the MP suspended after appearing in I’m A Celebrity, said he had ‘leadership potential’. Another . backer said: ‘Adam has a fantastic back story. It is difficult to see . how we get a majority at the next election. The assumption is that David . Cameron will be stepping down. At . that point we don’t want a coalitionist who has been subject to the . compromise and taint of government. There are a number of people like . Adam who are unhappy with the direction of the party.’ But . his critics questioned his abilities, pointing out that despite funding . Mr Cameron’s leadership bid he served only briefly in an obscure front . bench job and has never had a ministerial post. One . serial rebel said:  ‘If I wanted to get rid of Cameron, the last person . I would back would be the kind of idiots who launch a leadership . campaign in one of the Prime Minister’s most successful weeks. It’s . deranged.’ Another MP added: ‘Some people don’t realise how loopy they look to everyone else.’ Mr Afriyie would also have to contend with organised supporters of more senior figures. Some . senior female MPs will seek to secure the leadership for Mrs May, while . Mr Osborne’s lieutenants have been building support for him on the . backbenches. Tory chairman Grant Shapps said he had sought assurances that Mr Afriyie would not run. Nadine Dorries (pictured) is a supporter of Adam Afriyie . Where David Cameron rode to victory with the help of the modernisers in the ‘Notting Hill set’, Adam Afriyie’s team have taken to styling themselves ‘the Windsor set’. The name is a nod to Mr Afriyie’s seat, where he lives in a lavish former monastery, but is somewhat misleading since the other members are not geographically close. They include Mark Field, the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, and Chris Heaton-Harris, the MP for Daventry who has helped co-ordinate European rebellions against Mr Cameron. Another supporter, Nadine Dorries – currently suspended from the Tory whip – is MP for Mid Bedfordshire. The MPs meet in London, sometimes at Mr Afriyie’s £7.5million mansion near Parliament which he shares with his second wife Tracy-Jane. One supporter said: ‘It’s like the Notting Hill set. We’re looking at what Cameron and his crowd did before he became leader.’ But the Windsor set lacks the heavy hitters who gathered around Mr Cameron, such as George Osborne and Michael Gove. The Windsor set is a nod to Mr Afriyie's seat where he lives in a former monastery . And most of the Windsor set have been removed from the front bench by Mr Cameron, or were never given a job. The ‘organised group’ of Afriyie fans claims to number eight MPs, but one critic said: ‘I can’t think of more than five. And most of them are nutters.’ Allies of the largely obscure Mr Afriyie point out that Mr Cameron was little known by the public before – but he and Mr Osborne were widely touted in Westminster as the Blair and Brown of the Tory modernisers for five years before assuming the leadership of their party.","Adam Afriyie, the multi-millionaire MP for Windsor, has said he supports David Cameron 'for now'

Babies played music while still in the womb remembered the tune months later when part of the big, wide world. And the more they had heard Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star, before birth, the stronger their recognition afterwards. What is more, the effect was visible until at least four months of age. I Got You Babe? Scientists at the University of Helsinki tested 12 pregnant woman and claimed their babies could remember the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star up to four months after they were born (file photo) The finding suggests that mothers-to-be who develop a liking for Mozart, Vivaldi or Bach in the hope of boosting the development of their unborn child may not be wasting their time. Finnish researchers gave 12 pregnant women a CD which and asked them to play it loudly five times a week during the last three months of pregnancy. They were instructed to destroy the CD after giving birth to ensure any memory of the songs came from pregnancy. The study was careful to warn that a baby played classical music in the womb may not turn out cleverer than average. And turning up the volume by placing a speaker right on the . mother-to-be’s abdomen could cause more harm than good. The researchers did, however, suggest  mothers-to-be play music they enjoy or sing lullabies. Neuroscientist Eino Partanen, who contributed to the study, said: ‘If a mother sings or hums some . melodies during pregnancy, it may be more likely that the newborn will . recognise those songs. ‘Then singing or humming those melodies may be useful in trying to soothe the baby if he is crying.’ Linda . Geddes, author of pregnancy book Bumpology, said: ‘There is . still no good evidence that playing music to your bump will boost your . baby’s brain development. ‘However, research suggests that unborn babies can learn to associate their mother relaxing with a particular song.' Shortly after birth, the babies were played Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, which had been repeated three times on the CD, and their brainwaves measured. Crucially, around one in eight notes of the lullaby had been altered. A second group of babies that had not be exposed to the song in while in the womb also had their brain activity measured. The brains of those who heard music before birth lit up more on hearing the lullaby - but only to the familiar notes. The more the song had been played before birth, the greater the child’s recognition of it. It is known that babies can hear outside noises in the womb, although they sound rather muffled. Previous research has shown that newborns remember words they heard before birth and even seem to recognise the theme tune of their mother’s favourite soap opera. But this study showed that the memories are stored until they are at least four months old. Writing in the journal PLoS ONE, the University of Helsinki researchers said exposure to music in the womb may influence a critical period of brain development. They said: ‘These results show that . babies are capable of learning at a very young age and that the effects . of learning remain apparent in the brain for a long time.’ It was already known babies could hear noises outside the womb, although they sound muffled (file photo)","Scientists at University of Helskini gave CDs to 12 pregnant women .

Some of Britain’s biggest sporting events could disappear from the BBC unless the corporation cleans up its act. Ministers have been urged to consider handing the slice of the licence fee used to buy up events like Wimbledon and the FA cup to rival broadcasters. It is suggested that while the so-called Crown Jewels events in the sorting calendar should be on free-to-view channels, the BBC should not automatically receive the funding to air them. Sporting highlight: Millions watched Andy Murray finally win Wimbledon in 2013 which is one of the sporting 'crown jewels' which could be under threat unless the BBC cleans up its act . The move marks a significant escalation in the row between the BBC and the government, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall sex abuse scandals and public outrage at huge payoffs to BBC managers. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps warned at the weekend that television licence fee could be cut unless the BBC tackles a 'culture' of secrecy, waste and bias. But the aggressive approach could go further, with ministers looking at breaking the link between the BBC and licence fee itself. Every year the Corporation spends . £150million buying the rights to major sporting events, including . Wimbledon, the FA Cup, Six Nations rugby, Formula 1, which is now shared . with Sky, and Premier League highlights for Match of the Day. Rival . broadcasters believe there should be a level playing field, with the . BBC unable to give away for free events that they have to pay for. Warning: Tory Party Chairman Grant Shapps suggested the BBC could face a cut in the licence fee or even have to compete with other broadcasters for a share of the money . The idea has been put to Culture Secretary Maria Miller to allow them to bid for a slice of the licence fee to air sporting events deemed too important and popular to be restricted to pay-to-view premium channels. A source close to Mrs Miller said: ’There is a conversation to be had there as to whether the BBC should be funding things that are also covered by commercial broadcasters. ’There's an array of sporting events,’ the source told the Daily Telegraph. ’It would impact on the licence fee. The money that was given to the BBC could theoretically be given to other broadcasters who were doing something that we would consider of public service. ’The BBC covers a whole range of events which private commercial broadcasters pay to cover. ’The licence fee is not a given right any more. There is an acknowledgement that the change in commercial broadcasters means this is something that needs to be looked at. ’If the BBC doesn't put its house in order we will bring forward talks on the royal charter and start to thrash it out earlier.’ The changes could be forced through as part of the renewal of the BBCs royal charter, due in 2016. Tories argue that the £145.50-a-year licence fee would be 'too much' if the BBC failed to reform by 2016. Mr Shapps, the Conservative party chairman, said the Corporation must rebuild confidence following the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall abuse scandals, controversy over fat cat salaries and pay-offs to stars and senior executives. Scandal: Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said the BBC needed to regain public trust after a series of scandals including Jimmy Savile's sex abuse . He also hinted at Tory frustrations with the BBC's perceived Left-wing bias - saying it faced a 'question of credibility' over whether it applies 'fairness' to its political reporting. 'People pay their licence fee in this country because people believe that we should have public service broadcast program-ming,' said Mr Shapps. 'Of course, there are lots of different ways you could do that. I would also say that £145.50 is quite a lot to pay for everyone in the country who has a TV. 'It is too much if we don't see the kind of reforms that all public organisations are used to, that the BBC isn't having to engage with as much as it could do.' His intervention brought a sharp response yesterday from the BBC's former director-general Greg Dyke, who accused Mr Shapps of trying to bully the Corporation. Mr Dyke said: 'This is an attempt to pressurise and intimidate the BBC, which is what governments do, and the BBC's job is to resist. This is so predictable. ’Honestly, I've been waiting for it to happen. Eighteen months from an election, the government of the day - it doesn't matter which government - decides to start pressurising the BBC and say, ""if we win again, we're going to take away your money"".'","BBC spends £150million every year on sporting rights .

Split: McDonald's will no longer serve Heinz Ketchup at any of its 34,000 worldwide restaurants . It's been the perfect accompaniment to a Big Mac and fries for decades. But McDonald's is to stop serving Heinz Ketchup in its 34,000 restaurants worldwide after ending a partnership of more than four decades. The fast food chain says that the surprising split is down to 'recent management changes'. Heinz is now led by Bernardo Hees former chief executive of McDonald's arch-rivals Burger King. McDonald's said that it will work with Heinz until a replacement supplier is in place. The chain said in a statement: 'As a result of recent management changes at Heinz, we have decided to transition our business to other suppliers over time. 'We have spoken to Heinz and plan to work together to ensure a smooth and orderly transition.' The switch from Heinz is likely to be more apparent in the UK and other restaurants across the world, with ketchup in most of the franchise's US restaurants supplied from elsewhere. Heinz disappeared from many US branches in the 1970s after the company couldn't meet McDonald's demands due to a tomato shortage. Since then, apart from in Pittburgh and Minneapolis where Heinz was still used, most ketchup is just branded as 'fancy ketchup' in US branches. A Heinz spokesman declined to comment on the matter. Heinz was bought for $28billion (£17.3billion) back in June by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and an investment fund. It immediately named Hees, still vice chairman of Burger King, as its CEO. Burker King has been a customer of Heinz for 'decades' and will continue to use its products in around 80 per cent of its outlets around the world, according to a spokesman. All change: The restaurant chain has been serving up Heinz with its fries in restaurants outside the US for more than 40 years . Silence: Heinz declined to comment on the news that it will no longer count McDonald's among its customers . Henry J Heinz first went into business with L Clarence Noble in 1869 and the first product to be launched was Heinz & Noble's 'pure and superior' grated horseradish. Seven years later and Mr Heinz set up his second company with two relatives - F&J Heinz Co - and became manager of the firm, launching its now famous ketchup in the US in 1876 and in the UK in 1886. It wasn't until 1910 that the company's Cream of Tomato Soup made its way to UK stores for the first time and the company began producing its products on British shores for the first time during the 1920s. Life in plastic is fantastic: Heinz introduced squeezy ketchup bottles for the first time in 1987 . In the first year of UK production alone, Heinz created Some 10,000 tonnes of its tomato sauce. The product's ketchup remained fairly unchanged until 1987, when the company introduced plastic squeezy ketchup bottles as opposed to its traditional glass containers. Heinz now exports to 60 countries across the world and is the fourth biggest brand name behind Coca Cola, McDonald's and Nescafe.","Fast food giant said split is down to 'recent management changes' at Heinz .

Gambling addict James Whitehouse, 30, drove one of his victims to bankruptcy after making off with hundreds of pounds and leaving her to deal with high-interest repayments. He was imprisoned for two years at Birmingham Crown Court after admitting four counts of fraud, totalling £1,800, against victims he met on dating website Plenty of Fish. The court heard that one of the victims thought Whitehouse was 'the perfect man' until he stole her identity for easy cash. After using their personal details to apply for loans, he told the four women to expect money to arrive in their bank accounts to be forwarded to him. Not realising the funds came from high-interest loans companies, his victims sent Whitehouse the payments and were later hit with the bill for the loans he had taken out in their name. Meanwhile he used the money to fund his gambling habit. Zaheer Afzal, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Whitehouse befriended women over an internet . site, gained their trust and confidence, then exploited them. 'He used the same method in every case and left the victims vulnerable to high interest payments to payday lenders. 'His victims were financially and emotionally exploited.' Whitehouse first targeted women in February 2011 and struck up another relationship in September last year. The . court heard he went on to fleece two more women after he was arrested . the following month, when one of his victims went to the police. 'Perfect man': Whitehouse found his victims on dating website Plenty of Fish. None of the people pictured were involved in the court case. Jailed: Whitehouse was imprisoned for two years at Birmingham Crown Court on four counts of fraud . Sentencing, Judge William Davis QC told . Whitehouse: 'You moved from one to the next, leaving them financially . worse off and emotionally beleaguered. 'You deceived and defrauded vulnerable women one after the other, purely to support your gambling habit.' Since being arrested for his crimes, the court heard that Whitehouse has tried to control his addiction, and has saved up £500 with which to repay his victims. Niall Skinner, defending, said: 'He wanted to repay the victims some of the money. 'He seems to have made good progress with his gambling addiction himself but he isn’t naive enough to say he’s conquered it.'","James Whitehouse, 30, met four women online and gained their trust .

Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told MailOnline that 'bags for life' should not be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them . Using a ‘bag for life’ might make you feel virtuous, but it could harm your health, experts are warning. Shoppers who ditch their plastic bags in favour of reusable ones are putting themselves at risk of food poisoning, they say. Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, told MailOnline that ‘bags-for-life’ should not be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them as the bacteria on these products can then be transferred to other foods, such as fruit, that will be consumed without cooking. Professor Pennington said: ‘Plastic bags should be used for things like raw meat. They shouldn’t be going into Hessian or cotton bags, even if they are wrapped, because the outside of their packages carry bacteria. ‘Raw meats should be separated from the rest of shopping – particularly from unwrapped things that will be eaten raw.’ He added that plastic, Hessian and cotton reusable bags are equally unsuitable for carrying raw meat but that they are fine for transporting products such as boxes of cereal and jars of jam. He explained that they can be machine washed to keep them as clean as possible for transporting products other than raw meats. But, he said that washing them or using antibacterial sprays is not enough to kill the bacteria transferred to them by raw meat. He told MailOnline: ‘They are really rather difficult to clean. If they are looking a bit grotty then they should be thrown away. ‘You can’t get the bugs out just by washing them – it will get rid of some of the bacteria, but not all of them. Professor Pennington said plastic, Hessian and cotton reusable bags are equally unsuitable for carrying raw meat but that they are fine for transporting products such as boxes of cereal and jars of jam . ‘Once you’ve used a bag for carrying raw meat, you should throw it away.’ Professor Pennington's comments come after a study by University of Pennsylvania revealed that since San Francisco banned the use of plastic bags in 2007, hospitalisations and deaths from foodborne illnesses have nearly doubled. Penn Law professor, Jonathan Klick, found that eight per cent of reusable shopping bags contain E.coli and that 97 per cent of people admit to never washing their reusable bags. Professor Klick said: 'Food safety research has shown that a large percentage of reusable bags actually contain harmful bacteria.' Professor Pennington says people should never transport raw meat in reusable bags, even it is wrapped. He says it is also best not to carry vegetables which have soil on them in reusable bags. He thinks shoppers should throw away any bag that has been used to carry raw meat. The professor says washing bags that have carried raw meat is not sufficient to make them safe for use. He also says using antibacterial sprays will not kill all of the bacteria. However, he says it is fine to use 'bags for life' to carry products such boxes of cereal and jars of jam. Professor Pennington says bags used for carrying these items can be machine washed when they start to look 'grotty'.","Professor Hugh Pennington, professor of bacteriology, says 'bags-for-life' should never be used to carry raw meat or vegetables with soil on them .

The luxury residence that helped German bishop Franz Peter Tebartz-van Elst earn the nickname ‘The Bishop of Bling’ may be turned into a soup kitchen or refugee centre. The complex in Limburg was renovated at a cost of 31 million-euros (£26.4 million), a figure that has sparked outrage in Germany. However, it may now be used for the benefit of the needy, according to a newspaper report. Good cause: The Residence of Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst in Limburg may be turned into a soup kitchen or refugee centre . An aerial view of the Tebartz-van Elst residence (foreground). Top left is the Limburg Cathedral . Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst (left) has been expelled by Pope Francis following the spending of some 31 million euros on a residence . The Independent claims that Catholic officials want the sprawling property to be used to feed and house the poor. Campaign . group Caritas told paper: ‘The residence is like an inherited sin which . the bishop has left in his wake. People who seek sanctuary with us . could be given food in the residence.’ The outlay on the complex resulted in Tebartz-van Elst, 53, being formally suspended. The . Vatican didn't say how long he would spend away from the diocese of . Limburg but it refused calls to remove him permanently. It gave no . information on where he would go or what he would do. People walk past a part of the residence, the renovations to which have been defended by Tebartz-van Elst . Tebartz-van . Elst has defended the expenditures on his residence, saying the bill . was actually for 10 projects and there were additional costs because the . buildings were under historical protection. But . in a country where Martin Luther launched the Reformation five . centuries ago in response to what he said were excesses and abuses . within the church, the outcry has been enormous. The . perceived lack of financial transparency has also struck a chord since a . church tax in Germany brings in billions a year to the German church. In a highly unusual move, Bishop Franz-Peter Tebartz-van Elst of Limburg was ordered to leave his diocese while an investigation and audit into cost over-runs is held . Tebartz-van . Elst's leadership style has also been criticised. In August and . September, more than 4,000 people signed an open letter to the bishop . criticising what they considered his authoritarian style. The . head of the German bishops' conference, Archbishop Robert Zollitsch, . has been particularly blunt in his criticism of the expenditures and the . credibility problem it was causing the church. He . said the 'decisive' turning point came when Hamburg prosecutors earlier . this month asked a court to levy an unspecified fine against the bishop . for false testimony in a related case. Zollitsch . has said the church commission will investigate the costs of the . renovation, the financing and how decisions about the restoration . evolved. Tebartz-van Elst's leadership style has also been criticized . Canon lawyers will determine if Tebartz-van Elst violated church law regarding the use of church money, Zollitsch said. In a statement , Zollitsch pledged that the commission would do its work 'quickly and carefully.' Francis' decision opens 'a space to return to inner calm and create a new basis for talks,' he said. The . Vatican stressed that Francis took the decision based on 'objective' information, suggesting that the Vatican wasn't being swayed by the . popular outcry. Francis has also made it clear he expects his bishops to . live simply, setting as an example his own humble lifestyle. The . Vatican said the bishop was leaving pending the outcome of a German . church investigation into the expenditures and his role in the affair. Fellow bishops and lay Catholics in the diocese, however, expressed doubt that he would ever be able to return. 'This is a crisis of confidence that will be hard to overcome,' said the dean of the cathedral chapter, Guenther Geis. Limburg's . vicar general, the Rev. Wolfgang Roesch, who had been due to start . January 1, will instead begin work immediately and will run the diocese . during Tebartz-van Elst's absence, the Vatican said. Germany's main lay Catholic group, the Central Committee of German Catholics, praised the decision. 'Pope . Francis' decision offers the chance of a first step toward a new . beginning in the Limburg diocese, because the situation had become an . increasing burden for the faithful there and in all of Germany,' said . Alois Glueck, the group's head. The German government refused to comment on the matter. Franz-Josef . Bode, bishop of Osnabrueck, said the pope had made a 'smart' decision . which gives all concerned time to review the situation calmly.

The annual Halloween block party of 20,000 people that helped earn a university the title of best party school ended this weekend with 50 arrests. The party near Ohio University in Athens on Saturday night saw around 45 ambulances called, with most treating revellers with alcohol-related issues.

Halloween brawl: A fight broke out between several costumed men in California which saw a 27-year-old man taken to hospital in a critical condition . Revellers at the Ohio event said they felt comfortable with the security level and called the event safe and fun. Arrests in some recent years have eclipsed 200 and security has been beefed up since 2003, when party-goers rioted. The university was voted the top party school in the 2011 Princeton Review surveys, but the institution does not sanction the event. ‘Up until 3 am there were less violence reports but after that we did get a few fight calls,’ an emergency services official told the Athens Messenger.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor and This Is Money Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:18 EST, 27 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:34 EST, 28 October 2013 . A chronic lack of homes for sale is continuing to drive up house prices with a return of sealed bids and gazumping in some areas. The number of homes on the market has fallen by 1.6 per cent in the past month, however there was a 2 per cent increase in buyers registered with agents, according to research by Hometrack. The situation is giving sellers, particularly those in London and the South East, a strong hand, it said. This echoes a Rightmove report showing asking prices up by £220 per day in October to hit an average of £252,418 - largely driven by a London spike. In demand: The number of would-be buyers looking for properties like these ones in Harrow and Brent, in north west London, has gone up six per cent month-on-month . Hometrack said the percentage of the asking price now being paid by buyers is up to 95.2 per cent, which is second only to the figure of 95.7 per cent seen at the height of the 2007 property boom before the crash. There are fears that a new property bubble is being stoked by the addition of the Government's Help to Buy boosters to the cheap mortgage cash pushed by the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme. The market in London and the South East are most at risk of seeing an artificial bubble as buyers, including wealthy foreigners with cash, battle for homes and flats before they are even built. Nationally, prices have risen by 0.5 per cent in the past month, according to Hometrack. However, the figure is a higher 0.7 per cent in the South East and 0.8 per cent in Greater London. Prices have risen by 3.1 per cent over the past year. It puts the annual rise in prices as lower than the Rightmove asking prices report, which showed them up 3.8 per cent over the past year. The most recent Land Registry monthly report showed house prices up 3.4 per cent in the year to September, while Halifax reported a 6.2 per cent rise and Nationwide a 5 per cent increase over the same period. On the up: House prices are rising in more than a third of postcodes, while in most others they are stable and just 1.6% saw a decrease. Demand from prospective buyers in London surged by more than 6 per cent month-on-month, helping to maintain the upward pressure on prices. Houses in London take just over four weeks to sell on average amid continued demand from wealthy overseas buyers in the capital, compared with slightly more than eight weeks across England and Wales. Sellers in the capital are typically achieving 97.2 per cent of their asking price, while the figure is 95.9 per cent in the South East. One of the major factors driving the turnaround in the property market this year has been a decline in mortgage rates and increase in availability. This has come as cheap money has filtered through banks and building society's from the Bank of England's Funding for Lending scheme. For borrowers with the biggest deposits, two-year fixed rate mortgages have fallen below 2 per cent, while those with 25 per cent of a property's value to put down can fix their mortgage for five years at less than 3 per cent. But savers have suffered as rates on accounts have plummeted due to lenders no longer needing to compete to get their cash in to fund mortgage lending. A separate study published by the Halifax today found 70 per cent of the nation expects house prices to rise over the next year. Hometrack said the North East was the only region not to see any change in prices over the month. Prices . increased by 0.1 per cent in the East Midlands and the North West, by . 0.2 per cent in Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside, by 0.3 per cent in . East Anglia and the West Midlands, by 0.4 per cent in the South West. The situation is giving sellers, particularly in London and the South East, a strong hand . A new phase of the Government’s flagship Help to Buy scheme launched this month is set to inject further activity into the housing market as lenders offer state-backed mortgages to aspiring first-time buyers and home movers with deposits as low as 5 per cent. Lenders representing most of the mortgage . market have now come on board the scheme, although only state-backed . lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of . Scotland have unveiled their products under the initiative so far. In a sign that house prices could push . up further amid surging buyer demand, the shortage of homes for sale . continued in October as the number of new properties listed dropped by . 1.6%, while the number of new buyers registering with agents rose . Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said that a ‘chronic lack of supply’ has been driving house price growth. He . said: ‘Growth in new sales being agreed is running at 4-5% per month . and this is continually eroding the stock of homes for sale. ‘In . contrast, levels of demand have grown by 3% in the last two months. Improving confidence amongst buyers has been fuelled by low mortgage . rates and positive news on a recovering housing market.’","Number of homes on the market has fallen by 1.6 per cent in past month .

Toyota Motor Corp. has been found liable for a fatal crash and is ordered to pay $1.5 million compensation to Jean Bookout, 82, the driver injured in the crash, and $1.5 million to the family of Barbara Schwarz, 70, who died. An Oklahoma judge said yesterday that the settlement to . award punitive damages was reached in a case that blamed sudden . acceleration in a Toyota Camry for a wrongful death in 2007. The jury also decided that Toyota acted with 'reckless disregard' for the rights of others. Victim: Barbara Schwarz, who died in the crash, is pictured with her husband and daughter . Oklahoma County District Judge Patricia Parrish said today that jurors won't be deliberating additional punitive damages. The judge didn't disclose the amount of punitive damages awarded, which is still being discussed in the courtroom. The judge has barred the parties from discussing the case publicly until the trial's conclusion. Toyota . said in a statement: 'Per the court's instructions, we cannot comment . on the ruling pending the ongoing deliberations by the jury.' Bookout . was driving the 2005 Camry in 2007 when it accelerated, leading it to . drive through an intersection and slam into an embankment in Eufaula, . Oklahoma. A defect in . the car's electronic throttle-control system led to the car accelerating . unexpectedly, Bookout and Schwarz's lawyers claimed. Attorney . Cole Portis told the jury: 'We believe Toyota's conduct from the time . the electronic throttle-control system was developed has been shameful. The jury found Toyota Motor Corp. liable Thursday for a fatal crash involving a 2005 Toyota Camry (file photo of a Camry) 'It's a big deal because if it doesn't work right, people get killed', CBS News reported. The Japanese car maker denied claims and instead blamed the driver for the crash. Toyota's lawyer Randolph Bibb Jr. said: 'Sometimes people make mistakes while driving cars.' He argued that Bookout probably pumped the accelerator instead of the brake by mistake. In 2012, Toyota agreed to pay more than $1 billion to settle a legal case involving unintended acceleration problems in its vehicles. The car maker said the deal would resolve hundreds of lawsuits from Toyota owners who said the value of their cars and trucks plummeted after a series of recalls stemming from claims the firm's vehicles accelerated unintentionally. Steve Berman, a lawyer representing Toyota owners, said the settlement was the largest in U.S. history involving automobile defects. Toyota has recalled more than 14 million vehicles worldwide due to acceleration problems. Toyota Motor Corp's shares fell 0.4 per cent on October 18, in light of more recalls to fix a problem in air conditioning condensers.

A rogue wallaby spotted bounding around north London has finally been captured after one final escapade in a children's playground. The animal, known as Jean, was seen hopping through the famous graves in Highgate Cemetery two weeks ago and snacking in Hampstead's Fitzroy Park the week before. But finally, after a major search by Londoners and RSPCA officials, the wild animal has been rescued as she tried to venture further afield. But it does not signal the end of the month-long hunt as witness reports claim another wallaby is still on the loose. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Capture: Jean the wallaby was cornered in York Rise estate, Hampstead, London, yesterday morning . Chaos: 18-year-old Oscar Chettleborough called the RSPCA when he saw the animal after a night out . RSPCA inspectors received calls from an 18-year-old on his way home from a night out at 5am yesterday who spotted the creature in the children's playground of York Rise estate near Dartmouth Park. A confused Oscar Chettleborough exclaimed down the phone: 'A large wild animal is causing chaos,' as Jean bounced around the 1930s red brick courtyard. Inspector Leigh Summers was alerted at 7am, and armed himself with a tennis net to wrap around the wallaby, a notoriously fierce and strong creature. Calmed down: After a month of bouncing around north London, Jean slowly came to a stand still . At last: Inspector Leigh Summers (left) had not encountered a wallaby in his nine years with the RSPCA so used a tennis net - a classic Australian trick. The marsupial was taken to an exotic animal pound near Heathrow . Although Inspector Summers was apprehensive about tackling the wallaby, it seems Jean had had enough of adventuring. By . the time the inspector arrived, local children were feeding apples to the gentle creature, who readily tumbled into the inspector's tennis net and remained . calm throughout the journey to her new pound near Heathrow airport. Inspector Summers said: 'I had . been told to handle the wallaby by grasping its tail and hold it as high . as I could off the ground and as far away from me as possible to stop . it finding any purchase for its legs. 'In . fact, when I did grasp it the animal just hung there, relaxed, very . much like a cat does when it is scruffed by its mother so I knew it was . used to being handled like this. 'The biggest problem I had was untangling the netting around it when I got it back to the van.' He told the Camen New Journal: 'I've worked for the RSPCA for nine years and this is my first wallaby.' He added that he is still unsure as to how Jean managed to get out of the high-walled . Highgate Cemetery and through the busy streets to York Rise. It is the finale in a large-scale bid by Londoners and RSPCA officers to track down the animal for fear of it being injured on the busy roads. Unexpected: A wallaby was filmed hopping around Highgate Cemetery in north London two weeks ago . Adventure: The marsupial hopped around some of the 53,000 graves at the burial site to onlookers' amazement . Wallabies are marsupials, like kangaroos but smaller. Unlike kangaroos who mainly eat grass, they feed on leaves and as a result they have very different teeth. They originate from Australia but zoo owners brought them to the UK in the late 1800s. The most prolific free colony of wallabies in the UK was in Staffordshire when a family famously broke free from a private zoo in Leek. They made a home in the Midlands' countryside and survived happily in the wild. Their population peaked in the 1970s. Although they were reported to have died out in the early 2000s, a photographer spotted the tribe in 2009. The colony has cousins living in Norfolk's Fenland and Ashdown Forest, Sussex. There is also a population in Inchconnachan, an island of Scotland's Loch Lomond, created by Lady Arran Colquhoun in the 1920s. A spokeswoman for the charity said the . animal is believed to be one of a pair dumped in Highgate Woods, and a . second wallaby is still thought to be on the loose in north London. Maurice Melzak, a documentary maker and zoologist living in the area, spotted the creature during a walk through Highgate Cemetery two weeks ago. He grabbed his camera to capture the unusual moment as the wallaby bounded over the 53,000 graves. He and other concerned Londoners contacted numerous local zoos when the animals were first spotted - but none of them were missing a wallaby. The nearby Golders Hill Park Zoo homes wallabies but a spokesperson said that none of their animals had escaped in recent years. London Zoo in Regent’s Park also confirmed that none of their animals had escaped. However, the search for the second wallaby is under way, with inspectors hoping to find new homes for them in the near future. An RSPCA spokesperson said: 'We've had reports of more than one wallaby being seen. They are herd animals and don't live on their own, they live in a family. 'It would've been strange for one wallaby to be living so healthily and happily without another one, so we're pretty sure there's another one to be found. 'We're not sure where they came from . but we think they could have been dumped by their owner or escaped from . some sort of establishment. 'It . is the first time Inspector Summers has rescued a wallaby before, which . is why he spoke to London Zoo and got advice from their kangaroo and . wallaby experts. Not alone: The sighting follows news that another wallaby was seen on Hampstead Heath three weeks ago . 'The wallaby is now doing well at its temporary home near Heathrow.' The charity said populations of red-necked wallabies became established in the wild in Britain back in the 1940s. However, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the release of them as they are a non-native species, so the Highgate wallaby will end up in a zoo or somewhere that has a population of the animals.","After month-long search, RSPCA captured animal at London playground .

Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi was reunited with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on a visit to Britain today. The Burmese opposition leader made a special request to see the royal couple on a tour which also saw her meet political leaders including Prime Minister David Cameron, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Mr Cameron backed her efforts to amend the Burmese constitution, which currently . prevents her standing for president in 2015. Aung San Suu Kyi met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall at Clarence House during a visit to the UK . They spoke for about 45 minutes in the palace's Garden Room after Suu Kyi made a special request to see them . Prince Charles gave the Burmese democracy leader a tour of the gardens during her visit . Earlier in the day, Charles and Camilla accompanied Ms Suu Kyi into the Garden Room at Charles's London home Clarence House and the Prince explained: 'There's endless people taking photographs.' Ms Suu Kyi replied: 'You've got to obey the photographers.' And the Prince assured her: 'That's by far the best policy.' Ms Suu Kyi met the Royal couple shortly before they attended the christening of Prince George. She has close connections with Britain having read philosophy, politics and economics at St Hugh's College, Oxford, between 1964 and 1967, before settling in the university city with her late husband Michael Aris, a Tibetan scholar. In July 1989, around a year after her return to her homeland to care for her mother, Ms Suu Kyi was placed under house arrest by the ruling military which feared the influence of a woman whose father was instrumental in gaining Burma's freedom from British rule. She remained there for much of the next 20 years, finally being released in November 2010. Her husband died of prostate cancer in 1999 at the age of 53. He had asked the Burmese authorities to grant him a visa to visit her one last time, but was refused. Prince Charles knew Suu Kyi's late husband Michael Aris and is now a patron of a trust set up in his memory . Prince Charles showed her the tree planted in her honour at Clarence House last year . Prince Charles met the campaigner shorty before attending the christening of his grandson, Prince George .

Charles and Ms Suu Kyi have another connection apart from his links to her late husband. Lord Mountbatten, the prince's great uncle, and the campaigner's father, General Aung San, were involved in important events leading up to Burma's independence from British rule. As supreme allied commander of South East Asia Lord Mountbatten held negotiations in 1943 with Aung San, Burma's war minister, who switched his country's military allegiance from Japan to Britain and helped the Allies defeat the Japanese in his homeland. The general went on to play a crucial role in Burma becoming an independent nation before he was assassinated in 1947, months before independence was realised. The Prime Minister, who said he was one of Ms Suu Kyi's 'greatest admirers', pledged to build international pressure for the constitutional changes. Welcoming her to Downing Street, Mr Cameron said Britain would do 'everything we can' to support Ms Suu Kyi in her efforts to change the constitution, which will require the agreement of the current president Thein Sein and the military. Suu Kyi later met David Cameron at Downing Street where he backed her calls for a change to the Burmese constitution . The Prime Minister pledged to build international pressure for the constitutional changes . Mr Cameron said that some progress seen in Burma on human rights needs to be sustained . Mr Cameron said: 'You are hugely . admired in this country, I am one of your greatest admirers - for . everything that you have done for your country but also for everything . you stand for in the world. 'Your example and your perseverance in your beliefs is a huge inspiration to people across Britain and people around the world. 'We wish you well with everything that you are doing and want to do everything we can to support you.' He said there had been progress on human rights in the country, with the release of political prisoners and Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy winning seats in a by-election. But he added: 'The most important message is that progress needs to be sustained and, in particular, we need to see the constitution amended. 'It would be completely wrong for elections to be held under a constitution that really excludes one person, who happens to be the leader of democracy in Burma, to be excluded from the highest office in the land. Cameron announced support for Suu Kyi's plans to renovate the Rangoon General Hospital . Ms Suu Kyi also met William Hague, Justine Greening and Ed Miliband during her visit . 'Those would be no elections at all, in . my view. Those would not be democratic elections, the constitution has . to be changed in that way and in other ways. 'We will do everything we can to build . the international pressure to send the clearest possible message to the . Burmese government that these changes must be made.' Ms Suu Kyi said: 'The crucial issue at the moment is to make amendments to the constitution. 'If . the process of democratisation is to move forward, if it is to be . sustainable, we have to amend the constitution to make it a democratic . one, one that will ensure that the future of our society is going to be . rooted in genuine democratic institutions.' The Burmese opposition leader added: 'Although there has been some progress there has not yet been enough and in order to carry it forward we have to address this very important issue of constitutional change, of inclusive development which must have, at its heart, providing jobs for our young people and for others.' Asked about progress on religious freedom and citizenship, Ms Suu Kyi said: 'It's for the president and his government to set a timeframe for their policies with regard to citizenship or any other matter that the government has to deal with. 'If you want me to give you a timeframe you had better make sure that I become president.' Mr Cameron announced support for Ms Suu Kyi's plans for the renovation of the Rangoon General Hospital, with the UK funding a team to assess plans for the renovation of the 1,500-bed facility. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Rangoon General Hospital has offered life-saving healthcare to the Burmese people for generations and it is right that we help Aung San Suu Kyi in her work to restore this crucial institution. 'Her project shows that Burma is getting back to business and I am pleased to support this and the country's wider agenda of healthcare reform.'

A horrifying video has revealed the brutal, state-condoned treatment of a mentally ill inmate at one California prison where guards douse the man in pepper spray, leaving him screaming in pain and begging for it to stop. The tape was released on Thursday by a federal judge as part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of 30,000 prisoners seeking a ban on the practice. Pepper-spraying is an official method at California State Prison in Corcoran to remove troubled prisoners from their cells after all other tactics fail. WARNING: DISTRESSING VIDEO CONTENT . A naked and screaming prisoner is pinned down by six guards in gas masks at Corcoran Prison in California last July after he was pepper-sprayed to get him out of his cell . In one tape from July 2012, a screaming, naked prisoner is doused in pepper spray five times in the 30 minutes that it takes six guards, wearing hazard suits, gas masks and helmets to pin him down and strap him to a gurney. Throughout the ordeal, the prisoner appears highly distressed and in pain, screaming: 'Somebody help me'; 'You're choking me' and 'I can't breathe'. He can be heard retching along with prison guards who also cough from the volume of pepper spray used. The inmate, whom was deemed psychotic by his prison psychiatrist and in need of emergency medication, reportedly had hours of discussions with officers before the extreme measure was taken. According to the LA Times, psychiatrist Dr Ernest Wagner told the court: 'When we order involuntary medications, the inmate is told they will receive medications whether they like it or not.' He said the 31-year-old needed the medication to save his life. The prisoner was suicidal, according to Dr Wagner, hearing voices and eating his feces. A court ordered that the man be medicated. Prison guards don gas masks and protective suits as they prepare to pepper spray a mentally-ill prisoner . A prison guard uses a hose through the food hatch in the cell to release pepper spray onto the prisoner . After screaming for help in his cell for several minutes, the prisoner extends an arm to be cuffed by officers but then withdraws forcing guards to enter . Hearings are being held by District Judge Lawrence Karlton on the practice in Sacramento. The judge ordered the release of six tapes which are created by law as part of the prison practice. The tapes were released without the prisoners or staff involved being identified. Lawyers for inmates say that the pepper-spraying reveals extreme force at Corcoran and abuse of patients who are mentally ill and unable to understand what is going on. The prisoner shown in the video above at times appears bewildered and to have little grasp of the situation. He repeats: 'I don't know what you're doing'; Why is this happening' and 'I don't want to be executed' at several points in the 30-minute tape. After he is injected with drugs, the prisoner is kept strapped down to the bed under doctor's orders. The 31-year-old's sentence was increased by three months because he refused to follow orders. In November 2012, he was moved to a psychiatric prison where he improved, according to court records. He was paroled in February of this year. Guards press the naked and distressed prisoner against the door as part of the pepper-spraying measure, which officials say occurs only as a 'last resort' The man is pinned to the ground by six guards as he retches and asks for someone to help him . The inmate, whom a prison psychiatrist deemed as psychotic and in need of medication, writhes as he is lifted on to a stretcher and strapped in . Prison authorities say that the procedure is necessary as a last resort to have some prisoners take medication or move cell. State . witnesses, including California's director of adult prisons, said that . the videotape shows guards following proper procedure and that the . method is safer than physical force. In a statement to MailOnline, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Assistant Secretary . Deborah Hoffman said: 'Use of force is always a last resort for our . staff, and cell extractions are typically done to keep inmates from . harming themselves or others and to ensure that they are placed in a . more appropriate mental health setting. 'What . you don’t see on these videos is the hours of discussions that take . place between the inmate and clinical staff before a cell extraction is . ordered and the video camera starts rolling. 'As . we are always looking to improve our policies, CDCR is revising use of . force policies to limit the duration of pepper spray applications, the . total applications and the minimum waiting period between applications . in non-emergency situations.' The man's head is held in place as he is administered a shot by prison medical staff in his solitary cell at Corcoran . The 31-year-old prisoner looks at his restraints and can be heard on tape telling the guards: 'I don't want to be executed'. Authorities said without the medication, the prisoner would have died .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:49 EST, 25 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:23 EST, 25 October 2013 . The parents of a five-year-old Iowa boy have had to teach him to learn when he may be hurt because he cannot feel pain. Isaac Brown was born with a congenital insensitivity to pain, which means he rarely feels anything even when he breaks a bone. 'The toddler years were an absolute . nightmare,' Isaac's mother, Carrie, said. 'He would just drop to . the ground and smack his face on the table. He thought the fall was . fun.' Growing pains: Isaac with his parents Carrie and Randy Brown, who had to teach him how to know he had been hurt . Like most toddlers Isaac has had his fair share of cuts and scrapes. He has stuck his hand in hot coffee and on a hot stove, cut himself on a shard of glass and broken his pelvis - all without shedding a tear. Because he can't feel when he is hurt, Isaac's parents have to keep a constant watch on their active son, and try to teach him to understand when he may have injured himself. 'We're doing the best we can to just . teach him; he knows blood is bad,' Mrs Brown told Good Morning America. 'We taught him even when . he was little to say ""ow"".' You don't have to tell normal kids to say ""ow"".' Isaac's condition, Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis, affects fewer than 100 people in the U.S. As well as not feeling pain, the untreatable disorder makes Isaac unable to sweat or feel extreme heat and cold. Cautious: Isaac plays on a trampoline with two of his brothers. His parents want him to have as normal a childhood as possible but have to keep a close watch on him . Keeping cool: In the summer Isaac, who can't sweat, wears this specially made vest to control his temperature . Although his parents sought medical help, there is little doctors can do to treat the condition. When she first took her son to a specialist, Mrs Brown was told to just watch him carefully and bring him in if he appears to be injured. The couple found more practical help through online support group The Gift of Pain, where parents whose children have the same disorder shared their experiences. 'We got a ton of ideas of people who have gone through it,' Mrs Brown said. 'They have been a gift to us.' Hope: Dr Stephen Waxman is trying to identify the gene mutation that causes the condition . Next month the family will attend Camp Painless but Hopeful, set up by the family of 13-year-old Ashlyn Blocker who has the same disorder. The camp will give the Browns the chance to learn more about the condition and spend time with families in a similar situation. Camp Painless is held in Georgia in November so children with the condition can do the same fun activities others their age do over the summer. Because the condition prevents sufferers from controlling their temperature, children with it often have to stay indoors when it is hot, or wear cooling vests when they go outside. Dr Stephen Waxman, of Yale University's Center for Neuroscience and Regeneration Research, said because the disease is so rare it made . sense that parents might turn to others in the same situation for advice. 'There's . not guidelines,' he said. 'I think we doctors . need to work with [these patients] and educate them and we need to learn . more about this disorder.' For the Brown family, having a child with Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis has been a learning curve. When Isaac's father, Randy, accidentally stepped on his child, the five-year-old giggled because he thought it was funny. Mr Brown had to explain that being stepped on was a bad thing, and that Isaac should say 'Ow' and tell an adult he was hurt. A few hours later, Isaac yelled 'Ow' as the family cat delicately stepped on him, believing it would hurt as much as being stepped on by an adult. A more serious injury however came when Isaac fell from some playground equipment and broke his pelvis. He knew something was wrong but it took a couple of X-rays and scans to spot the break. 'He does feel [something], but the pain . has to be 20 to 30 times greater to what we would feel,' Mrs Brown said. 'He thought his . ankle hurt.' Play time: Isaac is an active five-year-old who often has to have an X-ray when he takes a tumble . Her husband added: 'We consider him pretty normal.' 'Other kids have had all their teeth removed because they would self-mutilate, bite their tongues, chew their fingers off,' he told the Sioux City Journal. The family are currently working with researches at the Mayo clinic who are examining Isaac's DNA in the hope of uncovering the gene mutation that leads to the disorder. It could take up to eight years to find the mutation, and even when it has been found researchers still won't have a cure for Isaac. But, by finding the gene, doctors could find a way to simulate the mutation to ease suffering for patients with chronic pain. 'We could fill our clinics five times over with patients in chronic pain,' Dr Waxman said. Help: The Browns have found support from families who are also caring for children who can't feel pain . 'If researchers could disrupt a specific channel that only transfers pain messages it could possibly mean alleviating pain for those suffering debilitating and chronic conditions.' Mrs Brown said the possibility that her son's condition could be used to help others has been a silver lining for the family. 'When he was diagnosed, [doctors said] there's nothing we can do for Isaac, not yet anyway,' Mrs Brown said 'But the fact that they can take his mutated gene and cause people with chronic pain to feel less pain. The thought of that is unreal.'","Iowa boy has Congenital Insensitivity to Pain with Anhidrosis .

Graphic video footage showing three Royal Marines allegedly murdering a wounded prisoner in Afghanistan will not be released because it could put the lives of British troops ‘at risk’, a judge ruled yesterday. Judge Advocate Jeff Blackett said the ‘shocking’ DVD would be a propaganda gift to extremists and endanger UK service personnel and civilians. The Daily Mail and other media organisations had asked that images of the Marines shooting the severely wounded insurgent - already played in open court - should be made available publicly. Members of the defence legal team at Bulford Court Martial 'Board' sit next to a blue screen erected in the courtroom to hide the identities of three Royal Marine Commandos accused of murder . But the judge ruled the video clips so disturbing it could be used to ‘incite attacks’ against British troops and members of the public. Film footage showing the blood-stained detainee being dragged across a field in Helmand Province and shot at point blank range with a 9mm pistol in September 2011 was recorded by a camera mounted on the helmet of another marine. It was discovered by police investigating war crimes a year later. The marines, who can only be identified as A, B and C, are accused of ‘executing’ the stricken insurgent. A court martial in Wiltshire has been told that Marine A killed the man with a bullet to the chest and was helped and encouraged by B and C. All three deny murder. Arguing the video clips should not be released, senior Home Office counter-terrorism expert Paul Mott told Judge Blackett the images would go viral on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube within minutes. He said: ‘I’ve seen nothing that surpasses it in terms of radicalisation potential. It’s exceptionally worrying, There’s nothing I have seen that matches its emotional power. It is a gift in propaganda terms. ‘I am confident that if made publicly available this footage would not only be used as propaganda material by terrorist organisations in order to radicalise others but would also be exploited by terrorist organisations to incite individuals to carry out terrorist acts. ‘Releasing it would therefore present a real threat to life for members of the armed forces and the wider British public and for British interests overseas.’ The video has already been played in open court. This sketch shows members of the Bulford Court Martial Board scrutinising the video clip last week . Mr Mott said footage of incidents such as the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq or US Marines urinating on dead insurgents in Afghanistan had been exploited by jihadists as propaganda. Clare Kissin, barrister for the media organisations, said there was no evidence releasing the footage would pose a ‘real and immediate risk to life’. She said there was a ‘clear public interest’ in publicising the images because it involved ‘serious and important questions about the action of service personnel in conflict zones'. But in a written judgement, Judge Blackett said the DVD would ‘generate significant feelings of anger and revenge among certain people and will incite attacks on British service personnel at home and abroad’. He said the principle of open justice was ‘immutable’. But he added: ‘It must be subject to exemptions particularly when dealing with threats posed by terrorist organisations which repeatedly attempt to radicalise people whom they can incite to commit atrocities. ‘Releasing it for unrestricted public consumption would expose British service personnel to increased risk of harm unnecessarily. ‘I am not prepared to ignore his [Mr Mott’s] very stark warning to put the lives of British service personnel at risk.’ The court martial continues.

Somewhere inside the Pentagon sits a notoriously tight-lipped man whose words Defense Department top brass take as gospel and whose mysterious office exists to predict the future. Andrew W. Marshall, 92, is nicknamed Yoda both for his bald head and uncanny ability to foresee advancements in military technology and warfare strategy decades in advance and has done so for the Office of Net Assessment since Richard Nixon gave his the agency’s top job back in 1973. And though Marshall has accurately predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, the rise of China, and the advent of drone warfare, and is credited with helping end the Cold War, the ‘Pentagon’s futurist-in-chief’ could see his entire office axed if some bureaucrats get their way. Mysterious, he is: Andrew W. Marshall, 92, (left) is known as Yoda (right) to Pentagon top brass because of his bald head and uncanny ability to predict what the state of warfare will be 20 to 30 years in the future . For the last twenty years, Yoda has been . using the force to contemplate scenarios of an American war with China, . a nation whose military spending could outpace our own within 20 years. As for predictions, he's said that performance enhancing drugs will one day very soon be just as important as technological developments. 'People who are connected with neural pharmacology tell me that new classes of drugs will be available relatively shortly, certainly within the decade,' Marshall told Wired in an extremely rare interview from 2003. Marshall has given very few interviews over the years and very rarely allows himself to be quoted in the press. 'One of the people I talk to jokes that a future intelligence problem is going to be knowing what drugs the other guys are on,' he said. He's proven his predictive prowess with the fall of the Soviet Union, which he helped catalyze, and managed to keep his office afloat through every presidency since Nixon's. But on October 15, Defense News reported that Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and his department were considering getting rid of the internal think tank in light of serious budget cuts. Marshall is so revered in the . tight, smoke-filled circles in which he’s traveled for 40 years, however, that critical voices have chosen to remain nameless. Prescient: Here, Marshall receives the 2008 Presidential Citizens Medal from President George W. Bush. Since 1973, Marshall has navigated the highest and most secretive circles of the U.S. military thanks to his remarkable abilities . Nixonian: This photo was taken in 1973, the same year President Richard Nixon gave Marshall the reigns to the Pentagon's newly formed Office of Net Assessment, an in-house think tank formed to predict the state of warfare 20-30 years in the future . And its mysteriousness is working against it. ‘You . can’t quite tell what the nation is getting out of it,’ a former senior . defense official who spoke on the condition of anonymity told the . Washington Post. That’s . because reports out of Marshall’s office—which cover everything from . potential nuclear strike outcomes, to energy use in Asia, to U.S. military superiority and any number of warfare and security topics—are . so classified that the only person who can read many of them in the . Defense Department is the Secretary of Defense himself. Even officials speaking on the record aren’t saying much on the subject. ‘The . Department of Defense is currently assessing our missions, structure . and programs in light of an evolving set of strategic challenges, as . well as a constrained fiscal environment,’ Lieutenant Colonel Damien . Pickart, a Pentagon spokesman, told the Post in a statement. ‘It would . be premature to comment on pre-decisional issues.’ Regardless of his office’s usefulness as a whole, no one seems to deny Marshall’s personal gifts as a gazer into the politico-military world of tomorrow. ‘Mr. Marshall’s brain is highly networked,’ John Arquilla, Navy professor who has known Marshall for decades, told the Post while praising his ‘mental suppleness.’ His age, Arquialla said, isn’t an issue, either: . ‘His mind is as sharp as ever. He’s gotten not just a second wind but a third wind in recent years.’ Uncertain future: Chuck Hagel and the Department of Defense have considered giving Marshall and his office the axe due to budget cuts, but a high powered group of Washington insider quickly rallied around their 'futurist-in-chief' Also among his fans is China’s General Chen Zhou, who last week said in an interview with the Economist: ‘We studied RMA exhaustively. Our great hero was Andy Marshall in the Pentagon. We translated every word he wrote.’ RMA stands for revolution in military affairs, a theory favored by Marshall that basically states that warfare technology develops in short and intermittent but transformative spurts—think bows and arrows to cannons to atomic bomb. While some say he’s exaggerated such a possibility in order to keep his obscure office funded, other say this sort of thing is exactly why America needs Marshall. One lawmaker pushing to keep the office around is Representative J. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican. ‘Given the critical contributions to U.S. national security made by the office during its forty-year history and its role as a central repository for long-range strategic thinking, we believe it would be a serious error to further consider its abolition.’ said Forbes, who is Chairman of the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee. A bigger name fighting for Marshall himself is a man who worked closely with the ONA during his own tenure at the Pentagon. ‘Forefront of strategy & transformation @DeptofDefense for 40yr, to cut Andy Marshall & ONA would be a serious mistake,’ tweeted former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld October 19. Allies: Among the 92-year-old warfare genius's strident supporters is former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, who said ousting Marshall 'would be a serious mistake'","Andrew W.

They say the institutions will have to raise their charges and increase the contributions from lecturers to plug a ‘very worrying’ deficit much higher than previously thought. The Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) is the biggest pension fund in the country with 303,000 members – most of them on gold-plated final salary pensions. Squeezed: Students could be hit with a £1,000 increase in tuition fees to plug the deficit in staff pensions . USS put its shortfall at £7.9billion in a report last month. But pensions consultant John Ralfe, a former finance director of Boots, says the real deficit is £2.6billion higher. He examined the data for an investigation by BBC2’s Newsnight. Using the same analysis methods that private companies use, he put the deficit at £10.5billion. To make good that deficit over 20 years would require a near doubling of contributions  to £1.8billion, he said. That could be achieved by a rise in tuition fees of up to £1,000 a year. ‘There is a whole degree of denial,’ Mr Ralfe said. ‘USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. 'We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. ‘There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we’re doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children.’ Higher education minister David Willetts said it would be wrong to pass on the cost to students . The USS has assets of £37.9billion – more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. However, it has admitted it has a huge deficit. Professor Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, said the size of the scheme’s black hole was concerning. ‘It’s very worrying now and it  looks even more worrying for the future,’ he said. ‘It would be an added cost that we would have to cover either from tuition fees or some  other source, either philanthropy or earnings from consulting or other enterprises.’ But higher education minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students. ‘Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits,’ he said. ‘It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits  to support pension schemes that  are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they’re older.’ As well as the threat of higher tuition fees – which can already cost as much as £9,000 a year – university staff could face the prospect of having to pay more for their pensions. They are already planning to strike next week over pay. Bill Galvin, chief executive of USS, said that higher contributions or cuts to benefits had to be considered. ‘It’s been done in 2008. It’s been done in 2011. We’re looking at it again now,’ he added. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, denied yesterday that tuition fees will have to rise to plug the black hole. ‘Employers have already taken significant steps to address the fund deficit and will continue to work on long-term solutions to ensure that USS remains sustainable and affordable,’ she said. ‘The range of challenges facing the fund are not exclusive to USS and impact on all pension schemes. There is no question that tuition fees will be increased to plug the USS funding shortfall.’ A USS spokeswoman said: 'USS has been entirely transparent about the deficit figures and provides comprehensive estimates to institutions on an annual basis. 'USS has made changes to both benefits and contribution levels in recent years to deal with historic deficits and will continue  to work with employers and members’ representatives to agree a recovery plan which is commensurate with the long-term nature of the scheme. The employers have made it clear there is no suggestion that tuition fees will be increased to provide additional funding for the scheme.'","The Universities Superannuation Scheme is Britain's biggest pension fund .

Initiative: David Cameron today visited the Mini factory in Oxford to launch new plans to boost the skills of British young people . Eastern Europeans find it so easy to get jobs in Britain because many of our young people are not ‘fully capable’ of holding down work, David Cameron has said. The Prime Minister said the UK needs to ‘say no’ to the current situation, which sees half of workers in many factories coming from abroad. Poor training and school standards mean young Britons do not have the skills and qualifications to compete, he said. He told apprentices at a Mini factory  in Oxfordshire he did not blame ‘hard-working’ Eastern Europeans for travelling here, nor employers for hiring them. But because our education system has failed many school-leavers and the welfare  system has not incentivised work, Britons are often a cut below other workers, he said. ‘Immigration, welfare and education are totally linked,’ said Mr Cameron. ‘You go round factories in our country and half the people have come from Poland or Lithuania or Latvia. You can’t blame them. They work hard. ‘They see the jobs, they come over and they do them. But as a country what we ought to be saying is “no”.’ He said: ‘Let’s get our education system right so we are producing young people out of our schools and colleges who are fully capable of doing the jobs. Second, let’s reform the welfare system so that it doesn’t pay to be out of work. And third, let’s have sensible controls on immigration. ‘Crack those three problems together and we’ll create an economy that really generates wealth for all our people.’ The comments come weeks after London Mayor Boris Johnson backed chef Jamie Oliver, who suggested many young Britons were ‘lazy’ and ‘wet behind the ears’. Speech: The Prime Minister said he did not blame foreign workers for coming to the UK to look for jobs . And this summer, civil society minister Nick Hurd said some young people lacked the ‘grit’ and social skills to get a job. Yesterday, . skills minister Matt Hancock said: ‘We have a record number of jobs in . this country and we’ve got to make sure that as people leave school, . they are in a position to take those jobs. ‘And likewise employers should look at . local young people. I don’t blame the employers at all – my job is to . make sure that young people have got what it takes.’ He . said a recent study showed Britain was ‘the only country in the world . where 65-year-olds have better skills than those who have left school in . the last few years’. Scheme: Mr Cameron is seeking to promote apprenticeships to help British workers' prospects . Mr . Cameron defended the Government’s controversial work experience scheme, . in which people do internships in return for benefits. He . said: ‘Getting people into the workplace, giving them experience of . work, of timekeeping and all the things it means to have a job is a . really good way to help get people started.’ He added: ‘The danger for a . country like Britain is yes, you see the economy recover, yes you see . jobs coming, but you leave behind people who have not got the right . qualifications from school. ‘I don’t want that to happen in our country.’ The . Prime Minister spoke as more than 60 leading firms – including Mini’s . owners BMW, BAE Systems, Microsoft and Barclays Bank – signed up to . deliver new, tougher apprenticeship schemes, which will last at least a . year and include maths and English tests. Downing . Street said all new apprenticeships should meet the standards by . 2017/18, while intensive vocational training will be offered to those . for whom apprenticeships are not the best option. Accenture, BAE Systems, Barclays, BT, Centrica, Diageo, G .

Wanting for nothing: Miss Cann, now 33, was raised by hard-working middle-class parents . But far from being born into the . benefits ‘trap’, as she claims, she was raised by hard-working . middle-class parents who are at a loss to explain how their rebellious . daughter has veered so far from the path they intended for her. ‘It . is deplorable,’ said Stephen Cann, 62, a biomedical scientist who works . full-time for the NHS and lives in a £300,000 cottage in a Wiltshire . village with his second wife Nikki, 58, a manager at a BMI private . hospital. ‘Every time I . tell her to get work she has another baby,’ he said. ‘I keep telling her . she can’t have any more children but she won’t listen. We did not bring . her up like this. We are horrified.’ Miss Cann, who is pregnant with her tenth child with Leigh Miller, 40, a former convict and drug addict, caused a huge row last week after she demanded they be rehoused. The couple moved into their  semi-detached housing association home in Bournemouth eight years  ago with their daughter Ayesha, now 13, and sons Danny, 12, and Jamie, ten. Despite neither of them working, they went on to have Dean, now nine, Luke, seven, Leon, four, Karleigh, three, Mercedes, one and Brooke, ten months. They also keep a pet Royal Python, which lives in a large lit glass vivarium in the lounge. While they have trashed their home – with doors smashed in, graffiti on the walls and mould growing on the ceilings – the property has the latest gadgets, including a 50in plasma TV, Sky HD+ and broadband, video consoles, an iPad and a brand new American-style fridge, washing machine and tumble drier set. They have funded their lifestyle with £127 a week in child benefits, £482 a week in child tax credits and a discretionary £200 monthly payment towards their housing association rent, meaning they pay £253 a month for a property which would cost five times that if it were rented privately. They also received £112.50 in jobseekers’ allowance until last month when Mr Miller, who claimed to have emphysema, was told by a doctor to ‘go to the gym, get fit and get a job’.

The 37-year-old, who finished her award-winning debut novel White Teeth during her final year at Cambridge University, said: ‘People seem to think I put those photos in the paper. I don’t put them in. Photo editors put my photo in because it’s the easiest thing to do, I suppose.’ She added: ‘Some of it is just ridiculous. A friend was telling me that in an Italian newspaper they had an editorial letter about how I was probably quite a good writer. ‘But I couldn’t possibly be a great writer because, in their opinion, I was too attractive and when you thought about writers those things never went together.’ Ms Smith went on to cite Sylvia Plath as an example of a beautiful female author before addressing ‘sinister’ sexist attitudes. She said: ‘What is fascinating about it is what it assumes. ‘It is a really misogynistic and fascinating thought.

With creations ranging from kung pao Chicken McNuggets to tapas and slow-cooked beef with Mac Fry gnocchi, the foods appeared to be worlds apart from the usual fast food fare of burgers and fries found at the golden arches. Award-winning chefs Dale Talde, of Brooklyn’s Talde, James Tahhan of Telelmundo fame, The Next Food Network Star winner Aaron McCargo Jr and McDonald’s in-house chef Jessica Foust all competed against each other at an event in New York to create some exotic dishes.

Not coming to a restaurant near you: The dishes were all created for a one-off event... but it shows you what can be achieved! Meanwhile, the rest of us will have be content with a Big Mac and fries . The transformation wizardry didn't stop at the food either. Among the drinks being offered were a mango pineapple mojito, made with the mango smoothie base, and a bacon old fashioned. The first dish, from Chef Talde, was kung pao Chicken McNuggets. Three nuggets doused in sweet and sour sauce, rice wine vinegar and peanuts atop a small bed of shredded Big Mac lettuce with sliced orange, according to Thrillist. Would you like fries with that? McDonald's USA Chef Jessica Foust, RD, prepared dishes featuring only McDonald's ingredients .

The first was a slow-cooked beef with blueberry pomegranate sauce and Mac Fry gnocchi. The blueberries and pomegranates come from the smoothies and the fries were turned into a potato gnocchi. The slow-cooked beef was the same meat used by the fast food chain prior to turning it into burger meat. Dessert looked just as mouthwatering as Chef Foust made a doughnut from the chain’s biscuit mix and topped it with pumpkin spice latte syrup.

Casting directors for the new Star Wars film are set to hold open auditions across the UK. Actors Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia and Harrison Ford as Han Solo in Star Wars: Episode IV, A New Hope in 1977 . The new characters could follow in the footsteps of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen who starred in the 2005 film Star Wars: Episode III, Revenge of the Sith . According to a casting notice the film-makers are looking for an actor and actress to fill two roles. They are a 17-year-old 'street smart and strong' orphaned girl and a 'smart capable' man in his late teens or early 20s. The casting notice released on . Twitter calling for two lead roles for an upcoming Disney film . The open auditions were first revealed on the Twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a 'nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie'. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series in October 2012. The new film will be the first produced by Disney since taking over the film company founded by George Lucas - creator of the Star Wars franchise. The description of the characters is almost the same as those leaked online earlier in the year when the overall casting process began, the BBC reported.In the past the Star Wars franchise has given little known actors and actresses major roles. In the original triology the then unknown Mark Hamill was cast in the role of Luke Skywalker. The new production will form part of the third trilogy of films and is set to be directed by JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the film. He is said to be annoyed that the movie is being filmed in London, having said he wished to avoid moving his family across the Atlantic. After receiving high acclaim from critics for his direction of the first two Star Trek films, Abrams revealed earlier this year that he would not be taking the reins for the third installment as he prepares for his first foray into the Star Wars genre. The announcement of his selection as director for the next blockbuster in the franchise came in January prompting speculation among fans and industry heavyweights as to whether or not he can correct a string of mediocre modern Star Wars films. Star Wars creator George Lucas is set to act as a creative consultant for Episode VII, which will begin shooting at the Pinewood Studios next spring and is set to be released in 2015. There is speculation cast members Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher from the original trilogy will appear in the film.","First open audition taking place in Bristol this Saturday .

A group of Saudi Arabian women have got behind the wheel today in protest at the ban on women driving in the kingdom. Four women have successfully driven, defying the ban, despite warnings by police officers and ultraconservatives in Arab state, activist May Al Sawyan said. Though no specific Saudi law exists banning women from driving, the female population are not issued licences. Scroll down for video . Activist Manal Al Sharif showed her support for Saudi women who defied the country's ban on female drivers . Defiant: Four women have successfully driven in the kingdom, protesting at the state's ban on women driving . Powerful religious leaders, who exert a far-reaching influence over the monarchy, enforce the ban warning that breaking it will spread 'licentiousness'. In the run up to today's protest, police warned anyone disturbing public order would be dealt with forcefully. Ultraconservative clerics staged protests earlier in this week against the online petition campaign, which was launched in September, which claims to have more than 16,000 signatures. The account's website, oct26driving.org, and official English language YouTube account were hacked on Friday, according to activists. Activists posted a four minute-long video on the campaign's official Arabic account that they said filmed driving campaign supporter Al Sawyan driving in Riyadh. She wore sunglasses and her hair was covered by the traditional black headscarf worn by Saudi women, but her face was otherwise visible. Like other female drivers defying the ban in Saudi Arabia, Al Sawyan said she has obtained a driver's license from abroad. 'I am very happy and proud that there was no reaction against me,' she said. 'There were some cars that drove by. 'They were surprised, but it was just a glance. It is fine ... They are not used to seeing women driving here.' Protest: Female campaigners have filmed themselves driving and uploaded the footage online . However, Al Sawyan said she was prepared for the risk of detention if caught. She said she was far enough from a police car that she was not spotted. 'I just took a small loop. I didn't drive for a long way, but it was fine. I went to the grocery store,' she said.

Newly-released tablet computers from Tesco and Argos could put children at risk of stumbling across porn because they do not come fitted with filters, an expert warned last night. Tesco has brought out a cheap device called a Hudl, while Argos has introduced MyTablet which is aimed specifically at ‘tweenies’ aged from eight to 13. Both are expected to be bought by hundreds of thousands of parents for their children at Christmas. Tesco's Hudl tablets, which cost £119, could put children at risk of stumbling across porn, an expert has warned . But the Tesco tablet, which retails for just £119, does not come supplied with pre-installed filters which protect against adult materials being viewed by youngsters. Neither does Argos’s device, costing £100 - despite advertising that it comes with ‘parental controls’. John Carr, from the Children’s Charities’ Coalition on Internet Safety, said he was worried that the devices could expose young children to hardcore imagery. Many other popular tablets, such as the iPad, also do not come with such filters, but Mr Carr said Tesco and Argos had greater responsibility because their cheaper models were more likely to be used by children. He said he believed that Tesco had ‘dropped a clanger’, because with the Hudl ‘you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds’. ‘Argos in particular needs to re-examine what they are doing,’ he said. ‘They expressly state that they are going after 8 to 13 year olds. In other words they are going after young children.’ He added: ‘I imagine hundreds of thousands will be heading into children’s Christmas stockings this year. ‘This makes it all the more disappointing that companies that ought to know better have not gone the extra mile to make these devices as safe as they can be when they come out of the box. ‘True enough, other tablets on the market may not be any better than a Hudl when it comes to online child safety, but other tablets are not manufactured by a flagship British company.’ Last night Tesco said it was ‘leading the way’ on providing parents with information on how to protect their children, such as by giving them advice on filters when they switch on the Hudl for the first time. They said they had been advised by charity Parentzone that this sort of education was more effective than installing a filter which can never block everything. The Daily Mail has been campaigning in favour of an automatic block on online porn, with content blocked unless the user can prove via a strict age verification check that they are over 18. Charities warn that easy access to adult materials can have damaging effects on youngsters, including warping young boys’ views of how to treat girls. Tesco and Argos both offer tablet computers that are considerably cheaper than iPad models . The latest study by Ofcom fund that 37 per cent of children aged just three and four are going online, and 9 per cent are using tablets. These figures are likely to increase as the availability of cheaper tablets such as the Hudl gathers pace. In July, David Cameron said he wanted to see all homes to be asked whether they wanted to install child-friendly filters. But on his blog, Mr Carr said that Tesco had undermined what the Prime Minister was demanding. Tesco’s failing comes despite the fact that it has a representative on the high-level UK Council for Child Internet Safety, which brings industry and campaigners together with ministers. A member of the board is Tesco’s UK head of product development Andrew Uden. Mr Carr’s blog goes on: ‘Straight out of the box if you only click Next or Enter, depending on the wi-fi connection that happens to be available, you can be right in among the hard core porn and all sorts of other kinds of adult content within seconds. ‘Tesco have dropped a clanger. This is all the more surprising because elsewhere in the forest Tesco have shown considerable leadership when it comes to online safety.’ Mr Carr said he accepted that when the Hudl is activated, a screen comes up saying; ‘Sharing your Hudl with a child?’ which gives advice about installing a filter. But he said that in many cases it would be children themselves switching the tablet on for the first time – and they would not heed warnings about filters. Even if the parent looks at the advice, it is so lengthy that, on Christmas morning, ‘eyes will glaze over’. ‘Murder and mayhem have broken out in the living room,’ he said. ‘You might resolve to come back and check out the safety stuff later, but you won’t. ‘Little Johnnie or little Jennie will be off on their voyage of discovery with potentially disastrous results.’ Last night a spokesman for Tesco said: ‘We asked the experts, like Parent Zone, for advice. They were clear that the key is awareness raising and education. ‘We created an overlay screen that clearly guides users on online protection, going beyond what other manufacturers currently do. ‘We tested a wide range of filters but none of those currently blocks all harmful content. We didn’t want to offer parents a solution we didn’t have complete confidence in. If a reliable filter becomes available we will use it.’","Expert warns the newly-released tablets do not come fitted with filters .

Ordeal: Jeanette Akua, pictured in her high school days in South Africa, was handing out leaflets in Johannesburg when she was attacked . X-Factor star Jeanette Akua has revealed she was kidnapped by a gang of armed thieves who held her at gunpoint for two days. The Miss Dynamix star said she feared for her life during the terrifying ordeal which happened when she was in her native South Africa. Miss Akua, 21, was standing at a taxi rank in Johannesburg handing out flyers. The gang approached her and a friend and dragged her off them from the street into a room in a taxi office. The terrified girls were told to hand over money in return for their release. Miss Akua, who was 18 at the time, was working in the notorious Randburg district of the town, which has high levels of muggings, gun crime and car-jackings. She was locked up for 48 hours and given no access to food or water. She said she was singled out by the yobs because she was from a 'good home'. The singer, who is now a beautician in the UK, was only freed after she contacted the employment agency she was working with and they agreed to pay a £400 ransom. Now competing in the live shows of the Saturday night talent show, she said the ordeal has made her feel lucky to be alive. Recalling the incident, the singer told The Mirror: . 'I thought they were going to kill us. In South Africa people are . murdered for less than 2p. You hear these stories but you never think it . will happen to you.

The archive, which consists of around 220 drawings, blueprints, specifications, memoranda and letters, effectively tells the story of how it was developed during the crucial period in the early years of the war. A unique archive charting the wartime development of the jet engine by the pioneering engineer Sir Frank Whittle is expected to fetch up to £30,000 at auction next month. This sketch of how the engine would work (pictured) is among the papers for sale . It will be sold at Bonhams' sale of Books, Maps, Manuscripts and Historical Photographs in London on November 12, when experts expect it to fetch between £20,000 and £30,000. Bonhams specialist Matthew Haley said: 'This is one of the most important and complete archives on a technological development which has shaped all our lives. 'It is a fascinating insight into the often tortuous way in which an idea takes shape and progresses through trial and error against the backdrop of the misunderstandings and professional frustrations common to any project.' Sir Frank, a British RAF engineer air officer, is credited with single handedly inventing the turbojet engine - one of the major technological developments of the 20th century . The development of the jet engine influenced not only the course of World War Two but underpinned the huge expansion of commercial aviation in the post war period. It enabled planes to fly at high altitude and at speeds of over 500 miles per hour for the first time. A 2002 BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons ranked Sir Frank at number 42. The archive is contained in a 'special file,' which belonged to Henry Nathan Sporborg, who was senior director and chief engineer of British Thomson-Houston. The archive, which consists of around 220 drawings including this one, blueprints, specifications, memoranda and letters, effectively tells the story of how it was developed during the crucial period in the early years of the war . The company manufactured the engine for Frank Whittle and Power Jets Ltd, under contract from the Air Ministry, between January 1940 and June 1941. Sir Frank had been working on his idea of a jet engine since 1930 and with financial backing, had established the company, Power Jets Limited, to develop the idea further. He attracted no interest from the War Ministry, however, until the late 1930s when the combination of the threat of war and the technological advances which Whittle was able to demonstrate changed official minds. The development of the jet engine influenced not only the course of World War Two but underpinned the huge expansion of commercial aviation in the post war period. Pictured is a letter from the Ministry of Aircraft Production . By 1940 the Ministry was writing to Mr Sporborg emphasising the importance of the work. One extract from the papers that will be sold, said: 'I hope that if you are fully aware of the great importance that the Air Ministry attach to the development of this Whittle engine you will take all steps in your power to ensure that no unnecessary delay occurs in the completion of these engines and that you will do all in your power to assist Power Jets Limited in their work.' Sir Frank's genius lay in realising that propeller engines, with their hundreds of complicated working parts, were approaching the limit of their capacity. Another intricate drawing by Sir Frank Whittle showing the workings of the jet engine. His genius lay in realising that propeller engines were approaching the limit of their capacity. To enable planes to fly at speeds of over 500 miles per hour he proposed using a variant on the internal combustion engine with the hot gases used for propulsion . To enable planes to fly at high altitude . and at speeds of over 500 miles per hour he proposed using a variant on . the internal combustion engine, which directly heats the air by . combusting fuel, with the resultant hot gases used for propulsion. With far fewer components than propeller engines this also had the advantage of being much simpler to maintain. Sir Frank is reported to have said: 'Reciprocating engines are exhausted. They have hundreds of parts jerking to and fro and they cannot be made more powerful without becoming too complicated. 'The engine of the future must produce 2000 horsepower with one moving part: a spinning turbine and compressor.' His work was developed some years earlier than that of Germany's Dr Hans von Ohain who was the designer of the first operational jet engine. Each worked separately and knew nothing of the other's work. Whittle was the first to register a patent for the turbojet engine in January 1930, while Mr von Ohain was granted a patent for his turbojet engine in 1936. However, Mr von Ohain's jet was the first to fly in 1939 - Sir Frank's jet first flew in in 1941. Sir Frank, who was born in Earlsdon, Coventry, retired from the RAF in 1948, was a founding member of the Royal Academy of Engineering and received a knighthood. He later relocated to America and died in 1996 at his home in Columbia, Maryland.

Difficult case: Zimmerman claimed he was acting in self-defence when he shot Trayvon Martin on the night of February 26 and has not yet been charged over the incident . A volunteer captain of a Florida neighbourhood watch, who shot dead a black teen and then claimed he acted in self defence, had a 'history of aggressive tactics,' it has today emerged. Neighbours in George Zimmerman's gated community,  at Twin Lakes, near Orlando, had issued complaints about the 26-year-old to local police and the homeowners association before the February 26 shooting, a homeowner said. Zimmerman has not been charged in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, 17, who was gunned down as he returned to his father’s house with candy for his younger brother. Martin had been visiting his father from Miami. According to a police report, Zimmerman, who was patrolling the neighbourhood in his car, had initially called police to report a 'suspicious person in the area'. Zimmerman was told to keep his distance, but before officers could reach the scene, there was some kind of confrontation between him and Martin. The teen was shot once in the chest just yards from his father's home. Zimmerman claimed he had fired his 9mm handgun in self-defence and the police say they have no reason to suspect he is lying. A resident, who attended an emergency homeowner's association meeting after the shooting on March 1, told the Huffington Post how 'one man was escorted out because he openly expressed his frustration because he had previously contacted the Sanford Police Department about Zimmerman approaching him and even coming to his home. 'It was also made known that there had been several complaints about . George Zimmerman and his tactics' in his neighborhood watch role, they added. Sanford Police Chief Bill Lee, who is leading the investigation into the shooting, and a member of the city council both attended the meeting, according to the homeowner's association newsletter. Neither were available for comment. Devastated: Trayvon's mother Sybrina Fulton said her 'heart is broken' as Zimmerman has not yet been arrested . Tragic: Martin was coming home with Skittles and iced tea when he was shot dead in the gated community . The complaints against Zimmerman come . amid protests over the killing. The Martin family and their lawyers have . called the shooting an outrage and want Zimmerman arrested. They . believe Zimmerman - who is white - had profiled . the teen, who is black. Civil rights leaders, including . members of the NAACP and the Rev Al Sharpton, say they are also . preparing to back the Martin family. Rev Sharpton told the Huffington . Post: 'This case is disturbing to say the least. This is appalling, to . think that this guy admitted to initiating the conversation and that . there was no crime other than the killing of this young man. Yet, . (Zimmerman) is walking around with no threat of an arrest.' Shot dead: Trayvon Martin was killed as he walked home from a shop at a Florida gated community where his father lives . Police Chief Lee said the investigation into the shooting should be concluded later on today, at a press conference yesterday. The State Attorney's Office will then decide whether to present it to a grand jury. The chief was heckled by protestors . during the press conference when he said he did not believe . investigators had enough evidence to charge Zimmerman. '...there is the right for someone . that has a concealed weapons permit to carry that weapon' he said, . according to local news reports. 'In this case Mr. Zimmerman has made the statement of self defence. Until we can establish probable cause to dispute that, we don’t have the . grounds to arrest him.' A police report said Zimmerman . reported a suspicious person in the neighbourhood and minutes later 911 . dispatchers received several calls of shots being fired in the . neighborhood. Zimmerman told police officers that he had shot Martin and officers found a semiautomatic handgun on him. The report said that Zimmerman's back . was wet and he was covered in grass as if he had been on the ground. He . was bleeding from his nose and the back of the head, the report said. A police officer said he overheard . Zimmerman say, 'I was yelling for someone to help me but no one would . help me' while he was being treated by paramedics. On . Thursday, the family said they were suing police to get access to 911 . calls in the case, which they believe could provide clues to Trayvon’s . death. Police say the 911 recording is evidence in the on-going investigation. Martin's father, Tracy, said that family members were upset that no arrest had been made. Exclusive: The entrance to the gated community where Martin was shot . The family's attorneys also questioned why a neighbourhood watch leader would carry a gun. 'He was stereotyped for some reason,' the Martins' attorney Ben Crump said of the victim. 'Why was Trayvon suspicious? There are hundreds of children in that community.’ Mr . Crump also called Zimmerman a ‘loose cannon’ and pointed out that . Zimmerman was arrested in Orange County in 2005 for resisting arrest and . battery of a police officer. 'He had a gun, and Trayvon had Skittles,' Mr Krump said. 'We want justice.' Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, is angry no actions have yet been taken against . the man who shot her son, telling WESH.com: 'As a mother, my heart is broken.’ Tracy Martin, also demanded justice. ‘My son left Sanford, . Florida, in a body bag,’ he told wesh.com. ‘While George Zimmerman went . home to go to sleep in his own bed.

In four years, I never heard a word out of his mouth,' Hamilton told The Los Angeles Times. 'He was quiet and people would take advantage of that.' Welfare check: Officers visited Ciancia's apartment after his father raised concerns . Another . former classmate; Jeff Skidmore, said that Ciancia may have had a speech . impediment and did not like speaking in front of the class. Skidmore . told the paper that he did not remember Ciancia ever being bullied, . saying instead that he was just left alone by his peers. A different federal official said that it was clear from the note that he expected to die in the standoff. 'This was clearly a suicide mission... he did not expect to walk away from this,' the official told USA Today. The 23-year-old gunman is said to . have has strong anti-government views and sent a text to his brother . this morning saying he was thinking about taking his own life. CNN reports . that his text to his brother was not the first one that he had sent in . recent days that scared family members. In others, which were sent to . his brother and father, Ciancia was said to have rambled about his . negative outlook on life, his disgust with the government and his . disappointment with his life in Los Angeles. Relatives . were concerned about the latest suicidal text, so they contacted the . local New Jersey police station, who called their Los Angeles . counterparts and ordered a 'welfare check' for Ciancia. Police went to . his apartment and spoke to his two roommates before signing off and . telling the New Jersey police that everything was fine. Little did they know that as they were making that phone call, Ciancia had started shooting at LAX. Ciancia, . an American citizen with a minor criminal record, was arrested after an . armed confrontation with police and taken to a hospital, where he is . listed in critical condition after reportedly being shot in the face. The gunman, who was raised in Pennsville, New Jersey, is accused of shooting dead . a safety screener with a high-powered assault rifle and wounding . several others before being apprehended by police, according to . officials. He was pictured handcuffed to a gurney as he was escorted out of the airport after being shot multiple times by responding officers. Investigation: Police gather at the New Jersey home of Ciancia's father . According . to ABC, Ciancia's brother received a 'worrying' text from him before the . shooting, which prompted their father to call the police station to . warn them of the possible threat to his own life. Los . Angeles police went to Ciancia's apartment for a welfare check, and . spoke to the 23-year-old's roommates, who said when they last saw him on . Thursday he had been fine. Victim: Gerardo I. Hernandez was shot and killed by a gunman at the Los Angeles International Airport on Friday . The . officers reported back to headquarters that there was nothing to be . worried about but, unbeknown to them, as they made that call Ciancia had . already opened fire in LAX. There was one fatality in the shooting: Gerardo I. Hernandez, a 39-year-old father-of-two who had been working at Los Angeles International Airport for three years. Friends and family have begun paying . their respects to the slain public servant, saying that he was a loving . husband and caring father who enjoyed spending his free time with his children. The . shooting makes Hernandez the first TSA agent shot and killed in the . line of duty. One of his colleagues was also shot in the Friday rampage . but that individual is expected to make a full recovery. NBC's . Pete Williams reported that the 23-year-old suspect may have anti-government views based on the literature he . was carrying. A neighbor of Ciancia's, Whitney Hankins, 18, who went to Pennsville . Memorial High School with him, said the family were very quiet and kept to . themselves, especially after the 2009 death of the mother Susan, who suffered . from MS for years. ‘I didn’t know him personally as he was a few years older . than me,’ she said. ‘But I would see him around school and the neighborhood. Warning signs: Ciancia sent a text message to his brother on Friday morning saying he wanted to kill himself . Loner: Neighbors of Ciancia say the 23-year-old was quiet and shy . 'He was kinda strange, very quiet and shy. Wouldn’t really make eye contact or . talk much. Though I would never have expected him to do anything like this. Some of the girls on the street called him “the creepy guy”.’ The motive for the Friday morning . shooting has not been confirmed, but a note thought to be written by the . gunman is shedding some light on his thought process. Shooter . Paul Anthony Ciancia had 'anti-government' leanings and was reportedly . carrying a note which said that he 'wanted to kill TSA and pigs'. The . Los Angeles Times reported that in a note found in his bag, he wrote . about his 'disappointment with government' and how he did not intend to . injure any civilians, only federal employees. Sources also added that the note was signed with the letters 'NWO' which stands for 'New World Order'. The . conspiracy theory of a 'new world order' asserts that there is a secret . group of powerful individuals who used their money and global influence . to eventually gain control of the world. The . concept of the New World Order has many different strains that have . evolved over time, and has come to include mysterious elite groups like . the Illuminati and the Freemasons. Some . of the more radical conspiracy theorists believe that the secret . members of the New World Order will order a coordinated coup d'etat in . the United States and other powerful countries using black helicopters . and implement a totalitarian regime to control the world. Whitney said in the tight-knit middle-class neighborhood, . the Ciancia’s house was set back into the woods and was ‘humungous’ compared to . others on the street. ‘We just assumed they were really wealthy because they have . a really big house compared to the others and his dad owns an auto shop up the . street. 'It’s a really small town and everyone knows everyone else’s business. But everyone just kind of left them alone after the mom died.’ The Pennsville Police Department has had no dealings with the younger Ciancia, Cummings said. He and neighbors described the Ciancias as a good, nice family. Ciancia graduated in 2008 from Salesianum School, an all-boys Roman Catholic school in Wilmington, Delaware, across the Delaware River from Pennsville, the school said. The suspect's father has been involved with Pennsville's Fraternal Order of Police, said neighbor Orlando Pagan, a lieutenant in nearby Penns Grove. He didn't provide details on his involvement. Outside the father's home Friday in Pennsville, a police cruiser blocked the long driveway. Phone calls weren't answered, and efforts to reach siblings were also unsuccessful. Orlando Pagan's 17-year-old son Josh said that he would sometimes encounter Ciancia at orthodontist appointments, but that it had been at least two years since the last one. 'He was never weird toward me. He . never gave me any weird vibes,' he said, adding that in the 10 years he . has lived across the street from the Ciancia family, 'they've been . nothing but nice to us.' Witness . Leon Saryan told ABC News Radio that a ‘fairly young’ man armed with a . rifle fired about 20 rounds as he made his way down a hallway before . confronting a TSA agent. Stranger: Some girls on the street where Ciancia grew up referred to him as 'the creepy guy' The screener, who was holding Saryan's shoes, was shot and wounded, he told ABC. The witness recalled that the suspect faced him and asked, ‘Are you TSA?’ ‘He saw me. He looked at me with a quizzical look and said, “TSA?” And I just shook my head. So he moved on,’ Saryan said. FBI agents and LAPD anti-terrorism . officials were on the scene at Terminal 3, but sources said they do not . believe the suspect was connected to any known terrorist groups, calling . him a lone shooter. LAX . Police Chief Patrick Gannon told reporters that the gunman entered . Terminal 3 at 9.20am local time, pulled an assault rifle out of his bag . and opened fire. He shot . his way through the safety screening area and moved deeper into the . terminal. Officers who responded to reports of shots fired tracked the . man to a Burger King and shot him.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:10 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:46 EST, 9 October 2013 . Restraint: Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes, pictured, said show bosses could have shot a more graphic rape scene than the one which was aired on Sunday . Julian Fellowes . has defended the airing of a rape scene in this week's episode of Downton Abbey. Answering criticism that rape scene had been sensationalist, the Oscar-winning writer said he supported ITV's decision to screen the sex attack of a maid by a visiting valet. In the episode, aired on Sunday night, Joanna Froggatt's character, Anna Bates, was attacked by Mr Green, played by EastEnders actor Nigel Harman. It sparked more than 200 complaints to ITV and Ofcom with many saying it was too strong for a Sunday night. However, Mr Fellowes said the director had shown restraint in cutting away to other rooms of the house and it could have been much more graphic. He told the BBC: 'The whole point of the way we do things on Downton is we don't do them gratuitously. We are interested in exploring the resultant emotions and the effect these things have on people. 'If we'd have wanted a sensational rape we could have stayed down . in the kitchen with the camera during the whole thing and wrung it out. 'The . point of our handling is not that we're interested in sensationalising . but we're interested in exploring the mental damage and the emotional . damage.' Joanne Froggatt has also defended the storyline, saying she is 'proud' of Downton Abbey for tackling the controversial subject. The star said it was a 'brave' move by programme-makers to feature such a difficult scene in the normally gentile Sunday night series. ITV . warned viewers about upsetting scenes before the start of the period . drama, but it still received 'around 60 complaints' by Monday . 'Brave move': Joanne Froggatt has defended Downton Abbey after the rape storyline that featured on Sunday night's show caused complaints from shocked viewer . Froggatt said during an interview on BBC1's Breakfast on Tuesday: 'I was really proud of the show for tackling a subject like this. It's a really brave thing to do and I really do believe that Julian's written that in a way that is not gratuitous at all, he does very much go on to explore the emotional journey of Anna and Bates. 'He's done a beautiful job of hitting the right note with it. I think we all just felt a big responsibility to get it right.' Froggatt, who was made aware of the storyline by producer Gareth Neame a week before she was given the script, said creators of the show did not want to show graphic violence on screen. Research: The actress said she looked as testimonies from women who had been in similar situations to prepare herself ahead of shooting the rape scene . She said: 'Julian, and this is a credit to him, was adamant that we wouldn't depict that kind of violence against a woman on the screen and that's something that he didn't want in a show of his, that he's a part of, and that's an incredible thing in this industry in this day and age. 'And the shock value was there without having to depict anything graphic. The story is shocking enough, as it should be for a story of that essence.' She said she had prepared for the role by looking at the testimonies of women who had been through a similar ordeal in those days - as well as modern women who had been reluctant to report attacks. Disturbing: Despite a warning from ITV, many viewers were left stunned by the violent scenes of Joanne's Anna Bates being raped by Mr Green . In advance: Froggatt was made aware of the storyline by producer Gareth Neame a week before she was given the script . 'I did a lot of research on the internet reading through people's stories of women who have been through similar situations, and women that hadn't gone to the police in this day and age because they were in a situation that came across as being vague when they were going to explain it - maybe they were at party or it was someone they knew and they were very confused by what had happened to them. Defense: Harman also defended the show as he appeared on This Morning on Monday . 'Now what I wanted to do - I wanted to get into my head as an actress - was to bring that to this time period.' She said the programme's historical advisor had pointed out that women still had few rights back then which made them reluctant to report such an attack. 'All you had was your reputation, your career, possibly if you had a job, and your family. There was still such a stigma attached to any sort of attack like this, that you were very much in danger of losing all of that. 'If a woman lost her reputation, that would bring shame upon the house - she could lose her job, she could lose her husband and society still saw it as no smoke without fire - ""he's only a man, he couldn't help himself"". it's very interesting to see that was only a hundred years ago,' Froggatt added. Froggatt's comments come after Nigel Harman, who plays Mr Green in the show, also defended the storyline. He said on This Morning on Monday: 'For a show like Downton Abbey it really leaps out as a bold and risky idea.' The episode was seen by an average audience of 9.2 million according to overnight figures.","Oscar-winning writer said director showed restraint .

A Lebanese-born Danish man who was once a radical islamist and was instrumental in the protests against Denmark in the wake of the Danish cartoons depicting Prophet Muhammad is a changed man. Ahmed Akkari says it is thanks to one man, a teacher in America, Wes Cecil, whose online video tutorials touched him and changed his way of thinking. Akkari, who now lives in Greenland, was furious over the cartoons which were published in a Danish newspaper, Jyllands Posten, in 2005. In his fury, he co-wrote the the Akkari-Laban dossier, which played a major role in the cartoon controversy because it brought the issue - which would have been contained in Denmark - to the attention of influential decision-makers in the Middle East. It created widespread anger in the region and spread across the world. He also became famous as the head of the delegation of Danish Muslims, who traveled around the Middle East to seek support for the resistance against the newspaper and Denmark. Former radical Islamist: Ahmed Akkari was the head of a delegation of Danish Muslims, who traveled around the Middle East to seek support for the resistance against the Muhammad cartoons in 2005 . Angry Muslims: Jordanian Islamists burn Danish and U.S. flags during a protest against the cartoons. Akkari was the one who caused the issue to ignite as he went to the Middle East to raise support against Denmark . Instigator: Ahmed Akkari (front left) in 2006. He was part of the delegation who first made an uproar about the Danish cartoons and went to the Middle East to get support, spreading the word . Furious: Akkari and other Muslims protested over the cartoons which were published in a Danish newspaper, Jyllands Posten, in 2005 . 'Sorry': Akkari has apologised to the likes of Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, whose cartoon of Prophet Muhammad enraged him and other Muslims in 2005 . But this summer Akkari returned to Denmark to apologise, saying he has turned into an apologetic agnostic. And he’s crediting his change of faith to Cecil, according to the Oregonian. Cecil, 47, who is a published playwright, novelist, essayist and academic, lives on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, far away from the cartoon controversy that sparked rage across the Muslim world, and which resulted in Danish embassies being torched during protests in Denmark, Syria, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Iran. But in his own community of 9,000, along the Salish Sea, his reputation is fabled, particularly among the 600 students who take college classes in the Old Schoolhouse building at Fort Worden State Park. 'Need my fix': Students at the Fort Worden State Park on Washington's Olympic Peninsula, say their teacher, Cecil, is the best . Inspiration: Akkari says American professor, Wes Cecil, 47, is the one who changed his radical way of thinking . He also has over 100,000 hits on his youtube videos in which he lectures about everything from modern and ancient thinkers – the German existentialist Martin Heidegger and Greek philosopher Epicurus – to literature, culture, and the humane arts of walking, letter writing and conversation. Kevin Webber, an 18-year-old student of  biology at Peninsula, says it is ‘hard to get your fix of Cecil’. ‘Really, he's as much a history teacher as an English teacher. He presents everything in such a comprehensive manner.’ In an interview last month with The Daily Beast, an Internet news outlet, Akkari, 35, and as curious as a college student, recommended Cecil's disquisitions. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper in August, he told a reporter that it was after moving to the northernmost continent in the late 2000s that his mind began to change. 'I had plenty of time to read and write. And think,' Akkari said. He embraced philosophy, starting with Danish existentialist philosopher and theologian Sren Kierkegaard, he said. 'Plenty of time to think': Akkari embraced philosophy, and started reading the Danish existentialist philosopher and theologian, Soeren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) Moving to Greenland: Akkari says he has undergone an 'existentialist crisis' after moving to the northernmost continent and immersing himself into Cecil's online tutorials . 'He told how he had stayed in Greenland and in this epic and barren environment had undergone an existential crisis,' Danish radio host Mads Holger and cultural critic Kasper Stvring said in an English translation of a Danish news story in the Berlingske Tidende newspaper. Repentant, Akkari apologised to Westergaard, the editors and artists at Jyllands-Posten, one of Denmark's most widely read newspapers, and others he had condemned. That Akkari was isolated in Greenland when he underwent the transformation in his thoughts and beliefs confirms Cecil's philosophy that the French and German 17th and 18th Century ideals on reason, known as the Enlightenment, are best absorbed in still places. ‘If you're in Greenland, man, you've got some time to kill,’ said Cecil.","Lebanese-born Danish resident Ahmed Akkari, 35, says Wes Cecil, 47,  changed him from being a radical to an 'apologetic agnostic'

Explosion: The bomb sends debris flying and a huge explosion ringing out around the sleepy village of Ikham . Sounds of war: Explosives were moved by the Royal Logistics Cops into field before being detonated . Builders discovered the first 25lb shell as they dug a new pathway at Mr Wilkinson's spa near Ickham, Kent. They alerted him and he picked it up before carefully laying it back in the ground where it had lay hidden since the First World War. Experts from the Royal Logistic Corps then dug a trench and covered the rusting explosive with sandbags in preparation for detonating the warhead. They handed the detonator to Mr Wilkinson, allowing him to trigger the explosion from a safe distance. Thinking the coast was clear, Mr Wilkinson, went back to work at the Tor Spa Retreat.

The terror suspect who went on the run disguised in a burka was facing 20 different charges for breaching court orders at the time he disappeared, it emerged today. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for a week, and today a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to attend a court hearing about a terrorism prevention and investigation measure which was imposed on him. He is currently suing the Government over claims he was tortured in Somalia, but lawyers today suggested that the proceedings should be blocked while he is still on the run. Mohamed, 27, was seen leaving a mosque in West London last Friday dressed in a burka, and has not been located since after cutting off his electronic tag. He was supposed to attend the Old Bailey today for a hearing about previous alleged breaches of his TPIM. However, after he failed to turn up - leaving his own lawyer in the lurch - Mr Justice Nicol issued an arrest warrant. The judge also lifted an anonymity order banning reporting of the 20 charges Mohamed faced before he disappeared. One indictment included six counts of breaching his TPIM by failing to report to Action police station on a number of occasions in December last year. Escape: Mohamed attended a mosque dressed in normal clothing but changed into a burka and absconded . The other involved 14 charges dating back to 2011 when Mohamed was subject to a control order, the predecessor to TPIMs. Among the charges, it is alleged he failed to report to a monitoring company, failed to report to Ipswich police station, met a person without agreement of the Home Office, and used an unauthorised mobile phone. The defendant is alleged to have fought for al-Shabaab, the Somali wing of Al Qaeda.Mohamed's solicitor Gareth Peirce told the court she had 'no reason for the defendant's non-appearance'. However, she suggested that he might somehow have been traumatised by being tortured in Somalia, allegedly with the collusion of the British security services. 'I say that because in relation to the breaches which are lateness of attendance at police stations his defence would have been that he suffered the effects and impact of torture,' Ms Peirce said. Mohamed is due to stand trial for the alleged breaches of the terrorism prevention orders on April 28 next year. Proceedings: Mohamed is currently suing the British Government over claims he was tortured in Somalia . Separately from the legal proceedings against him, he is seeking damages from the British Government over claims the UK was complicit in their detention and torture in 2011 while they were in Somaliland. Their claim is against the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence and the Attorney General, who all deny the allegations. The High Court heard today that the Government might seek to block the case as a result of Mohamed's fugitive status. James Eadie QC said the case raised the question 'whether it is abusive for someone in Mr Mohamed's position to invoke the courts' jurisdiction as a claimant whilst denying that jurisdiction by absconding'. Yesterday, fears were raised that Mohamed may have a second passport after confusion emerged over his British one. Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs on Monday that officers had seized the 27-year-old's British passport, but then revealed that this was wrong. Mohamed's British passport was cancelled before he returned to the UK, and he was placed on a 'warnings index'.

While fireworks are normally imported between July and September in preparation for bonfire night, the Chinese Government this year put a total stop on the production and movement of fireworks for four weeks due to high temperatures in the country, which could have caused explosions. The ban was lifted at the end of August in the area of Liuyang, which is where most of the UK fireworks are manufactured. This had a knock on effect to the UK market this year - either orders weren't completed or they missed their chance on the container ships. Wayne Richardson (pictured), of Preston, Lancashire, who is stocking the UK's most expensive firework cake 'Make My Day' Going off with a bang: The UK's most expensive firework 'Make My Day' exploding . Mr Richardson, 43, said: 'It takes approximately six weeks for the fireworks to be shipped from China to the UK. The knock on effect here in the UK was very worrying for the firework companies and retailers, not knowing if the products were going to come in on time - this left the seasonal sellers and pop-up shops scrambling for whatever stock they could get their hands on, if any at all. 'So, this year the general public will see less of the pop-up shops.' Mr Richardson, a self-confessed 'pyro-anorak', is looking forward to seeing the Make My Day firework light up the skies across the country this week. He said: 'The biggest smile on my face is when I look around the skies of Preston on November 5, and see the fireworks I have sold and my children shout out the name of the firework. It's wonderful! 'My passion for fireworks started at an early age and every year I couldn't wait for my local shop to start selling fireworks in the run up to bonfire night. 'I would gaze at the wonderful coloured boxes wondering what these little boxes of gems would unleash. Thinking of those times brings back the smell of sulphur in the air! 'Over the years, I became increasingly disappointed with the standard of fireworks I bought from the supermarkets and local pop-up shops, so I decided to do something about it and start my own business. 'Fireworks are safe if used correctly and if the general public just follow the fireworks code and read the instructions on the fireworks using the safe distances labelled on the firework.'","Pictures taken from the top of The Shard show how celebrations spread across the capital .

Five birds tested were found to have Mobistix - a painkiller used to combat fever and inflammation - in their blood.

Even more shockingly, a sixth bird showed traces of cocaine, according to the tests carried out by a South African drugs laboratory. Despite the findings of the tests, the Pigeon Fanciers' Association will not be able to take any disciplinary action against the owners of the birds because the samples were submitted anonymously. According to the Independent, the 20 samples tested in total had already been checked in Belgium, but no traces of drugs were found. The Association's chairman Stefaan Van Bockstaele and chairman of sport Dirk Schreel were said to be shocked at the findings which will likely lead to new doping rules been introduced to the sport ahead of the 2014 racing season.

Pigeon racing is big business in Belgium where specially bred birds are released from a specific location and race back to their loft. The sport - which often sees pigeons race over 600 miles - sees around 60 per cent of competitors in any given race not make it home. They fall victim to exhaustion, get lost or are killed by predators or power cables. It is so lucrative that a Belgian pigeon called Bolt was bought by a Chinese businessman for a staggering £260,000 earlier this year. It is thought that the buyer wanted to use Bolt - named after Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt - to breed more racing pigeons.","Tests found that five pigeons had been given painkiller Mobistix .

The German magazine Der Spiegel published an open letter it says was written by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden titled, A Manifesto for the Truth, in which Snowden said calls for surveillance program reforms justify his alleged decision to leak classified information. 'Citizens have to fight against the suppression of information about affairs of essential importance for the public,' Snowden wrote according to a translation by Reuters. 'Those who speak the truth are not committing a crime.' 'Instead of causing damage, the usefulness of the new public knowledge for society is now clear because reforms to politics, supervision and laws are being suggested,' he wrote.

Sometimes the agencies try to avoid controls,' he wrote.

'He . should return to the U.S. and face justice,' Pfeiffer said, adding when . pressed that no offers for clemency were being discussed. Snowden. 30, fled to Russia in June, hearing arrest and extradition to the US where he faces espionage charges. He has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified NSA documents, which revealed the existence of top-secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the United States and monitor the cell phone and Internet activity of overseas residents. He is wanted in the United States on espionage charges. A recent report by Der Spiegel, citing documents provided by Snowden, alleged the NSA monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. Some reports also suggest the United States carried out surveillance on French and Spanish citizens. The allegations have prompted some European countries to call for investigations. It also has prompted congressional hearings in the United States, where some are calling for more transparency and more oversight of American spy programs. The letter also accused governments of trying to squash debate about mass surveillance 'with a never before seen witch hunt' that threatens journalists and criminalizes the publication of details about the programs. In the letter, translated by CNN, Snowden purportedly writes that his actions were bringing about change. 'The debate they wanted to avoid is now taking place in countries around the world,' the letter said.'And instead of causing damage, the use of this new public knowledge is causing society to push for political reforms, oversight and new laws.' President Vladimir Putin has rejected American pleas to send Snowden home to face charges including espionage, and the temporary asylum he was granted in early August can be extended annually.

Broadband cables and the trenches dug to carry them may have contributed to the number of trees that fell in the St Jude’s storm, experts said yesterday. There was speculation that the proliferation of underground communication cables for the internet, phones and TV weakened trees that may have appeared stable above the ground. Trees brought down by the fierce winds caused four deaths in southern England yesterday, compared with five or six deaths caused by such incidents in an average year. Experts said cable digging has been affecting trees and their root system. Scroll down for video . Massive impact: Council staff get to work with a chainsaw to remove a tree that impaled a luxury Jaguar car in Clapham, south London . Smashed in: A towering tree crushes the roof of a Mini in Camden, north London, leaving a huge clear-up job following St Jude's storm . ‘When you cut through the roots, it takes a long time for them to grow and get stable again,’ said Dr Trevor Dines of the Plantlife charity. Concerns grew about the effect of cabling on tree safety as town hall officials were braced for questions about whether they could have done more to prevent the deaths, damage and disruption caused by the trees that fell across the South. Councils were warned by the Forestry Commission earlier this year that ‘tree-care professionals are increasingly aware of the risks of damage to tree roots from a range of maintenance and construction activities in the urban environment’. It added: ‘As well as damage from  chemicals such as de-icing road salt and herbicides, roots are killed by physical damage during cable- and pipe-laying  and road alterations, and from soil  compaction or regrading during building construction. Damage: A parked Vauxhall is crushed along its entire length in Colchester, Essex, after a tree was blown over in stormy weather that hit Britain yesterday . Looking on: The wind snapped this tree in Hove, East Sussex, like a twig. Luckily, it did not fall on nearby houses, but rather on a Vauxhall car . ‘In city streets, tree roots are expected to survive in the narrow space between buildings and roads, under solid pavements, and they must grow through a substrate that is often more rubble than soil.’ 'When you cut through the roots, it takes a long time for them to grow and get stable again' Dr Trevor Dines, Plantlife . Dr Dines said digging up roads to lay broadband cables can destabilise trees. ‘There are regulations in place to try to curb and stop that but often it has to happen,’ he said. Local councils are responsible for the safety of trees on most public ground. Officials are expected to foresee reasonable risks and pay special attention to ‘zone one’ trees, which are passed by large numbers of people every day. These should be regularly examined by ‘a person with a working knowledge of trees’ to check for signs of whether they are unstable. The inspectors, however, are not required to be professionals qualified in tree safety. Local interest: Children on their half-term break from school look at a giant tree that was blown over onto the park side of a residential street in Southampton . Going nowhere: A Mazda crushed in a tangle of branches and autumn leaves in Loughton, Essex, as the storm caused havoc across Britain yesterday . Pauline Buchanan Black of the Tree Council said local authorities are ‘very diligent’ about looking after trees that are a danger. 'Whatever happens, we are not going to be able to be properly prepared. You can’t batten down the hatches on the landscape' Pauline Buchanan Black, Tree Council . ‘People need to remember that when trees are blown down and fall across train lines, these trees are often not on railway land to begin with, they are on land neighbouring the railway,’ she said. ‘Whatever happens, we are not going to be able to be properly prepared. You can’t batten down the hatches on the landscape.’ Simon Richmond of the Arboricultural Association there is ‘no direct correlation’ between councils cutting back on tree maintenance budgets and trees falling in yesterday’s storm. ‘Budgets have been cut for this and so many other services and that has reduced the amount of maintenance work that is carried out. But trees are very long lived and changes take a long time to have results.’ Covered: A woman takes a look at this silver car in Bognor Regis, West Sussex, which was buried underneath a tree that fell during the high winds . Smashed in: A boy looks at a car that has been crushed under a fallen tree following the storm that affected parts of Britain, in Hornsey, north London . He added that there is no evidence that trees are less stable than they used to be. Urban development may make it more difficult for trees to put down extensive root systems, he said, but they can adapt to grow in extremely difficult conditions. 'Councils were well prepared for the worst storms in 25 years and have pulled out all the stops in the aftermath to clear the road network' Local Government Association spokesman . Trees growing in an area with a strong prevailing wind tend to have their roots concentrated on one side and so are particularly likely to fall if their roots are disturbed. A spokesman for the Local Government Association which represents councils said: ‘Councils were well prepared for the worst storms in 25 years and have pulled out all the stops in the aftermath to clear the road network, get vulnerable residents the help they need and ensure life returns to normal as swiftly as possible.’ It is thought that thousands of trees were brought down by the St Jude’s storm, but it does not match the level of destruction in the Great Storm of 1987. Then, 15million trees are thought to have fallen, causing 18 deaths.","Trees brought down caused four deaths, compared with five or six caused by such incidents in an average year .

American traders braced for an economic backlash after the federal government shut down at midnight on Monday evening and the price of oil took the first major hit. Benchmark oil for November delivery dropped 35 cents to $101.99 per barrel at midday Bangkok time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell 54 cents to close at $102.33 on Monday after trading as low as $101.05. The looming threat of a shutdown- the first of it's kind in 17 years- sank stocks in anticipation on Monday as Wall Street worried that a budget fight in Washington could lead to an event far worse for the economy— a failure to raise the nation's borrowing limit. The two financial debates- first the failure to pass a budget and the still-looming threat over the possible refusal to raise the debt ceiling which is scheduled to occur on October 17- are adding pressure to one another and causing economic unease globally. Closed for business: The government shutdown means that nearly a million government workers will be sent home without pay and the nation's struggling economy will take a hit . Early global implications seemed . positive as international markets held steady, though the real test will . come when American markets open on Tuesday morning. 'When you're in a time of lower funding and money, you tend to cut things like travel,' said Evan Lucas, market analyst at IG in Melbourne, Australia. After climbing to over $110 in late August, the price of oil has fallen as diplomacy aimed at Syria and Iran eased concerns about Middle East supplies. 'Considering there was a big run-up in oil prices two weeks ago, it's just a bit of a correction,' Lucas said. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 129 points, or 0.8 per cent, to close at 15,129.67. The Standard & Poor's 500 slid 10 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 1,681.55 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10 points, or 0.3 per cent, to 3,771.48. Scroll down for video .

There is a simple reason why the . budget battle — and, more importantly, an upcoming fight over the debt . ceiling — are so crucial: the credit of the United States is the bedrock . that nearly every other investment is built upon, largely due to the . assumption that the nation will always pay its debts. 'The . concern is government has become so polarized that if it cannot pass (a . budget), there's a greater chance that the debt ceiling battle will go . to the brink or possibly lead to a default,' said Alec Young, global . equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ. Monday's decline adds to what has been eventful September for investors. Stocks hit an all-time on Sept. 18 after the Federal Reserve voted to keep up its economic stimulus program. But that enthusiasm vanished as Wall Street began to worry that the political bickering between Democrats and Republicans would lead to a government shutdown and crisis over the debt ceiling. Obamacare in trouble? The bill includes a delay of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law despite veto threats from the White House . A partial government shutdown is all but certain. Congress and the White House were no closer to a budget deal Monday afternoon. If no deal is reached by midnight Tuesday, the federal government will partially shut down for the first time in 17 years. A . brief shutdown wouldn't hit the economy and stock market that hard. But . a shutdown lasting two weeks could slice 0.3 percent points off U.S. gross domestic product, according to a report by Macroeconomic Advisers. That is because hundreds of thousands of federal workers will go . without a paycheck. 'You're putting a lot of people, at least . temporarily, out of work and out of pay, and that will affect spending,' said Kathy Jones, vice president of fixed income strategy at Charles . Schwab. 'It slows down activity on companies that depend on federal . contracts.' Some investors think a shutdown may be a positive . event in the long-term. The political pressure from a shutdown could . force politicians to get down to business and negotiate — particularly . on the issue of the debt ceiling. 'This may be good thing in the . long run because it may lead to compromise,' said J.J. Kinahan, chief . strategist at TD Ameritrade. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said . last week that the government would run out of borrowing authority by . roughly Oct. 17. The last time the debt ceiling issue came up in August . 2011, it led to Standard & Poor's downgrading the United States' credit rating and the Dow went through nearly three weeks of nauseating . triple-digits moves almost daily. Markets worldwide are reacting to the likely shutdown of the United States' federal government . 'This sort of political . brinkmanship is the dominant reason (the United States' credit) rating . is no longer 'AAA,'' Standard & Poor's analysts Marie Cavanaugh and . John Chambers wrote in a note to investors Monday. If domestic . and foreign investors begin to question whether the U.S. will pay its . debts, it could throw every other investment out of alignment. 'It's . a threat to the center of the global financial system,' said Jake . Lowery, portfolio manager at ING U.S. Investment Management. Missing targets: The U.S. Federal Reserve (pictured) recently held off on slowing its stimulus program, saying economic growth was not meeting its targets . Correction: Political infighting in 2011 prompted the loss of the United States' triple-A credit rating and was the primary driver of the stock market's last full-on correction . Analysts had viewed a shutdown as unlikely, with many citing other government stalemates that were resolved in the past few years. However, political infighting in 2011 prompted the loss of the United States' triple-A credit rating and was the primary driver of the stock market's last full-on correction. Essentially all market sectors could . see a reaction to a shutdown, with industries tied to the pace of . economic growth- like energy and financials- seeing outsized impacts. The . defensive sector 'will feel an immediate impact since its biggest . customer is the U.S. government,' said Sarhan. 'We're talking billions . of dollars in income. If that goes away, what could replace that?' Even utilities, which are considered a defensive group, may see steep moves if a shutdown impacts interest rates. Default fears: Even if a last-minute deal is reached, investors face a second Washington cliffhanger as Congress must agree to increase the $16.7 trillion limit on federal borrowing by October 17. If Capitol Hill fails to act in time, the unthinkable could happen and the United States could default on its debts . Among other asset classes, the uncertainty could been a boon for U.S. Treasuries as investors seek shelter. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose 10/32 on Friday, with yields easing to 2.62 percent.

Police interrupted a sham wedding in North London between a Nigerian man and a Portuguese woman . Portuguese woman, 22, led away from ceremony after questioning. She is on bail until November 7 . Broadcast on Sky News this morning, immigration officers said the woman may have married for cash on three separate occasions. Police interrupted the marriage in front of guests and took the bride and groom for questioning separately. It emerged that they knew little about each other and that the man was working in the UK illegally.

Questioning by police revealed the couple knew little about each other and that the man was in the illegally . The photographs and footage come after it emerged yesterday that one in five civil marriages in parts of Britain may be bogus. Some 15,000 such ceremonies a year are taking place simply to get around immigration law, estimates one of the country’s most senior registrars, Mark Rimmer. Last year the Home Office received nearly 1,900 warnings about potentially bogus unions. But Mr Rimmer, the chairman of the Local Registration Services Association, said that figure represented ‘the tip of a very large iceberg’. He said that in urban areas, up to 20 per cent of marriages are ‘suspicious’. He estimated that overall, 15,000 of the 173,000 civil weddings each year in England and Wales could be fake unions designed to evade immigration laws. Registrars were powerless to prevent couples they suspected of faking their relationships from marrying and were forced to conduct the ceremonies ‘through gritted teeth’, he said. Mark Rimmer, chairman of the Local Registration Services Association, said official figures are the 'tip of a very large iceberg' Mr Rimmer said the problem was worse than at its high point in 2004 because laws drawn up since then to deal with the problem had been watered down by a series of human rights judgments to the point where they were ‘meaningless’. Last week ministers announced a major crackdown on sham weddings, with laws designed to ensure every potential sham wedding is reported and investigated before it happens. It also gives officials more power to delay the ceremony taking place by up to 70 days. Official figures show that the number of reported cases has tripled in the last three years. In 2009 some 561 reports were lodged with officials, a figure which nearly doubled in a year to 934 in 2010. By 2011 it stood at 1,741 and last year 1,891. Home Office officials admit that the figure is likely to severely underestimate the scale of the problem. They put the likely number of sham weddings at between four and ten thousand a year. But Mr Rimmer says the problem is even worse than that. He claims only the most blatant cases are flagged up and ‘borderline’ weddings which are slightly suspicious go unreported. ‘We . have seen huge increases in potential sham marriages presenting . themselves to us, we now have more reports from registrars going to the . Home Office, but I think that is the tip of a very large iceberg, and . effectively the real scale of the problem is far greater than that . reported to the Home Office officially,’ he told a Sky News . investigation. ‘Most registration officers are not immigration officers, they came into this business to facilitate marriage. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said extending the notice period for marriages there will be more time to investigate and prosecute those involved in sham marriages . PUGH page 8.jpg . ‘So therefore they don’t want to be cynical, unfortunately therefore what happens is, the ones that are absolutely blatant get reported and there are some that are borderline that slip through without being reported – and that is the iceberg under the water and that’s huge – it is absolutely huge. ‘In an area like anywhere in  London it is multiple times per week. It would not be unreasonable to say that 20 per cent of all our marriages are suspicious, have some elements of suspicion about them. Very often the ceremony is done through  gritted teeth.’ Sham weddings became a major problem in the early 2000s and Labour passed a law in 2004 requiring couples including one foreign national to get an approval certificate from the Home Office before they could wed. But this was watered down by a series of legal judgments on challenges under Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. As a result, Mr Rimmer said, the law became ‘meaningless’. Ministers say new measures announced will provide registrars better powers to deal with sham weddings. When the Immigration Bill becomes law, every proposed marriage in which a non-EU national will gain rights to be in Britain will be reported to the Home Office. Salome Almeida, 22, has been jailed for 12 months for plotting a sham wedding . A Pakistani student and a Portuguese woman were sent to prison for 12 months after they were found guilty of plotting a sham wedding so he could remain in the UK. Salome Almeida, 22, admitted to police that she had agreed to marry Wahab Khalid, 23, for £1,340. Almeida arrived in the UK a few weeks before the wedding was  due to take place and visited a register office with Khalid to give notice to marry. Despite only being in the UK for 24 hours, she opened a bank account and received a national insurance number. The pair were arrested in April this year at a register office in Harrow, north London, and confessed to conspiracy to facilitate a breach of immigration rules. The notice period for marriages and civil partnerships will be increased from 15 days to 28 days for all couples, and officials will be able to increase that to 70 days in suspicious cases. Foreign nationals from outside the EU wanting to get married in a church will first have to go to the register office and get approval – ensuring the authorities are made aware of the planned wedding. Immigration Minister Mark Harper said: ‘Sham marriages have for too long been an easy target for migrants seeking to circumvent our immigration rules, often assisted by organised criminals. ‘By extending the marriage and civil partnership notice period to 28 days and allowing this to be increased to 70 days in some circumstances, we will make time to investigate, prosecute and remove those involved in sham marriages.’","Police interrupt sham wedding in Harrow, North London .

Defendants and witnesses in British courts will no longer swear on the Bible to tell the truth under controversial plans being considered by a powerful body of judges. The traditional religious oath could be scrapped amid concerns that many giving evidence in criminal cases no longer take it seriously. Instead, all witnesses and defendants would promise to tell the truth without mentioning God, and would acknowledge they could be jailed if they are caught lying. Judges are considering plans which would mean defendants and witnesses would no longer swear on the Bible to tell the truth in court . It is claimed the new oath would be fairer for everyone and make it easier to understand the importance of what they are saying. But critics point out non-believers already have the option of promising to tell the truth without any reference to a sacred text, and that the change would further erode Britain’s Christian heritage. The historic change will be debated this month by the Magistrates’ Association, and if it is voted through the organisation’s influential policy committee will draw up plans to be sent to the Ministry of Justice. Ian Abrahams, a Bristol magistrate, has proposed ending centuries of tradition by axeing the religious oath. He told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘More and more I see people shrug their shoulders or say “whatever” when asked to take it. ‘Other witnesses think it’s wrong to swear on a holy book, and make an affirmation instead. ‘I’m suggesting we take holy books out of the process. Instead, people will have to show they understand they could be sent to prison if they don’t tell the truth.’ Critics point out non-believers already have the option of promising to tell the truth without any reference to a sacred text and that the change would further erode Britain's Christian heritage . The married 62-year-old was raised in the Jewish faith but now calls himself an atheist. ‘I don’t intend my motion to make any comment on religion,’ he said. ‘It is certainly not anti-religious.’ But it has been seen by senior figures in the Church of England as another attempt to chip away at the country’s Christian foundations. The Rt Rev Michael Nazir-Ali, former Bishop of Rochester, said: ‘This could be the slippery slope towards the increasing secularisation of society. Where will it end – with the Coronation Oath? The Bible is bound up with the constitution, institutions and history of this country. It is right for people to have a choice of oath, a religious or non-religious one. But we are being urged, in the name of tolerance and secularisation, to restrict that choice.’ ‘I’m suggesting we take holy books out . of the process. Instead, people will have to show they understand they . could be sent to prison if they don’t tell the truth' - Ian Abrahams, a Bristol magistrate . The Rev Arun Arora, director of communications for the Church of England, added: ‘Given that the last census showed almost 60 per cent of respondents self-identified as Christians and two thirds as people of faith, this proposal seems to ignore the statistical reality that we remain a faithful nation. This kind of proposal seems driven more by blinkered campaigning agendas than abiding interests in justice and truth.’ John Glen, Tory MP for Salisbury and a magistrate until last year, said: ‘This smacks of political correctness gone mad.’ Legal expert Lord Carlile QC said: ‘It would be unacceptable for the choice to take a religious oath to be removed.’ Existing religious oaths have, for hundreds of years, required Christian witnesses to hold the Bible and state: ‘I swear by almighty God that I shall tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.’ Followers of other faiths are given copies of their sacred texts with Muslims swearing on the Koran and Jews on the Old Testament, for instance. Those who choose instead to make an affirmation are required to ‘solemnly, sincerely and truly declare and affirm’ the truth of their evidence. Under Mr Abrahams’ proposal,  the holy books would be removed and the oath would read: ‘I promise very sincerely to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth and I understand that if I fail to do so I will be committing an offence for which I will be punished and may be sent to prison.’ The plan will be debated at the agm of the Magistrates’ Association, representing 23,000 lay judges, in Cardiff on October 19. A MoJ spokesman said: ‘We have no plans to change the arrangements for swearing an oath or making an affirmation in court, which have worked well for many years and still do.’","Religious oath could be scraped amid concerns it is not taken seriously .

The new, smaller version of NASA's shuttle needs some more work before it's ready for space . A helicopter dropped the unmanned craft from 12,500 feet in a first free flight reminiscent of NASA's drop tests of the shuttle prototype Enterprise in the 1970s. Everything worked well for the automated Dream Chaser model until the end, when the left landing gear deployed too late and the test vehicle skidded off the runway. Company space systems chief Mark Sirangelo said Tuesday that damage was minor. The left gear was still attached and the tire wasn't even shredded, he said. The crew cabin area was unscathed and astronauts would have been uninjured, he said. Dream for the future: Everything worked well for the automated Dream Chaser model (seen in an earlier photo) until the end, when the left landing gear deployed too late and the test vehicle skidded off the runway .

Ninety years ago this month, British archaeologist Howard Carter discovered the tomb of Tutankhamun and set in motion a chain of events that brought scandal, infighting and rumours of a famous curse all the way from Egypt back to England and Highclere Castle – known to television audiences as Downton Abbey. As he peered into a hole in a door of the boy king’s tomb, his financial backer, the 5th Earl of Carnarvon and owner of Highclere, asked: ‘Can you see anything?’ ‘I see wonderful things,’ came the famous reply. Within, they found treasures beyond their wildest imagining:  thousands of statues, vases, paintings and the ornate sarcophagus in which the king’s mummified body lay, all glittering with gold and  precious jewels. Somehow they had survived for 33 centuries, safe from robbers who had plundered all  the other tombs in the Valley of the Kings. It was the greatest archaeological find of all time. Taking treasures: British archaeologist Howard Carter, left,and Lord Carnarvon, master of Highclere Castle in the chamber inside King Tutankhamen's tomb . As a British adventurer, Carter should be up there with David Livingstone and Captain Cook. Instead, his reputation is marred by accusations that he turned grave robber, pinching dozens of items for himself and Carnarvon, and that no one actually knows what the tomb looked like when he found it because his reports on the excavation are a pack of lies. According to Carter’s story, he found the tomb’s entrance on November 4, 1922 and cabled Carnarvon  to sail from London. Carter waited until his backer arrived before they went down the steps on November 26. He poked a hole in the door, held a candle to test for noxious fumes and peered in to  see piles of lavish ornaments, shimmering with gold. Carter’s notes record that they then resealed the hole so they could fulfil their legal duty of telling Egypt’s Director-General of Antiquities. But did they really? Carter and Carnarvon knew the find would put them in the history books and I don’t believe for a second that they didn’t explore the tomb that night. There’s plenty of evidence that far from resealing the hole, Carter enlarged it to let himself, Carnarvon and Carnarvon’s daughter Evelyn climb in. The Earl’s  half-brother Mervyn Herbert wrote in his journal that they confessed ‘under the strictest promise of secrecy’ that they went through to the inner chamber. It seems they also removed small souvenirs that night, such as figurines or jewellery – anything bigger would have been noticed by workmen outside. Their pockets must have been stuffed as they returned to the Winter Palace Hotel in Luxor. But one evening’s pilfering doesn’t explain the sheer number of Tutankhamun artefacts in museums and collections round the world. Evidence has emerged that points to a quite different story. Some experts think Carter found the tomb several months before he told Carnarvon, giving ample time to explore it and sneak out dozens of items. TV set: Highclere Castle in Berkshire made famous as ITV's Downton Abbey . What would Lord Grantham say: The Egyptian treasures currently at display at Highclere - or The Crawley family's Downton to the rest of us - are stolen, according to Egyptian authorities . Carter, a knowledgable dealer in antiquities, had helped Carnarvon amass a significant collection of Egyptian tomb artefacts. They worked together on several digs before gaining a concession in the Valley of the Kings in 1914. During work in 1922, his men reached a spot inches from where the  tomb’s entrance would be found when Carter told them to move some  distance away. Had he found the entrance? If so, he had good reason to keep it under his hat. Carter claimed there were clear signs that robbers broke seals on the tomb shortly after Tutankhamun was laid to rest in 1323BC, stealing perfume bottles and disturbing the careful array. This would have been very helpful, because under the terms of his licence to dig, his team was entitled to keep half of any treasure if  he could prove the tomb had been broken into before their arrival. But if robbers had found their way in, why did they leave behind so many priceless golden objects? Alfred Lucas, an employee at the 1922 dig, admitted in 1947 that he saw Carter break open a door and relock it, with an antique seal, but no one paid much attention at the time. As part of his evidence of previous break-ins, Carter showed a photo of a footprint he claimed was made by a robber, but modern experts say it doesn’t resemble an ancient Egyptian sandal. In fact, it appears to be the sole of a modern shoe – much like the type Carter himself wore. Carnarvon was optimistic the Egyptian authorities would agree he was entitled to half the treasure – but in April 1923, he died of septicaemia from an infected mosquito bite. He had owned the concession, and arguments sprang up. The Director-General of Antiquities wanted to retain it all for Egypt. One thing was for sure: Carter wasn’t entitled to anything. Portrait: A wooden effigy of the young Tutankhamun . There was talk back in 1923 that items had been illegally removed.  Carter was nearly caught in the act when Egyptian inspectors found a painted bust packed into a Fortnum & Mason box, as if waiting to be sneaked away. Somehow he managed to talk his way out of trouble. Carter began quietly distributing gifts from the tomb, with US oil baron Edward Harkness receiving a gold ring. He gave an amulet to a fellow Egyptologist, Sir Alan Gardiner. Then, when Carter died in 1939, dozens of valuable and important items from the tomb were found in his house, including a shabti [figurine] and a glass head-rest with a gold band. His looting was now an open secret. Lord Carnarvon’s wife Almina became convinced that he had died as a result of the ‘Curse of Tutankhamun’, especially after several others associated with the dig died in the years immediately after the tomb was disturbed. She begged Carter to remove the collection of Egyptian artefacts from Highclere and he sold most to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Remaining treasures were packed away in cupboards at Highclere  and forgotten. In 2010, the Met agreed to return to Egypt 19 antiquities, including a lapis-lazuli sphinx and a bronze figure of a dog with a golden collar. The Met is not alone. Egyptologist Christian Loeben visited the Louvre in 2010 and found a shabti with Tutankhamun’s throne name written on it, which he claims could only be from the tomb. Two golden hawks’ heads were found in Kansas City, part of  a collar that broke as it was removed from the mummy’s neck. The story goes they were a gift from Carter to his dentist. He seems to have been very generous with his plunder. And what of Highclere? In 1987, the 7th Earl of Carnarvon unlocked a door that had been closed for many years and found pigeonholes full of packages which turned out to contain finds from the 5th Earl’s excavations. He dusted them down and put them on display. Recently, as Downton Abbey’s success has drawn attention to the house, authorities in Egypt have said all the Tutankhamun antiquities were stolen and asked for the return of any original items at Highclere. The Earl argues that he does not have any, only replicas, and that the other antiquities were obtained fairly. It’s never been definitively established where the 5th Earl’s  Tutankhamun souvenirs ended up. The fact remains that Carter made a phenomenal discovery in the Valley of the Kings in 1922. The ancient solemnity of the tomb gets under your skin. It inspired me to write about the discovery of the tomb in a new novel set in the Twenties. So perhaps, on the 90th anniversary, we should proclaim it as a great British success story. Carter was certainly a giant of British Egyptology. As it turns out, however, he was an untruthful giant with rather sticky fingers. Gill Paul’s novel Women  And Children First is out now  (Avon Books, £7.99).

US Airways denies crew members used racial slurs against actor Brandon T. Jackson, who was kicked off a flight at a Phoenix layover because of unruly behavior. Mr Jackson, best known for his role as Alpa Chino in 'Tropic Thunder,' had been drinking on the New York City to Phoenix flight Monday night and became upset when flight attendants stopped serving him alcohol. He sent out 21 tweets about the experience and claimed a flight attendant 'called me the N-word.' That's racist: Movie star Brandon T. Jackson has accused a US Airways flight attendant of calling him the n-word . Phoenix police were called and the actor, who also plays Grover in the 'Percy Jackson' movies, was escorted out of the terminal at Sky Harbor International Airport. Officers said they determined that no crime had been committed so they let Mr Jackson go. The 29-year-old actor then took another flight to Burbank, California. 'We've spoken with the crew members involved and they deny any use of the N-word or racist slurs with Mr Jackson,' said US Airways spokesman Andrew Christie. Mr Christie added that the actor 'was disruptive and our crew made the right decision to stop serving him alcohol.' He said the behavior started with Mr Jackson playing loud music in his seat. He was asked several times to turn down the music. 'Additional erratic behavior was observed and that is when the crew made the decision to stop serving,' Mr Christie said. 'If the crew determines to no longer serve alcohol to a customer, then their decision is definitive at that point.' Tropic Thunder: Mr Jackson, pictured left with Ben Stiller, center, and Robert Downey Jr., right, is best known for his role as Alpa Chino in 'Tropic Thunder' But the passenger sitting next to Mr Jackson, Darrell Howard, told TMZ on Thursday that the actor was not drunk and had no more than two drinks during the five-and-a-half hour flight from NYC to Phoenix. Mr Howard said Mr Jackson was nothing but nice and even shared a few scripts with him and another passenger, which supports the actor's claim that he told the angry flight attendant he was just 'rehearsing lines' with the people next to him. TMZ reported Tuesday morning that Mr Jackson and a flight attendant named Dee began arguing on the flight after the crew refused to continue serving him alcohol. Tiring of his act after telling him to sit down, the flight attendant reportedly said: 'I don't care if you're Obama's son -- get in your seat!!' Mr Jackson said the flight attendant then called him the n-word. He was soon released without charge and tweeted: 'This was the most racist thing that ever happen to me even the white people on the plane was like that racist.'","Brandon T.

But this silver coin, discovered in a field, could be worth up to £80,000 if proved to be a genuine Roman antique. Colin Popplewell, 58, and Mark Hildreth, 38, say the coin - which is the size and weight of a penny - is only the second one in history to be found featuring the short-lived Emperor Proculus. This is only the second Roman coin ever found featuring the Emperor Proculus. It is estimated to fetch £80,000 at auction, but could go for a lot more. Some experts think it is a 15C forgery . A metal detecting expert, Julian Evan-Hart, certainly believes the coin is genuine and that it was minted to mark the brief rise to power of Proculus in 280AD. Father-of-two Mr Popplewell, who made the find in a field near Stamford Bridge, East Yorkshire, on November 7, said: 'The first coin with Proculus was found in a collection in Germany in the 1980s. It sold in 1991 for £40,000. 'It was in a private collection that dated back a century so there was no way of validating whether the coin was authentic or a contemporary forgery, made in the Roman times. 'Our find is ground-breaking because it validates the first coin and gives weight to the history of Proculus - it really will change the history books.' But coin specialist and renowned academic Roger Bland, who is Keeper of the Prehistory and Europe Department of the British Museum, disagrees that the coin is genuine.' He said: 'I don't believe any coins of Proculus were ever made and this one is probably a 15th century forgery. 'The . only source for our knowledge of him is a controversial history book, . written at the end of the 4th century AD, much of which was made up. Colin Popplewell (Left) takes a closer look at the coin featuring Emperor Proculus. Mr Popplewell  and Mark Hildreth (Right) proudly display the metal detectors that helped them find a the rare Roman coin in Yorkshire . 'It says that there were 30 tyrants who all vied for control of the Roman Empire when things got a bit messy in the late 3rd century AD and lots of people were declared Emperor. 'Many of these 30 tyrants never had coins made, which is a sign of a true Emperor. 'But in the Renaissance, when coin collecting was fashionable, people thought these men should have had coins so they made them. 'This coin has been made from the same dye, or mould, as another in the Munich Museum, which is widely believed to be fake. Proculus was a Roman usurper who ‘took the purple’ against Emperor Probus in  280AD. An ambitious soldier, he proclaimed himself joint emperor with Bonosus after being asked by the people of Lugdunum (Lyon), who had started a rebellion against Emperor Probus. Proculus was married to a woman named Vituriga; at the time of his usurpation he had one son, Herennianus, aged four. On Probus’ return from fighting in Syria, he forced Proculus to retreat north. Proculus apparently had some connections to the Franks and he had hoped to rally them to his cause. They appear, however, to have betrayed him and promptly handed him over to Probus. Probus had him killed in 281 but spared his family.  Probus was killed by his own troops sometime between September or October 282. 'There is no context to this find either - only single coins, not hoards, have been found so their provenance is difficult to assess. 'Unless someone finds a hoard of these coins, I'm going to remain very sceptical that there were ever any coins made for Proculus.' Mr Popplewell, a body shop manager, said that when the duo found the coin they didn't recognise the emperor's features. He and Mr Hildreth photographed the coin out in the field and put the image on a Facebook site used by metal detector specialists. 'We started getting messages back from people telling us that we really should take it to be valued properly. All these figures started coming at us and they're constantly changing, even now.' Mr Hildreth, a self-employed joiner, added that they would give a proportion of the proceeds to the farmer who owns the field and gave them permission to go detecting. The lucky duo, of York, will then share the remainder between them 50/50, as they had always agreed. He explained that a single coin was not considered treasure trove and therefore did not need to go to an inquest, but it had been recorded by the finds liaison officer at the Yorkshire Museum. Mr Evan-Hart said the find 'made an astounding contribution to world numismatics by this find of a single debased silver coin'. Christopher Webb, of specialist auctioneers and valuers of coins, Dix Noonan Webb, said it was an 'extremely rare and valuable coin, possibly the second known'. He said that at auction, it could fetch up to £50,000, but this estimate was later raised to between £60,000 and £80,000. Mr Popplewell added: 'I probably will be a bit sad to say goodbye to the coin but to be honest it's become a bit of a burden - I'm looking forward to someone taking it off my hands. 'This has definitely whet my appetite for metal detecting - in fact Mark and I were back out with our detectors just after we found the coin.'","After 30 years of metal detecting, pair get lucky by finding Roman coin .

The 24-year-old has Neonatal Progeroid Syndrome which causes premature ageing, a wrinkled appearance, and decreased fat under the skin. Her condition also means she cannot put on any weight, and despite eating every 20 minutes or so, and consuming thousands of calories a day, she never tips the scales above 4.3 stone. But now, scientists who have been studying Miss Valasquez for more than ten years believe they are closing in on the gene that causes her condition, which may one day lead to treatments and a cure. They believe Miss Valasquez, who is the oldest person living with NPS, is offering hope to other sufferers and helping doctors understand how people can survive well into adulthood. Miss Valasquez, from Austin, Texas, explained: 'I took a year out after university and now I'm ready to start travelling to give talks in different States. 'I receive so many requests but I have to be careful so my schedule does not become too busy.' Miss Valasquez carefully manages her condition by eating healthy meals regularly, taking rests every few hours, and ensuring she has enough sleep.

An NHS trust has admitted responsibility for the death of a young mother who killed herself in a hospital room while suffering from severe post-natal depression. Diana Mager 'would be alive today if she had received proper care', her widower Adam said after the climbdown by Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust. Officials initially insisted that Mrs Mager's death 'could not have been predicted or prevented' despite the fact that she had already made a number of suicide attempts. Tragic: Diana Mager killed herself in a hospital room in August last year while suffering post-natal depression . However, following a legal challenge from the bereaved family, the trust backtracked and admitted that in fact the tragedy could have been avoided. Mrs Mager, 33, committed suicide in August last year while being treated at Green Parks House psychiatric unit in Orpington, Kent. She had been suffering severe post-natal depression since giving birth to her daughter Sofia in November 2011, and was self-harming. Mrs Mager had previously been allowed out of the unit for short periods, during which time she went to the Tate Modern and tried to jump from roof. On another occasion, she smuggled a knife into her room, leading Mr Mager to argue that she should be put under continuous observation. However, at the time of her death she was being checked by nurses only every 15 minutes - despite a note on her medical records stating that she was 'at very high risk of killing herself'. Anger: Mrs Mager's widower Adam, left, says she would still be alive if she had received proper care . Oxleas Trust said earlier this year that there was nothing they could have done to prevent Mrs Mager's death. But when Mr Mager launched a legal challenge against the trust, they admitted that they could have stopped her killing herself. Mr Mager, 39, said the admission vindicated his campaign for justice for his wife. 'I always believed that Diana would be alive today if she had received the proper care she desperately needed,' he said. 'Instead, I have to explain to our daughter why her mother is no longer with us.' A spokesman for the trust said: 'At Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust we are very sorry and deeply saddened by Mrs Mager's death, and would once again like to offer our sincere condolences to her husband and family. 'We undertook an internal investigation following Mrs Mager's death, which identified some learning for us. We take the death of a patient very seriously and have since taken further expert advice. 'Following this, we will now review our internal inquiry to identify further learning and ensure that this is put in place. Patient care is our top priority and we want to be open with our patients and their families.' Mr Mager's lawyer Mark Bowman, a medical negligence specialist at London firm Field Fisher Waterhouse, said: 'I am pleased to see that liability has finally been admitted by the trust in this matter. 'I am however concerned that the admission comes after the trust had initially claimed, following a full and through investigation, that Diana's death could not have been predicted or prevented. 'There needs to be far greater transparency and honesty in mental health care in this country if the public are to have confidence in the system.'

"By . Dan Bloom . PUBLISHED: . 16:15 EST, 7 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:34 EST, 7 November 2013 . It may be the most expensive water bottle in history. A Chinese ceramic treasure whose design was modelled on ancient water flasks has sold today for £1.5 million - after staying hidden for a century in a Welsh mansion. The stunning Imperial dragon moonflask was one of fewer than five commissioned by the Qianlong Emperor, who reigned from 1736 to 1795. But the magnificent piece vanished about 100 years ago when, unknown to the wider world, it was bought in China by the wealthy shipping captain Charles Oswald Liddell. This Imperial dragon moonflask, made for the Qianlong Emperor, has sold at auction for £1.5m after lying hidden in a Welsh mansion. Experts said it was one of the finest examples of Chinese ceramics in existence . He installed the flask at his 13-bedroom stately home, the Grade II listed Shirenewton Hall near Chepstow, Monmouthshire, where it remained a family treasure for a century. Its whereabouts were only revealed when descendants of Capt Liddell, who was an avid collector of Oriental art and died in 1941, listed the flask for auction earlier this year. The flask's sale was announced at about the same time Capt Liddell's former home also went on the market, with a guide price of nearly £4 million. It is no longer listed for sale. Shirenewton Hall was heavily influenced by Capt Liddell's love of the Far East, with a Japanese garden and a pagoda roof which included a one-and-a-half-tonne bell. The 12-inch artwork depicts a traditional 14th Century design of a flaming red Imperial dragon encircling a burning pearl, a sign of power in Chinese folklore. It is among the most valuable of several pieces bought by Western collectors who seized upon the end of 2,000 years of Chinese Imperial power in the early 1900s. The flask mimics a traditional 14th Century design of a flaming dragon flying above a stormy sea . This name 'moonflask' - 'baoyueping' or 'bianhu' in Chinese - refers to the ceramic work's large, round shape. The flasks are also traditionally known as 'pilgrim's flasks' in the West, since they take their shape from a Middle Eastern prototype for water flasks which were carried by travellers. It was sold today for £1,482,500, more than double its estimate of £500,000 to £800,000, to a collector from Hong Kong at auction house Bonhams. Colin . Sheaf, head of the Chinese art department, said: 'The moonflask is . a superb example of porcelain created at the highest level of the . potter's art for a sophisticated and demanding Imperial Court in Beijing. 'The appearance of this flask, unknown to collectors for nearly a century, is a very exciting event in the world of Chinese art.' A distinguished connoisseur of ceramics in his own right, the Qianlong Emperor presided over one of the greatest collections of Chinese art. Items from his collection are now among the most sought-after Chinese antiques in the world. The flask was hidden at Shirenewton Hall near Chepstow, pictured, which also went on the market this year . Asaph Hyman, Bonhams' director of Chinese art, said: 'This moonflask is extremely rare because of its intricate decoration which features several enamels and underglazes. 'With this technique it is very hard to get good results during the firing process and often one of the colours is not as strong as the other. 'But with this flask the colours are perfect and it is a piece fit for an emperor. 'Without doubt this flask would have been on display in one of the Imperial palaces. 'We know that Captain Liddell bought other vases from Li Hung Chang, a diplomat from the late Qing dynasty, so it is clear he was able to buy fine Imperial treasures. 'This moonflask is certainly one of the rarest vases of its type to come on the market.' Emperor Qianlong loved all Chinese art . Emperor Qianlong was the sixth Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. He reigned from October 1735 until February 1796 making him one of the country's longest serving emperors. Qianlong, whose name means 'lasting eminence', was also considered one of the most enlightened of the emperors. He was an enthusiastic patron of all forms of Chinese art and published catalogues of Royal collections which he expanded greatly. The Emperor wrote thousands of poems in beautiful calligraphy, was a talented painter and commissioned many magnificent temples and palaces. During his reign, Qianlong was determined to expand his empire and Tibet became a protectorate, Ili and Turkestan were conquered and Burma and the Nepalese Gurkas acknowledged Chinese suzerainty. In the last decade of his reign, delegating decisions to others led to an increase in corruption and inefficiency in government. He officially abdicated in favour of his son in 1796 so as not to rule longer than his grandfather, but ultimately reigned until his death two years later.

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 13:17 EST, 30 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:29 EST, 30 September 2013 . As Monday turns to Tuesday the U.S. government will lose its authority to spend money on non-essential services, unless House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the Democrat occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue strike a budget deal that hinges on the future of President Obama's controversial health insurance overhaul. House GOP leaders offered and passed . last week a budget resolution that would fund the government, but . without providing money for Obamacare. But now Republicans are working . on a compromise measure that would delay the health care law's . implementation for a year instead.A competing plan would chip away at Obamacare more modestly by eliminating a widely reviled new 2.3 per cent tax on medical devices. 'None of this is acceptable,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday. 'This is blatant extortion.' A federal government shutdown, something Washington hasn't seen since 1995, would paradoxically not cancel Tuesday's planned rollout of health care exchanges that President Obama claims will permit millions of Americans to lower their health insurance costs. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Obama said after Monday's meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he was hoping to avert a government shutdown but had no intention of bending on his position . Speaker of the House John Boehner parried a Senate-passed temporary budget bill that wouldn't defund the Obamacare law, and is now angling for a one-year pause in the law's implementation instead as a halfway measure . But the White House insists that the president will not sit down to discus any deal that rolls back parts of his Obamacare system. The U.S. Senate has declined to vote on the GOP's original proposal, and shows no sign that it will embrace the GOP's halfway measure. The House worked past midnight Saturday to pass its legislation, but the Senate sat shuttered all weekend. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid kept his chamber's Monday morning schedule empty too, choosing to call senators back only at 2:00 p.m. to send the House a 'clean' budget that doesn't change Obamacare at all. By that time, Republicans complained in a Sunday press conference, Democrats would have successfully 'run out the clock' on the budget stalemate, forcing the hot potato back into the GOP's hands as midnight approaches. California Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer pivoted to feminist issues on Monday, complaining that any rollback of Obamacare would be an attack on women's health . The Senate moved quickly as expected Monday afternoon, voting 56-44 strictly along party lines to strip the House Republicans' Obamacare-related language out of the budget resolution and send it back. The Obama administration, while refusing to negotiate, has insisted that Republicans deserve all of Americans' blame if government ceases to function. 'As of now,' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Monday afternoon, 'it is up to the House of Representatives to decide whether they want to shut down the government in order to make an ideological point.' Carney said president would not bow to 'threat and extortion.' House Republican leaders have faced internal pressure from a cadre of new members swept into power in a 2010 tea party landslide. Those conservatives are unlikely to be satisfied by any budget resolution that leaves Obamacare as-is. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blamed House Republicans Monday for the brinksmanship that has pushed the u.S. toward a federal government shutdown . Their infighting, driven by a belief in small government and a desire to re-litigate the Obamacare debate, has provided an unwelcome dimension to the budget problem for Republicans, and a source of glee for Democrats. A prominent Democratic political operative told MailOnline on Monday that 'the tea party nuts are spinning everyone's wheels, including Boehner's,' referring to Republican House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio. 'As long as there's no left-wing bloc in the Senate that's as easily identifiable as the tea party is on the right, the Republicans will always look like they can't keep their own house in order and our side will look pretty unified and reasonable.' While the Senate convenes at 2:00, those Republicans will meet to play out scenarios, a GOP congressional staffer told MailOnline. 'Our members are going to be working this out,' the aide said. 'We're not going to be the ones kneeling on the football when the clock hits zero. If that means the federal government shuts down, we'll make sure the Senate has the ball at midnight.' But Obama told reporters after a bilateral meeting with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he is 'not at all resigned' to the idea that the government will shut down. 'I suspect I'll be speaking to leaders today, tomorrow and the next day,' Obama said. Carney later told reporters that he had no information about any new meetings added to Obama's schedule. Republicans blamed Senate Democrats on Saturday for not being at work as the House budget proposal sat without action . The president added that his only . negotiation plan related to turning a short-term budget victory into a . longer-term funding plan. 'The . Senate has passed a bill that keeps the government open, does not have a . lot of extraneous issues to it, allows us to then negotiate' future . budgets, Obama said. He holds out hope, Carney added an hour later, that Republicans will 'do the right thing' and acquiesce to the White House's demands. The GOP should take 'the opportunity to follow the Senate's lead ... we would support that,' Carney insisted. Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward warned that President Obama would be blamed in the long term even though Republicans might catch more of the immediate blame . He refused, however, to predict whether the White House might embrace what one reporter called 'toll-both government,' – a one-week stopgap budget commitment that would give the political left and right some breathing room. That idea would move the country closer to a second deadline, the federal government's looming reach of its constitutional debt ceiling. Another negotiation delay could up the ante at a time of more critical economic decisions. 'We certainly can't have any meaningful negotiations under the threat of default,' Obama said. Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward suggested Monday morning that while Republicans may pay an immediate political price for a government shutdown, Obama himself would pay a greater price in history. 'He should be talking – they should be meeting – and they should be discussing this,' he said on MSNBC. 'The America economy is at stake and the president, if there is a downturn or a collapse or whatever could happen here that's bad, it's going to be on his head.' A CNN/ORC poll released Monday morning shows that 46 per cent of Americans would blame congressional Republicans for a government shutdown, and 36 percent would blame the president. Another 13 per cent said they would hold both responsible. CNN did not say if its poll asked whether Senate Democrats should share the blame.","The Senate killed the House spending proposal Monday afternoon, on a straight party-line 56-44 vote .

Patrick 74, was in intensive care after crashing his car when PC Philip Reese visited him at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in June last year . A 74-year-old man who lay dying in intensive care after a car accident was threatened with prosecution by a policeman, an inquest was told. PC Philip Reese was criticised by a coroner for carrying out an 'inappropriate interview' with the pensioner who was wearing an oxygen mask. Patrick Harris from Cinferdord, Gloucestershire, died two days after the interview took place. According to the deceased's family, the police officer was overheard going through a formal caution procedure before telling Mr Harris he could face prosecution for dangerous driving. Mr Harris was being treated for injuries from a car crash in which his twin sister, Shirley Harris, was also involved. The former police mechanic was allegedly left in tears after his conversation with PC Reese,  family spokesman, Robin Vick, told the inquest. A patient in the bed next to the 74-year-old claimed she heard the police officer telling Mr Harris that his sister's life was hanging in the balance  as she was being treated at a different hospital. Mr Vick said sent a letter of . complaint to Gloucestershire Police's chief constable to alert him to . the way in which Mr Harris had allegedly been treated. The . complaint was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission . but was then handed back to be investigated by the force’s own internal . disciplinary department. It is understood the officer was ‘given advice’ but there was no further action. In evidence, PC Reese claimed the . reason for the bedside interview was his concern the pensioner would be . discharged and be allowed to drive again. He said the conversation was carried out 'under caution' in order for a proper record to be kept of what was said. Coroner David Dooley however asked: 'You had concerns that he might shortly be released and drive again? But . what is the reality of a man with serious injuries including a broken . arm and with a car which is written off driving again?' 'According to the protocol at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital did you get permission from senior medical staff to interview him?' Shirley Harris, 74, was not well enough to attend the inquest in Gloucester. The siblings lived in a house their father built for over 50 years before Mr Harris's death . The . policeman said he had received permission from a nurse (who had asked a . doctor) to conduct the interview, but could not remember either . person's name and had no record of the conversation. The . officer denied that he threatened Mr Harris with prosecution for . dangerous driving but admitted that he told the pensioner his . sister was ‘very poorly’ in Frenchay Hospital. When Mr Dooley probed: 'Did you tell Mr Harris that it was all his fault, as was said by the woman in the next bed?' the officer said he hadn't. The . family's representative, Mr Vick added: 'Did it not occur to you that . Mr Harris was not in a fit state to be interviewed - he was wearing an . oxygen mask and his arm was in traction' to which PC Reese responded by . saying he had interviewed 'numerous' people in oxygen masks before. A post mortem concluded that Mr Harris died as the result of a heart attack combined with his multiple injuries. It was revealed the 74-year-old suffered a heart disease which had caused him to collapse in the months before the accident. Cardiology consultant Professor . George Hart told the inquest that the bedside interview conducted by PC . Reese on June 21 last year could have contributed to his cardiac arrest. 'Severe stress can be . linked to an increased risk of a heart attack and as Mr Harris was . already in a precarious medical state the interview could be sufficient . to be associated with his heart attack,' said the professor. 'But . I must stress that this cannot be separated from his pre-existing poor . medical condition and other factors and, in my view, it is more likely . that he would have died in hospital anyway.' Mr Harris suffered internal injuries, . broken ribs and a fractured arm in the accident which is thought to . have happened after he 'blacked out' and veered off the road. Miss Harris was left with wrist and rib fractures, and has undergone six operations since the crash. Mr Dooley concluded proceedings by saying: 'I don’t think conducting an interview . under caution was appropriate and there is no record of permission . being sought for the interview.' 'Nevertheless . the stress of the interview is the same as the other contributing . factors in this case, such as Mr Harris’ injuries and his serious heart . condition, and cannot be blamed for his death. 'The appropriate conclusion therefore is that Mr Harris died from natural causes.' A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police said after the hearing: 'First and foremost our thoughts are with the family of Mr Harris for their loss. 'Following a complaint, an internal investigation was carried out by our Professional Standards Department. It resulted in words of advice to PC Reese around the issue of note taking and the case was closed with no further action. 'When investigating road traffic collisions in which people are killed or seriously injured, it is essential officers are able to quickly establish the factors involved to allow them to preserve or gather evidence and assess if there is any criminal responsibility. 'This is a key aspect of protecting the public and often means speaking to people who are being treated in hospital. We understand this can cause distress and our officers make every effort be sensitive to the circumstances. 'In this case the interview was authorised by PC Reese's supervisor, agreed by a nurse and was very brief.'","Patrick Harris was in intensive care after crashing his car into a tree .

A ten-year-old schoolgirl had her life saved by a routine eye test which showed a tumour the size of a golf ball pressing against her brain. Lauren Uncles went to her local opticians to get some prescription sunglasses for a family holiday in Cornwall on August 21. But during her eye examination, optometrist David Strachan spotted swelling behind her optic nerve. Lauren Uncles (pictured with her mother Teresa) was diagnosed with a brain tumour after her optician noticed a problem during a routine appointment. Thanks to the optician, she rapidly underwent life-saving surgery . Lauren was rushed from her local Specsavers branch in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, to nearby Queen's Hospital for further tests. These revealed she had a rare cranial fibroma - a cancer which grows inside the eye - which can be deadly if left untreated and can cause complete blindness within days. The next day she was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she underwent a major operation to remove the benign tumour. Her mother Teresa, 34, a phone shop sales consultant, urged other parents to make sure their children get their eyes checked regularly. She said: ‘I took her for an eye test because she was going to go to Cornwall on holiday with her friends. ‘The optometrist told us there was swelling on eye and told us it was best that we went to the hospital to get it checked out. Lauren went to see David Strachan at Specsavers in Burton upon Trent to get prescription sunglasses. He noticed a swelling behind her optic nerve and suggested she go to Queen's Hospital . ‘On the Thursday, the day she was set to go to Cornwall, we went to the hospital in the morning and were then taken to the children's ward before she had an MRI. ‘Quite quickly after she had another one and I knew something was wrong. Then they told us the bad news. ‘I was heartbroken and in complete shock, you don't expect news like that, no parent does, I thought it was all a bad dream but it wasn't. At Queen's Hospital Lauren was diagnosed with a brain tumour so she was transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital for surgery . ‘The doctors said the operation could not have gone better but there is still a tumour in her head, it has just been reduced in size. ‘I just want to appeal to all parents to make sure they take their children for an eye test. ‘What happened to Lauren shows that this can be the difference between life and death.’ Despite her life-saving operation, Lauren acted as if ‘nothing had happened’ and was back eating chips and ice cream within half hour. Mother-of-three Teresa, from Barton-under-Needwood, Staffordshie, added: ‘We were all in tears, so worried about what was going to happen. ‘She could have gone blind at any moment, but Lauren turned to us and said: “You lot need to man up, it is me that's got the problem, not you and the doctors will sort it out”. ‘She was amazing. ‘Lauren then had the two hour operation and within half an hour of waking up was eating chips, beans and ice cream, it was as if she was back to normal. ‘She was just a little tired. ‘Now I just think what could have been if I would have let her go on holiday, I don't even like to think about it. ‘We went back to Specsavers after Lauren came out of hospital to thank Mr Strachan. ‘He had a tear in his eye, we all did, it was very emotional. During the surgery, surgeons removed most of the tumour but they were not able to remove all of it meaning that Lauren may require more surgery in future . ‘She basically thanked him for saving her life, he did a fantastic job.’ Lauren, who already wore glasses but didn't have any symptoms before she went for her eye test, said: ‘I think everything went fine. ‘I was a little bit scared but it was . okay, I was just telling everyone to man up, they were all crying but . it wasn't them having the operation. ‘It was good when I woke up because I had two dinners, I joked about having it but they actually gave it to me, it was great. ‘It was a bit strange going to sleep, . but I am happy I am not in hospital anymore and I am happy that I am . through the bad parts of everything now.’ Lauren's mother, Teresa, has urged parents to get their children's eyes tested regularly as 'it can be the difference between life and death'. Image shows Specsavers in Burton upon Trent where Lauren was treated . Mr Strachan said  he was not aware of anybody else as young as Lauren having a deadly brain tumour discovered by an eye test. He said: 'I'd never seen this in someone of such a young age before and without showing any real symptoms was really very unusual. 'I'm just so glad to see Lauren making a fantastic recovery - it was wonderful to see Lauren so soon after her operation. 'Her story is obviously quite unusual, but it does highlight how eye examinations can help identify a number of other health issues. 'With children we recommend getting their eyes checked from the age of three, unless like Ms Uncles, you have any concerns in which case they should come in sooner.'","Lauren Uncles went to the optician to get prescription sunglasses .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 13:55 EST, 9 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:46 EST, 9 October 2013 . A southern Idaho boy returned home this week from the hospital after a terrifying ordeal with a flesh-eating bacteria that doctors feared would kill him. Slade Dill, an eighth-grader at Dietrich School near Twin Falls, was playing tag at school on September 18 when he cut his knee. What initially appeared to be 'no big deal' became far worse. Slade's leg began to swell, and CT scans showed the infection had spread to his abdomen and chest, The Twin Falls Times-News reported. Slade Dill contracted the same flesh-eating bacteria that caused Aimee Copeland to have her limbs amputated . Doctors in Idaho quickly flew him to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City, where he was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis. The boy, who is a runner, could have lost his leg, but doctors didn't amputate because they didn't expect him to live, his mother Dixie Dill said. Slade defied their expectations and is projected to make a complete recovery after arriving home in Dietrich on Monday. He'll be taking antibiotics every day, and he'll get his stitches out from his surgery in two or three weeks. Doctors in Idaho quickly flew Slade to Primary Children's Hospital in Salt Lake City for treatment . Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat. The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area. Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body. Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications. Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg. But about a quarter of victims will lose their lives to the disease. 'Whatever they say, we are going to do it and be thankful,' Dixie Dill said. Necrotizing fasciitis is a bacterial infection most commonly carried by a cough or sneeze from someone carrying the group A Strep bacteria - the same one that causes common strep throat - which can then be transmitted to an open wound by touch. Typically, people who are most at risk have weakened immune systems. That's one of the confounding details about Slade's case, he was in seemingly perfect health, an active cross-country runner for his school. Twin Falls dermatologist Chris Scholes did not see or treat Slade but is familiar with necrotizing fasciitis, having seen the condition personally twice in his career. He said Slade's parents made the right move, to seek help quickly. Doctors were also to be commended, Scholes added. 'The disease is easy to misdiagnose. It may start with a red spot on the skin,' Scholes said. 'The infection goes deeper beneath the skin and can move relatively quickly and get serious fast.' Slade had the same infection that fellow flesh-eating bacteria survivor Aimee Copeland almost lost her life to. Copeland received huge media attention for her recovery after suffering life-changing injuries which led to her limbs being amputated. Aimee was injured on May 1 last year when she traveled down a homemade zipline that snapped, sending her into a lake on the Little Tallapoosa River near Carrollton. A cut on her left leg from rocks in the water became infected with necrotizing fasciitis. Aimee Copeland, left, with her parents, Andy and Donna Copeland, outside Doctors Hospital in Augusta, Georgia, in June 2012, after her amputations .","Slade Dill contracted the bacteria after cutting his knee at school in Idaho .

The Queen today started the countdown to next year's Commonwealth Games as she handed over the official baton for a relay which will travel more than 120,000 miles around the world. At the ceremony outside Buckingham Palace, Her Majesty placed a secret message inside the baton, which she will read out at the opening ceremony for the games in Glasgow in July 2014. The unique object, crafted from titanium, wood and granite, will be taken to every Commonwealth country before it arrives in Scotland in June. Scroll down for video . Kick-off: The Queen today launched the countdown to the Commonwealth Games with the ceremonial baton . Procession: Sir Chris Hoy carried the baton along The Mall towards Buckingham Palace . Proud: Sir Chris, Britain's most successful Olympian, was chosen because of his origins in Scotland where the Games will be held next year . Today Sir Chris Hoy, Britain's most successful Olympian, carried the baton along The Mall accompanied by the pipers and drummers from the Scots Guards and Royal Scots Borderers. The Queen then placed her message of support to the Commonwealth athletes inside the baton's lattice frame, before handing it over to former sprinter Allan Wells. The message, written during the Sovereign's stay at her Scottish estate Balmoral this summer, will remain secret until she reads it out at the opening ceremony in Celtic Park on July 23. Mr Wells, winner of four Commonwealth golds and the 100-metre sprint title at the 1980 Olympics, was joined by 25-year-old Monica Dzonzi, 25, a Unicef ambassador who runs a youth centre in Malawi. Hosts: The Queen and Prince Philip were present at the start of the relay outside Buckingham Palace . Handover: Games officials gave the baton to the Queen for the formal start of its journey . Message: The Queen's greeting to Commonwealth athletes will remain secret until next year . The pair took the symbol of the Games on the initial leg of its global journey and were soon joined by the first of the many baton bearers. At the Palace gates, Wells handed the baton over to swimmer and double Commonwealth gold medallist Caitlin McClatchey. It then made its way around the Queen Victoria Memorial twice, collecting more bearers as it went. Those chosen included athletes, budding sportsmen and women, volunteers and schoolchildren involved with Glasgow 2014 projects. After the ceremony, the baton was carried to nearby Marlborough House, home of the Commonwealth Secretariat. It was followed by the spectacle of dozens of young people each carrying a flag of a Commonwealth nation or territory taking part in the Games. Legend: Sprinter Allan Wells was the first athlete to take the baton on its 120,000-mile trip . Farewell: Mr Wells, an Olympic medal winner, waved goodbye to the Royals as he left . Lord Smith of Kelvin, Glasgow 2014 chairman, told the guests gathered at the Palace: 'Years of planning and preparations have gone into putting on the Games and we have now reached the moment when the countdown really begins. 'The baton is a tangible object. Thousands of people will carry it, and they will bring the Commonwealth to life in front of our eyes. As the journey unfolds, we will see a vast diversity of people, of landscapes and of cultures.' The relay is a Commonwealth tradition that started in 1958, growing in scale with every Games. It is similar to the Olympic torch relay and is designed to unite the citizens of the Commonwealth in a celebration of sport, diversity and peace. Glasgow 2014 is the 20th Commonwealth Games, and its baton relay route is the biggest so far. International: Sir Chris led a procession of students holding flags from all the Commonwealth countries . Support: Hundreds turned out at the Palace to watch the baton relay and flag procession . The baton will leave for India tomorrow and go on to visit every nation and territory of the Commonwealth, travelling through Asia, Oceania, Africa, North and South America, the Caribbean and Europe. It was due to travel to 71 nations and territories in total, but part of the route is being redrawn following Gambia's decision not to participate in the Games. The move comes days after the west African nation announced its departure from the Commonwealth, saying it will 'never be a member of any neo-colonial institution'. The baton will spend an average of one to four days in each nation, with an extended duration of seven days in Wales, two weeks in England and 40 days in Scotland. It will be in Vanuatu, in the South Pacific, over Christmas, bring in the start of 2014 in Sierra Leone and celebrate St Andrew's Day - dedicated to the patron saint of Scotland - in New Zealand. The smallest island on the route is Nauru, also in the South Pacific, which has a populartion of less than 10,000 people.","Monarch writes secret message for athletes and places it inside the baton .

A top London private school is at the centre of a murder investigation after one of its pupils was ‘executed’ during an official visit to the carnival city of Rio de Janeiro. Sergey Petrovich Danshin, the  17-year-old son of a wealthy Russian businessman, was shot three times  in the back of the head after leaving a beachside villa he was sharing with the school’s headmaster Philip Hurd, 52, and the teacher’s gay lover. Police said that four students and another teacher from the exclusive £22,000-a-year International Community School in Regent’s Park were staying in the house when Sergey left late at night, apparently in search of drugs. Sergei Danshin was shot dead in an 'execution' style killing after apparently going looking for cannabis . The teenager’s body was recovered the next day not far from the villa  and less than 48 hours after the party arrived in Brazil. But the murder has baffled detectives who revealed that Sergey’s backpack, containing an iPhone 5 and a credit card, had been left untouched. Police, who have described the crime as an ‘execution’, believe he had gone out to buy cannabis. Local police chief Julio Cesar Mulatinho Neto told The Mail on Sunday: ‘On Friday, September 27, at about 6pm, all seven walked to a bar for pizza. 'At 11.30pm, the three adults returned to the house. All the students remained in the bar. ‘At about 1am, all four students returned and went to bed. But soon afterwards, two decided to leave the house in an attempt to buy cannabis. 'They returned to the bar but were not successful and returned to the house. Later, Sergey left the villa alone.’ His body was found on a canal bank. ‘He had only been in Brazil for two days,’ Mr Neto said. ‘He can hardly have made many enemies in that time. We do not understand the motive for this crime.’ Headteacher Philip Hurd was supposed to be looking after the students while they were staying at this house in Brazil, but a bar owner says he watched on as his underage pupils downed shots and smoked . Earlier in the evening, Mr Hurd had looked on as his underage students downed vodka shots and smoked cigarettes, according to Renan Magalhaes Garcia Gutierrez, 21, the owner of the bar  the group visited. Mr Gutierrez added: ‘When Sergey came back to the bar alone he was asking where he could find cannabis and also made a sniffing gesture that I understood to mean cocaine. I told him, “Be careful, it is dangerous here.” ‘He laughed and said, “Don’t be silly, Brazil has no law.” He then walked off and I did not see him again.’ Sergey’s father, Petr Danshin, an agribusiness magnate in the Black Sea city of Krasnodar, flew out to Rio last week to try to find out what happened. Last night friends and pupils of  the school, which attracts many of the sons and daughters of London-based diplomats, expressed their shock and sorrow at  the death. A school spokesman said: ‘We’re appalled by this tragedy, and have done everything we can to help the Brazilian authorities with their investigations. 'We have offered  our heartfelt condolences to the family and we are now keen to respect their privacy.’","Sergey Petrovich Danshin, 17, shot three times on school trip .

These days, however, it appears the Osmonds has become two acts rather than one. While Donny and his sister Marie enjoy a run of sell-out shows in Las Vegas, the rest of their siblings were performing in this country – at Butlins in Bognor Regis. The Osmonds, who had a string of number one hits in the early 70s, performed at a nostalgia weekend at Butlins in Bognor . Merrill, 60, Jimmy, 50, and Jay, 58, played two lunchtime shows at the holiday camp. Missing, along with Donny and Marie, were the brothers’ bell-bottoms and, not surprisingly, much of their youthful glamour. They sang to a room full of merry middle-aged women fans who sang along to the hit Crazy Horses and screamed as the trio attempted some of their old dance routines. Many fans had travelled from all over Britain to West Sussex to see the brothers. Watching them for the seventh time, Belinda McLacklan, 52, from Kent, said: ‘We used to bunk off school to try to catch a glimpse of them.’ Dressed in Osmonds memorabilia, Sarah Best, 61, said she felt embarrassed for the group. She added: ‘I remember them wearing bell bottoms but now they look like a bunch of politicians with instruments.’ Take it from the top: Wayne Osmond, Jay Osmond, Merrill Osmond, Alan Osmond, Donny Osmond and Jimmy Osmond . The three-night Seventies event at Butlins cost £80 per night and featured passes to themed events, including the Osmonds’ American Jukebox.

Air Force Academy cadets are no longer required to say 'so help me God' at the end of the Honor Oath, school officials said Friday. The words were made optional after a complaint from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, an advocacy group, that they violated the constitutional concept of religious freedom. Academy Superintendent Lieutenant General Michelle Johnson said the change was made to respect cadets' freedom of religion. No help required: Air Force cadets can now choose whether they say, 'so help me God' when making their Honor Oath . The oath states, 'We will not lie, steal or cheat, nor tolerate among us anyone who does. Furthermore, I resolve to do my duty and to live honorably, so help me God.' Cadets are required to take the oath once a year, academy spokesman Major Brus Vidal said. Mikey Weinstein, founder and president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, welcomed the change but questioned how it will be applied. If the person leading the oath includes the words, cadets who choose not to say them might feel vulnerable to criticism, he said. 'What does it mean, ""optional""?' Weinstein said. 'The best thing is to eliminate it.' Religious freedom: Lieutenant Major Michelle Johnson (left) and the Military Religious Freedom Foundation's Mikey Weinstein (right) Vidal said the oath is led by the Cadet Wing honor chair, a student, and that person will also have the option to use or not use the words. Academy officials did not immediately return a follow-up call seeking comment on Weinstein's question. The West Point equivalent oath does not include the words 'so help me God,' said Frank DeMaro, a school spokesman. It states, 'A cadet will not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do.' Officials at the U.S. Naval Academy did not immediately return a call. 'The Honor Concept' on the Naval Academy website includes similar proscriptions against lying, cheating and stealing but includes no religious reference. The Air Force Academy outside Colorado Springs has about 4,000 cadets.

A four-year-old girl is battling a disease that means her tiny bones could shatter at the slightest knock. Hollie Hunter from Chester-le-Street, County Durham, suffers from Langerhans' cell histiocytosis, which affects just one in 200,000 children. Hollie was diagnosed after she broke her arm in a minor fall and now doctors are hoping to be able to cure her with chemotherapy. Hollie Hunter (pictured with her mother, Kim) suffers from Langerhans' cell histiocytosis a rare cancer-like condition which affects just one in 200,000 children in the UK. She was diagnosed after breaking her arm . Her mother, Kim, said: 'It was a typical fall, but when I thought about what happened it just didn’t add up. Hollie fell on soft grass so the impact shouldn’t have broken her arm. It wasn’t normal.' At first, consultants feared Hollie had cancer. Her mother, a biomedical scientist at a Sunderland hospital, recalled the moment she was ushered into a room by doctors. She said: 'They asked me to come into this room and I kept thinking it wasn’t right. 'They thought Hollie might have cancer and over the next few days we lived at the hospital as they did loads of tests.' What followed was an anxious wait as Hollie went through a series of MRI scans and biopsies only for consultants to realise she did not have cancer after all. The condition has left Hollie with very brittle bones meaning her mother has to keep a constant eye on her in case she knocks herself and breaks a bone . But her mother's relief was short-lived as doctors soon broke the news that Holly was instead suffering from Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. The condition develops when the body has too many Langerhans' cells - these normally develop to protect the skin but when there are too many present they can move around the body causing damage. The disease can affect the bones and organs and can cause a range of symptoms from loss of appetite to bone pain and a rash. The condition has a high survival rate and can be treated with chemotherapy as the chemotherapy drugs help to destroy the excess Langerhans' cells. Hollie (pictured with her aunt Amanda, left, and mother Kim, right) is now having chemotherapy in an attempt to destroy the excess Langerhans' cells which are damaging her bones . When doctors examined Hollie they discovered more than 20 bone lesions throughout her body, including in the back of her skull. Her family is now praying her chemotherapy treatment is successful . Specialists believe Hollie may have been born with the condition - leaving her little body a ticking time bomb and doctors amazed an accident did not happened sooner. Ms Hunter said: 'Breaking her arm was a blessing in disguise. 'We would have been none the wiser and she could have done far more serious damage because her bones are being eaten away.' LCH is not technically a cancer, but it behaves like a cancer and it can be treated with chemotherapy. It is named after Dr Paul Langerhans who first described the cells in the skin from which the disease develops. Langerhans' cells are normally only found in the skin and major airways. In people with LCH, the cells are abnormal and are found in other parts of the body including the bone marrow, lungs, liver, spleen and lymph glands. When they are present in these tissues they can cause damage. LCH is divided into two groups - single-system LCH which just affects one part of the body, such as the bones, and multi-system LCH which affects more than one part of the body. About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year - it is more common in boys than girls. Symptoms include poor appetite, irritability, bone pain, a rash, hearing problems, breathing difficulties and jaundice. Single-system LCH may disappear on its own without treatment. Multi-system LCH is usually treated with chemotherapy as it can help destroy the LCH cells. 80 to 90 per cent of children with LCH make a full recovery. Source: Macmillan Cancer Support . When doctors examined Hollie they discovered more than 20 bone lesions throughout her body, including in the back of her skull. Her mother must now constantly watch over her as she could suffer a break from the slightest knock. She can no longer join in with playtime games and is also prone to infection. Hollie is undergoing an 18 month course of chemotherapy and has a tube fitted in her chest to administer a drug cocktail doctors have devised to fight the disease. She would have had regular biopsies but these were halted when doctors grew concerned Hollie’s bones may fracture as they tried to take tissue samples. Hollie's aunt, Amanda, 39, always attends her chemotherapy sessions. She said: 'Chemo scares Hollie so much and fighting the fear is a massive thing.'

A veteran Newtown Police Officer is facing dismissal and no compensation for not returning to work following the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary last year. Thomas Bean was among the first to respond to the horror at the Connecticut school which left 20 first graders and six adults dead. His doctor stated that is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and Mr Bean has not returned to work. Terror: The massacre by 20-year-old gunman Adam Lanza, a former Sandy Hook student, was one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. A police officer leads two women and a child during the attack . Relief: Demolition of Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, began on Friday. The school was the scene of a deadly massacre in December 2012 . But Chief Michael Kehoe wrote to Mr Bean that he received notice that he is '100 percent permanently disabled from performing the essential functions of your job as a police officer.' Mr Kehoe asked Mr Bean to meet with him 'to discuss the issue of whether termination of your employment is necessary due to the medical disability and your options if that is true.' 'They haven't given him many options. It's either quit and get nothing, retire and get nothing or we will fire you and you get nothing,' Newtown police union President Scott Ruszczyk told Courant. Union officials said they expect Mr Bean to be dimissed because the town does not want to pick up the cost of paying half of his salary until he is eligible to retire - that is what they say is mandated by the union contract, reported News Times. Mr Bean has been receiving long-term disability benefits, but the town's insurance police will only cover two years of long-term disability.

Tributes: Painted stars on a . tree leading to Sandy Hook Elementary School the day before demolition began . 'The town tried to pinch some pennies by buying the wrong type of insurance policy, ' said Eric Brown, attorney for the Newtown Police Union, reported NBC. 'Tom acknowledges, based on his own reports, that he's probably not going to be able to come back to work. The question is what type of benefit is he entitled to?' Mr Brown said. Last month the demolition of Sandy Hook Elementary School began under a cloak of secrecy and security to discourage ghoulish souvenir-hunters. Officials hope it will be completely dismantled by the one-year anniversary of the attack. The town has required the workers handling the tear down of the building to sign agreements banning them from discussing any aspect of the work as Newtown officials attempt to fade out of the media spotlight that hit the commuter suburb after the December 14 attack.

The Chilean miners freed from a collapsed copper mine three years ago claim they've been tricked out of royalties as filming begins on a Hollywood movie about the dramatic rescue. Some of the 33 miners are locked in a bitter legal dispute over a contract they signed in 2010 which they claim severely restricts the parts of their rescue story they can make money from. Despite the legal battle, shooting on the new film starring Antonio Banderas and Martin Sheen is set to begin this month in Colombia. Incredible: In 2010, 33 miners were rescued from a copper mine in San Jose, Chile, after being trapped underground for 69 days . 'We have to fix our affairs with the . lawyers and with the [movie] producer that is in the United States,' Luis Urzúa, the group's foreman when the mine collapsed, said. 'With . the march of time, we have had various complications with respect to . our life story. 'I don't think we are going to make a movie and then later realize we feel bad [because] our rights were infringed.' The Guardian reported the legal fray centers on who . retains the long-term rights to key elements of the rescue. This includes a . private diary kept by the miners and their initial 17 days of entrapment with practically no food. The men were trapped underground in the San Jose mine for 69 days before they were rescued in October 2010. The rescue was broadcast live on television with more than a billion people tuning in. It has been reported the men created an underground community that included daily votes on key . issues, 12-hour work shifts, a system of underground lighting and morning . prayer meetings. Elated: Miners Mario Gomez (left) and Mario Sepulveda (right) were over the moon after being rescued . Furious: Former miner Luis Urzua (at podium) believes he and his colleagues have been tricked out of royalties . After rejoining a world intensely curious about their incredible ordeal, the men signed contracts with Chilean law firm, Carey, and a group of Chilean investors. But the miners now claim the agreements strip them of . other long-term rights and the corresponding revenue from the sale or . commercialization of key portions of their entrapment, according to The Guardian. Ex-shift leader Urzúa says some of the miners are willing to cede rights to make the movie, . from which they will each receive a portion of the revenue. He claims the group was pressured to sign the contracts which were only available in English. Another group of miners, however, claims the contracts were also drawn up in Spanish and were the result of a group vote. Meanwhile, the movie's underground sequences will be shot inside a disused . mine in Colombia, while other scenes will be filmed in Chile.

An award-winning film director is being sued for almost £500,000 after failing to turn up for work on a big-budget movie. Lynne Ramsay quit the blockbuster Western starring Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor the day before filming was due to begin in March. Now the producers of Jane Got a Gun have begun legal action in the US against her. They are demanding that she return the $750,000 fee (£466,000) paid to work on the screenplay and to direct it. The action alleges that Ramsay – who was Bafta-nominated for We Need to Talk About Kevin, which starring Tilda Swinton –  was in breach of contract by not appearing on set in New Mexico, as planned. She is also accused of being drunk and disruptive. The movie project descended into farce when the 43-year-old Glasgow-born director was followed off the troubled production by actor Michael Fassbender, who was then replaced by Jude Law. However, Law later walked away from the project as did American actor Bradley Cooper, who quit a short time afterwards. According to one report, Ramsay had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was due to begin. Scottish actor McGregor was eventually drafted in to replace Law, while Warrior filmmaker Gavin O’Connor signed up to direct the movie. According to the lawsuit, Ramsay was reportedly paid around £500,000 to re-write the script and direct the picture. She has previously worked on the movies Ratcatcher and Morvern Callar, both of which were set in Scotland. Big budget movie: Jane Got A Gun stars actress Natalie Portman, pictured left, and Ewan McGregor, right . According to court papers submitted in Albuquerque, New  Mexico, problems with Jane Got a Gun developed in February and March before filming was due to start. The lawsuit claims Ramsay failed to deliver a script, delaying the movie. They allege that she was 'repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew, and was generally disruptive'. The producers are asking that she repay the money and are seeking punitive damages over claims of fraud and breach of contract. Director Gavin O’Connor said production had been delayed for three days to replace Ramsay. Joel Edgerton, one of the movie’s other stars, said the cast decided to complete the film. He added: ‘The producers decided they were going to be the guys playing the violin on the Titanic, that they were going to keep playing. That was kind of infectious.’ Jane Got a Gun is expected to be released in the US next year. Ramsay was unavailable for comment yesterday.

Two fire crews and a police helicopter were called after the university students clambered on to the Dean’s roof last Friday night. The Dean’s House is part of the . cathedral - which dates back to the 11th century and has protected status . as a world heritage site.

Home: The students were rescued from the roof of the Dean's home, pictured, by a police helicopter . The rescue estimated to have cost several thousand pounds. The helicopter was needed to locate the students on the cathedral buildings. Today the Dean, the Very Rev Michael Sadgrove, criticised the students' 'reckless' behaviour. He said: 'I cannot deny that I am deeply concerned that the cathedral has been treated with such disrespect, that Durham University has been brought into disrepute and that the taxpayer has had to bear the costs of a wholly unnecessary emergency call-out. 'Reckless': The Very Reverend Michael Sadgrove, pictured, has condemed the students - thought to be mimicking the Oxbridge 'night climbers' 'But what most worries me is the reckless disregard the students had not only for their own lives but for others, in particular colleagues here at the cathedral and members of the emergency response team. 'Alcohol has obviously played a key part in this dangerous adventure and it is vital that this issue is addressed for the sake of good relations between Durham city and the university, and the welfare of the students themselves. 'Ironically it was other Durham University students who alerted cathedral security staff to the incident. Thank you to them, cathedral staff and the emergency services.' Durham Police said the students have received a warning for their behaviour. A force spokeswoman said: 'I can confirm that police and fire brigade were called to a group of students who were on the roof of the Dean’s House on Friday evening.

France’s first black newsreader today launched an outspoken attack on the country, saying it is blighted by ‘deep-seated racism’. It was not until 2006 that Harry Roselmack finally became the only non-white presenter on TF1, the Gallic equivalent of BBC1. Now he is furious after monkey chants were aimed at a black minister, saying they reduced him ‘to my negro condition’. Harry Roselmack, France's first black newsreader, has said there is 'deep-seated racism' in the country . ‘Racist France is back,’ said Mr Roselmack, responding to a massive increase in popularity for the far right National Front (FN). In a Le Monde opinion piece, he complained about ‘the deep-seated racism that withstands time and words of order, not just within the FN but in the deepest parts of French society’ Christiane Taubira, the black justice minister, was racially abused several times last month. An FN electoral candidate, who has since been suspended, said she would ‘rather see her in the trees than in the government’. Children as young as ten protesting against gay marriage in Angers were also filmed waving banana skins at Ms Taubira, while shouting: ‘Who is the banana for? It is for the monkey.’ Mr Roselmack said: ‘While it is false to say all FN voters and sympathisers are racist, it is equally false to say that there is no racism in this party. ‘Xenophobia and racism are the essential glue that binds it. And it is not unhelpful to see its republican veneer crack from time to time.’ Mr Roselmack’s first appearance on TF1 seven years ago only came after the then president Jacques Chirac urged the media to hire more ethnic minority journalists following race riots. It came as a woman from an Arab background who wanted to stand as a mayor for the FN was told by another party member: ‘You and your children are good for the oven’. Christiane Taubira, the black justice minister, was racially abused several times last month . The shocking reference to the Second World War Holocaust prompted Nadia Portheault, a 26-year-old mother from an Algerian background, to leave the party. She now alleges that it is still plagued with ‘racism and homophobia’ and that ‘neo-Nazis’ are among its members. This is despite Marine Le Pen, the FN’s leader, insisting that it is has been modernised and is fit for government. Mrs Portheault originally wanted to run to become mayor of Saint-Alban, near Toulouse, in south-west France, using her maiden name of Djelida. But FN executives said such an Arab name would be a ‘disability’, with one saying that immigrants from North Africa might end up in the Nazi gas chambers, like thousands of French Jews during the war. Mrs Portheault and her husband, Thierry, said the brother-of-one activist boasted about his Swastika tattoo and hated ‘Arabs and gays’. FN spokesman Julien Leonardelli in turn said the party  ‘categorically rejected’ the Portheault’s ‘vile accusations’ and was ready to sue for libel. Mass immigration from eastern Europe, and from Muslim countries, has been the main target of the FN’s campaigning. They have also capitalised on the economic mismanagement of President Francois Hollande’s ruling Socialist Party, convincing Working Class voters that they are being let down. Analysts insist that the FN win in Brignoles is a strong reflection of the national mood in France. An Ifop poll for the Nouvel Observateur suggested last month that the FN will win 24 per cent of the  vote in next May's elections for the European Parliament.","Harry Roselmack furious after monkey chants were aimed at black minister .

Britain could be hit by power cuts if Labour moves to freeze bills, the head of energy giant Npower has warned. Chief executive Paul Massara claimed the industry needed a ‘stable environment’ to commit to investment in the energy network. Labour leader Ed Miliband has vowed to freeze bills for 20 months if he wins the 2015 general election. Warning: Npower chief executive Paul Massara said future investment depended on stability, which Labour's price freeze would threaten . Npower has announced average price rises of 10.4 this winter, the highest of the Big Six made public so far. It has triggered a major political row over government intervention in the market to curb crippling increases. Sam Laidlaw, the boss of Centrica which owns British Gas, has promised not to take a bonus this year while families are ‘under pressure’. But Mr Massara dismissed the idea as a ‘gimmick’ and insisted he would take his money. And he claimed the lights could go out in the future unless there was a ‘stable environment’ for investment. Recently announced price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . He warned: ‘The amount of spare capacity to meet the peak requirement... has dropped from somewhere around 15 per cent to five. ‘That is extremely low by historical levels... and unless the UK can create a politically stable environment to attract new capital, that new capital will not come in.’ He told BBC's Hardtalk he earns about £600,000 a year, of which £150,000 is a bonus. When asked if he would follow Centrica boss Mr Laidlaw, who on Monday said he would turn down his own bonus, Mr Massara said: ‘I think the issue is, are we doing absolutely everything we can to keep costs down and to make sure it's affordable? ‘Gimmicks of saying, 'I'm going to reduce my bonus' - if Sam was earning five million a year and he's willing to give a million, good for him. ‘My bonus is linked to my performance, is linked to getting it right for customers, is linked to employee satisfaction. All of my team are linked to that. If we don't deliver on that, we don't get a bonus.’ Pledge: Centrica's Chief Executive Sam Laidlaw told the CBI he will not accept a bonus this year, but will still take home millions . On Monday Mr Laidlaw said he had decided not to take his bonus, because there was a need for leadership at a time of public anger. 'Bonuses are independently set by our remuneration committee but in this environment there is a case for leadership. ‘Just . to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and . assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration . committees think about it,’ he said.","Paul Massara says industry needs 'stable environment' to invest .

Asking prices for houses in London have soared by 10 per cent in a month, according to a leading property website. They rose by more than £50,000, fuelling fears that the capital’s property market is overheating. The average price being asked by sellers increased from £493,748 to £544,232 between September and October, said Rightmove. The website put much of the increase down to a ‘frenzy’ of activity in parts of prime central London as wealthy overseas investors look for a safe haven to place their cash amid the troubles of the eurozone. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said that while this is happening and developers can achieve sales at premium prices, this ‘eats up a much-needed source of fresh supply and drags up existing property prices at an even faster rate’. He added: ‘Although it is not sustainable in the longer term, some agents currently report there is a buying frenzy in parts of prime inner London, with available stock so low that their shelves are now bare.’ The new high of £544,232 is £28,852 more than the previous high, which was recorded in July – asking prices fell during the traditional summer slowdown. Across England and Wales, asking prices rose more gently by 2.8 per cent month-on-month, following two months of falls, to reach £252,418 on average.

Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly is back at work just two months after the birth of her son, cutting her maternity leave short to begin her new show tomorrow. The mother of three hopes her new 9pm time slot for 'The Kelly File', which debuts on the 17th anniversary of the Fox News Launch, will be more family friendly. 'I . don't miss being on the air,' she said. 'But there is a part of me that . is not present when I'm on maternity leave and it's good to see that . part of me return when I go back to work. My husband said he could hear . the vibrancy in my voice.' Debut: Megyn Kelly's new show 'The Kelly Files' on Fox News Channel will kick off on Monday . Kelly gave birth to son Thatcher on July 23. She said her new schedule will allow her to work from home in the morning and head to the office in the . afternoon. It means her husband gets the three kids, ages 4 and under, . during the cranky hours when they're getting ready for bed. On . her second day back at work last week, having adjustment problems, she . brought baby Thatcher (and a baby sitter) in with her. Despite the short . maternity leave, she said she's happy to be back. Kelly said she is looking forward to hosting a new show, which is very different to the edgy news show she had been hosting in the afternoon. 'If you watch O'Reilly, you hear a lot about what Bill O'Reilly thinks,' she said. 'Sean Hannity, same thing. But you're not going to hear what I think.' 'The Kelly File' is the linchpin to the first overhaul of Fox's prime-time lineup since 2002, a century in television time. Starting Monday, Hannity moves back an hour to 10pm to make room for Kelly at 9, Greta Van Susteren shifts to 7pm and Shepard Smith becomes a roving news anchor making appearances throughout the evening. At the time of the last schedule change, when Van Susteren moved to Fox from CNN, the now 42-year-old Kelly was an unhappy Washington lawyer. She began reporting news for a local Washington station on weekends in 2003. A year after that, she was noticed and hired by Fox News chief Roger Ailes. Game changer: 'The Kelly File' is the linchpin to the first overhaul of Fox's prime-time lineup since 2002, a century in television time . Kelly . said she hasn't been pressured to make changes for the move into the . evening, where a larger audience is usually available. Her afternoon . show averaged 1.2 million viewers a day before her maternity leave, . while Hannity reached 1.9 million at 9 pm. 'I've . never wanted to be an opinion host, and Roger Ailes hasn't wanted me to . be an opinion host,' she said. 'I don't think I'd be very successful . anyway. I'm not an ideologue, and I think you have to be successful in a . prime-time opinion-based show. I think I'm too moderate and . reasonable.' Kelly has cultivated an image of speaking up in ways that run counter to Fox's image. She . marched off the set on Election Night to interview Fox's numbers guy, . minimizing the embarrassment when Karl Rove questioned the declaration . that President Barack Obama had won re-election. Her legal training helped Fox correct, quicker than rivals, an initially wrong report on the U.S. Supreme Court's health care decision. She expressed disgust at a man's suggestion that children of working mothers don't fare as well as children with stay-at-home moms. Yet on a day-to-day basis, the stories that she selects and emphasizes have made her show one that Fox's primarily Republican audience can feel comfortable with.

The California home where Steve Jobs made the first Apple computers in his garage has been designated a historic site. The Los Altos ranch-style house where the tech legend first launched his hugely successful company has been named a 'historic resource' by the town's historical commission. The vote was unanimous, and will preserve the home exactly as it stand, according to the San Jose Mercury News. Unexpected landmark: The boyhood home where Steve Jobs grew up is up for historic status . Starting point: Jobs and Steve Wozniak (pictured here in 1976) built their first 50 computers in the garage . 'The documentation looks very complete, better than some of the books as far as accuracy goes,' historical commission chair Frank Bishop told the paper. 'Innovator': The application for historic status hails Jobs as a legend . The designation was made without current owner Patricia Jobs, the Apple founder's sister, permission, according to the Mercury News. She did speak to the board and has not raised any objections, Mr Bishop noted. Mr Jobs moved into the house with his family when he was in 7th grade, eventually building his first personal computers in the garage. The humble beginnings of the massive technology company have played an important role in the mythology of Apple and Mr Jobs. The garage was the spot where Jobs and his friends Steve Wozniak and Bill Fernandez worked on the first iteration of a computer. In the official biography of the Apple founder, Mr Jobs said that he and Wozniak built their first 50 computers in the garage. A similar house was used in the filming of the latest film about Mr Jobs' life. The actual three-bedroom home on Crist Drive is valued at $1.5million and is not for sale. While . the push for the entrepreneur's boyhood home has been logged down by . bureaucratic paperwork for the past two years, Mr Jobs left some of his own . historical mementos behind well before he died in 2011. Just last week, a time capsule that he buried at a conference in Aspen, Colorado in 1983 was discovered and it contained the very first commercially-available computer mouse that his team had created.

The quirky-looking 830-square-foot property was built in 1925 and measures just 4.5 feet wide at the back, before expanding out to become 15 feet wide at the front . What makes the Montlake Spite House in Seattle such a peculiar property is its unusual shape which is best described as V-shaped like a piece of pie . It is also one of the famous examples of a ‘spite house’ - a property built specifically to irritate neighbors or other parties by blocking out light or access to neighboring buildings. The property at Montlake fits the bill perfectly as a strange and impractical structure that occupies a small piece of land in front of another, larger property. Legend has it that the strange structure came about as a result of a bitter divorce between a married couple who owned the property directly behind it. Allegedly a judge awarded the husband the house and the wife the front yard; so out of spite she built the tiny home on top of her front yard to block out light and access to her husband’s property. The house is one of the famous examples of a 'spite house' - a property built specifically to irritate neighbors or other parties by blocking out light or access to neighboring buildings . Despite its unusual shape, the house is quite roomy inside 'with the exception of where it narrows into the kitchen,' says the owner . Current owner Lisa Horton firmly believes the legend that the property was built as a spite house but says that she’s heard that it was for an altogether different reason. ‘I can't imagine why else someone would build a house like that if it wasn't out of spite,’ she told Komo.com. She believes the dispute was over land. The owner of the land went back to Germany and allowed somebody to build a house on the property. The landowner requested that the builder leave him enough space to build his own home upon his return. But when the landowner returned, he saw that the new structure was much bigger than he’d expected and he could no longer build the home he wanted. 'Out of spite, he [the landowner] built that funny little pie-shaped home [as a barrier],' Horton told Quirksee.

Adil Hussain was sentenced to three years in prison today after taking miles off used cars and selling them for more than they were worth . A car dealer who tricked customers into overpaying for vehicles by reducing their mileage has been jailed for three years. Adil Hussain pocketed over £100,000 by fiddling with the cars' odometers before selling them at premium rates to unwitting customers. The 26-year-old from Lenton, Nottinghamshire, was reported to Trading Standards after one woman realised she had been duped out of thousands of pounds. Nottingham Crown Court heard how the man bought cars at auctions and from private sellers before rigging their odometers and selling them on Autotrader. Over 18-months, Hussain raked in £133,200 by fraudulently selling 74 used cars online. He was finally exposed when hairdresser, Caroline Jones, discovered she had been scammed after part-exchanging her Honda RS3200 for a Toyota Celica. 'I was forced to downsize my car to save money because the recession really hit my business,' she said. 'I looked on Autotrader and Adil Hussain was advertising himself as a car dealer. 'I saw he was advertising a 2005 Toyota Celica with 48,431 miles on the clock for £6,000. 'He offered me £4,000 for my car so I paid him £2,000 cash. 'I went to look at the car and he provided all the documents and service history which tallied with the mileage of this car. 'We agreed a price and he dropped the car off but almost immediately after I handed over the money I realised something was wrong because the car wouldn't start. 'The gearbox was completely shot and when I held up the service book to the light I noticed a sticker was covering the front which said Toyota Diesel. Mrs Jones sold her Honda (left) to Adil Hussain in exchange for the car which had a false mileage (right) for £2,000 . A Toyota Celica which was purchased by Caroline Jones had only 48,00 miles on the clock when it should have read over 100,000 miles . 'Everything clicked and I realised he had given me the service book from another car. 'I could just see him driving away in my car and tried to ring him on his mobile but it was already disconnected. 'I rang the police but they couldn’t help so I got straight on the phone to Trading Standards and reported him. 'I did my own research on Adil Hussain and there were lots of people saying he had conned them. 'The car I bought from him had actually done 100,000 miles and the rear wheel was hanging on by a single bolt. It could have killed me. 'Because I needed a car for my business I ended up paying £3,000 to have it repaired before I just sold it for a banger because the memory of what he did was too much for me. 'I am glad he was jailed but I don’t know if I will get my money back. I borrowed the money from my husband which now means he has to work more so we can pay it off.' Hussain was ordered to repay his customers £390,000, the value of the 74 cars he 'clocked'. Judge Andrew Hamilton said: 'You effectively stole from your victims. Because of the high mileage the cars had travelled they could be potentially dangerous.' His cousin, Ayaz Aziz, 27, also of Nottingham, received a 14 month prison sentence suspended for two years.

It has been revealed that the famed Chicago chef who died suddenly in his home yesterday had a brain aneurysm and knew that the condition was fatal. Charlie Trotter's initial autopsy was deemed 'inconclusive' by the Chicago medical examiner's office and they will conduct additional tests that will be finished in six to eight weeks. They said that there was no foul play or trauma. A close friend has spoken out about how the 54-year-old chef had previously disclosed his medical condition. A sommelier who worked with Trotter and became a close friend over their years of working together said that doctors had told Trotter not to fly to avoid adding pressure to his brain. 'It was a time bomb, and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left,' sommelier Larry Stone told The Chicago Tribune. Final appearance: Charlie Trotter spoke at a culinary conference on Friday and he flew to Wyoming to attend, going against doctors orders as they wanted to avoid extra pressure on his brain . The last picture? Trotter spoke at a culinary conference in Jackson Hole on Friday, just four days before he died and one audience member noticed that his left hand- seen in his pocket while posing with attendee Megan Gallagher- was shaking . 'It was inoperable, and it was not something that could be repaired; it was deep inside the brain.' Mr Stone told the paper that his 54-year-old former boss had multiple seizures in the time leading up to his death on Tuesday. The first hints of trouble came last year when he closed his eponymous, award-winning restaurant after 25 years, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and study philosophy. That didn't keep him from staying active, in spite of doctor's orders. Just days before his death, Trotter flew to and from Jackson Hole, Wyoming to speak at a culinary conference. Nothing . seemed particularly unusual about Trotter during that appearance, but . one audience member did notice that the chef's left hand was shaking . slightly as he held the microphone.

Friends: Chef Anthony Bourdain (center left) and his wife Ottavia (right) hugs Trotter and his wife Rochelle Smith (center right) at a food event in Miami in February of last year . The chef's wife Rochelle was seen by neighbors screaming and crying hysterically as ambulances arrived at their home after Trotter's son Dylan found his father unconscious. 'He was much loved and words cannot describe how much he will be missed,' she said in a statement. 'His impact upon American cuisine and the culinary world at large will always be remembered.' Multi-course tasting menus that are now seen on many fine dining establishments were his handiwork, as he traded the 10-course menu at his flagship restaurant on a daily basis and boasted that frequent customers never had the same thing twice. He had a great influence on both the local and national food scene, one that many expect to be felt for years to come. Passed: Charlie Trotter, seen here in August 2012, died on Tuesday after collapsing in his Chicago home . Wine was a passion for Trotter, and when asked at the event in Jackson Hole what he would like for his final meal, he said he wanted only the best: a bottle of 1900 Chateau Margaux, a wine that costs up to $16,000. During an interview when he decided to close his restaurant, he revealed his grand plans for what would happen to his restaurant's 26,000-strong wine cellar after it closed last year. 'I did a mathematical . calculation: If I live to the average life expectancy of the American . male — 78.9 — and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should . consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet,' he said in an . interview with The New York Times.","Charlie Trotter, 54, was found dead in his Chicago home on Tuesday .

Officers Teresa Lashmet and Jeremy Myers, as well as two other unnamed police have been placed on leave, the Tulsa World originally reported. Dashcam footage shows the OHP cruiser speed up to catch Mr Payne, who initially refuses to get out of his truck while two officers bark commands at him, this despite the official police report written by Ms Lashmet saying he ‘immediately’ exited the truck. ‘You're going to see where she says the driver immediately got out of his truck,’ Josh Lee, Mr Payne’s attorney told KOTV. ‘He never gets out of his truck.’ The report says Mr Payne exited the truck, then got back in and asked ‘what the f**k did I do?’ But the video shows an entirely different scene. Mr Payne is sitting in his truck while two officers talk to him. Soon, a state trooper, identified in the report as Kenny McKee, is shown pulling the driver out by his neck and pinning him to the ground. The report says that ‘McKee then pulled Payne from the truck and we placed him on the ground using a straight arm bar technique.’ SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Unprovoked: An officer, presumably Jeremy Myers, based on the arrest affidavit, is seen rushing in to kick Jerry Payne's head . Inaccurate: The arrest report written by Theresa Lashmet does not match the dashcam footage . There appears to be a short struggle restraining Mr Payne on the ground, which is documented in the report, but what happens next isn’t mentioned in the affidavit. Another officer rushes in from the right side and appears to kick Mr Payne in the head before falling onto and helping restrain him. The report says simply that ‘Officer Myers then arrived on the scene and assisted me in getting control of Payne.’ ‘The other Miami police officer comes from back over here, and this is when he comes running and kicks Mr. Payne right in the face and you see his head snap back pretty good,’ the attorney explained to KOTV. Pictures of Mr Payne at the time he was admitted to jail showed multiple wounds to his face, as well as blood. Another attorney for Mr Payne told NewsOK he suffered broken teeth, a bloody lip, bumps, bruises and . scrapes all over his face. Not a threat: Mr Payne is shown sitting in his truck and never exiting, in stark contrast to the affidavit . Choke-slam: An officer can be seen throwing Mr Payne to the ground by his neck . Already restrained: This image shown, shortly before Mr Payne was kicked in the head, does not indicate further restraint was required . The arrest report says Mr Payne ‘received a scratch on his left cheek and a bump above his left eye.’County jail records show a Jeremy Myers as the arresting officer. A DUI charge was dropped last month shortly after the video was made public. A call by MailOnline to the Miami Police Department was meant with resistance before being forced to leave a voicemail – which has not yet been returned. Mr Lee wants the city to file perjury and assault and battery charges against the police involved, he told KOTV. A message left with an assistant to Mr Lee requesting further comment was not returned, nor was a message left at a number shown in prison records belonging to Mr Payne. The trooper involved has not been suspended, an OHP spokesperson confirmed.","Jerry Payne is seen in the video being kicked in the face by a police officer .

A stage 4 cancer sufferer has written a powerful op-ed explaining that as a direct result of Obamacare she has lost her life-saving medical insurance and the team that has kept her alive. Edie Littlefield Sundby, who has been battling gallbladder cancer since 2007, explained in a piece for the Wall Street Journal that she is 'one of the losers' in the president's signature healthcare plan. 'I am a determined fighter and extremely . lucky,' she writes. 'But this luck may have just run out: My . affordable, lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled . effective December 31.' Since learning that her plan with United Healthcare PPO will end within weeks, she has been scrambling to find out the alternatives for her care, she writes. Battle: Cancer sufferer Edie Sundby (pictured with her husband Dale) says she is 'one of the losers' from Obamacare as she has lost her healthcare plan and now faces losing her doctors too . But she has learned that she must now either accept the government exchange plan and lose her world-class doctors or pay more for private insurance with an unfamiliar company. It means that after fighting the cancer, which has a five-year survival rate of just two per cent, for nearly seven years, she faces the prospect of losing her team of primary doctors and oncologists, who have been crucial to saving her life. She explains that her insurance company has paid $1.2 . million for her treatment and has never doubted her doctors, but now it is . pulling out of the individual California market. There is no one health-exchange plan accepted by both of the medical centers she has come to rely on; it means she needs to . choose between either keeping her primary oncologist at Stanford . University or her primary care doctors at the University of California, . San Diego. Few options: Sundby (taking part in an 800-mile walk after she was previously cancer-free) must either accept the government plan and lose her doctors or pay more with an unfamilar insurance company . World-class care: University of California, San Diego (pictured), where her primary care doctors are based, does not accept the same exchange plan as Stanford University, where her primary oncologist is based . 'My choice is to get coverage through the . government health exchange and lose access to my cancer doctors,' she . writes, 'or pay much more for insurance outside the exchange (the quotes . average 40% to 50% more) for the privilege of starting over with an . unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits.' With . time running out, Sundby says that she and . her broker 'still don't have a clue how to best proceed'. She asks: 'What happened to the . president's promise, ""You can keep your health plan""? Or to the promise . that ""You can keep your doctor""?' 'Thanks . to the law, I have been forced to give up a world-class health plan. The exchange would force me to give up a world-class physician.' She concludes that while taking away . an individual's control over their medical coverage may be an effective . way to manage costs, it makes it harder for them to stay alive. 'Broken promises': Obama has previously said that people will not lose their healthcare plans or their doctors - but Sundby said that is not the case for her and demands to know why . 'Perhaps that's the point,' she writes. While the piece appears aimed at President Obama, she writes that she only wants to stay alive, rather than made political points. Her op-ed comes among increasing concerns that exchange plans following Obamacare will typically have narrow networks of physicians and hospitals. It is just the latest criticism of the system; the enrollment process has also been plagued by software and data entry problems which led Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius to offer an apology to a House committee in testimony. Sebelius called the enrollment software problems a 'debacle' and 'a miserably frustrating experience for way too many Americans.'","Edie Littlefield Sundby, who has been battling gallbladder cancer for nearly 7 years, wrote about how Obama's plan has affected her care in op-ed .

Nor are you ever likely to see him at a children’s party, thank goodness. This is possibly Britain’s creepiest clown, who is terrifying people by popping up on darkened streets and in the process turning himself into a global internet sensation. Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that he models himself on a fictional child killer from the Stephen King horror story It, and first showed up on Friday the 13th. Scroll down for video . Out to amuse: The Northampton Clown has said that he never intended to scare anyone with a series of appearances in the town in fancy dress . But yesterday the man who has won a worldwide audience on Facebook with his antics in the town of Northampton insisted: ‘I wasn’t trying to scare anyone.’ Unashamed but not unmasked, the figure, who wants to stay anonymous, declared this week it was just ‘harmless fun’. ‘I just wanted to amuse people,’ he said. ‘Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards. It’s like watching a horror movie. When people get scared they usually start laughing.’ The ‘Northampton Clown’ has amassed an international following after YouTube and other websites showed photos of him standing motionless, waving or staring at passers-by – sometimes carrying a teddy bear or holding a bunch of balloons. Bizarre: Appearances of the clown, who was seen waving and holding balloons and a teddy bear, had left residents of the Northamptonshire town baffled . Clowning around: The clown has vowed to continue appearing in the town even though he says it is difficult to keep his identity a secret . Such is his following that his Facebook page, called Spot Northampton’s Clown, now has almost 130,000 fans. His make-up and outfit bear a startling resemblance to Pennywise, the sinister circus joker in the movie of King’s novel It and he has even adopted the character’s catchphrase, ‘beep beep!’ One couple on holiday from Florida travelled from London to search for the clown because they were fans of the film. But although many have applauded his exploits, some have failed to see the funny side. Earlier this week, a ‘vigilante’ calling himself Boris the Clown-catcher set out to trap the mysterious figure. And on the Facebook site, Kelly Keen wrote: ‘You’ve been spotted – now get out of the clown suit and start acting like a grown-up... and stop scaring people as some people do have real fears of clowns, and you are terrorising them despite what you may say.’ In contrast, Jessica Maffre urged people not to harm the man in the red wig and white painted face, adding: ‘Loving all this, it’s brightened up boring old Northampton a treat, people need to stop taking things so serious and just enjoy the fun, don’t try and ruin it, and please don’t be violent towards the clown.’ Worldwide fame: The Northampton Clown's Facebook page has attracted around 125,000 likes . Not trying to be sinister: The clown was threatened with violence by some Facebook users after he started appearing on Friday 13 . An American observer suggested he . should visit Washington ‘and replace the clown in the White House’ – a . reference to President Obama. Someone . even argued that the appearances captured local imagination because . they took place in a town he dubbed ‘Nothing-happening-ton’. There . has been feverish speculation over the clown’s identity, with one . blogger naming a local actor who recently appeared in a YouTube film as a . clown. It was noted that a backdrop in the footage was identical to that in a photograph of the Northampton Clown.

Scientists have successfully tested a new drug treatment for tuberculosis which could be an effective weapon against increasingly resistant forms of the disease. The combination of three drugs killed 99 per cent of patients' tuberculosis bacteria in two weeks. 'The results of this clinical trial give . us the first indication that a new TB drug regimen - a combination of . drugs - could be more effective than any of the existing TB drug . regimens,' said Dr Mel Spiegelman, chief . executive officer of the TB Alliance, a non-profit research group that . conducted the study. A woman with TB rests at a hospital . in Tamatave, Madagascar. The disease killed 1.7million in 2009 . He said the combination is especially . promising because it could be used to treat patients with both . treatment-sensitive TB and TB strains that are resistant to two or more . of the common drugs, known as multiple-drug resistant TB. The cocktail includes one existing TB drug, pyrazinamide, a repurposed antibiotic from Bayer AG called moxifloxcin that is now used off-label for patients with drug-restistant TB, and a new drug called PA-824 being developed by the New York-based TB Alliance. The findings, published in The Lancet, come as the TB bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis is rapidly developing resistance to the world's most effective tools. Standard treatment for TB usually includes a mix of four drugs over a period of six months and multi-drug resistant TB can take 18 to 24 months to treat. Since most of the disease is cleared in the first few months, people often do not finish their full regimen of TB drugs, which can lead to drug resistance, making TB more dangerous and more difficult to treat. According to the World Health Organization, in some parts of the world, one in four people with TB has a form of the disease that can no longer be treated with standard drug cocktails. Even more deadly forms of TB are emerging. Dr Zarir Udwadia of the National Hospital in Mumbai, India, has identified more than a dozen cases of TB that cannot be killed by any existing form of treatment. TB kills an estimated 1.4 million people each year, and some 9 million people are newly infected. Tuberculosis virus: Some strains of the disease are becoming increasingly resistant to drug combinations . In the mid-stage study conducted at two sites in South Africa, researchers tested the drug combination on 85 patients with TB. After two weeks, they found the new treatment combination was 99 per cent effective at killing off TB bacteria in these patients. A follow-up study of the treatment testing the drug combination over a two-month period already has begun and should be completed next year, Dr Spiegelman said. Once that study is done, the group hopes to start large-stage clinical trials. 'The results look strongly promising from this early trial,' said Dr Mario Raviglione, director of the World Health Organization's Stop TB Partnership. 'If further trials hold up, we may have a major solution for drug-sensitive TB and drug-resistant TB.' The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the British and Irish governments. The study, which needs to be confirmed in larger and longer trials, was presented at the . International AIDS Conference in Washington. The new treatment doesn't contain any drugs . in the class called rifamycins, which pose the greatest threat of side . effects for patients who also are being treated for infections with HIV, . the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDs. Dr Spiegelman said: 'TB is the largest killer of AIDS . patients, and so in order to contain the AIDS epidemic, we have to . contain TB to a much greater extent.'","In some countries one in four .

Matthew Dillon, who found love and fathered two children during more than four years on the run . An escaped prisoner fathered two children with a woman who didn't know he was a wanted man before police caught up with him. Matthew Dillon, 34, fled from Sudbury open prison in 2009, after he became 'fed-up' with his daily routine. After staging the simple escape, Dillon found love and was living with his unwitting partner - who had no idea he was on the run - and their two children when police finally tracked him down. Dillon left the open prison, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, in August 2009 as he neared the end of a 10 year eight month jail term for robbery. But police did not track him down until September, even though he was living in Perton, West Midlands, just 40 miles away. He was returned to jail on Friday after admitting one charge of escape from lawful custody at Stafford Crown Court. Imprisoning him for the rest of his sentence, plus a further six months, Recorder Adam Feest said: 'It's a great shame you chose to walk out, you would have been released fairly soon afterwards. 'You have since shown you can live a law-abiding life.' David Bennett, prosecuting, said police officers who arrested him asked Dillon why he had absconded from Sudbury and his reply was that he was 'fed up' with the prison's regime. Mr Bennett said: 'He said he wanted to hand himself in, but he had met a partner, they'd had children together and he did not want to return to prison. His partner had no idea he had absconded from prison.' HM Prison Sudbury: Matthew Dillon's partner had no idea that he had escaped from the Derbyshire jail . The court heard that Dillon was sentenced in September 2004 for conspiracy to rob and was due for release after serving two-thirds of the jail term. Mr Darron Whitehead, defending, said Dillon was only 24 when he got into serious trouble for 'a number of robberies'. He served most of his sentence at Dovegate before being moved to Sudbury ahead of his scheduled release date. Mr Whitehead added: 'He couldn't adjust to the new regime, he walked out and didn't come back.'The irony is that had he applied for parole he would probably have got it.'","Matthew Dillon was sent back to jail after spending four years on run .

It's one of London’s most desirable addresses with five-star hotels and fabulous views over Hyde Park. But the Romanian travellers who have descended on Park Lane are not the most welcome of visitors. Suitcases in tow, they have taken over a patch of grass near Marble Arch and it is feared they may set up a camp. Back on the scene: Romanian beggars have been pictured setting up camp in Marble Arch once again . Going nowhere: The group was pictured huddle together chatting or sleeping on the grass nearby . Nuisance: Others were pictures gathered in the doorway of a luggage shop drinking cups of tea . A 40-strong band did exactly that a year ago, turning the site into a rubbish dump and being accused of knife-point robberies and other crimes. Yesterday Richard Owen, who has a burger van at Marble Arch, said the new arrivals were bad for tourism. He said he had just seen two Romanian women ‘pull their skirts down, squat down and go to the toilet’. He added: ‘There were tourists going by on those open-top buses, people everywhere, they didn’t care. It was absolutely disgusting. ‘The police don’t seem to be doing anything. ‘All they seem to be doing is going up and checking passports and then just let them go. Taking a nap: It is not yet clear if these travellers are part of the same gang who blighted Marble Arch last year . Problem: Police and Westminster Council faced a long-running battle to remove the travellers last summer . Blight: The beggars have gathered in sight of some of the capital's top hotels . ‘When I get here in the morning there are usually about 60-70 of them. They are drinking and begging. It’s ruining the tourism.’ Tony Carlozzi, 31, on holiday with a friend from New York, said she saw one of the group urinating in the underpass. ‘He just looked at me, he was drunk,’ she added. ‘I couldn’t believe it and I’m from New York. I don’t know why the police don’t just lock them up, that’s what would happen in America. ‘They have been begging. It is intimidating. It is the sort of thing that would put me off coming to London again.’ Britain is preparing itself for a predicted influx of Romanians – and Bulgarians – when they are given free access to our jobs market in January. Ministers have refused to put an estimate on how many migrants will travel here but campaign group MigrationWatch has warned it could be 50,000 every year for five years from 2014.","Group of around a dozen pictured near Park Lane earlier this week .

An award offering cash prizes for the best works of art that stir up hatred for the United States has been launched in Iran. The competition, named Marg bar Amrika, which translates to 'Down with America' or 'Death to America', has a grand prize of 100million Iranian rial, which equates to £2,500. Held in two parts, the contest invites entries on anti-American subjects including 'Why is the US not reliable', 'The US and oppression' and 'The US and global Zionism'. Award: A contest for the best anti-American work of art has been launched in Iran . Antagonism: This image of 'Uncle Sam' holding a mace features on the awards site as inspiration . The first part, eligible for the £2,500 prize, is for photographs, posters and cartoons, while the second part, with a smaller grand prize of £750, is for documentaries, hymns and blog posts. Hardline conservative illustrators and artists from Iran will judge submissions, including cartoonists Maziyar Bizhani and Mohammad Hosein Niroomand, both of whom have been published in the Keyhan newspaper. The awards are sponsored by conservative news agencies and television stations. A website promoting the awards features the iconic 'Uncle Sam' image with a medieval mace drawn into his hand.

Iran and and US have had a strained relationship for decades, which had looked to improve since the election of moderate politician Hassan Rouhani as president in June this year. The announcement of the award comes as . conservatives in Iran feel ignored by the government, which has recently . re-opened talks in the West over the country's nuclear programme. The country's revolutionary guard, a military organisation which protects the country's Islamic values, is also organising a series of 'down with America' rallies on 4 November. The rallies commemorate an attack on the US Embassy in Iran's capital city Tehran in 1979, when hardline students overran the building.

A Minnesota man who heroically stopped to help the victim of a car accident two years ago has finally returned to work after a long road of rehabilitation following the loss of his leg. Keith Barnes, 39, has had sporadic contact with Alicia Kaufenberg, a 23-year-old college student who also lost her leg after Barnes and another man, Marcus Andary, attempted to carry her to safety and were struck by a drunk driver. Both Barnes and Kaufenberg suffered serious injuries and required leg amputations; Andary, 21, died as a result of his injuries. Return to form: Keith Barnes talks to fellow barber Johnathan McCastle (right) on a slow day at Grooming House Barber Shop in St. Paul after returning to work after almost two years of rehab . Barnes says that if he had the opportunity to do it again, he would never have gone to Kaufenberg's aid. He spoke to Pioneer Press from the barber shop where he finally returned to work three months ago after almost two years of rehabilitation. 'I'm no hero,' said Barnes, who is a father of six from St Louis Park. 'My decision, it wasn't the best one. Next time, I'll call the police and stay put until the police come.' Barnes' selfless action in going to the aid of someone in need had unforeseen consequences for everyone involved, not least Barnes himself. Brave: Barnes lost his left leg when hit by a car while pulling a woman to safety from a rollover accident in December 2011 . A truly tragic chain of events was set in motion the night of December 18, 2011 as Barnes was driving onto Interstate 94 by Lexingon Parkway. Suddenly the car in front of him, driven by Kaufenberg, swerved to avoid a pick-up truck, driven by Andary. Huge price: Barnes said he's not used to his prosthetic leg yet: 'I walk slowly because I haven't gained confidence,' he said . According to the Star Tribune, Andary had been attempting to change lanes when another car blocked him, so he veered back into Kaufenberg's lane. The two cars struck and Kaufenberg lost control of her vehicle, which rolled over and landed on its roof. 'I know you see it in movies, but to actually see a full-sized car flipping in front of you, I was just shocked,' Barnes told Pioneer Press. 'It was terrible.' Barnes, acting on instinct, parked his car and ran across the freeway to help Kaufenberg. Her car had come to rest in the highway's west-bound fast-lane and she was struggling to crawl from the wreck. Andary also ran to the aid of Kaufenberg and together he and Barnes pulled her from the car and began carrying her to safety when further disaster struck. Eugene Michael Farrell, 63, was driving after drinking in a bar and had a blood-alcohol reading of 0.09, just above the state's legal limit of 0.08. His Chevrolet Venture minivan traveling at 63mph hit Barnes, Kaufenberg and Andary, killing Andary instantly and claiming the left legs of both Barnes and Kaufenberg. According to the Pioneer Press, Barnes sustained head trauma, internal injuries and fractures to his legs, wrist, shoulder and pelvis. Back to work: Keith Barnes (right) trims the beard of his old friend Antonio Hrabowski at Grooming House Barber Shop . He was placed in an induced coma and his leg was amputated below the knee. Barnes said doctors told his family that he may never smile again. 'The doctor kind of hurt my feelings,' said Barnes. 'The doctor said I was never going to be able to cut hair again. Because of my arm. I really do believe the more I use it, it'll go back to normal. It's already starting to.' Kaufenberg has not spoken publicly about the accident but she and Barnes were both disappointed to learn that Farrell, who has a previous careless driving conviction, was sentenced to just one year in prison. Recognition: Barnes denies being a hero, but many disagree, including the Minnesota Board of Barber Examiners who honored him for his bravery and selflessness . All in all, it's a harsh outcome for two men who were acting on their instinct to help. Barnes denies being a hero, but  many friends and supporters disagree - including U.S. senator Al Franken, who stopped by the barbershop to thank him for his courage and sacrifice. Barnes says he knows Kaufenberg may have some unresolved issues towards him about the results of his intervention. According to Minnesota state law, a . person is generally protected from legal consequences for stepping in to . help the victim of a crime and accident and making the situation . unintentionally worse. The Good Samaritan law varies . from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as to who is protected from liability and in . what circumstances. Barnes told Pioneer Press that Kaufenberg visited him at the Courage Rehabilitation Center but that the two haven't spoken in-depth about what happened. 'I've been wanting to,' he said. 'Just so we can sit and have a conversation, just so we can talk about it.'","Keith Barnes stopped to help Alicia Kaufenberg whose car flipped on a highway .

A barrister-turned-farmer has been found dead with gunshot wounds less than three weeks after getting married. Ben Hinchliff, 46, who gave up his job as a London lawyer to pursue his dream of working on the family farm, was found dead with gunshot wounds on Friday. Police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident on Nether Mill Farm in South Yorkshire. It is the latest tragedy in the Hinchliff family. His father was mid-50s when he died in 1995. In July 2011, his younger brother Adam suffered a fatal heart attack aged 43 at Silkstone Golf Club, near Barnsley. Tragic: Ben Hinchliff, 46, married Emily three weeks ago in a church in Barnsley. He was found dead on Friday . Mr Hinchliff, who joined One Brick Court Chambers in Temple, London in 1993, took over running the farm following his brother's death - his brother had taken over following the death of their father. He married his wife Emily at a village church in Barnsley at the end of last month. With his sister, Rebecca Scott, 43, Ben Hinchliff owned racehorses and recently submitted a planning application to convert some of their farm buildings into 20 homes. On Sunday his wife, who works at a poultry company, posted photographs of the couple together on Facebook - including one of their wedding and one on a beach. Mr Hinchliff's wife and his sister Rebecca were too distressed to talk. Barbara Beevers, whose late husband Barry was a farm manager for the Hinchliffs, said: 'Ben was a highly intelligent man who was always courteous, always pleasant, they were a lovely family. 'He always had a smile on his face, was always very friendly which is why all this has come as a huge shock. In short he was a lovely man.' 'Where his heart lay': Mr Hinchliff left his job in London to take over his family's Nether Mill Farm in Yorkshire . A family member, who did not want to be named, added: 'With his father dying and the death of his brother we seemed to have drifted apart. 'If I saw him locally we'd stop and talk. It's a personal tragedy and I don't want to say anything that would upset the rest of the family. I think they have had enough grief.' A statement on the website of his former chambers said: 'Chambers is very sad to report the tragically early death of Ben Hinchliff, who was a tenant in these chambers between 1993 and 2002, when he left a busy and successful junior practice to run the family farm in Yorkshire where his heart truly lay. 'He will be remembered as a wonderful companion who brought warmth and colour to the lives of many. He will be enormously missed.' An inquest was opened and adjourned in Sheffield on Tuesday. A service of thanksgiving will be held at St. John's Church, Penistone on Tuesday.","Ben Hinchliff, 46, was found in an outbuilding on his family farm in Yorkshire .

Manipulative: Robert Louis Rosseau's 'secret society' scam was exposed when he tried to recruit a third underage girl . A 41-year-old former Bible teacher who sexually assaulted two teenage students after luring them through a 'secret society' based on the occult, Christianity and Freemasonary has been sentenced to 12 years jail. Robert Louis Rosseau, who taught eighth graders at the Christian Academy of San Antonio, reached a plea agreement last month over the aggravated assault of two underage girls. 'I am not a monster. I do accept full responsibility. I offer no excuses,' he told the court during his sentencing yesterday, according to Fox 29. 'I think it [the assault] is something that's going to hurt them for the rest of their lives.' Rosseau received deferred adjudication probation for two additional counts of sexual assault of a child, a second-degree felony that carries a punishment of up to 20 years in prison. According to court documents, . the 'secret society' was revealed in October 2009 when Rosseau tried to recruit a . third girl into the group. But when she balked at the offer and tried to reveal the secret society to students at another school, the group's two existing 'members' attacked her. mySanAntonio.com reported police were called to the school. That's when the girl told authorities that Rosseau was trying to enlist her in the group and accused him of having sex with the other two teens, according to an arrest affidavit. Troubling: Former teacher Robert Louis Rosseau, 41, was sentenced on Thursday to two concurrent 12-year prison terms for having sex with two underage female students after luring them into his 'secret society' based on magic . The girl said the other teens told . her that Rosseau had seen both of them nude and also told her 'this was a . part of the trust that was needed for the 'order' to operate'. The . girl told police Rosseau talked to her for about an hour at Medina . Lake vacation home, explaining the 'society' was based on Christianity, the occult, magic . and Freemasonry', according to Chron. Rosseau . told her he was a '38th degree mason, and he needed to add a third . person into the 'society'.' Two weeks later, one of the two members of the group told her parents Rosseau had been sexually assaulting her since January 9. Educator: Robert Louis Rosseau taught Bible classes to eighth graders at the Christian Academy of San Antonio (pictured) She said the other teen, who refused to talk to police, persuaded her to join the society which was 'geared to help mankind'. Police said Rosseau would read Bible passages to the girls while sexually assaulting them. In later interviews with police, the other girls told officers they had smoked marijuana and salvia from a pipe as part of the society's rituals. Meanwhile, a relative of one of the victims said the girls had been given a 'life sentence' because of Rosseau's actions.

A man who beat eight family members to death in a cramped mobile home in Brunswick, Georgia, was convicted of murder yesterday. Guy Heinze Jr, killed his father and seven others, aged between 15 and 45, in a fight over prescription pills in August 2009. Defense attorneys had tried to argue that it would have been impossible for the 26-year-old to have beaten to death so many people without someone getting away, but the jury ruled he was guilty. Guilty: Guy Heinze Jr has been convicted of killing eight family members in a mobile home . When the verdict was read out, Heinze's younger brother Tyler ran cursing from the courtroom, saying: 'This ain't right! This ain't justice!. You know Guy can't have done this [expletive].' Heinze was spared the death penalty in a deal to avoid a hung jury, meaning he will be sentenced to life in prison. A judge will decide at a later date whether he will be eligible for parole. 'We knew the biggest challenge we were going to have was to convince them one person did this,' Glynn County Police Chief Matt Doering, whose officers investigated the killings, said. He added that four years later he was still convinced that Heinze had acted alone. Prosecutors said Heinze had been smoking crack on the night of the murders. Each of the victims died from multiple crushing blows to the head from what police believe was a shotgun barrel, though the murder weapon was never found. Despair: Heinze's younger brother Tyler wept as the jury read their verdict . Deal: Heinze, pictured with attorney Jerry Word, avoided the death penalty but will be sentenced to life . Although the attack happened in the middle of the night, and most of the victims were found in bed, defense attorneys argued a single assailant couldn't possibly have inflicted such carnage. They insisted that police ignored evidence and alternate suspects in a rush to accuse him. During three days of deliberations, it looked like the jury could go either way in the case, or possibly be unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The jury foreman reported on Thursday afternoon, during the second day of deliberations, that jurors were deadlocked nine to three. Brutal: Heinze was arrested six days after his victims were found beaten to death . Glynn County Superior Court Judge Stephen Scarlett asked them to keep trying. On Friday morning, the judge announced one of the 12 jurors had been excused and would be replaced with one of three alternates who had also sat through the full week of testimony. They came back with a verdict within four hours. After it was read, Judge Scarlett informed the jury that the death penalty had been taken off the table and therefore their service was done. Prosecutor John B. Johnson told reporters dropping the death penalty had been necessary to get Heinze's defense team to agree to let the judge dismiss a particular juror because of 'a situation' that contributed to the deadlock. He said neither side wanted a mistrial, which would have meant trying Heinze again with a new jury within a few months. 'It was done to get a verdict. That was the biggest hang-up both sides had,' he said. Mr Johnson declined to say which juror was dismissed or why. The jury had been sequestered at a hotel, with no access to TVs, computers or cellphones and under constant watch by deputies, since the trial began on October 15. During the trial last week, Deputy Rocky Mortoriet reported to the judge that one juror had been talking about the case against the judge's orders. Mr Mortoriet said he overheard the juror say while escorting him to the gym: 'There is no way I can convict this gentleman.' Mr Heinze's lead defense attorney, Newell Hamilton Jr, declined to comment as he left the courthouse on Friday. Four years ago, Heinze told police he found the victims' bodies after returning from a night out. Crime scene: Most of the victims were found bludgeoned in their beds at this trailer park . Victims: Heinze's victims included his father, Guy Sr, left, and 15-year-old Michelle Toler, right . Family: Russell Toler Sr and his son Michael, who was 19 on the night of the murders . Beaten: Joseph West and girlfriend Chrissy Toler were also killed. Chrissy's three-year-old son survived . Attack: Russell Toler Jr, 20, and Brenda Falagan, 49, were also among the victims killed by Heinze . During the frantic 911 call, Heinze cried: 'My whole family is dead!' Six days later, investigators charged him with murder. The victims included Heinze's father, Guy Heinze Sr, 45; Rusty Toler Sr, 44; Chrissy Toler, 22; Russell D. Toler Jr, 20; Michael Toler, 19; and Michelle Toler, 15. Brenda Gail Falagan, 49, and Joseph L. West, the 30-year-old boyfriend of Chrissy Toler, were also killed. Miss Toler's three-year-old son, Byron Jimerson Jr, was the sole survivor but suffered severe head injuries. Heinze told police his father moved in with Toler's family when they were teenagers. The suspect said he considered Rusty Toler Sr. to be his uncle, and his children cousins.","Guy Heinze bludgeoned to death victims aged between 15 and 45 .

But they said they hoped 'fans everywhere will join us in wishing John and his family all the best.' Band spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg did not specify what type of cancer McVie is being treated for and it is not known how serious his condition is . United: Band members Mick Fleetwood, Stevie Nicks and Lindsay Buckingham said in a statement they were sorry to cancel the 14 show dates but that John, far left, and his treatment came first . Fleetwood Mac recently finished a . European tour which included packed out performances in London where they were joined by former members Peter Green and McVie's ex wife Christine McVie. The New Zealand and Australia shows were similarly eagerly anticipated and scheduled to run until Dec 7. The British-American band were formed in 1967 in London and Stevie Nicks and then boyfriend Lindsey Buckingham joined the line up in 1975. Wished the best: Bandmates said they hoped fans would join them in wishing McVie all the best as he undergoes treatment . Their album Rumours sold 40million and topped the U.S. chart for seven months - until Michael Jackson released Thriller it was the best-selling album of all time. But their stardom was blighted by drink and drug-fuelled excesses and tragedy. Former guitarist Danny Kirvan became and alcholic by the age of 22, developed mental health problems after he was sacked from the band for his increasingly erratic behaviour, and eventually became homeless on the streets of London. In 2012 band member Bob Welch, 66, was found dead by his wife after writing a suicide note and shooting himself in the chest. He had had spinal surgery three months previously and been told by doctors that he would not regain the use of his legs - he opted to kill himself rather than become a 'burden' to his wife Wendy. And sadly though the band's longevity has led to the release of classics such as Don’t Stop, Little Lies and Go Your Own Way the infighting, partner-swapping and drug-taking of the Fleetwood 'family' has rarely been out of the headlines. And the phenomena which Lindsey Buckingham dubbed 'The Curse of the Fleetwood Mac Guitarist’ started back in the late Sixties. Indeed Welch's tragic death was preceded by another former Fleetwood guitarist just six months earlier when Bob Weston was found dead in his bed in his London flat from a haemorrhage aged just 64. Peter Green founded Fleetwood Mac as a blues band in London in 1967 but by the time the band released its fourth album he had become dependent on LSD. He also he grew a beard, began to wear robes and a crucifix and told the band’s manager he was Jesus. He left the band in 1970 after rowing with drummer Mick Fleetwood who refused his request to donate all their royalties to charity following a drug-induced vision he had of an angel. He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered financial problems which led to him working as a hospital porter and even a grave digger. Still drawing the crowds: After a staggering 15 different changes the reunited Fleetwood Mac remain popular across the generations and played to sold out crowds at the O2 arena London last month . Way back when: Fleetwood pictured in 1982, left to right Lindsay Buckingham, Christine McVie, Mick Fleetwood, Steve Nicks and John McVie . In 1977, police surrounded his house and he was arrested for threatening the band’s accountant, David Simmons, with a shotgun. Bizarrely, the reason Green gave was that he was furious because Simmons kept sending him royalty cheques. Another notoriously wild founder member Jeremy Spencer took a turn for the worse during a tour if the US in 1971 after taking the drug mescaline. He later joined the Children of God, a sinister cult which used sex  to ‘show God’s love’ and win converts and refused to perform with the band again. After an astonishing 15 different personnel line-ups the bands recent reunion tours and the healing of old wounds appeared to have brought them success again prior to the news of McVie's diagnosis. The band is still believed to be scheduled to perform in Las Vegas on . Dec 30 but no announcement has yet been made about whether this will take place.","14 tour dates cancelled .

I’m in the rudest cafe in the UK. It is called Temporary Measure, in Keswick. It’s pouring, and cold, I’m hungry, and there are lots of walkers afoot in fluorescent waterproofs. Therefore, I’m not in a forgiving mood. The proprietors, John Sellers, 24, and his sister, Emma Smalley, 33, made headlines last week because of reviews posted on TripAdvisor complaining of ‘hostile’ staff and an ‘unwelcoming’ attitude. They were on the TV news, accused of throwing forks at customers, and were being compared to Basil Fawlty at his most dictatorial. The cafe is small, with vintage Lloyd Loom chairs, prints on the wall and lots of balls of wool. My friend sat down, and I went up to order. ‘Do you have scones?’ I asked the newly notorious Emma. She smiled. She looked me in the eye. ‘Yes, we do!’ ‘Ah, but do they have dried fruit in them?’ ‘Yes, but we could take them out? I have tweezers!’ ‘No, that’s OK. Can I have coffee with almond milk?’ ‘Of course!’ This was too much. Like finding out that escaped terror suspect Mohammed Mohamed (what unimaginative parents!) wore a burqa because he really wants a sex change and to  make pots. Unlike in Costa Coffee, where they take your money before they have even begun to steam the non-organic milk for your latte, I was allowed to take my coffee and tea on trust. When I went up to pay later, even though I was below the minimum card spend of £10, Emma decided to waive the rule, and thus avoid me having to make a wet trudge to the cashpoint. She didn’t even ask whether I had a Nectar card! I asked why she and her brother have been so demonised. ‘John is a quiet lad,’ she said. ‘I haven’t really thrown a fork. I was joking. And when I said that we in the North have a healthy respect for a good old-fashioned surly disposition, I didn’t expect it to go viral. The quirky cafe in Keswick, which according to Liz Jones, is a delight . ‘The Sunday Telegraph came in today, and I told them, “People are not allowed to say anything these days. You say one thing out of turn, that’s meant to be a joke, and you are vilified.” ’ This ‘trial by the people’, where anyone is allowed to trash your reputation online, is the opposite of democracy: It’s not free speech, it is conviction and sentencing by the malevolent. I’m reminded of the brilliant film The Lives Of Others, where East German thought police monitored your every move. I’m getting a bit tired of this. Take bloggers. I was at a fashion event last week and met many, many 20-something bloggers: over-confident young women with no training, who thrust business cards into my hand. How on earth do you earn a living, I asked one. ‘Oh, we are paid by brands to mention their products, or tweet photos of them.’ So, the internet has become home to the worst sort of journalism: PRs posing as critics. No delineation between advert and editorial. What staggers me is that these young women, and the people who post negative reviews about a family-run cafe, have no self-doubt. No humility. So, everyone is afraid, which is why you get columns that don’t stick up for factory-farmed animals, in case the author is deemed to be anti poor people. We professional writers are afraid not of letting down those without a voice, but of inflaming the vocal and the outraged and the organised: mums, for example. Immigrants. It’s all currying favour, like the outraged woman writing last week about how expensive and elitist M&S is for selling an £85 coat. She would never tell you that she lives in a vicarage and has staff, a rich husband and loads of money in the bank: that would spoil the populist conceit. I wish Emma from Keswick had indeed thrown a fork at a difficult customer who was already penning a post on her iPad Air. Liz Jones complained to Natwest and said she was leaving the bank after nearly 40 years . Liz Jones used to love Italian carbonated fizzy water San Pellegrino . After I criticised Lady Gaga last week . for wearing a bikini on TV before the watershed, I received a poo . (human? dog? badger?) in the post; you have to laugh because I had to . sign for it. The world is being ruled by the loudest, not the smartest. And for the record, the cafe in Keswick is a delight. After I complained about the service at NatWest (I didn’t name my personal banking manager, mainly because his name is too long – 18 characters – and heinously difficult to spell, but also because I didn’t want to get him fired), and said I was leaving the bank after nearly 40 years, I got a letter from him, with a laminated photograph. A photograph! And yet NatWest wrote to me to say they will no longer be writing to tell me if something has bounced. I used to love San Pellegrino fizzy water because it doesn’t give you a cold shower when you unscrew it, and it’s not salty. Now, though, the bottle says: ‘Continue the story on Facebook.’ Bam! Six hundred years of sophistication dead in the water.","Liz Jones visits Temporary Measures in Keswick, the 'rudest cafe in the UK'

Iranian officials hanged 16 'rebels' in revenge for the deaths of 14 guards in clashes near the border with Pakistan. The executions took place on Saturday, hours after the rebels ambushed the border guards near the town of Saravan in southeast Iran. State TV said that rebels had crossed the border from Pakistan and fled back there after the clash. Boarder guards on patrol: 14 were killed by 'rebels' according to reports from sources inside the country . The border is easily accessible which makes the area popular with a number of 'rebel' groups according to Fars Agency. In the past drug smugglers have ambushed Iranian troops in the mountainous area, which straddles a major transit route linking Afghanistan to Europe and the Persian Gulf. Ethnic Baluch armed groups also operate there, but have not been active recently. The clashes took place in Saravan, which is close to the Iranian border with Pakistan and patrolled by guards . The daughter of Mir Hossein Mousavi (pictured), who has been under house arrest since early 2011, has accused a guard of assaulting her after a visit . The report does not mention a trial for the hanged men, suggesting that sentenced prisoners had their execution dates moved forward after the clashes. The state news agency IRNA described the attackers as 'bandits', and said authorities were investigating whether the attackers were drug smugglers or an armed opposition group. Meanwhile an Iranian official said that authorities would investigate claims that the daughter of detained opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi was assaulted by a female guard when she went to visit him. IRNA quoted an unnamed security official as saying that the Intelligence Ministry, which supervises the detentions of the elder Mousavi and his wife, will investigate any failures or fault by the guard. However, the official said Mousavi's daughter was at fault in the incident, claiming that she insulted and attacked the guard. The opposition website reported the abuse allegations, by Nargess Mousavi. She said the guard demanded that she and her sister be strip searched after visiting her parents, who have been under house arrest since early 2011. On Friday Nargess Mousavi claims the guard struck her in the head and bit her on the wrist after she refused to be searched. Her parents, and fellow opposition figure Mahdi Karroubi, were placed under house arrest after leading protests in 2009 over the disputed re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.","'Rebels' from unspecified group clashed with guards according to source .

At first glance £1.7million appears a low asking price for a Mediterranean island complete with woodland, private beaches and its own monastery. But the piece of land has been on the market for three years and despite cutting the asking price in half, the owners haven't even had a viewing. That is because this is the haunted island of Daksa, Croatia, where 48 people accused of being Nazi sympathisers were brutally executed in 1944. Costing just £1.7million, this island may look like a tempting buy, but beware: this is the site where 48 people were massacred at the end of WW2, and the locals say it's haunted by their ghosts looking for justice . Legend has it that spirits of the dead men haunt the island, demanding justice against those responsible . Deserted: Even the owners of the island near popular tourist spots do not live on it - and few tourists visit . On October 24th, almost exactly 69 years ago, Yugoslav partisans celebrated their victory over the Nazis by rounding up anyone they thought corroborated with the enemy, including the village priest and mayor, Petar Perica. The 'guilty' were then rowed out to the island where they were gunned down in cold blood and left unburied. The locals were told that the same fate awaited them if they intervened, so the corpses remained uncovered for decades and it wasn't until recent years that they were finally laid to rest. The victims were gunned down on cold blood and then left unburied on the island for decades . The 48 men accused of sympathising with the Nazis included the town's priest Petar Perica who was also the mayor during German occupation . Legend has it that the spirits of the dead men haunt the island, demanding justice against those responsible. To date, the crime has never been investigated. Nila Perica Dusilo Florshutz and Franica Dusilo Cavich, the current owners, don't live on the island and even at the height of the tourist season, few ever venture there. The 12 acre island sits in front of Dubrovnik's Gruz port and despite . the members of the Croatian Bishops' Conference visiting the site in . October, 2009,it remains uninhabited. By comparison nearby Dubrovnik, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a popular holiday spot, especially with the rich and famous. The likes of Roman Abramovich, Bernie Ecclestone, Catherine Zeta Jones, Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg have all spent summers there. Marshal Josip Broz Tito was the Communist President of former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia of which Croatia was a part . Croatia did not exist as a country for most of World War Two, when the massacre took place, but was instead part of Yugoslavia. From the end of World War One, when the state was first created, Croatians were unhappy with the union as they felt too much power had been handed to the Serbs. When the Germans invaded after the start of World War Two, they exploited Croatian discontent to get soldiers to mutiny. Once Yugoslavia was under Nazi control, Croatia was made an independent state and the Ustaša were put into power. They began persecuting Serbs, Jews, Roma Gypsies and non-fascist Croatians and between 350,000 and 450,000 victims were killed in massacres and the notorious concentration camp at Jasenovac. After the defeat of Hitler and the Nazis, Croatia became a republic within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Under communist control, many partisans in Yugoslavia felt the need for revenge against their Nazi persecutors and carried out acts of violence against those they held responsible. The massacre at Daksa, in which 48 supposed Nazi sympathisers were killed without trial, is one example. No investigation into the killings has ever taken place, and none of the perpetrators have been identified.","Owners have been trying to sell Daksa, near Dubrovnik, for three years .

French football clubs are threatening to cancel games over the government's plan to impose a 75 per cent super-tax on the country's richest clubs. President Francois Hollande has pledged to push through the levy which will see giant of the country's game like Paris St Germain have to pay out on wages over €1m per year. He told reporters at the European Union summit that 'the law must be the same for all' suggesting stand by the controversial policy, despite the threat of abandoned matches. Big earner: The tax will effect clubs like Paris St Germain who are reported to be paying Zlatan Ibrahimovic, above, 14m euros per year . The law would affect clubs rather than the players as it is geared toward making employers bear the tax burden. It means, for example, that PSG would have to pay a 75 per cent tax on any wages over €1m that they pay to their superstars. Their highest paid player is Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who ears a reported €14m per year. Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of the Union of Professional Football Clubs, says the law would be 'the death of French football' if it is pushed through. His union has threatened to boycott the round of league games scheduled for November 29 through to December 2. Mr Hollande said he was willing to meet the clubs next week to address their difficulties but said he would not budge on their main complaint. Once the plan is voted into law, Mr Hollande said, 'it will be the same for all companies, whatever they may be'. Unmoved: Hollande says he will stand by the levy, despite the threat of strike action and postponed fixtures . The last time games were boycotted in the French league was in 1972, but that was at the initiative of the players. The tax was a campaign promise from Mr Hollande, who pledged to rein in what he said was excessive executive pay out of line with the struggling economy. The tax designed to be in place for two years, starting retroactively this year, and the government expects it to net 420 million euros, around £360 million. It would cost clubs 44 million euros, or £37 million, over that period. Pledge: Hollande sailed to victory in the 2012 general election on the promise of a super tax, which was hugely popular with voter. He has insisted he will see the promise through, saying the law 'must be the same for all' The proposal for such a tax hike was the most memorable promise of his campaign, and polls have shown it was widely popular, even if it generated heavy criticism from business leaders and sports organisations. Mr Hollande's initial proposal called for individuals,in the case of football, the players to pay a 75 per cent tax on all income over a million euros. That tax was rejected by a court this year and the budget before parliament would instead put in place a fifty per cent tax, paid by the employer.","Hollande wants to impose 75 per cent levy on earnings over €1m per year .

Fourteen-month-old Elia-belle Hooker suffered a nasty cut to her face when she and her older brother Jack, two, were playing with a Disney tea set . A mother has urged Argos to rid their shelves of a 'dangerous' toy after her 14-month-old baby girl suffered a nasty cut from the rough plastic edges. Horrified at the cut inflicted on tiny Elia-belle Hooker by the Disney Princess Tea Set, mother Natalie Giugno posted a warning on Facebook to alert other unsuspecting parents. The 30-year-old immediately returned the toy to the Cromer branch of Argos urging managers to remove the product from sale. But when an Argos representative revealed Miss Giugno's was the first complaint he advised they could not take the toy - which carries a warning that it is not suitable for children under the age of three - off the shelves. Miss Giugno said the decision 'shocked and disgusted' her. Argos has since said they have launched an urgent investigation with the toy's suppliers. Determined to do something to ensure other children were not injured she posted a picture of Elia's cut along with the toy and warning on the social networking site. Since it was posted more than 80,000 people around the world have shared the warning, with dozens messaging Miss Giugno to express their thanks. The 30-year-old from Holt in Norfolk said Elia was playing with her older brother Jack when she heard her crying 'all of a sudden'. She said while her youngest children were playing nicely together, pretending to have a tea party,  Jack must have banged into this little sister, accidentally causing the cut. 'I could not believe it, that a toy tea cup could cause such a nasty cut,' she told MailOnline. 'Jack is two years old, he doesn't have the strength to cause such a cut, they were playing so nicely together. 'I picked up the cup and felt the edges - they were really sharp, like unfinished plastic, almost grainy.' Miss Giugno said when she returned the toy to her local branch the staff there were 'brilliant', fetching another model to check if the problem was replicated. She said: 'The manager said they would send the toy off for hazardous analysis and that someone would contact me back. Miss Giugno has called for Argos to remove the Disney Princess Tea Set from its shelves after her 14-month-old daughter Elia-belle suffered a nasty cut to her cheek when she was scratched by the rough plastic edge of one of the tea cups . 'I am a regular customer of Argos and they are generally great. I really thought they would take the toy off the shelves. 'But . I didn't hear anything back for ages and so wrote a letter. Then the . managing director's office contacted me to tell me they were looking . into removing it from sale. 'But . when he called back the next day he said because ours was the only . complaint they would not be removing the toy from the shelves but would . monitor the situation. 'I . was horrified. I couldn't believe it. It could very easily have been . Elia's eye, she could have been left with her vision impaired.' The mother-of-four said she was disappointed when the store firstly offered her a £15 gift card in compensation and then upped their offer to £50. 'It is certainly not about getting any money from them,' she told MailOnline. Jack, two, and his little sister Elia-belle were pretending to have a tea party when the accident happened. Little Elia-belle still has a faint scar underneath her right eye, where the tea cup cut her face . Rachel Hooker, mum to Polly (left) and auntie to Jack (centre) and Elia-belle (right) bought a set each for her daughter and nieces and nephews. She has joined Miss Giugno's calls for Argos to take the toy off the shelves . 'I am worried this could happen to another child and this time the child might not be so lucky. Elia could have really hurt her eye, she could have caused real damage to her sight. 'There will be parents out there buying Christmas presents for their children unaware of the sharp edges. 'The scarring is still there, the next day we had to take her to the doctors because the cut got infected. 'Poor little thing, she only wanted to be a princess and play with the tea set.' Argos said they have launched an urgent investigation with the suppliers of the Disney Princess Tea Set, pictured . Argos told MailOnline they have launched an urgent investigation with the toy's manufacturers. A spokeswoman for the chain said: 'We are very sorry to learn of this . child’s injury and we have made contact with Natalie Marie directly to . discuss her complaint. 'We . can confirm that we have no record of any other reported injuries with . the Disney Princess Tea Set Playset. However, we have launched an urgent . internal investigation with the supplier.' The toy was a present for Mrs Giugno's older daughter Maisie-Rose, six, bought by her sister-in-law Rachel Hooker. The 27-year-old who lives nearby in Sherringham, Norfolk, also bought one of the sets for her 10-month-old daughter Polly. She said: 'I felt absolutely terrible,' she added. 'Natalie called me to see if I had bought one for Polly. 'And . then she told me what had happened to Elia. She just wanted to let me . know, she told me it wasn't my fault but I felt responsible. 'She . has still got a scar, it got infected. But it could have been so much . worse, if it had been one centimeter higher it could have scratched her . eye. 'I felt awful, I know it isn't my fault but I felt responsible. 'It could easily happen to another child and that is why we want to see the product taken off the shelves. 'Whether the toy is not suitable for children under the age of three, it should not have such sharp edges. Children over the age of three have younger siblings. It is not acceptable to leave unfinished plastic on the edges. 'The edges are really sharp, and because there are so many pieces in the set, they are on all the tea cups and plates.' The MailOnline contacted Disney's press office for a comment but has yet to receive a response. Miss Giugno discovered the sharp edges on a tea cup caused her daughter's injury. She said the pieces appear as though the plastic is unfinished . The 30-year-old posted this warning on her Facebook page: 'PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY. Please can you all share this. 'My . daughter was playing with this tea set with her brother when my son . playfully hit her in the face with a tea cup that had extremely sharp . edging (small little sharp plastic bits sticking out of the cups).

Almost 150,000 criminals convicted or cautioned last year had committed 15 or more previous offences,  figures revealed last night. The ‘frightening’ re-offending rates mean this group alone have been responsible for  more than two million crimes between them. And shockingly, the number of such career criminals has increased by 14 per cent in just five years. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the figures exposed the abject failure of the criminal justice system to get to grips with repeat offenders and showed the desperate need for action to tackle persistently high reoffending rates. Mr Grayling said the public – and the Government – were ‘fed up with crooks doing their time and going straight back to crime’. The Justice Secretary has proposed radical reforms to the Probation Service aimed at reducing recidivism among hardened criminals. Charities and private firms will be paid ‘by results’ to engage with criminals and help them turn their lives around. But his reforms have faced fierce opposition from unions – who are planning strike action next week – and probation chiefs. Reform: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said plans to privatise the probation service will save taxpayers millions . Last night Mr Grayling said: ‘People should stop and think about what these bleak figures represent – too many devastated victims, too many wasted lives and broken families, and millions in taxpayers’ money squandered. ‘Simply put, the situation is grim and it will only get worse by sitting on our hands and doing nothing. ‘Our reforms will help us put a stop to this, for the first time making it possible for every offender coming out of prison to receive at least 12 months’ support and supervision. ‘And we will only pay for services in full where they are proven to cut reoffending, making sure public money goes further.’ The . previously unseen Ministry of Justice figures show some 148,641 . criminals with 15 or more cautions or convictions to their names . offended again in the year to  March 2013. That total is up 14 per cent in five years, from 130,153 in 2008. This . group are therefore responsible for at least 2.25million crimes – . although the true extent of their criminality will be much higher, as . the figures do not capture how many more crimes than 15 each had . committed. In addition, many will have carried out further offences which went undetected. The . statistics also show that more than half a million offenders with at . least one previous conviction or caution committed a further crime in . the same period. That includes 95 per cent of those given short jail sentences of less than 12 months. Under pressure: The Goverment is being urged to suspend plans to overhaul the probation service. Probation trusts have said the plans pose a risk to public safety while the probation officers union is planning to strike . In addition, more than 350,000 of those convicted or cautioned in the same period had served some kind of community sentence. Justice officials said the statistics exposed the ‘frightening scale’ of reoffending. Experts say crime is increasingly committed by a small group of hardened offenders who return to crime again and again. The previously unseen Ministry of Justice figures show some 148,641 criminals with 15 or more cautions or convictions to their names offended again in the year to March 2013 . Peter . Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, . said: ‘These are appalling figures. Thugs are going through a revolving . door of probation and soft justice and then reoffending time and again. ‘We . need to do far more of what works – tough prison sentences. Locking up . serious, repeat offenders cuts crime and protects the public.’ Under . the new reforms Mr Grayling’s department will award contracts worth . £450million to private and voluntary groups who will supervise some . 225,000 low and medium-risk offenders. The . remaining rump of 31,000 high-risk offenders, including  dangerous . violent and sexual  criminals, will remain under State control. Criminals . given short-term jail sentences, who currently are not supervised at . all after their release from jail, will be given at least 12 months . supervision and rehabilitation on release from prison. This ‘Rehabilitation Revolution’ will, it is hoped, make a significant dent in reoffending rates. The . figures expose how reoffending remains persistently high – despite some . recent falls – and  tens of thousands of criminals  continue to offend . after completing community service or probation programmes. Members of the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo) union are due to strike next Tuesday over the policy. And . yesterday the Guardian reported that the chairmen of the Derbyshire, . Leicestershire and Warwickshire probation trusts have told the Justice . Secretary the plans will risk public safety. The . Ministry of Justice has said that more than 700 organisations worldwide . have expressed an interest in carrying out the work, including hundreds . of British firms. In a . letter to the Justice Secretary, Jane Wilson, chairman of the . Leicestershire and Rutland probation trust, said the current timetable . had ‘serious implications for service delivery and therefore increases . the risk to public safety’.","Justice secretary Chris Grayling says public are 'fed up with crooks doing their time and going straight back to crime'

These include rabbits and chickens, and a captivating cat which stares from a painted window. Many of the images were inspired by the history of botany and horticulture. In one window Swedish botanist Carl Linneaus, who was the first person to categorise plants, sits writing with a quill pen. A parrot watches him from an ornate perch and an old fashioned wig sits beside him. Mr Dodd, who was taught by pop art pioneer David Hockney, paints the work, which he says is a homage to the market town's heritage . Mr Dodd adds the finishing touches to the masterpiece, which he says will benefit from being on a wall that stays out of the sun . The finished mural is incredibly detailed and Mr Dodd spent 55 hours up a ladder during the painting process . In another view influential British horticulturalist Gertrude Jekyll reclines in her rocking chair, looking into the secluded garden through the painted curtains. Mr Dodd's mural also features a red Royal Mail letterbox, adding even more colour to the finished work. The artist spent 55 days up a ladder to create images at the property in Eye, Suffolk. He says the stunning finished product is a homage to the heritage of the market town. In another detail from the mural an elderly lady reclines in a rocking chair next to a vase of flowers, while in a second window an intricate vase is displayed . Mr Dodd, 71, who lives in Weston, Suffolk, said: 'It was just a blank, long wall. 'You would not believe what a difference it has made to the space. 'The wall is about 650 square feet so it would not have been feasible to paint the whole thing so we decided to paint parts of it.' He added: 'The mural will also really benefit from being on a wall which is often away from direct sunlight.' Mr Dodd trained at the Royal Academy of Arts in the 1960s and was taught by influential pop art pioneer David Hockney. He now designs and paints murals for a living. The artist has used his skills to work on a number of important projects, including the Pompeiian ceiling decoration in the New Picture Room at Sir John Soane's Museum in London.","Alan Dodd painted the stunning and unusual murals on the side of a friend's home in Eye, Suffolk .

Jailed: Douglas Bailey has been sentenced to five years in prison for killing his wife Hazel . A pensioner who beat his wife to death with his walking stick after a row about the heating has been jailed for five years. Douglas Bailey, 79, was obsessed with money, even though he had tens of thousands of pounds in savings. He clubbed his 82-year-old wife Hazel 22 times around the head and neck and punched her so hard her false teeth fell out. He was furious because she had turned the central heating on when it was only early September, police sources said. It is believed Mrs Bailey had been dead for two days by the time her body was found after the attack last year. The couple’s window cleaner raised the alarm when Bailey answered the door in blood-stained pyjamas, a court heard yesterday. He alerted a neighbour who went round to check up on the couple. At first Bailey lied that his wife was at a friend’s house, but eventually admitted: ‘It’s Hazel. She’s dead. I have killed her.’ The couple had been married for 45 years and did not have any children. They lived in Winsford, Cheshire, in a bungalow Bailey had built himself. The retired joiner, who was later diagnosed as being in the early stages of dementia, looked confused yesterday as a judge said his crime was so serious he had no choice but to send him to prison, despite his age. Home: The killing took place at the Baileys' bungalow in Winsford, Cheshire in September last year . ‘It is a tragedy to see you here at . your age and that your wife of so many years is dead at your hands,’ Judge Elgin Edwards told him. ‘This was a brutal attack on a vulnerable . old lady of nearly 83 years.’ Douglas Bailey, 79, was obsessed with money, even though he had tens of thousands of pounds in savings . The . couple used be ‘well turned out’ and keep their home spotless, Chester . Crown Court was told. In recent years, however, they had been in . declining health and struggled to look after themselves. Mrs . Bailey had sciatica and needed help getting about, but her husband had . shown little sympathy, neighbours later told police. Mrs Bailey had also . been seen with bruises, apparently inflicted by her husband, but police . had not been informed and the ‘proud’ couple had rejected help from . social services. Simon . Medland QC, prosecuting, said Bailey’s concern about the heating was . part of an obsession with saving money. He added: ‘Whilst they had not . much by way of income, they had tens of thousands of pounds in shares, . owned their bungalow outright, which is a valuable, substantial . property, and £68,000 in bank cash.’ Bailey . was in custody for more than a year while experts compiled reports on . his mental health, finally concluding he had been suffering from . dementia. As a result, he pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds . of diminished responsibility. Mr . Medland said the killing would otherwise have been ‘a grave case of . murder, involving the killing of an 82-year-old woman by protracted, . substantial violence’. He . added: ‘She must have known it was her husband inflicting the injuries . on her and it was plain death was far from instantaneous.’ Last night Mrs Bailey’s cousin, Andrew Buckley, said: ‘Hazel was a very kind and devoted wife and certainly didn’t deserve to end her life in this cruel and tragic way.’","Douglas Bailey, 79, attacked his wife Hazel as she was lying in bed .

The Labour party must reopen its inquiry into vote-rigging scandal which exposed union dominance, Alistair Darling said today. The former Chancellor who is leading the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK called for a 'very thorough investigation'. And he stepped up pressure on Labour leader Ed Miliband, insisting the details of the inquiry had to be published to ensure justice is 'seen to be done'. Warning: Former chancellor Alistair Darling said there had to be a 'very thorough investigation' into the alleged attempts to rig the selection of the Labour candidate in Falkirk . Mr Darling is one of the most senior Labour figures to date to call for a new investigation into the Unite union's influence on candidate selection in Falkirk. It comes afterthe whistleblower at the centre of the scandal sensationally rejected claims by Unite that she had withdrawn her story. Mr Darling told the BBC: 'Something has gone very wrong in Falkirk. There needs to be a very thorough investigation. I understand the police are looking at matters now. 'If they proceed, then that is what'll happen but if they don't there needs to be a full inquiry and I am quite clear that the results have to be published because that is the only way in which people will be satisfied that justice is done and been seen to be done.' His dramatic intervention comes after Labour's leader in Scotland Johann Lamont admitted the party's original . investigation into Unite's influence on candidate selection 'wasn't . entirely complete' and should be looked at again. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Alistair Darling is the latest senior Labour figure to blow the whistle on Unite’s shadowy tricks in Falkirk. 'Union bosses up there have been pushing Ed Miliband around: fixing Labour seat-selections, intimidating families and their young children, and signing up people as Labour party members without their knowledge. Embarrassed: Leader of the Scottish Labour party Johann Lamont said the vote-rigging scandal had damaged local party morale. ‘Ed Miliband has been totally silent . about this, ever since he caved in and cancelled Labour’s inquiry. If Ed . Miliband is too weak to stand up to his union paymasters, then he is . too weak to stand up for hardworking people.’ The leader of Labour MSPs and MPs . north of the border also said the long-running row had left people in . Falkirk 'embarrassed' to be members of the party. Whistleblower . Lorraine Kane triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption . when she revealed her family had been signed up to the Labour Party . without their consent. It happened as Unite activists were waging a bitter battle to seize control of the safe Labour seat of Falkirk, where she lives. This led to claims that she and others had been signed up as Labour members without their agreement in a bid by the union to manipulate the candidates’ selection. They allegedly hoped to flood the seat with members who they thought could be persuaded to back Unite’s choice to be the party’s prospective MP. The investigation into Mrs Kane’s . case was dropped suddenly in September, after Unite officials produced . documents stating that she had withdrawn her claims. But, . speaking for the first time, Mrs Kane, 61, told the Mail: ‘I did not . change the testimony. I did not change anything. I did not withdraw . anything.’ She is now demanding to know whether the evidence she gave . was tampered with by Unite. ‘I . want all the emails to see what’s what,’ she said. ‘I haven’t seen . them. This has been going on for months. I don’t know what the emails . are saying. I want to see everything so I know what was said and if . anything was changed from what I said.’ Her statement is entirely at odds with public claims made by the union. It raises the prospect of the shelved Labour investigation now being reopened. Shadowy: The revelations of union practices need to be look at again, Ms Lamont (right) said, in an apparent warning to Labour leader Ed Miliband (left) Ms Lamont said: 'I think we certainly . need to look at that because obviously there is a concern if the . investigation wasn't entirely complete. 'Again, I say these matters are ongoing. We know that some complaints have been given to the police,' she told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme. 'In this process what we want to do . is get beyond the point where people are claiming and counter-claiming . and get to the point where again individual Labour party members are . treated with respect and, more critically, we fight to get a Labour . representative in Falkirk who will stand up properly for the people of . Falkirk.' However Ms Lamont rejected calls to . publish the party's internal report, insisting no political party did so . with its own investigations. 'I . understand how difficult it is to be a Labour party member in Falkirk . now. They have been embarrassed by who was representing them. They are . now frustrated by what was going on. We will work closely with them,' she added. Mrs . Kane’s bombshell claims appear to undermine the grounds on which Labour . leader Ed Miliband closed his investigation into the vote-rigging . allegations. The whistleblower at the centre of the Labour vote-rigging scandal, which saw Karie Murphy (right) become the front-running candidate for the Falkirk seat vacated by Eric Joyce (left), says she has not withdrawn her story . Whistleblower Lorraine Kane, from Falkirk (pictured), Scotland, triggered a major probe into alleged electoral corruption when she revealed her family had been signed up to the Labour Party without their consent . They came as shocking evidence emerged of the practices Labour investigators uncovered at Falkirk. Labour has refused to publish its findings but yesterday leaked extracts of its initial inquiry were published. They suggested that Unite activists . falsified up to 112 membership documents, forging signatures on many, . and ‘coerced’ and ‘badgered’ constituents into signing direct debit . forms. In some cases they even paid the joining fees themselves to get . more members on the books and established a secret system for signifying . those signed up ‘specifically for the selection’. Last night Labour supporters and critics demanded that Mr Miliband publish the full report into the alleged vote-rigging. Only today, Unite leader Len McCluskey said that the 'evidence from the families has been withdrawn' ‘We’ve heard umpteen reports, allegations, suppositions as to what did or did not happen. We can’t tell fact from fiction. We can’t tell what is and is not being spun,’ a local party spokesman said. ‘I want him to publish the report, the constituency wants him to publish the report, everyone I’ve spoken to wants him to publish the report. If errors have been made, then what you do is you get them on the table, you discuss them, you learn from them, and you move on.’ Conservative MP Priti Patel said: ‘These incendiary revelations show the full extent of Unite’s infiltration of the Labour party. But still Ed Miliband refuses to hold a proper inquiry, or to publish Labour’s internal report. This is further evidence that the Unite union tried to dupe Ed Miliband. ‘Yet despite calling it “bad practice”, Ed Miliband backed down in the face of pressure from Unite boss and Labour Party paymaster Len McCluskey. ‘From day one Miliband has shown that he is too weak to stand up to the trade unions. If Ed Miliband was forced into a deal with Unite to avoid bad publicity during this selection, how many other dodgy deals are being struck between Labour and their trade union paymasters?’ The Labour leader’s brother David Miliband said there was ‘no place’ for the style of politics being pursued by some trade unions. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘Ed was right to say that he wants to reform the relationship with the unions. What you call “old politics”, rightly has no place, obviously.’ Mrs Kane wrote to Labour in March demanding to know how what information they had on her family after she discovered four of them had been enlisted as Labour members without signing any forms. Unite activist Stevie Deans, Labour’s Falkirk constituency chairman, was trying to get Karie Murphy – a close friend Mr McCluskey –selected as Labour candidate and allegedly started a recruitment drive. Ed Miliband's brother, David, said there was 'no place' for the style of politics being pursued by some unions . It is claimed that Mr Deans and Miss Murphy signed up people from the area - including the Kanes - without their knowledge. Last night it emerged that Mr Deans will not be seeking re-election as constituency chairman later this month. Linda Gow, who was running against Miss Murphy, acted as the intermediary with the Kanes in their original statements. ‘The statements were then allegedly changed,’ she told the Mail. ‘That’s murky. The Labour Party didn’t, as far as I’m aware, come back to ask the Kanes why they changed their statements, or if they changed their statements.’ After Mrs Kane made her claims, the affair was probed by Labour as well as the police. But Mr Miliband called off the investigation in September, claiming evidence from ‘key witnesses’ had been withdrawn. His decision has come under increasing pressure. Last week emails showed Unite officials had themselves drafted the crucial new statement which exonerated them on Mrs Kane’s behalf. By speaking publicly for the first time, Mrs Kane has fatally undermined Unite’s claims that it has ‘no case to answer’. Unite has also faced furious criticism after the Mail last week revealed its shocking campaigns of bullying and intimidation against more than 60 businesses and the families and friends of bosses. Asked if there will be a new inquiry, a Labour spokesman said: ‘Information has been handed to the police. We think it is wise to let the process take its course.’","Former Chancellor says justice must be done 'and seen to be done'

Smoke rises after a car bomb attack in Sadr City, Baghdad, as a wave of apparently coordinated bombings shook the city this morning . A wave of bombings tore through Baghdad today, killing at least 56 people in a spasm of violence on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the US-led invasion. Most of this morning's attacks involved car bombs targeted on Shiite areas, small restaurants, labourers and bus stops in the Iraqi capital and nearby towns. The attacks show how dangerous and . unstable Iraq remains a decade after the war began - a country where . sectarian violence can explode at any time. The attacks that left 56 dead and more than 200 wounded came ten years to the day after Washington announced the start of the invasion on 19 March 2003. Meanwhile today Iraq's Cabinet decided to postpone upcoming provincial elections in two provinces dominated by the country's minority Sunnis.  Provincial elections are scheduled for April 20. The prime minister's spokesman Ali al-Moussawi said the decision to postpone the elections for up to six months followed requests from the political blocs in the provinces. The two provinces affected, Anbar and Ninevah, have been at the centre of nearly three-month-long protests against Iraq's Shiite-led government. One of the deadliest of this morning's attacks struck close to one of the main gates to the heavily-fortified Green Zone, which houses major government offices and the embassies of several countries, including the United States and Britain. That blast outside a restaurant killed six people, including two soldiers, and wounded more than 15.  Thick black smoke could be seen rising from the area as ambulances raced to the scene. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blasts, but the attacks bore hallmarks of al Qaeda in Iraq.  The terror group favours spectacular, coordinated bombings intended to undermine public confidence in the Shiite-led government. Scroll down for video . This car bomb attack near the gates of the Green Zone which houses both the US and Britain's embassies, left six dead . Police and hospital officials reported most casualties from a car bombing near the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs in Baghdad's eastern Qahira neighborhood at around 10am. That blast killed seven people and wounded 21. The officials provide casualty numbers on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to release the information to journalists. The violence started at around 8am, when a bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in Baghdad's Mashtal neighbourhood, killing four people and wounding 15. Minutes later, two labourers were killed and eight were wounded when a roadside bomb hit the place where they gather every day in an area of New Baghdad. Children inspect a bus destroyed in a car bomb attack in the Shiite stronghold of Sadr City, Baghdad, this morning . In the poor Shiite neighbourhood of Sadr City, a bomb stuck to the underside of a minibus killed three commuters and wounded seven people. Another car bomb exploded in a commercial street in the same area, killing two people and wounding 11, and yet another bomb struck a police patrol in the neighbourhood, killing five people and wounding 13. Hussein Abdul-Khaliq, a government employee who lives in Sadr city, said he heard the explosion and went out to find the minibus on fire. He said: 'We helped take some trapped women and children from outside the burning bus before the arrival of the rescue teams. 'Our clothes were covered with blood as we tried to rescue the trapped people or to move out the bodies. 'Today's attacks are new proof that the politicians and security officials are a huge failure.' Other attacks struck the largely Shiite neighbourhoods of Hussainiyah, Zafarniyah, Shula and Utaifiya, as well as the Sunni district of Tarmiyah. A policeman inspects the wreckage of a car bomb attack in Sadr City, one in a string of attacks that left 56 dead . Just outside the capital, a mortar shell landed near a clinic in the town of Taji, killing two people and wounding five. And about 30 miles south of Baghdad, in Iskandiriyah, a car bomb exploded near a bus stop, killing five people and wounding 20. Tuesday's attacks came a day after insurgents killed nine people, including a bombing by a suicide attacker who killed five when he drove an explosives-laden car into a checkpoint in the central Iraqi town of Balad Ruz. Al Qaeda's Iraq arm, which operates under the name the Islamic State of Iraq, has sought to reassert its presence in recent weeks. Last week, the group claimed responsibility for a highly coordinated attack earlier this month in far western Iraq that killed nine Iraqis and 51 Syrian soldiers who had sought temporary refuge in the country. And on Sunday, Al Qaeda's Iraq branch took responsibility for a brazen and highly coordinated raid on the Justice Ministry in Baghdad last week, which killed at least 24 people.","A string of apparently coordinated blasts left scores dead or injured today .

Bijan Ebrahimi, who was burned to death by two vigilantes who mistook him for a paedophile, could have been better protected by police, said a chief constable . An innocent man who was murdered after being wrongly labelled a paedophile was failed by police, the force involved has admitted. The family of Bijan Ebrahimi have now called for Avon and Somerset Police to face justice over the 44-year-old’s death. Mr Ebrahimi was viciously beaten and then burned to death by vigilantes said to be acting on false rumours which had been started on his estate. The rumours led to police arresting him in front of a crowd of around 20 neighbours chanting ‘Paedo, paedo’. But they released him without charge and sent him home. Mr Ebrahimi was brutally killed two days later. Six police officers involved in the case have all been served notices of gross misconduct, including an inspector, sergeant and PC involved in his detention. Yesterday Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan said: ‘We need to ask, “Why wasn’t that poor man better served by us?” ‘Once all the dust has settled and all the investigations are complete it’s important for all the agencies involved to sit down together and try to understand how we failed that man.’ The force is being investigated by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Lee James (right) has admitted to murder while Steve Norley (left) pleaded guilty to assisting an offender . Capgrave Crescent in Brislington, Bristol, the home of Bijan Ebrahimi who was brutally murdered . In a statement released through their solicitor, the family of Mr Ebrahimi – who was registered disabled and unable to work – said: ‘It should not be forgotten that Bijan had been the victim of hate crimes for a number of years before his death, both due to his race and his physical disability. ‘It was for this reason that the police should have taken especially seriously his calls for help in the days before he was murdered.’ The keen gardener from Iran was reported as a paedophile after he was seen taking photos of local youths vandalising his hanging baskets and potted plants, in order to pass the evidence on to the police. After he was arrested in front of the chanting crowd, officers quickly realised this was entirely false, and took him back to the estate in Bristol where he lived. Two days later Mr Ebrahimi was beaten unconscious and dragged into the street where his body was doused in white spirit and set on fire. Lee James, 24, has admitted murder, while Stephen Norley, 24, has denied murder but admitted assisting his co-accused. Both men, who the court heard had chosen to ‘take the law into their own hands’, will be sentenced next month.

They added: ‘We hope that not only James and Norley will face justice but also all of those who failed to protect Bijan, including the police. ‘We are anxiously awaiting information from the Independent Police Complaints Commission regarding Bijan’s calls for help during the last days of his life. ‘Every day we have to wait for this information makes our lives harder.’ Avon and Somerset’s Police and Crime Commissioner  Sue Mountstevens added: ‘I think it was a terrible, tragic case which is now being investigated. ‘There are many questions that need to be answered, not only of the police but also of the local authorities as well.’ A spokesman for the force said earlier this week: ‘We can categorically state he had not taken any indecent images and that nothing of concern had been found on his computer.’ The spot where Bijan Ebrahimi was dragged unconscious before he was doused in white spirit and set alight.

Chiller Cabinet: Owen Paterson, who was promoted to Environment Secretary in the Cabinet reshuffle, wants to see British desserts outsell foreign imports . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson yesterday urged patriotic diners to help close Britain’s ‘dessert deficit’ by buying more British puddings. Mr Paterson, who was appointed this month with a brief to kick-start the rural economy, said it was time for Britain to ditch fancy foreign dishes. He said diners should swap desserts such as panna cotta, crème brulee and tiramisu for traditional favourites like treacle tart, apple crumble and spotted dick. In an interview with Farmers Weekly he said there was a ‘big job to be done’ in boosting Britain’s food exports and persuading more people in this country to eat British produce. Mr Paterson singled out desserts as an area where there was great scope for ‘import substitution’, if diners could be persuaded to buy British. He said he is particularly alarmed at the . level of dairy-based desserts which are imported from overseas, at a . time when UK farmers are struggling to recover the costs of producing . milk. ‘There is a huge dessert deficit in this country,’ he said.  ‘We have a huge opportunity to replace imported desserts with desserts made here.’ Peter Henderson, chairman of the Gloucestershire-based Pudding Club, which promotes traditional British desserts, welcomed the intervention. ‘I would be delighted if the . Government wants to put its weight behind British puddings. Anything . that promotes British food is a good thing. ‘Promoting British recipes and British products has to be a good thing for our economy - and our tums as well.’ Britain imports twice as much ice cream as it exports, according to official figures, something the minister wants to reverse . The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs does not keep detailed figures on the trade gap in puddings. But officials pointed to the dairy sector as a particular cause for concern. Recent figures reveal that Britain imported 115,000 tonnes of ice-cream last year – more than double the 50,000 exported. Yoghurt imports reached almost 150,000 tonnes – six times the 25,000 sent abroad. This summer British farmers blockaded . milk processing plants in protest at the price their received for milk, . often lower than the 30p per litre it costs to produce. While just two per cent of liquid milk is imported, the level of cheap processed dairy products coming from overseas is much higher. He believes if everyone in Britain bought a dessert made here they would help to reverse the trend, and provide a welcome boost to the farming industry. The Great British Bake Off with Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry has been a uige hit, and reignited interest in old-fashioned desserts . The UK is currently a major net importer of dairy desserts, something the new minister hopes to reverse. Officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are examining ways to persuade shoppers to buy British. It . is thought the success of cookery shows like The Great British Bake Off . will reignite interest in traditional desserts, after a drift towards . lighter puddings like panna cotta and sorbet. Mr Paterson also revealed plans to increase the amount of British food sold abroad, saying there ‘is a big job to be done in exporting. Former farm minister Jim Paice, who was ousted in the reshuffle which saw Mr Paterson promoted to Defra, had been spearheading a drive to sell British pork to China. ‘There is also a real job to be done promoting dairy products, promoting food production and adding value,’ Mr Paterson said. ‘More generally, there is a real job for Defra to get out of people’s hair – to help businesses start up and prosper in all sorts of small ways. But basically to make it simple, to encourage the kaleidoscope of business ideas across the countryside.’","New Environment Secretary Owen Paterson urges Brits to be patriotic with their puddings .

Protesters marched Saturday in Washington, D.C., to protest government surveillance programs revealed this year by Edward Snowden on the 12th anniversary of the law that made them legal. Carrying signs reading: ‘Stop Mass Spying,’ ‘Thank you, Edward Snowden’ and ‘Unplug Big Brother,’ people gathered at the foot of the Capitol to demonstrate against the online surveillance by the National Security Agency. One protester also read a statement released by Mr Snowden prior to the rally. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Stop watching us!: Demonstrators march outside of the U.S. Capitol in Washington during a rally to demand that the U.S. Congress investigate the National Security Agency . Organizers estimated that more than 2,000 attended the demonstration, but Capitol Police said they do not typically provide estimates on the size of demonstrations. The march made for unusual allies, with liberal privacy advocates walking alongside members of the conservative Tea Party movement – both sides oppose what they say is unlawful government spying on Americans. ‘I consider myself a conservative and no conservative wants their government collecting information on them and storing it and using it,’ said protester Michael Greene. ‘Over the past several months, we have learned so much about the abuses [of privacy] that are going on and the complete lack of oversight and the mass surveillance into every detail of our lives,’ demonstrator Jennifer Wynne said. ‘We need to tell Congress that they have to act,’ she added. Though Mr Snowden could not attend the rally in person, he was very much a presence. With his picture and name on signs and placards, as well as his words being read aloud by activist Jesselyn Radack. Here we go: Demonstrators gather at Union Station in Washington for a march to Capitol Hill . A major presence: Edward Snowden wasn't physically at the rally, but he was a very strong presence . Yes we scan: Protesters were angry at the ongoing US surveillance of Americans and those abroad, and want Congress to put an end to it . ‘In the last four months, we’ve learned a lot about our government,’ Ms Radick read from a statement written by Mr Snowden. ‘We’ve learned that the US Intelligence Community secretly built a system of pervasive surveillance.’ 'Today, no telephone in America makes a call without leaving a record with the NSA,’ she continued. ‘Today, no Internet transaction enters or leaves America without passing through the NSA’s hands… this isn’t about red or blue party lines. Neither is it about terrorism.’ The statement explained held surveillance up as the government’s way of wielding power. Calling the actions unconstitutional and blasting the ‘surveillance state,’ Mr Snowden, as read by Ms Radick, called for ‘ordinary people from high schools to high office stand up to oppose a dangerous trend in government.’ ‘We are told that what is unconstitutional is not illegal, but we will not be fooled,’ the statement said. ‘We have not forgotten that the Fourth Amendment in our Bill of Rights prohibits government not only from searching our personal effects without a warrant but from seizing them in the first place,’ it continued. ‘We declare that mass surveillance has no place in this country.’ Growing outrage: The march comes as it has been revealed the US spied on the leaders of over 70 other countries, leading to more distrust of the US around the world . ObamaCam: Protestors lampooned President Barack Obama while relentlessly praising and even reading the words of Mr Snowden . Great weight: Mr Snowden's words, as read aloud by an activist, set the tone for the day . The event was organized by a coalition known as 'Stop Watching Us' that consists of some 100 public advocacy groups and companies, including the American Civil Liberties Union, privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation, Occupy Wall Street NYC and the Libertarian Party. The groups have been urging Congress to reform the legal framework supporting the NSA's secretive online data gathering since Snowden's disclosure of classified information about the programs that are designed to gather intelligence about potential foreign threats. The Obama administration and many lawmakers have defended the NSA programs as crucial in protecting U.S. national security and helping thwart past militant plots. They have also said the programs are carefully overseen by Congress and the courts. Mr Snowden's disclosures have raised concerns that NSA surveillance may span not just foreign, but domestic online and phone communication. 'We are calling on Congress to take immediate action to halt this surveillance and provide a full public accounting of the NSA's and the FBI's data collection programs,' Stop Watching Us said in a letter addressed to members of Congress posted online, calling for a reform of the law known as the Patriot Act.

The mascara is good, very thick and lasts all day and it's good to know that it's helping to condition your lashes whilst you wear it. It's pretty tough to get off though, we recommend using a gentle eye make-up remover like The Body Shop's Camomile Kind Eye remover as it can be quite stubborn. As for the eyeliner, if you have the knack for applying it, it looks great. However, it is very, very black so may be too heavy on some fair-haired ladies.

The Turkish immigrant who 'invented' the doner kebab at his market stall in West Berlin has died at the age of 80. Kadir Nurman, widely credited as inventor of the popular fast food meal, passed away in Berlin. He set up the stall at a train station in 1972 - selling grilled meat and mixed salad inside a flatbread. 'Inventor': Kadir Nurman, who was widely credited as inventor of the doner kebab, has died at the age of 80 . He later claimed to have noticed the increasingly fast pace of city life - believing busy Berliners might like a meal they could eat on the go. The doner kebab, which features juicy meat sliced from a rotating skewer - with all the trimmings and optional chilli or garlic sauce - has since become one of Britain's most reviled food creations. It is now a firm fast food favourite across the world - particularly with late-night revellers and students. Its success even prompted the launch of a doner kebab-flavoured Pot Noodle in 2009. Popular: The doner kebab, which features juicy meat sliced from a rotating skewer, has become one of Britain's most reviled food creations. Above, a mixed doner shawerma kebab . While there have been many other possible 'inventors' of the kebab, Mr Nurman's contribution was recognised by the Association of Turkish Doner Manufacturers in 2011, according to the BBC. The entrepreneur was born in Istanbul, Turkey, before emigrating to Germany in 1960 at the age of 26. Entrepreneurial: Mr Nurman's contribution to the fast food snack was formally recognised in 2011 . As he did not patent his invention, he was not able to profit from the doner kebab's subsequent success. However, in a 2011 interview with German magazine Frankfurter Rundschau, Mr Nurman said he was happy that millions of people across the world ate the fast food meal. He added that the kebab's success meant that thousands of Turkish people could make a living selling it. There are now more than 15,000 doner kebab outlets in Germany - including at least 1,000 in Berlin alone. In Scotland, the kebabs are popular with both late-night drinkers and people looking for a cheap and different meal out - with the doner meat often coated in batter and deep fried. However, despite the popularity of the fast food snack, a study has revealed that it contains 'sky-high' levels of salt, fat and calories. A particularly large and greasy specimen can contain up to 2,000 calories - as many as a woman should eat in a whole day. The average kebab also provides 98 per cent of the daily salt quota and 148 per cent of the daily saturated fat limit for an adult, according to the study, carried out in the UK in 2009. And one in three doner kebabs include meat from several different species of animal - including sheep, cows, chickens and pigs.","Kadir Nurman was widely credited as 'inventor' of the fast food snack .

A French politician has caused outrage by suggesting that Adolf Hitler ‘did not kill enough’ Roma gypsies. In the latest ferocious attack on travellers, MP Gilles Bourdouleix stirred up memories of the Holocaust, when the Nazis sent thousands of gypsies to the gas chambers because Hitler believed them to be sub-human. Mr Bourdouleix, who represents a constituency in the Maine and Loire region of west France, was visiting an illegal Roma camp in the town of Cholet, where he is deputy mayor, when he made the incendiary comments. Holocaust: French MP Gilles Bourdouleix has been accused of saying Hitler did not kill enough Roma gypsies . Surrounded by armed police, Mr Bourdouleix was trying to persuade the new arrivals to move on. But as he began to speak to community leaders, some of the Roma gypsies standing by began to make Nazi salutes in his direction. Mr Bourdouleix was recorded by a local journalist saying: ‘Like what, Hitler didn’t kill enough’. Challenged about his comment by some of the Roma men, Mr Bourdouleix said: ‘You compared me to Hitler, do you think that’s nice?' Mr Bourdouleix then accused the community of incest, saying: ‘The other day, they called me a paedophile, even though half of their children are from fathers and grandfathers.’ Outrage: Roma gypsies mocked Bourdouleix when he turned up with armed police by making Nazi salutes . Crackdown: Last month scores of Roma gypsies were forced out of their camp in Lille by French police . Fabien Leduc, the journalist who recorded Mr Bourdouleix, has since transcribed a word-for-word account of the recoding. Expel: Jean-Louis Borloo is now considering throwing Mr Bourdouleix out of the UDI Party . It has persuaded Jean-Louis Borloo, leader of Mr Bourdouleix’s party, the centre-right UDI, that he should consider expelling his colleague. He said: ‘Whatever the real and unacceptable provocation the deputy mayor of Cholet, Gilles Bourdouleix, was subjected to, nothing justifies the remarks apparently made by him.’ Jean-Christophe Lagarde, the secretary general of the UDI party, meanwhile tweeted: ‘The words of Bourdouleix, even though made in the heat of the moment, were intolerable and incompatible with the values of the UDI.’ Mr Lagarde added: ‘The only possible sanction is his expulsion from the UDI, and this should be adopted by the executive committee next Wednesday.’ Mr Bourdouleix denied any accusations of racism, saying his words were  ‘totally skewed’ and that he intended to take legal action against Mr Leduc ‘and all the media outlets who repeat this false quote’. Mr Bourdouleix said what he really said was: ‘If it was Hitler, he would have killed them all’. French politicians from both Right and Left have launched an onslaught on Roma gypsies in recent years, destroying their camps and deporting them back to countries including Romania and Bulgaria. Despite this, shanty towns regularly spring up around major cities such as Paris and Lyon.","French politician causes outrage after stirring up memories of holocaust .

Divers today recovered what could be more human remains at the site of the wreck of the Costa Concordia, raising hopes the last of the shipping disaster's 32 victims may soon be laid to rest. The cruise liner sank last year in shallow waters off the Italian island of Giglio. It was hauled upright last month in a complicated 19-hour salvage operation. Divers have been combing the ship and surrounding areas for the bodies of Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Indian crew member Russel Rebello since it was judged sufficiently secure for investigation. Human remains were initially discovered during the operation to right the ship in an area previously identified as of major . interest. Results of tests to identify them are still to be announced. The head of Italy's civil protection agency Franco Gabrielli said Thursday that the latest remains are currently undergoing DNA tests.' 'We are waiting for the results of the analysis.' The identification process is expected to take at least a week. Searching: Italian Fire Brigade Divers meet for an operational briefing to search for Costa Concordia victims . Missing: The search resumes for the missing bodies of Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Russel Rebello, whose bodies were never found after the Costa Concordia capsized on January 13 . Last month, the families of the two remaining missing . victims arrived on the island of Giglio in the hope their loved . ones' remains would be found.

It’s important to have a . place to cry and a place to pray.’ As it was: The Costa Concordia lay on its side for more than a year before rescuers were able to move it . Salvage: The capsized cruise liner was brought pulled from the sea bed into its original floating position, shown here in three stages, during the a lengthy 'parbuckling' operation outside Giglio harbour in September. Righted: Crews have been able to go to work on the crippled cruise ship after the 19-hour operation . Moving in: Overseen by Italian police, divers have now been able to access the part of the seabed where the ship once lay . Captain Francesco Schettino, pictured leaving a court in Grosseto earlier this week, is charged with manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship before all aboard were evacuated . Mrs Trecarichi, the last remaining missing passenger, was on the cruise to celebrate . her 50th birthday with her friend Luisa, her daughter Stefania and her . daughter’s friend. The two young people survived. As . the ship sank, she rang her husband, but in a heartbreaking . twist of fate he failed to answer, having gone to bed early. She had not got onto a lifeboat with her daughter because she had returned to her cabin to get a warm jacket. The Sicilian mother-of-one then rang a friend, saying that Stefania was on a boat and she was waiting for the next one. The phone call was then interrupted by a shout: 'My God my God we are sliding into the water.' Her grieving husband Elio Vincenzi spoke last month of his hope that he will finally be able to bring his wife home. He said: ‘I want to bring her home back to Sicily, her homeland. I think only of her.' The successful parbuckling operation had given him new hope of closure, he said. Stefania, . 18, is now competing in the Miss Italia beauty pageant in memory of . her mother, who had always encouraged her to enter.

The captain of the Costa Concordia exclaimed, 'Let's go do this f***ing Giglio thing,' moments before crashing the cruise ship off the coast of Giglio Island, a court heard today. The ship's navigator, Simone Canessa, testified that captain Francesco Schettino ordered him to re-set course to pass near the island in order to carry out 'the bow', a greeting to someone on the shore. The revelation came on the day that the remains of one of the two remaining missing people from the ship were found by divers searching the submerged wreck. On trial: Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia, pictured outside court in Grosseto yesterday . The captain is on trial in the town of Grosseto over claims he acted recklessly in steering the Concordia on to the rocks and then abandoned ship in dereliction of his duties. 32 passengers died in the disaster in January last year, which occurred shortly after the ship left the port of Civitavecchia for a seven-day cruise around the western Mediterranean. According to Gazzetta del Sud, Mr Canessa said today: 'Before leaving Civitavecchia, Commander Schettino told me to wait on the bridge. 'Then he told me to programme a modification of the route Civitiavecchia to Savona to pass next to Giglio.' Disaster: The wreck of the Concordia is currently being removed from the sea off the coast of Giglio Island . Prosecutor Alessandro Leopizzi also played the court an audio recording of the conversation between Schettino and the navigator. 'Let's go by Giglio,' the captain said. 'Let's do this bow to Giglio. Let's go do this f***ing Giglio thing.' Mr Canessa said he did not know why Schettino wanted to do 'the bow' to Giglio, but had heard that he wanted to greet some residents of the island. He added that in 2005, he was working on another ship which carried out 'the bow' to Giglio safely, passing just 100 metres from shore at a speed of five knots. On that occasion, the captain of the . ship warned all relevant authorities that he was planning to sail . unusually close to the island. Devastating: 32 people died when the Concordia ran aground in January last year . Today officials in charge of clearing the wreckage of the Concordia announced that they had found remains believed to belong to Russel Rebello, an Indian waiter who went missing following the disaster. After the ship was finally pulled upright last month, divers have been able to search certain parts of the ship for the first time, allowing them to locate the body. If the remains are confirmed to be those of Mr Rebello, the only victim whose body has not been recovered will be Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi. Schettino faces up to 20 years in prison if he is convicted of the charges, which include manslaughter. The trial continues.","Simone Canessa says Francesco Schettino ordered him to change course .

Hero: Nicholas Oresko, a World War ll Medal of Honor recipient, has died in hospital aged 96 . A World War II veteran and the nation's oldest living Medal of Honor recipient has died aged 96. Nicholas Oresko, an Army master sergeant who was badly wounded when he single-handedly took out two enemy bunkers during the Battle of the Bulge in 1945, died on Friday night at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. Oresko had been hospitalized after injuring himself in a fall at an assisted living center in Cresskill. He died of complications from surgery for a broken right femur. A November 2011 article on the Department of Defense website described Oresko as the oldest living Medal of Honor recipient. The medal is the nation's highest military honor, awarded by Congress for risk of life in combat beyond the call of duty. A Bayonne native, Oresko received the Medal of Honor from President Harry Truman on October 30, 1945. At 28, Oresko was the platoon leader when automatic fire pinned down his unit. Realizing . a machine gun in a nearby bunker needed to be eliminated, Oresko moved . out alone in the morning darkness, braving bullets that zipped about . him, until he was close enough to throw a grenade into the German . bunker. He rushed the bunker and used his M-1 rifle to kill the soldiers who survived the grenade blast.

Despite being weak from loss of blood, Oresko refused to be evacuated until he was assured that the mission was accomplished. His actions on January 23, 1945, were credited with preventing numerous American casualties and were praised as key to the Allies' victory. The Bergen Record reported that several veterans and young members of various branches of the military stayed with Oresko in his final days after a friend wrote about his health problems on a Facebook page and noted that Oresko had no immediate family still living.

A 62-year-old woman died in a house fire caused by overloading a double socket with at least 12 electrical items. Spinster Avril Topham lived in the lounge with her beloved Jack Russell dog because she couldn’t manage the stairs of her terraced house. Fire chiefs yesterday issued a warning about the dangers of overloading plugs after an investigating revealed nine pieces of electrical equipment and three separate four-point extension adaptors had been linked to a double wall socket. Scene: Avril Topham lived in the lounge with her beloved Jack Russell dog because she couldn¿t manage the stairs of her terraced house . Miss Topham, who lived in the house all her life, had three table lamps, two television sets, a coffee heater, hand-held vacuum, a convector heater and a melted plastic appliance that could not be identified all connected up. There were also three different four-point adaptors connected to the same double socket and a fourth - which was badly burnt and found nearby - may also have been plugged in. Miss Topham probably had at least double the amount of items that were safe to use. The West Yorkshire Fire Service said the blaze was caused by a combination of overloading and a damaged extension cable. ‘We would urge people to make sure they are not overloading their sockets and get old extension cables checked,’ said station manager Richard Hagger. Neighbours in Brownhill Crescent, Leeds, called 999 after being alerted by a fire alarm going off in the early hours. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus broke into the property and rescued Miss Topham, but she died in hospital. Her dog Minnie also died in the blaze. Next door neighbour Mebrahtu Gebrelibanos said: ‘I could hear Avril banging on her front door shouting for help and I could smell smoke so I ran back inside and called 999. ‘I tried to open the door but it was locked from the inside. She was trapped in the house and by the time the fire service broke the door down it was sadly too late. She was a very good neighbour. God bless her.’ Miss Topham lived with her father until his death a few years ago. Neighbours helped her with shopping and cooked her meals due to her health problems. Neighbour Sarah Grainger, 24, said: ‘She struggled to walk and was living in the living room of her house as she couldn’t get up the stairs. ‘I think she was waiting to be rehomed by the council to a flat without stairs because she couldn’t manage in her house.’","Avril Topham lived in the lounge because she couldn't manage the stairs .

The eerie ghost-like shape of the ‘coldest place in the universe’ has been revealed by astronomers. With a crisp temperature of -272°C, the Boomerang Nebula it is even colder than the -270°C background glow from the Big Bang. Earlier observations of the nebula showed it to be lopsided, which is how it got its name. The Hubble Space Telescope later revealed a bow-tie-like structure. The Boomerang Nebula has revealed its true shape. The background blue structure, as seen in visible light with the Hubble Telescope, shows a double-lobe shape with a narrow central region. ALMA's resolution reveals the nebula's more elongated shape, as seen in red . The new image, taken using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile, reveals how Hubble may have been wrong. According to ALMA astronomers, and the twin lobes seen in Hubble image may in fact be a trick of the light. The finding could help scientists better understand how a star such as our sun will behave in its final death throes. ‘What seemed like a double lobe, or “boomerang” shape, from Earth-based optical telescopes, is actually a much broader structure that is expanding rapidly into space,’ said Raghvendra Sahai, a researcher and principal scientist at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. The Hubble Space Telescope caught the Boomerang Nebula in these early images. According to ALMA astronomers, the twin lobes seen in this Hubble image may in fact be a trick of the light . The Boomerang Nebula is located about 5,000 light-years away in the constellation Centaurus. It is a relatively young example of an object known as a planetary nebula, which, contrary to their name, are the end-of-life phases of stars like our sun. What remains at their centres are white dwarf stars, which emit intense ultraviolet radiation that causes the gas in the nebulae to glow with brilliant colours. The Boomerang is a pre-planetary nebula, representing the stage in a star's life immediately preceding the planetary nebula phase. Over the last 1,500 years, nearly one and a half times the mass of our Sun has been lost by the central star of the Boomerang Nebula in an ejection process known as a bipolar outflow. At this stage, the nebula is seen by starlight reflecting off its dust grains. The new image was taken using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (pictured) in Chile. ALMA is an international partnership between Europe, the United States, Canada, East Asia and the Republic of Chile . The Boomerang Nebula is a young planetary nebula and the coldest object found in the Universe so far. With a crisp temperature of -272°C, the Boomerang Nebula it is even colder than the -270°C background glow from the Big Bang. Keith Taylor and Mike Scarrott called it the Boomerang Nebula in 1980 after observing it with a large ground-based telescope in Australia. The -272°C temperature was calculated by seeing how it absorbed the cosmic microwave background radiation . The Boomerang is a pre-planetary nebula, representing the stage in a star's life immediately preceding the planetary nebula phase. Over the last 1,500 years, nearly one and a half times the mass of our Sun has been lost by the central star of the Boomerang Nebula. The outflow of gas from this particular star is expanding rapidly and cooling itself in the process. The -272°C temperature was calculated by seeing how it absorbed the cosmic microwave background radiation. ‘When astronomers looked at this object in 2003 with Hubble, they saw a very classic “hourglass” shape,’ said Dr Sahai. ‘Many planetary nebulae have this same double-lobe appearance, which is the result of streams of high-speed gas being jettisoned from the star. ‘The jets then excavate holes in a surrounding cloud of gas that was ejected by the star even earlier in its lifetime as a red giant.’ ALMA's unprecedented resolution revealed a more elongated cloud of cold gas that is roughly round. The researchers also discovered a dense lane of millimetre-sized dust grains surrounding the star, which explains why this outer cloud has an hourglass shape in visible light. Hubble took this image in 1998. It shows faint arcs and ghostly filaments embedded within the diffuse gas of the nebula's smooth 'bow tie' lobes. The image was exposed for 1000 seconds through a green-yellow filter. The light in the image comes from starlight from the central star reflected by dust particles . The dust grains have created a mask that shades a portion of the central star and allows its light to leak out only in narrow but opposite directions into the cloud, giving it an hourglass appearance. The new research also indicated that the outer fringes of the nebula are beginning to warm, even though they are still slightly colder than the cosmic microwave background. This warming may be due to the photoelectric effect - an effect first proposed by Einstein in which light is absorbed by solid material, which then re-emits electrons. ‘This is important for the understanding of how stars die and become planetary nebulae,’ said Dr Sahai. ‘Using ALMA, we were quite literally and figuratively able to shed new light on the death throes of a sun-like star.’","Eerie glow of the Boomerang Nebula was shown by the ALMA telescope .

The father of an undercover police officer gunned down in the line of duty says he wishes to look his son's killer in the eye before he is executed. Gang member Ronell Wilson executed Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin - both fathers - in Staten Island in 2003. Now Andrews' 73 year old father, Rodney Andrews Sr, has spoken of his desire to witness the execution of the man who took his son away from him, despite the years of appeals that will now follow. Conviction: Ronell Wilson has been sentenced to death for the second time after his first sentence was overturned in an appeals court . He said; 'Ronell might outlive me. 'I hope I’m here till I’m a hundred. I’d like to be there and get eye contact with him [Wilson] before they put him to sleep. 'I want him to see that I’m glad he’s gone. He took two people’s lives and doesn’t deserve to be here,' he told the New York Daily News. Wilson, 31, was convicted in 2007 and . sentenced to death for the murder of Andrews and his partner, James . Nemorin, as they worked undercover in a gun buy-and-bust operation. Ronell Wilson was first handed the death sentence in 2007, but an appeal court later overruled it. However, . the jury at his retrial took just over four hours to decide that the . man responsible should be sentenced to death. He will be sentenced today. Prosecutors argued that the 31-year-old . was 'thriving' in the prison environment, where he had fathered a child . with one of his prison guards. They claimed that Wilson, who had poked . his tongue out at his victims' families when he was first sentenced to . death, should not be allowed to live out his days as a jailhouse . celebrity. Wilson was said to have shown a lack of remorse for his crimes, the prosecutors argued. 'When a cold killer executes two heroes for greed and glory and dumps their bodies on the street, the death penalty is perfectly justified ... We ask that you impose the ultimate punishment for the ultimate crime,' the court was told in closing arguments, according to SI Live. Victims: New York cops James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, were working undercover when they died . They added that Wilson had shot Mr Nemorin, the father of three children, in the head as he pleaded for his life. Moments earlier he had shot Mr Andrews, who was also a father, in the back of the head. The defence had argued that Wilson . was born into a troubled life, to a neglectful drug addict of a mother, . and an absent father. Defense . lawyer David Stern described his client as being a 'learning-disabled and . severely emotionally disturbed' man who had never been taught the . difference between right and wrong, SI Live said. The defense added that the prospect of growing old behind bars was enough of a punishment for Wilson. However, . Wilson was described in court as being threatening and bullying towards . other inmates. He also convinced prison guard Nancy Gonzalez to have . sex with him. Improper relationship: Prison guard Nancy Gonzalez arrives at court while still pregnant with Wilson's child earlier this year . Gonzalez, 29, who pleaded guilty to . have sex with Wilson between March and August 2012, gave birth to their . son, Justus, in March. Earlier . in the retrial, the families of Wilson's victims gave impact . statements. Mr Andrews's widow, Maryann, told the court: 'The pain will . never go away. The world kept moving, but time stopped for us.' According to the Daily News, . she added: 'Rodney loved his children so much. All he ever wanted was . to grow old with his children and see his children grow old. Our lives . were ruined.' 'I think what the jury recognized is not only the severity of the crimes that were committed but also that Ronell Wilson is not going to change,' Detectives Endowment Association president Michael Palladino, said. 'He’s a thug. It’s in his DNA. He actually enjoys it,' he added after the trial. Wilson was taken to death row at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.

The uncle of top Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard is being hunted by police in connection with a an international drug smuggling ring. Robert Stephen Gerrard, 50, is wanted following a raid by armed officers on a Rotterdam cafe, believed to be an operations centre for international drug traffickers. He is the second cousin of the Anfield icon, although he is known as 'Uncle Bobby'. Tuesday’s raid was part of a series of coordinated strikes in the UK and the Netherlands involving officers from the National Crime Agency and the Dutch National Crime Squad. 'Uncle Bobby': Robert Stephen Gerrard, who is wanted in connection with the importation of large quantities of cocaine in Britain. He is the second cousin of Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard . Two Turkish brothers suspected of running the operations centre were among ten men arrested in the Netherlands. Three men were arrested in the UK – a 64-year-old from Hale, Greater Manchester, a 36-year-old from Harlow, Essex, and a 47-year-old from Brentwood, Essex. Addresses in Liverpool linked to Gerrard and another man, Michael Paul Moogan, 27, were also searched. Investigators believe the café, which can only be entered via a buzzer system, is used by criminals from across the world as a meeting place for negotiations with cartels and for arranging the bankrolling and shipping of huge quantities of drugs. Robert Gerrard is wanted following a raid by armed officers on a Rotterdam cafe, believed to be an operations centre for international drug . A Dutch police officer surveys the property with his handgun drawn during the raid . Officers recovered two handguns, over 100 mobile phones, 300,000 Euros, a cash counting machine, a radio scanner, a radio jammer and high value watches from the café. At other addresses in Rotterdam officers seized nine handguns, two semi-automatic rifles, a cocaine press and a total of 200,000 Euros. There is no suggestion Steven Gerrard currently has any connection to Robert Gerrard. Steve Baldwin, Regional Head of Investigations for the NCA, said: 'We believe this café was being used as a front for a drug trafficking operations centre with international reach. 'This was a well established set up which was open 18 hours a day. It appears you were only allowed in if your face was known. Taking it out of operation will have caused serious disruption to the activities of organised crime groups across the world.

It is not the first time links between Steven Gerrard and Liverpool's gangsters have arisen. Michael Paul Moogan who is also wanted in connection with the importation of large quantities of cocaine in Britain . The Gerrards, it must be stated here, are a law-abiding family without a stain on their character. In 2008 Gerrard appeared as a character witness to John Kinsella, a known gangster charged with tying up a security guard during a £41,000 robbery. Gerrard and his father, Paul, were happy to vouch for the defendant's character in an open letter to the court. Kinsella, the jury heard, had earned their gratitude by persuading a notorious criminal, George Bromley Junior, to call off a campaign of intimidation and extortion against the footballer. Signed by Paul Gerrard, it detailed how Kinsella, an amateur boxer and martial arts expert, saved Steven from a young gangster who threatened to shoot him in the legs in a dispute over a girlfriend. 'We were at our wits' end when we were introduced by a family friend to John Kinsella,' the letter concluded. 'From that time we have never had any more problems from the Liverpool underworld.' In 2003, the father of one of his ex-girlfriends, with whom Steven is said to have been close, was given a lengthy jail term for possessing 5,000 ecstasy tablets and a gun. Further, Gerrard's wife, Alex (nee Curran), used to date a well-known Liverpudlian criminal by the name of Tony Richardson. Even his stellar football career is alleged to have fallen prey to the villains. Four years ago, Gerrard's multi-million pound transfer to Chelsea was called off at the eleventh hour because of intolerable pressure being placed on his family by 'certain elements', a source told the Daily Mail in 2008. The precise reasons why this remarkable U-turn came about remain shrouded in mystery. However, it is known that, at the time, a number of leading gangland figures in Liverpool were determined that their football club's prize asset should not be lost to the city - at any cost.

It means the Commons standards commissioner which usually focuses on claims of expenses fiddling or dodgy donations will also probe the behaviour of MPs accused of abusing their position in the corridors of power. Complaints against MPs accused of bullying or sexual harassment could now be dealt with by the Commons standards commissioner . The House of Commons Commission, chaired by Mr Bercow, has asked the Committee on Standards to draw up a system to allow for ‘allegations of harassment or bullying of House staff’ to be investigated. A full probe would be launched in cases where ‘resolution is not possible by other means, and if the complaint is sufficiently grave’. It follows means those found guilty will be named and shamed, and could even be suspended from Parliament. Commons Speaker John Bercow drew up the respect policy to prevent staff being abused . MPs are warned against offensive, intimidating, malicious or insulting behaviour, including an abuse or misuse of power. ‘It is important to remember that it is the impact of the action that matters, not what was intended; offence may be caused intentionally or unintentionally,’ the Commons Respect policy states. It warns against ‘unwelcome sexual advances – touching, standing too close, the display of offensive  materials, asking for sexual favours and making decisions on the basis of sexual advances being accepted or rejected’. MPs are also banned from ‘copying memos that are critical about someone to others who do not need to know’. Other behaviour which could trigger an investigation include ridiculing or demeaning someone, overbearing supervision or other misuse of power or position, unfair treatment and  threatening or abusive language or behaviour. It follows reports of Commons staff being left in tears after being abused by MPs, particularly those who have taken advantage of Parliament’s subsidised bars. Complaints about food, drink and service after often considered to be over-the-top. Staff at the expenses watchdog IPSA have reported being described as ‘monkeys’, ‘nutty’, and ‘f***ing idiots’. The Commons Respect agenda published by Mr Bercow makes clear: ‘All staff deserve, and should expect to be treated with, respect for who they are and what they do. ‘Members must not discriminate against, victimise, harass or bully any member of staff.’ MPs found guilty of abusing their position over staff could be suspended from the Commons . Under current rules complaints about MPs’ behaviour are dealt with internally and can be referred to the Speaker. But now they could be dealt with by the Committee on Standards, which published a report into complaints it examines.

Children who have it rarely grow up, according to Justin’s mother, Lagenia. ‘Some of them can never walk,’ she told KHOU 11 News. Scroll down for video... Fatal: Justin Clark, 13, from Texas, was diagnosed with a rare recessive disorder which is currently incurable. A new clinical trial might change everything . Disease symptoms: The legs weaken first, sight and hearing can go next, and patients are ultimately bedridden . Though her son’s symptoms surfaced unusually late in life, the path from here may be inevitable. The legs weaken first, sight and hearing can go next, and patients are ultimately bedridden. Justin is currently still wearing a brace from the second of two surgeries he had on his feet which each lasted four hours. The family has been working with a non-profit called Hannah’s Hope Fund to fund research. This month, researchers were supposed to present their finds to the National Institutes of Health to have them sign off on a clinical trial, which would have been available for Justin and could have saved his life. However, because of the government shutdown, it has been put on hold indefinitely until the government starts up again. ‘Every day could be a day that a child could be dying if we don’t get this clinical trial started,’ said Mrs Clark. Lagenia Clark and David Clark, Justin's parents, say every day the government is shutdown is a day 'a child could be dying' Braces: Justin has had two surgeries in two months on his feet and is still wearing a brace on his leg . The family is now focused on fundraising and Justin’s twin brother will soon be competing in a half-ironman to raise money for research. Justin is trying to keep up spirits and describes his battle with the disease ‘as a challenging video game’. Another person with a fatal illness who is being gravely affected by the shutdown is Michelle Langbehn from Auburn, California. Last year, just weeks after giving birth to daughter Lula, the 30-year-old was diagnosed with sarcoma, a rare form of cancer. She was told by a specialist that people with the diagnosis live up to a year, on average. Devastating news: Michelle Langbehn, 30, with her daughter Lula, 13 months. The new mother was told last year that she had one year to live . Sad: Langbehn said the thought of not being able to be there for her daughter and husband was 'absolutely heartbreaking' ‘The thought of not possibly being able to be here for my daughter and my husband was absolutely heartbreaking,’ she told NBC Bay Area. Langbehn has since endured five surgeries, undergone radiation and different rounds of chemotherapy. Running out of time and options, she signed up with the National Institutes of Health for a promising new drug. She was expecting approval this week, but now must wait for the government shutdown to end. A year of illness: Langbehn has endured five surgeries, undergone radiation and different rounds of chemotherapy . 'Each month counts': She says she already has 'a new spot' that has popped up . ‘When you are given a terminal diagnosis, each month counts,’ she said. ‘And I already have one new spot that has popped up.’ Every second the shutdown drags on, is impacting not just livelihoods, but lives, she and her husband said. ‘I'd love to think about the future with my daughter, but right now it's unknown,’ she said. ‘I'd love to think about her first day of kindergarten. Or her getting married but I don't know if that's possible.’","Justin Clark, from Bellaire, Texas, was diagnosed with the rare recessive disorder Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN)

Nearly two-thirds of voters oppose . planned hikes in green taxes – and back David Cameron in his battle with . Nick Clegg  to ‘roll back’ the levies. A total of . 60 per cent of voters object to the charges, which will hit households . with an extra £270 per year on their energy bills by 2020. Just 18 per . cent support the taxes. The findings, in a Survation poll, come after . a week in which double-digit hikes by the energy companies dominated . debate at Westminster. Roll back row: David Cameron is locked in a battle with his Deputy Nick Clegg over planned hikes in green taxes . The row over heating bills was galvanised last month when Ed Miliband pledged to freeze bills for two years after the next Election if he becomes Prime Minister. But our survey reveals . Mr Cameron’s promise last week to cut the levies is backed by more . people (40 per cent) than Mr Miliband’s freeze (33 per cent). And only . seven per cent back Mr Clegg. The public seem sceptical about whether . Mr Miliband’s freeze is workable: a majority, 54 per cent, think the . energy companies will just hike their prices before or after the freeze . to compensate for lost revenues. Big promise: Ed Miliband pledged to freeze bills for two years should he win the next election . The Mail on Sunday poll shows 61 per . cent support for Mr Cameron’s move, against just 11 per cent who want . to keep the taxes in place. The energy firms say the compulsory levies . –  such as the £33 which the typical family pays each year in subsidies . for wind farms and solar parks – have contributed to their price rises. Last week ex-Prime Minister Sir John Major warned surging bills meant . that millions of people would face a choice between ‘heating and eating’ this winter. A total of 38 per cent of those asked by Survation said . they have already had to cut back on essential purchases such as food . to afford their heating bills. This rises to 56 per cent of those in the . poorest social groups. If extrapolated to the nation at large, it would . mean 19 million people have had to choose between ‘heating and eating’. It is clear from the poll who voters blame for the hikes: 59 per . cent cite the firms while just 15 per cent blame the Government. The . same proportion blames the last Labour Government. The poll has Labour on 35 per cent, the Tories 29, the Lib Dems on 12 and UKIP 17. Survation interviewed 1,000 people on Friday. Electricity costs are still certain to rise massively over the next seven years to pay for the shift to renewable energy – even if David Cameron succeeds in his plan to trim green levies, writes David Rose. The reason is the new Energy Bill which commits Britain to colossal increases in subsidies for renewables such as wind and solar power. A Department of Energy and Climate Change document says the subsidies  will rise steadily from about £2.35 billion now to £7.6 billion  in 2020-21. Energy expert Peter Atherton, of Liberum Capital, says green levies are likely to cost households an average of £400 a year just for electricity – minus mall reductions Mr Cameron hopes to make by trimming the budget for items such as insulation. These eye-watering sums are the consequence of Britain’s earlier pledge to cut overall carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent by 2020, enshrined in the 2008 Climate Change Act – piloted by then Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. It is much harder to cut emissions from transport and heating, so almost the entire cut must be absorbed by the power industry. To meet the Act’s legally binding target, it must triple the proportion of electricity made by renewables to 33 per cent, requiring an investment of about £100 billion. A further subsidy is to be paid to fossil fuel power station operators whose plants would otherwise become uneconomic. It is expected this will cost another £15 per home. But experts say if subsidies look expensive in 2020, they will cost far more ten years later. Under the official ‘Fourth Carbon Budget’, set by the Government’s Committee on Climate Change, the UK power sector is supposed to have cut its emissions from electricity generation by about 90 per cent in 2030. Mr Atherton says this is likely to require more than  £300 billion investment in nuclear plants and renewables.","A full 60 per cent of voters object to paying 'green taxes'

Everyone was surprised by President Obama's unplanned visit to Junior's Cheesecake in Brooklyn yesterday, but none more so than this excited little girl. In a photograph posted to an offical White House Twitter account, the tiny girl looks up at the smiling President with an open-mouthed grin. President Obama looks equally taken with the curly-headed little girl, who was at the restaurant having a meal with her family. PETE SOUZA - TWITTER_ OBAMA AT JUNIOR'S CHESSECAKE BROOKLYN OCT . All set: U.S. President Barack Obama walks out with two bags of cheesecake from Junior's Restaurant next to Democratic Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio in Brooklyn on Friday afternoon . Obama - who . briefly lived in the New York borough in his younger days - visited . the restaurant yesterday with democratic mayoral candidate Bill de . Blasio whom he introduced as the 'next mayor' to customers and staff. The president left with . two cheesecakes - one traditional and the other strawberry. And he was sure to grab some black-and-white cookies 'for his girls'. The check came to $73 and he paid with $80 cash, according to owner Alan Rosen. 'He . said (his daughters) were going to eat the cookies on Air Force One on . the way back to Washington,' Mr Rosen told Politicker. 'He greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building': Onlookers recount Obama's visit to a Brooklyn Junior's with New York City Democratic Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio . Getting around to everyone and then home: Obama hugs a young girl in the restaurant before going to see his family . 'He greeted every single customer and every single employee in the building, which was quite gracious and amazing to me. 'Literally every single person. 'It was pretty incredible. We're pretty honored.' The president also left behind a signature on one of the eatery's large holiday pumpkins. Brooklyn resident Deborah Howard said she was enjoying her dinner when the president suddenly walked into the restaurant and couldn’t believe her eyes as he walked around the room, hugging people and shaking hands. 'It was great! … He said hello to everybody. They were hugging him and calling out,' she said. 'They applauded him leaving: ‘Thank you for coming. We love you!’ It was really great.' One last thing: President Obama leaves behind an autograph on a Halloween pumpkin before getting his sweets at Junior's restaurant in Brooklyn . Friday night crowd: Plenty were on hand for Obama's visit . Earlier in the day, the president admitted at least two of America's three branches of government needed to brush up on their math. During a visit to the Pathways in Technology Early College High School (P-TECH) in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, Obama observed a level two algebra class, joking that he needed one of the students to help him keep his daughters' math skills up. 'The president joked with one of the girls that he needed her to tutor Sasha and Malia, because he's not very good at helping them with math anymore,' according to a pool reporter traveling with Obama. Sasha and Malia, the Obamas' children, are in the seventh and tenth grades. 'I liked math, but then it started to get harder. And so that can be frustrating,' the president said, referring to his days as a student, the pool report continued. But when Obama recalled the classroom visit an hour later in his speech to 600 students and teachers, it was Congress – not he – who needed help with numbers. Real world math: Obama jokingly solicited math tutors for his kids while admitting that he was no longer up to the task . Obama's speech at P-TECH high school touched on immigration, government budgets and education issues and . Adulation: Obama's job approval ratings nationally are abysmal, but he is still wildly popular in politically stalwart 'blue' states like New York, where he arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport on Friday . 'I know that budgets aren't the most interesting topic for a Friday afternoon,' he said while scolding legislators for the recent government shutdown tussle in Washington, 'even in a school where young people like math.' 'And by the way, I just sat in on a lesson called ""Real World Math,"" which got me thinking whether it's too late to send Congress here for a remedial course.' But the president's ribbing at Congress will be quickly forgotten, at least where it concerns those on the political left. Obama will deliver another speech on Friday night – this time to a New York fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee expected to raise up to $32,400 per person. Don't tell FEMA: Obama tried to help build an ""Earthquake Tower"" during a math class, but didn't manage to balance his load . And the camera-phones come out: Brooklyn high-schoolers jostled to get their own photos of the president as he entered the stage .","Surprised diners told how the President turned up at Junior's restaurant .

Prince Harry slept through a devastating attack on Camp Bastion which left 18 soldiers killed or wounded, it has been claimed today. It was originally alleged in a magazine article by GQ magazine that the Prince, who had just arrived at the base in his role as an Apache helicopter pilot, was rushed to a 'safe house' for his protection during the attack. The MoD later denied the claims, saying . he had been 'treated much the same as any [other] service member . deployed to Camp Bastion'. Slumber: Prince Harry, pictured while in Afghanistan above, allegedly slept through an attack on Camp Bastion which left two dead and 16 other injured . But newly released US military files that were previously marked 'secret' reveal that the young royal, alongside other soldiers, slept through the attack. In the documents, Major General Sturdevant is quoted to have said 'The night of the attack, he slept through the entire thing.' On duty: Harry, pictured at the camp above, was stationed in Afghanistan for three months as an Apache Helicopter Pilot . He also reiterated that the royal was treated like any other serviceman while at the base, and the only special treatment he received was 'a place identified as a safe house in case the base . came under attack.' Today, both the Ministry of Defence and Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the revelations, published in the Independent. Sources close to the Prince today, however, suggested he was aware that an attack had taken place. The attack, in September 2012, saw 15 Taliban fighters - . dressed in American uniforms - walk past an unmanned watch tower and on to . the airfield at Camp Bastion, home to 30,000 troops. They opened fire with machine guns . and rocket-propelled grenades. Two US Marines were killed, with 16 other soldiers left injured. Eight American aircraft worth more than $200million (£124million) were also destroyed. The US took over responsibility for security following the attack - blaming senior US personnel for disregarding warnings of possible attacks - despite security on site being the responsibly of British Commanders. On Monday, two generals from the US Marines, including Maj-Gen Gregg Sturdevant, stepped down from their roles. The young royal is currently on tour in Australia, representing the Queen on his first official visit to the country. The Independent also reported today that recommendations to strengthen security at the base were rejected by the MoD on cost grounds just six months before the attack. Devastation: During the Camp Bastion Attack, pictured, Nato claimed that Prince Harry was never in any danger . Secret papers the newspaper say they have seen reveal the MoD refused to pay for a fence to . protect the airfield despite a recommendation by British officers’ in March . 2012. The recommendation was made after an attempted suicide attack on the . runway where a plane carrying the US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta had . just landed. One of the papers, a review by the International . Security Assistance Force (Isaf), reads: 'A statement of requirements (SOR) was generated to request the preferred course of action: the . installation of an airfield perimeter fence ... This SOR was initially . sent through UK chain of command for approval; however, it was denied on . the basis of cost [vs] security gains.' In another document, a senior US . officer, whose name is redacted, states:  'Every airfield that I’ve ever . been [to] has a fence around to help protect it.' The officer goes on to say that the ease with which . the base was penetrated was correlated to Britain's inability to finance the fence. The papers also suggest that a number of watch towers were left unmanned before the attack. A statement by Maj-Gen Sturdevant . reveals that he did not realise until after the attack that the towers were unmanned, adding: 'the Brits were embarrassed. They knew that they had screwed up.' He added: 'For the tower to be unmanned with the terrain out there, I . questioned that.' On Monday, two generals from the US Marines, Maj-Gen . Charles Gurganus and Maj-Gen Gregg Sturdevant, who is quoted in the papers, were forced to retire . when the report was published. Ruin: This picture shows what remains of one of the six Harrier jets in the aftermath of the Taliban attack on Camp Bastion on Sept. 14, 2012 . None of the British officers in . charge at the base has faced any sanction. Stuart . Skeates CBE, Maj-Gen Gurganus’s former deputy,  who was awarded a Queen’s Commendation for Valuable . Service yesterday – is now the Commandant of . the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. Jeff Portlock, the Bastion base . commander on the night of the attack, has been promoted from group . captain to Air Commodore. Tonight the MoD was urged to investigate. In response to the report, an MoD spokesman has said: 'The UK has contributed fully to a . number of Isaf, US and UK reviews; as a result, force protection . measures at Camp Bastion have been reviewed and are appropriate to . current threat levels. Withdrawal: British Soldiers, in the Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand Province, are preparing to return to the UK . 'The US review was intended to . examine US actions only and not those of coalition forces. However, the . UK will consider the findings of this review to confirm our earlier . assessment that no further UK action is required. 'It would be . inappropriate to comment further at this time.” But Colonel Richard . Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said that . Britain must accept responsibility for failing to protect the base. 'There is no doubt that security . failings on the part of both British and American forces contributed to . the attack on Camp Bastion. Return: Vehicles arrive back in Camp Bastion from a Combat Logistic Patrol for the very last time . 'If British commanders were . culpable then, like their American counterparts, I would expect . disciplinary action to be taken. Questions do need to be answered. 'If a fence was required but not . built due to cost this is a very serious matter. Several times the Prime .

One of the most anticipated books of the year, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy has finally arrived and has received a mauling from critics and readers alike. 'A clunking disappointment' said the Daily Telegraph, who describes the book as veering between a 'disconcerting' Fifty Shades Of Grey manner and a 'sub-Mills and Boon style'. Bridget Jones has now become 'foolish' and unreal' while Daniel Cleaver makes just 'tantilisingly brief' appearances. The beginning is 'toe-curling', the first two-thirds are like listening to someone who once had perfect pitch but now can't sing a note and overall the book is 'v disappointing'. Bridget Jones is back - but the verdict on the latest book is not great . The Telegraph critic Sarah Crompton goes on to say that 'every line feels full of effort,' and that Fielding is on 'well-trodden territory', adding: 'If she is about to enter the fray, she had better have something original to say.' Bridget Jones: Mad about the Boy doesn't fare much better with the Sunday Times newspaper either. Sadly, there's no happy-ever-after for Mark Darcy and Bridget Jones . 'It isn't just the style that jars,' wrote its reviewer Christina Patterson, 'the random capital letters, the . subjectless sentences, the mannerisms that now seem awfully tired. 'It isn't just the rather hysterical tone. It isn't even the pile-up of . clichés: the room that ""looked like a bomb had hit it"" or the stare . ""like a rabbit caught in the headlights"". 'Or the fact that Fielding will never just . give two or three examples — of funny self-help books, of children's . names that sound like Latin declensions — when she can give 10. It's the . fact that I hardly believed a word of it.' It get worse: Patterson says the book is 'deeply uneven' as well as emotionally inauthentic and a brand which has 'lost its shine.' The Guardian's Justine Jordan was slightly kinder, saying that the book 'reads less like a satire on modern life and more like a good old Jilly Cooper' and adding: 'While the anxiety of the urban singleton was a fresh subject for comedy in the 90s, we've been reading this sort of thing for years.' More... 'The twists and turns of life go beyond happy endings of books': Bridget Jones author Helen Fielding on why she killed off Mark Darcy . She's back! Older, none the wiser and with some very odd dating advice for the newly single: Helen Fielding interviews Bridget Jones . The verdict from readers wasn't much better. Fans of the previous two books - and the wildly successful films starring Renee Zellewegger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth - were already reeling from the news that the gorgeous Mark Darcy had been killed off by Bridget Jones author Helen Fielding, leaving Bridget once again out looking for love. Fans took to Twitter to express their shock and sorrow about Mark Darcy's demise . After the news of Darcy's demise broke, one contributor to the book reviews website Goodreads wrote: 'After the revelations by author Helen Fielding this weekend, I won't be reading this or any other new HF book ever again. I have been so excited about hearing what Bridget has been up to and to hear that HF has destroyed the story of Bridget Jones and shown such a lack of respect to fans is just unbelievable!!' Another wrote: 'Mr Darcy is dead?! I hate it! Toyboy for Bridget. Ridiculous!' while another disappointed fan wrote: 'I am no longer interested in reading this book.' One Bridget Jones book too many? Out this Thursday, Mad About The Boy is already at the top of the bestseller's list on Amazon, despite poor reviews RIGHT: Helen Fielding was at the forefront of the chick lit movement when she released the original Bridget Jones book in 1997 . The opening chapters of Bridget Jones: Mad about the boy, serialised in a Sunday newspaper last week, made for rather depressing reading. Not merely because Mark Darcy - the stiff but smouldering human rights lawyer who had captured Bridget's heart (along with several million others) in the previous books - was no more, but because this meant that our heroine had to go back on the dating scene. Again. Haven't we been here before? Bridget Jones' Diary was all about how hapless singleton Bridget battled with her weight, her embarrassing relatives and her 'smug married' friends - not to mention her irrational dislike for Mr Darcy - to finally find love, having gone off on a enjoyable but then heart-breaking diversion with serial cheat Daniel Cleaver. The second book, Edge of Reason, saw Bridget completely mess up her relationship with Mark and rather improbably imprisoned briefly in Thailand. Even then the comic touch that had been so brilliant in the first book - and the original newspaper columns where Bridget first appeared - showed signs of fading. How many more times could Bridget be hapless, clueless and loveless without it getting rather repetitive? But here she is again, on her own, summoning up the energy to go out on the pull once again. It's all here, the reluctant dressing up, the fish-out-of-water feeling in the latest trendy nightclub, the encouraging but dippy friends as they prod, poke and cajole Bridget to get out there and strut her stuff. How much more fun would it have been to have a glimpse of Bridget and Mark's married life? The romance of the newlyweds (Bridget organising her wedding would have had great comic potential - would she have turned into a Bridezilla or just so relieved to have made it out of singledom she would have spent her entire day trying to get her still-single friends to get together?) making way to happy - or otherwise - domesticity. Would they argue over who loaded the dishwasher, whether to pay for their children's education, whether Mark Darcy worked too much or whether to watch Strictly or X Factor? Or would they take off around the world having fabulous adventures and giving us yet another chapter in such a popular romance? We will never know. So we are left with Bridget still being single, Daniel still talking about Bridget's big pants and a huge Darcy-shaped hole in all of our lives. Last week Helen Fielding, 55, told Vogue magazine that her latest Bridget Jones Diary reflects how real life does not always have happy endings. She said that the death of her father in a car crash made her realise that life has many 'twists and turns'. 'It's like the keys of a piano isn't it?,' she said. 'There are white notes and black notes. 'And there's a tragicomic element in my writing; the happy ending is just where you choose to end a book. Life, with all its twists and turns, carries on beyond it.' Whatever the critics say, Bridget Jones: Mad About The Boy will be a massive bestseller, already sitting near the top of Amazon's charts even though the title is not released until Thursday. But having read the reviews, Fielding could be forgiven for wondering whether it might be time to say goodbye to her most famous creation. Sarah Crompton, The Daily Telegraph . The news that Helen Fielding was bringing back Bridget after a 14–year . silence created a real sense of anticipation: but Mad About the Boy is a . clunking disappointment. The tone is all wrong. Reading the first two thirds of Mad About the . Boy is like listening to someone who once had perfect pitch, but now . can't sing a note. It lies as flat on the page as its heroine's . overcooked spaghetti. You feel the weight of that worry as Fielding . takes the staples of modern life – remote controls, tweeting, texting, . online dating – and strains to make anything of them. Christina Patterson, The Sunday Times . It . isn't just the style that jars: the random capital letters, the . subjectless sentences, the mannerisms that now seem awfully tired. It . isn't just the rather hysterical tone. It isn't even the pile-up of . clichés: the room that ""looked like a bomb had hit it"" or the stare . ""like a rabbit caught in the headlights"".

After a busy day it’s all too easy to eat your dinner in front of the TV rather than making the effort to have a traditional family meal. In fact, six out of ten meals consumed in British homes are eaten while watching television, according to a study. And more than one third of us regularly eat meals in front of the TV without making any conversation, researchers found. Unsociable meal times: Research has found one third of British people eat in front of the television without making any conversation . The survey, which highlights the extent to which millions have abandoned the dining table, discovered that the average person eats 13 meals at home each week, and at least eight of these – around 60 per cent – are eaten while watching television. Eight in ten think the television is now a big part of modern meal times. Six in ten are convinced that eating in front of the TV is a growing trend and admit they have done this a lot more in the last five years. Traditional eating: Research suggests that we have abandoned the dinner table in favour of eating in front of the television on the sofa . But 45 per cent don’t enjoy the food they’re eating, and many opt for ready meals and takeaways. More than a third say it’s quite common for them to eat a meal on the sofa and not appreciate their food or notice the flavour. While 57 per cent of those surveyed would prefer to eat away from the TV more than they do, they admit this never becomes a reality. A guilt-ridden one in six has even lied to family, friends or colleagues about the how often they eat in front of their television. Four in ten parents said that, given the chance, their child would eat every meal while glued to the television. Supporting the campaign: Actress Angela Griffin wants to encourage eating at the table to be popular again . The research was commissioned by Red Tractor beef and lamb, a logo scheme designed to assure shoppers about the quality and traceability of the beef and lamb they are buying. Jane Ritchie-Smith, from Red Tractor beef and lamb, said: ‘We know we should try to eat our evening meal at the table chatting to family and friends about our day, but the reality is that, after a long day at work, many people just want to sit down and relax in front of the TV. ‘Although there’s nothing wrong with the odd TV dinner, it’s worrying that so many people aren’t enjoying the food they’re eating.’ Red Tractor is launching a campaign – Highly Desirable TV Dinners – to help make the meals more appetising. The step-by-step recipe videos are available online. Actress and mother Angela Griffin, who is supporting the campaign, said: ‘When I was younger, we always ate dinner at the table and we still try to do this as much as we can. ‘But, sometimes, there’s nothing wrong with catching up on your favourite soap whilst eating your evening meal.’","More than a third of people say they often eat meals on the sofa .

The father and son came across a trio of small yellow grocery bags, inside which they found human bones covered in dirt. Unlucky find: Steven Terry and his father bought Robert Wood's storage locker at an auction for $170 . Police say the condition of the remains suggests that they may have been buried at some point, but were later dug up. The late owner of the locker, Robert Wood, moved from Corbin to Alabama in 2004, but continued paying rent on the storage unit until earlier this year. The owner of the storage facility called 911 after learning of the startling find, telling the operator that Mr Wood had worked for him around the time his wife went missing. ‘Everybody thought for sure that he had killed her,’ the owner said on the call obtained by the station WTVQ. Mrs Wood was reported to have left her home in Newark, Delaware, July 28, 1997, to meet with her sister, but she never made it and has not been heard from since. Her husband was questioned at the time but was never charged in her death, according to the station WKYT. The bones, which the local coroner has determined to be those of a woman, have been sent to the state medical examiner's office for analysis.","Doris Anne Wood, 42, went missing in Delaware in July 1997 on her way to meet her sister .

A female child daycare worker in Ohio was arrested Friday after video emerged of her having sex with an infant. Police in the town of Elyria found footage of Heather Koon ‘engaging in sexual conduct’ with an infant on the 25-year-old’s laptop while investigating her convicted sex offender boyfriend. Both remained in custody of over the weekend. Meanwhile, the baby’s father says administrators at the daycare center where the unthinkable allegedly occurred first tried to cover it up. Perfect couple? Heather Koon (left) was arrested after her convicted sex offender boyfriend James Osborne (right) was brought in for providing an incorrect address on a sex offender registry. When a confiscated laptop was searched, police say it held video of Koon raping at least two infants . As Koon sat behind bars with her boyfriend, James Osborne—whose previous offenses include pandering obscenity involving a minor—the infant’s father was livid over how ABC Kidz initially handled the situation. ‘I still haven't wrapped my mind around it. It's every parent's worst nightmare,’ the baby’s father, who has chosen to remain anonymous, told WOIO. The father claims ABC Kidz was initially vague about what had happened to his baby. ‘They tried to act like it was a simple assault,’ he said. ‘A few hours later they called us back again and asked us to keep it discrete.’ Unthinkable: The heinous act allegedly occurred at this daycare center in Elyria, Ohio, where Koon was employed . Cover-up? The child's father, who has chosen to remain anonymous, said that Koon's employers first behaved 'it was a simple assault.' What they didn’t want made public was that at least two babies at the daycare facility were raped. The footage came to light as investigators searched for Osborne, whose address is listed incorrectly on Lorain County’s sex offender registry. Upon his arrest for the violation, a laptop that ended up belonging to Koon was searched. On it was the evidence, say police. The anonymous father was forced to identify his baby in order to help the investigation. ‘They showed us still photos,’ the father said. As his family’s nightmare unfolds, the aghast dad is left only with advice to other parents. ‘Any child that's old enough to talk, they should talk to.  Any child that's not old enough to talk should be taken to a physician,’ he warned. Koon and Osborne remained in the Lorain County jail Sunday evening as they waited to see a judge.

At the age of 28, the Jersey City artist was diagnosed with breast cancer and shortly afterwards her chemotherapy began . Emily decided that she would keep a record of everything she was going to endure from the bald head, to a surgical bra, to the tiredness. Scroll down for video... The journey begins here: Emily Helck decided to start a blog that would chart her year-long course of chemo . Fast-paced: To the viewer the year speeds by in exactly one minute. To Emily, it must have felt like forever... Shades: The pictures capture the emotions, the ups and downs of Emily Helcks cancer treatment . One year on since she first began her treatment, Ms Helck gives a smile of achievement on a one minute long video that captures the past twelve months. She decided that a video really was the only way to keep an accurate record of the year she had to endure. 'You forget things that are upsetting,’ she said. ‘Your brain protects you.’ ‘Truthfully, I didn't think I would keep it up, because I'm terrible at stuff like that,’ she told NJ.com. She states on her blog that normally she doesn't like looking at photo's of herself, but taking pictures whilst she was undergoing treatment for cancer made her look at herself differently. 'I feel separate from this person somehow, even though the last photos are . from just a few days ago. I feel like the girl in the photos made it . through pretty unscathed, though the look on her face sometimes makes me . sad. A lot of people had it a lot worse. It could always be . worse.' 'My prognosis could be worse. I could have had to do harsher . chemo. I could be going bankrupt. My dog could have run away. So yes, it . could always be worse. But it could be a lot better, too.' Private moments: Emily says she took the photos for her own record so she would be able to remember . Yawn: The chemotherapy made Emily feel very tired for much of the year as drugs are pumped into her body . The photos aren't elaborate setups. Sometimes she's still in her pajamas. Viewers can also read her blog, The Real Tumours of New Jersey, which convey her dark moods as she endured a double mastectomy, reconstruction, chemotherapy and radiation. In some of the pictures she doesn't look towards the camera and looks decidedly downbeat. In a recent blog post, Emily tries to explain why she went ahead the the project. 'At first it had to do with documenting the hair saga. But it wound up becoming about something else, too. The photos became hash marks scratched on the wall, marking time spent inhabiting the world of this disease. Every time I set up the tripod was another week down. Regrowth: The video captures Emily's hair growing back and she says she feels as though she made it through 'pretty much unscathed' One year on: My hope is that by showing what it looks like to go through treatment, I can shine a light on a little bit of that unknown . 'My body continued to change drastically too. I kind of wear my heart on my sleeve, so what's going on emotionally is visible on my face. It became about how the process of cancer treatment affected my entire life.' 'It was not about looking good,' she says. Ms Helck took the videos for her self and put them all together in a timelapse video, and now more than 90,000 people have viewed her creation. ‘It's incredibly heart-warming,’ she says. ‘My hope is that by showing what it looks like to go through treatment, I can shine a light on a little bit of that unknown.’ Ms. Helck has now finished her treatment and says her health is good, although she's ‘still dealing with the reconstruction, which will go into next year.","Emily Helck was diagnosed with breast cancer in July of 2012 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:21 EST, 26 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:18 EST, 26 July 2012 . On a warm summer afternoon, Michael Ecker, a 25-year-old Iraq war veteran, called out to his father from a leafy spot in their backyard. Then, as the two stood steps apart, Michael saluted, raised a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. 'His eyes rolled back,' his father, Matt, said softly as he recounted the 2009 suicide. 'There was just nothing I could do.' Weeks before he killed himself at the family's home in Champion, Ohio, Michael received a letter from the Department of Veterans Affairs accusing him of 'over-reporting' the extent of his psychiatric problems. Proud: Army veteran Michael Ecker is pictured with his parents Matt and Cheryl at his graduation from boot camp. He committed suicide in April 2009 in the family's backyard . It was the culmination of a long struggle that Ecker, diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury related to his service, had waged since returning home from the war to try to hold down a steady job, obtain VA disability benefits and resume a life as close to normal as possible. 'I've often thought about finding that doctor and saying, ''Over-reporting?!'' and giving him the death certificate,' Matt Ecker said. About once every half hour in America, a veteran within the VA healthcare system tries to commit suicide, according to VA figures for 2011. President Barack Obama singled out suicide prevention as a priority when he talked about veterans issues on the campaign trail in 2008. He once cited the case of an 89-year-old World War II veteran who took his life the day after complaining about his treatment by the VA. Chilling: Matt Ecker demonstrates how his son, Army veteran Michael Ecker, saluted before shooting himself in the head in the woods behind their home in Champion, Ohio . Tragic loss: Matt and Cheryl Ecker hold a photo of their son, Army veteran Michael who killed himself after a long battle with PTSD . 'It is an outrage. It is a betrayal of the ideals that we ask our troops to risk their lives for,' Obama told an audience in Charleston, West Virginia, on May 12, 2008. He reiterated those sentiments at a Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Reno, Nevada, on Monday, saying he had told Pentagon chiefs and VA Secretary Eric Shinseki: 'We've got to do better. … This has to be all hands on deck.' In the nearly three years since Ecker's death, the Obama administration has expanded efforts to tackle suicide among veterans, some of which were initiated at the end of the Bush administration. It has hired more suicide prevention staff and enhanced tracking of high-risk patients. Other benefits meant to help veterans returning from war have been expanded, particularly educational benefits under the 2008 GI Bill. Perhaps the most lauded part of the VA's ramped-up effort to combat suicide has been a hotline that has received more than half a million calls since it was created in 2007, including more than 20,000 rescues of suicidal veterans. More recently it launched an online chat service and text messaging. Tragedy: Michael Ecker as a child in camouflage paint and a U.S. Army t-shirt. As an Iraqi veteran he was overwhelmed by his mental health problems . Devastating reminder: Matt Ecker points out a bullet hole in the back of his Ohio home after his 25-year-old son shot himself . The VA has sought to improve data collection, too, and the numbers appear troubling. In 2011 there were 17,754 suicide attempts - about 48 a day - up from 10,888 in 2009. That increase, the VA said, may largely reflect an improved tracking system put into place in 2010 and a growing number of patients treated at VA facilities. The VA couldn't provide data on the number of suicides within the VA system after 2009 but the figures through that date show a broadly stable rate since 2003 that is higher than the national average. Outside the VA healthcare system, which has almost 9 million enrollees, the data becomes murky. The VA has estimated that roughly 18 veterans nationwide kill themselves every day, but that number is based on limited data. A survey, conducted by Reuters, contacted all 50 states but obtained data for the 2005-to-2010 period from only 32. The information accounted for about two-thirds of the U.S. veteran population. Troubled: Army veteran Michael Ecker struggled to return to normal life after serving his country in Iraq . In those states, veteran suicides increased from 4,801 to 5,017 over a five-year period in which, the VA believes, the U.S. veteran population declined slightly. While the data is imperfect - the VA estimates the reliability of such figures at 78 per cent to 90 per cent - the department said the numbers appeared broadly consistent with trends it has observed. Shinseki said that the problem of veteran suicide appeared to be linked to a broader question about mental health in the United States. He pointed to data showing suicide is the second-biggest cause of death for people ages 25 to 34 and the fourth-biggest cause for people 35 to 54. 'We got a problem. Is mental health an issue in this country? Nobody talks about it,' Shinseki said. A copy of the July 29, 2009, VA letter to Ecker denied him an increase in his disability benefits from the $974 he was already receiving, citing 'over-reporting (of) both mood disturbance and impaired memory difficulty'. 'Mr. Ecker's death is a tragic outcome. Our deepest sympathy goes out to his family and loved ones,' the VA said in response. 'Experience has shown that access to quality mental health services from VA can make a positive difference in the lives of veterans and their families.' Grief: Cheryl Ecker looks at a photo of her son Michael who has suffered a traumatic brain injury following his tour of duty . Matt Ecker wonders daily whether his son's suicide could have been prevented had he received better treatment or found a job he could keep in his condition. Frustrated with the system, his son had declined treatment from the VA and had turned to a local doctor. He also wonders whether Michael might have done better if he had reenlisted. Going to war was risky. But, in Michael's case, so was coming home. 'It's just as dangerous, as it turns out, out here - because of the lack of jobs, lack of everything,' he said.","Michael Ecker called out to his father at their home in Champion, Ohio .

The parents of three children were arrested in Daytona Beach, Florida yesterday after police discovered the family living in a dead woman's house - all while the woman's body was decomposing in a bedroom. Police conducted a well-being check at the home in Holly Hill after being contacted by the Department of Children and Families who hadn't been able to contact the home's owner since early September. When officers forced their way into the home, they discovered the body of a woman - believed to be 33-year-old Tiffany Kain - in the late states of decomposition lying in a bedroom. Kain had spina bfida and was wheelchair-bound. Scroll Down for Video . Grim living: Todd Christopher La Duke, 38 (left), and Nicole Scalise, 32 (right), were arrested yesterday and their three children put in protective custody after police found them living in a house with a decomposing body . 'It was like a house of horrors for Halloween,' said Holly Hill Police Chief Mark Barker. 'It was awful. You could smell the body from 150 feet away.' But it was the presence of living bodies in the home that unsettled police the most. Across the hall in another bedroom, they found Todd Christopher La Duke, 38, and Nicole Louise Scalise, 32, with their 4-year-old child. La Duke and Scalise had been living with Kain on and off for years. Apparently they had been living in the house with the decomposing body. Two of their other children, ages 6 and 11, lived there as well but were at school at the time. Making themselves at home: La Duke, Scalise and their three children were discovered living at this house in Holly Hill. The woman's body is believed to be that of 33-year-old Tiffany Krain who the family lived with on and off . Gruesome: In addition to the decomposing body, police found the house littered with dog feces and urine and evidence of drug abuse . In addition to the awful odors from the decomposing bodies, police also found dog feces and urine in the home and evidence of drug abuse in the form of bath salts. 'This is one of the worst cases of child neglect and child endangerment that I've seen in my 31 years here,' Barker said. Both La Duke and Scalise admitted that they had been cashing in the dead woman's food stamps and Social Security benefits. However, they say they didn't know that Kain had died and assumed she left the home. Both were arrested on charges of child neglect and failure to report a death to the medical examiner. La Duke is also being charged with theft of utility services since he illegally connected electrical and water service on the residence when it had been cut off. Their three children are now in protective custody. Kain's death has been deemed suspicious by the police and an autopsy and toxicology report were ordered today.","Todd La Duke, 38, and Nicole Scalise, 32, were arrested yesterday after police found them living in a home with a decomposing woman's body .

A veteran marine committed suicide on Saturday as he struggled to cope with post-traumatic stress disorder following tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. Lance-corporal Janos Victor Lutz, a decorated machine gunner known as Johnny, took an overdose in his childhood bedroom on January 12. The 24-year-old killed himself in Davie, Florida just hours after discussing his studies at Palm Beach State College over lunch with his mother. Scroll down for video . Demons of war: Lance corporal Janos Victor Lutz, with his dog Kobe, took his own life on January 12 after struggling with PTSD since he returned from Afghanistan . Duty: The Marine Corps machine gunner, known as Johnny, killed himself in his childhood bedroom in Florida . Devastating loss: The serviceman, pictured with a friend, had been treated for PTSD on his return from Afghanistan but struggled to overcome the effects of war . The 24-year-old, who had been discharged 18 months ago, left a final note on his laptop which read: 'I'm sorry. I am happier now.' Mr Lutz is the latest in a long list of U.S. servicemen to have taken their own lives. Last year alone, some 349 troops died, far exceeding American combat deaths in Afghanistan. His mother Janine Lutz told the Sun-Sentinel: 'He was a casualty of war, stateside. 'This last week was the first time he seemed at peace, and I see now that . he had made up his mind. He didn't want to live any more.' The Marine had been treated for PTSD at Camp . Lejeune in North Carolina when he returned to the U.S. in 2011.

He was later deployed to southern Helmand province in Afghanistan with the 2nd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment. Lutz earned 13 service commendations while serving his country. A military memorial service will be held for him on Saturday at 4pm in Sunrise, Florida. Pentagon figures released on Monday revealed that there were 349 suicides among active-duty troops in 2012, up from 301 the year before and exceeding the Pentagon's own internal projection of 325. Statistics alone do not explain why troops take their own lives, and the Pentagon's military and civilian leaders have acknowledged that more needs to be done to understand the causes. Last year's total is the highest since the Pentagon began closely tracking suicides in 2001. It exceeds the 295 Americans who died in Afghanistan last year.

There are a seemingly unlimited amount of conspiracy . theories as to what happened on the cool November morning in Dallas nearly 50 . years ago. The former girlfriend of Lee Harvey Oswald, the man who is . widely accepted as President John F. Kennedy’s killer, is adding to the list. In a new explosive memoir, Judyth Vary Baker argues that . Oswald could not have murdered the 35th President of the United States in Dealy . Plaza. Girlfriend: In her new book, Me and Lee, Judyth Vary Baker claims that Oswald was framed for the assassination of JFK . Revealed: Besides knowing Lee Harvey Oswald intimately, Vary Baker said she was working on a secret government project to give Fidel Castro lung cancer . ‘Lee Oswald was a hero,’ Ms Baker began, speaking at an . Oregon bookstore earlier this week. ‘I’m here to tell you that when you find . out who did it, you will understand more about who took over our country and . why we are in the position we are in today,’ according to KVAL News. The author, who lives abroad due to what she claims are safety concerns, is going . on a limited tour this month and onto December to promote her book ‘Me & . Lee: How I Came To Know, Love, And Lose Lee Harvey Oswald.’ She will also make several other appearances via Skype. Ms Baker was a whiz-kid, carrying out complicated cancer . research in New Orleans in the early 1960s at the age of 19. ‘I was assigned to . make cancer more deadly,’ she told KVAL. ‘Can you imagine?’ She said that she met Oswald in 1963 during this internship . working under Dr Alton Ochsner, the former president of the American Cancer . Society and they became involved. Tragic end: Jacqueline Kennedy rests her head on husband John F. Kennedy's shoulder, after his arrival into New York to campaign, three years before his assassination in Dallas . 'I was his . lover,' she remembered, while not elaborating on their trysts. 'I loved . him and he loved me and I believe that with all my heart.' Oswald, she explained, was also part of the Ochsner project. According to her book, the cancer research helmed by Dr . Ochsner was tied to efforts to bring down Cuba’s then-president Fidel Castro . through biological means, injecting the guerrilla leader with a fast-spreading . cancer and making it nearly impossible to trace back to the U.S. Oswald also told Ms Baker of the Kennedy assassination plot . from conversations they had up to two days before November 23, 1963. In her 600-page book, Ms Baker argues that her . then-boyfriend was a deeply undercover intelligence agent who was actually . trying to prevent Kennedy from being killed. She said that Oswald was framed . for the murder, which she said he could not have committed from his sniper post . at the Texas Book Depository. Mystery: Oswald's girlfriend claims he was ordered to kill Kennedy but that he refused to go through with it . Assassinated: Lee Harvey Oswald was himself killer by Jack Ruby during a television press conference at Dallas police headquarters . She told KVAL: ‘We have a lot of information that Kennedy . was shot from the front,’ noting that the book depository was behind Kennedy’s . motorcade. Ms Baker said that there was a conspiracy against Oswald . from the beginning. ‘They arrest him, they say he’s from Russia.’ Now approaching her golden years, Ms Baker said the last words she ever . heard Oswald say to her were on phone call when he ended with: ‘I love you, Judyth.’ That was two days before . Oswald himself was shot dead outside of Dallas’ police headquarters. The assassination of President Kennedy has been the . springboard of countless conspiracies, including ones that there were multiple . gunmen, witnesses were intimidated, and that evidence had been both tampered . with and fabricated. Next year marks the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's death. Young love: Baker said Oswald confided in her about a plot to kill Kennedy as 'pillow talk' and says the last words he ever said to her were 'I love you' Sworn: President Lyndon B.

He also admitted Apple’s voice recognition service Siri can't always live up to the same standards as Google’s Android version. A partnership between the two firms could make phones better, he continued. In the interview with BBC Click, Wozniak, 63, said: ‘Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. 'And very often usually I find out that Android does.’ He continued that Google’s success is down to the fact Android has the benefit of being directly linked to the California-based firm’s search engine and results – something Apple doesn’t have the benefit of. Wozniak adds that Android is the ‘future of intelligence for computers getting smarter’ and wishes the two companies could join forces. If the two companies combined, Wozniak claims the information that could be shared would benefit all those involved, and ultimately benefit the paying customers. Wozniak admitted Apple's voice recognition service Siri, pictured right, just isn't up to the same standards as Google's Android version, pictured left. The 63-year-old believes a partnership between the two tech giants would make phones and technology in general better for everyone .

A beautician has launched a children's birthday party business offering full make-overs to girls as young as seven. Mother-of-two Kelly Matthews, 27, from Gloucester, has set up Little Beauties, a party pamper service where primary school children learn how to apply a full-face of make-up, as well as having manicures and pedicures. Kelly has been inundated with requests for parties from family and friends' children since running her first event last month. Mother-of two Kelly offers manicures, pedicures, face pack treatments, hair curling and make-up lessons . She said: 'I think some girls would relish a break from the traditional bouncy castle party, or a party at a fast food restaurant that every child has. 'When I was young, I always used to sneak into my mum's room and try on her make-up, because I looked up to her and wanted to be pretty like her. 'I know when I was a little girl, I would have been thrilled if my mum had booked me a pamper party. 'I can't wait until my eight-month-old daughter is old enough to have a pamper party herself. 'No one ever taught me how to put make-up on, and I think that's something which many girls never get told how to do today. 'That's why when you go into town, you often see so many teenagers with their faces plastered in foundation or fake tan, but all they need is a bit of guidance as how to use the products they will use regardless, in moderation and properly.' Cheyenne McNulty gets a pedicure (left) as Abby has rollers put in her hair (right) Kelly, who has two children Elsie-May, eight months, and Fletcher Wayne, two, and is an area administrator for a pharmaceutical company, hopes to make her business into a well-known brand and full-time career. Providing pamper parties for girls aged seven and above, treatments on offer include manicures, pedicures, face pack treatments, hair curling and make-up lessons. Kelly said: 'The feedback I've been getting from the girls and parents is that the parties are fun, surprisingly educational and something different, which is what I set out to achieve.' The issue of putting make up on children can prove a sticky issue among parents. Little children will always love raiding the dressing up box and playing around with mum's make-up, but there is growing concern over the 'hyper-sexualisation' of young girls. There is a growing trend in Britain for not only children's pamper parties but also American-style beauty pageants - which sometimes accept newborn contestants. The French government last month moved to . protect young girls from potential dangers by banning such pageants and even threatening organisers with years in prison and fines. While Kelly says that she's aware of these disturbing competitions, she insists her parties are all just about having fun. She will provide two main types of parties, those for children aged around 7 - 11 and parties for teenagers from the ages of 12 and above. Mackenzie admires her look in a mirror after her makeover at a Little Beauties pamper party . At the younger children's parties, girls will be able to try on sparkly make-up and colourful nail varnishes. For the parties aimed at teenagers, the emphasis will be on looking beautiful without using too much make-up. She says: 'I plan to teach children how to look after their skin and apply cosmetic products correctly.' Kelly prides herself on using high-quality, hypoallergenic products and says parental permission for all children receiving treatments will be sought. She said: 'Children love dressing up and looking pretty, and what I plan to offer is something different and alternative to simply going to a party and getting their face painted.' The creative beautician has always enjoyed party organising and said her pamper parties will involve more than just the girls getting a treatment.

Kelly said: 'I'm really excited about my new venture, and a career in health and beauty is something I've always wanted to do.' Back in 2011 the Mail reported on specialist businesses across the country that offered 'pamper parties' and cosmetic tips to children. The man advising David Cameron on the sexualisation of children promised to investigate its worrying findings.

It might look like a penny farthing, but in fact this revolutionary bike is made from some of the most advanced technology in the world. Created by BASF to celebrate the year the German-based chemical firm was founded, the e-velocipede boasts an electric motor, 24 specially moulded types of plastic and carbon fibre framework. The idea behind the concept was to imagine what bike inventors during the 19th century would have come up with if they had access to modern materials. Scroll down for video . The original 'bone-shaker' bike from 1865, left, next to the modern-day Concept 1865, right. German engineers from BASF created the e-velocipede using 24 different types of moulded plastic and carbon fibre. It is fitted with a 250W electric motor and batteries hidden inside the seat . The crank directly drives the front wheel. Additionally, the rear wheel houses a 250W electric motor - with batteries doubling as a seat. LED lights are built into the frame. Only the bikes brakes, axles, and motor are still made of metal - everything else is plastic. The seat is cushioned with top-of-the-range moulded foam called Elastoflex W. German-based BASF teamed up with Ding3000 to create the Concept 1865. The velocipede became commonly referred at as the Penny Farthing because it had different-sized wheels that corresponded with the difference in size between a penny and a farthing coin. Early designs for the bike originated in 1818 and it later became known as the 'bone-shaker' because it was uncomfortable to ride due to the wrought-iron frame, wooden wheels and iron tyres. The e-velocipede has been designed to be much smoother. The tyres have been replaced with a light, durable elastic called thermoplastic polyurethane, which the makers claim is puncture-proof. There are 24 different types of moulded plastic used throughout the bike, with the frames of the handlebars being made from carbon fibre. Only the bike's brakes, axles, and motor are made of metal. The pedals use friction created by sliding to turn and rotate, which made it possible for BASF and Ding3000 to remove the ball bearings. Pedals traditionally have a spindle . that threads into the end of a crank. The foot rest is attached to the . body and rotates on bearings around the spindle. The . seat is cushioned with top-of-the-range moulded foam called Elastoflex W . and the 250W motor and battery is hidden inside the seat.

Hundreds of girls as young  as 11 are taking up boxing in school, inspired by Nicola Adams’s Olympic gold medal. Teachers and coaches say interest in the controversial sport has surged among both boys and girls, in PE lessons and at after-school clubs. And the number of women who box at least once a week has rocketed by nearly 8,000 from 23,200 to 35,100, says Sport England. Champ: Adams fought her way to victory in the 51kg category in London, inspiring young female boxers . But many health experts believe children should not be allowed to box due to the injury risk. Professor Sheila Hollins, of the British Medical Association, said: ‘Blows can cause brain injury and, in extreme cases, acute brain haemorrhage, which can lead to death.’ Boxing virtually disappeared from state schools in the 1960s because of safety fears. But the Schools Amateur Boxing Association (SABA) says more than 1,000 teachers have now been trained to coach lessons, with hundreds of children aged 11 to 18 competing. In four secondary schools in Manchester, about 240 girls are learning boxing in lessons, with at  least 20 signed up for extra-curricular clubs.

The mother of a four-year-old boy who died in a hospital embroiled in a cancer care cover-up has condemned  the NHS trust’s failings. Mackenzie Cackett died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at Colchester General Hospital. Yesterday, a damning report into care at Colchester revealed several patients like Mackenzie may have died after enduring lengthy waiting times for treatment. Poignant: The Duchess of Cambridge paid a bedside visit to Mackenzie Cackett in March 2012 - two months before died of a brain tumour after a series of appalling delays to his treatment at Colchester General Hospital . Police have been called in over claims staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ by managers into covering up the extent of the crisis. Two months before Mackenzie died, a touching picture was taken of him with the Duchess of Cambridge, who visited him in a nearby hospice. The extraordinary suggestion by the healthcare watchdog, the CQC, is that officials falsified data to make it look as if crucial targets were met. Some desperately ill patients were forced to wait up to four months for urgent cancer care. Last night Mackenzie’s mother Danielle Uren said it was ‘terrifying’ to think how many cancer patients might have suffered. ‘The thing is, it wasn’t just Mackenzie,’ she said. ‘It is upsetting. What else will come out of the woodwork? It is scary.’ Series of blunders: Mackenzie with his father James Cackett and his mother Danielle Uren. They believe their son may still be alive today had it not been for delays to his diagnosis and treatment for cancer at the hospital . Colchester Hospital has admitted . making ‘administrative errors’ in Mackenzie’s case which meant crucial . appointments were never made and the little boy’s diagnosis and . treatment was delayed. But . it was only yesterday – after the publication of the damning report – . that the family from Halstead, Essex, learned that the problems went . much deeper. The CQC said . the records of 22 patients had been changed to cover up the fact they . had faced ‘extensive’ delays for treatment – which could have put their . lives at risk. Some were facing delays of almost four months for . life-saving treatment. Government . guidelines state patients should wait no longer than 31 days for . surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy after their doctor has decided on . the best course of treatment. The . investigation also found that staff had been ‘pressured, bullied and . harassed’ to change figures on cancer waiting times to meet government . targets. This is the text of the letter from the Duchess of Cambridge after she learned of Mackenzie’s death: . Dear James and Danielle . I was so desperately sorry to hear the devastating news about Mackenzie’s death. It was an incredible honour to have met Mackenzie when I came to The Treehouse earlier this year, and I was totally bowled over by his courage, his strength of spirit, and his brilliant sense of humour. I will remember very fondly his love of Sponge Bob Square Pants, and his gorgeous smile, which never seemed to leave his face.You have my deepest and most heartfelt condolences, . Catherine . Mackenzie’s parents believe he may still be alive had it not been for delays to his diagnosis and treatment. Miss Uren took Mackenzie to the A&E department in September 2010 because he was vomiting and complaining of headaches. But although he was given blood tests and an X-ray, no follow-up appointments were made. Further administrative blunders led to . a crucial scan of his head and spine being delayed for four weeks and . he was eventually diagnosed with cancer in February 2011 – seven months . after first going to the GP. And when his symptoms returned in September 2011, doctors initially dismissed them as unrelated and sent him home. He was diagnosed with the secondary tumour in January 2012 after he woke up paralysed – within four months he was dead. Just two months before he died in May last year, Mackenzie was visited by the Duchess of Cambridge at his hospice. She . was said to have been ‘touched’ by his plight, and after he died she . wrote a moving letter of condolence to his family, telling them she had . been ‘desperately sorry’ to hear of his death. ‘Mackenzie . is just another statistic as far as the hospital is concerned,’ Miss . Uren said in February. ‘The treatment by Colchester Hospital has caused . so much upset and guilt. They have avoided blame and it’s unacceptable.’ At risk: Staff at Colchester Hospital University . NHS Foundation Trust said they were 'pressured' into changing patients' data to imply they were treated within national guideline . 'Shocking': Sir Mike Richards, left, chief inspector of hospitals, urged Monitor, the foundation hospitals watchdog, to put Colchester University NHS Trust in special measures. Trust chief executive Gordon Coutts, right, issued an apology to patients who did not receive the 'high quality of care they should have expected' The . CQC found that at least three of the 22 patients whose records were . changed waited more than 100 days for treatment, including one who . waited 126 days. Although . Mackenzie is not one of the patients identified in the report, the . hospital has launched a separate investigation into his death over . concerns that ‘administrative errors’ led to delays in diagnosis and . treatment. Patients suspected of having cancer who have been referred by their GP should wait a maximum of two weeks to see a specialist, according to the NHS cancer strategy set out in 2011. Cancer patients should wait no more than 31 days from the decision to treat their cancer to the start of their first treatment, such as chemotherapy, which should then be delivered within the following 31 days. This means all patients should wait no more than 62 days from their urgent GP referral to the completion of the first phase of their treatment. When hospitals are unable to treat patients within the target timeframe they have a duty to investigate and offer alternative hospitals. Professor Sir . Mike Richards, the Government’s chief inspector of hospitals who is . based at the CQC, said: ‘It is shocking to think that people’s lives may . have been put at risk for the sake of the waiting time figures. 'If . you are diagnosed with cancer you are entitled to think that your . hospital will do all they can to ensure you get treatment you need as . soon as possible.’ The CQC spoke to three members of staff who were asked by bosses to change figures on waiting times. Sir . Mike has urged Monitor, the watchdog for foundation hospitals, to put . the Colchester Hospital University NHS Trust in special measures which . would see it being taken over by a hit squad. If Monitor agrees, the organisation will become the eighth foundation trust to be taken over following concerns of poor care. It . is rare for the CQC to refer a hospital trust to the police and they . are called in to investigate only the most serious cases. Trust . chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts said: ‘We are very concerned by the . findings of the CQC report. 'We are truly sorry that in some cases cancer . patients, their carers and families have not always received the high . quality of care that they should have expected from our trust.’ Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Christina McAnea, Unison's national secretary for health, said  union members blew the whistle. She said: 'They were admin workers, . bullied by managers into falsifying data. 'I think this is serious enough that it does merit a police . investigation. 'We think there should be police investigation – and a . complete change in way junior members of staff are spoken to. This is about people in every pay grade in hospital speaking . out when things go wrong.' Bernard Jenkin, MP for North Essex, added:  'The chief executive was aware of whistle blower, and thought it had been dealt with. He deeply regrets and apologises for the fact he didn’t personally pursue it. 'Why have we got a health service in which people feel justified falsifying records to make things seem better? 'We mustn’t replace values with targets. ‘This is a terrible indictment of the culture that has grown up in the health service over a long time. ‘There's no escaping from the fact that this is completely inexcusable, everyone acknowledges that.' Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Gordon Coutts said it was 'regrettable' that a 2012 internal review failed to address the issues. 'This report is awful reading. I want to apologise to patients because we have let them down by having these delays,' he told BBC Radio Essex. 'Yes, there was an investigation carried out by two members of my executive team at the time - in February of 2012 - and that review was not adequate. 'It wasn't robust enough and it didn't go deep enough and that is regrettable.'

Tourism is worth billions of pounds to the Caribbean every year but after 2010's devastating earthquake and years of escalating crime, Haiti has been left behind. Now the government is attempting to rebuild the country by redeveloping the once buoyant tourism industry. The Dominican Republic, which shares an island with Haiti, attracted 1.7million visitors in the first four months of this year alone. Tourist push: Haiti's Club Indigo beach resort is relatively empty in peak times but the government is hoping it can emulate its Caribbean neighbours by attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors a year . Packed: Haiti wants to build its economy on tourism, like the Dominican Republic, which attracted 1.7million visitors in the first four months of this year alone . Haitians hope jobs will be creating by emulating their neighbour and growing the economy on the back of its paradise beaches and weather. However, critics of the policy say it is moving too fast when much of the country is still lacking basics during as paved roads, drinking water and reliable electricity. Crime, health scares, hurricanes and . the monster earthquake of January 2010 have badly damaged the tourism . that was once a mainstay of the Haitian economy, attracting the likes of . Mick Jagger and Jackie Onassis. The Government is hoping a Venezuelan-financed $13.2million (£8.7million) airport . and new infrastructure on the southern island of Ile-a-Vache, and an $8million (£5.3million) development of the historic coastal town of Jacmel will help reverse the trend. However, it is a big challenge. The Club Indigo beach resort north of the Haiti capital Port-au-Prince is crowded with U.N. peacekeepers, aid workers, diplomats and missionaries, rather than tourists. Officials say the tourism push will . create more than 1,600 direct jobs and 6,500 indirect jobs. Tourism . generated $200million last year, Tourism Minister Stephanie Villedrouin said. The country's entire budget is $3billion. Haiti was once a haunt of the rich and famous who came in search of late-night Voodoo ceremonies and rum-fueled revelry. But an AIDS scare in the early 1980s sent the tourists packing, and years of political instability continued to keep them away. Investment: Officials say building of more resorts like this one in Montrouis, will create 1,600 direct jobs . Picturesque: Haiti wants to see itself on its glorious beaches, such as the Raymond les Bains beach (pictured) Jobs: A water taxi waits for customers at the Wahoo Bay Beach hotel in Montrouis, Haiti. Many Haitians welcome anything that will create jobs but some say the tourism push is too soon . Officials say the 2010 earthquake killed 316,000 people, and a cholera outbreak nine months later took more than 7,750 lives. Today, the only mass tourism - 600,000 a . year, according to Villedrouin - comes from cruise ships stopping at . Labadie on the north coast where passengers can frolic for a few hours . in a fenced-in resort. Sen. Francois Anick Joseph said: 'There are a lot of things that need to be done before we can attract . tourists,"" he said in a telephone interview.' But steps are being made. The Tourism Ministry's budget has more than doubled. Under the previous government it was $2million (£1.3million) plus a $1million (£670,000) loan from Venezuela's PetroCaribe oil fund. Now it's $4.7million (£3.1million), and Petrocaribe is paying $27million (£18million) to finance development on projects that include Ile-a-Vache and in Jacmel. It says it has signed off on 15-year tax breaks and exemptions from import duties for 11 hotel and resort projects costing a total of $160million (£107million), with nearly $100million (67million) more in the pipeline or completed. It is also training a force of 53 . 'tourism police officers' who will learn Spanish and English and be . trained in first aid and customer service. Devastation: More than 300,000 people died in the 2010 earthquake that flattened whole neighbourhoods . Too soon? Critics say the government should ensure there are countrywide pavements and clean water first . While many in Haiti welcome anything that can create jobs, some worry that the country isn't ready for a tourist invasion. The Tourism Ministry says it has only . 3,200 hotel rooms and U.S. and Canadian travel advisories say medical . services are woefully lacking. The UK's Foreign Office advises against all travel to the country's slum districts and advises caution in visits to other parts of Haiti. The government hopes to double the number of hotel rooms in two years. But the critics say Haiti first has to improve its infrastructure. Tourism Minister Stephanie Villedrouin says Haiti has to stand on its own feet. 'If we want to be a sovereign country, if we don't want to depend on other countries, we need to figure out ourselves how to move forward and how to get revenue, and tourism must be no.1 on the list,' she said. Each hotel room built creates two jobs and four indirect jobs, she said. Last year the U.S. State Department designated Haiti a 'major drug trafficking country.' Meanwhile, the country faces tough competition from Caribbean neighbours offering cheaper holiday deals. Air Transat, a Canadian charter carrier, flies weekly between Montreal and Port-au-Prince, and says it has brought in 120 tourists this year on holiday packages in Haiti costing $1,399 to $1,600.","The Haitian government wants to hook country's growth on tourism .

A cannabis dealer who claimed he grew the drug to ease his back pain has been caught out after video emerged of him snowboarding on holiday. Keith DelaraBond, 34, was jailed for two years when it emerged that his back injury was less serious than he'd pretended. He had told a judge he took the drugs to control his sciatica following a back injury which left him in constant pain. But Judge Trevor Faber rejected this after he watched a video of DelaraBond on a 14-week snowboarding course in the Canadian Rockies. Another video was also played to the judge, which showed DelaraBond wheel-spinning a powerful 600cc motorbike. DelaraBond was jailed for two years after he admitted growing 64 cannabis plants worth £21,500 at Warwick Crown Court on Tuesday. The court heard he converted the roof space of his home near Leamington Spa in Warwickshire into a large cannabis factory between January 2009 and June last year. The judge told him during sentencing: 'I am satisfied that you had been growing cannabis from before you went to Canada. 'You were growing large quantities on a regular basis, some for your own use but also to supply to others. Busted: A video of DelaraBond snowboarding in the Canadian Rockies scuppered his argument that he needed dope for his back pain . 'You pleaded guilty, but you had little choice other than to plead guilty.' DelaraBond was previously convicted for growing cannabis in 1999, and was given a 12-month prison sentence.

I am glad it was only two years, we thought it might be three. We all just have to move on from here.'",Keith DelaraBond was jailed for two years after admitting growing 64 cannabis plants.

Food manufacturer Kraft has decided to remove artificial food dyes from its popular children’s range of mac and cheese. The packaged food giant claimed the recipe revamp was not in response to a recent petition to remove artificial food colouring which gathered more than 348,000 signatures. Paprika will be among the natural colourings used instead of artificial dyes in the pasta dish aimed at children. Au naturel: Packaged food giant Kraft has decided to remove artificial food dye from its popular children's varieties of mac and cheese . The new recipe, with pasta shapes such as SpongeBob Squarepants and Halloween, is due to hit the shelves next year. The original elbow-shaped macaroni will remain unchanged, the company said. The petition on Change.org urges Kraft to remove artificial food dyes Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 from their macaroni and cheese varieties in America. Vani Hari, the petition’s author, said that artificial dyes had been banned in countries such as Norway and Austria and that it causes hyperactivity and learning difficulties in children. Kraft’s new recipe comes as consumers increasingly opt for more natural, healthier foods. With it there is a growing trend among food manufacturers to adjust their offering to satisfy consumers. PepsiCo said earlier this year that it would remove controversial brominated vegetable oil (BVO) as an ingredient in its Gatorade Sports drink. The company’s move coincided with another Change.org petition which called for the removal of BVO, a flame retardant chemical. Appeasing customers: PepsiCo said it would remove a controversial ingredient from its Gatorade Sports drink (right) while Kraft said it will use natural colourings such as paprika (left) to replace artificial dyes . PepsiCo said it was prompted to change the Gatorade recipe because of customer complaints, not the online petition which recorded more than 206,000 signatures. Kraft vice president of marketing for meals, Triona Schmelter, said that the company was striving to improve the nutritional value in three macaroni and cheese varieties. The new recipes will add whole grains and reduce the sodium and saturated in an attempt to cater to evolving customer preferences, she said. Ms Schmelter said: ‘We’ll continue to make improvement where we can.’ Sarah Kavanagh, author of the Gatorade petition, called it a victory, writing on the website: ‘This is so, so awesome,’ after hearing of PepsiCo’s plans to remove BVO. She said: ‘As someone who loves to drink their products, I'm so glad they're making strides to put as much consideration into their customers' health.’ Growing trend: Food manufacturers are increasingly adjusting their products to satisfy customers who are opting for healthier, more natural food more and more .","Paprika is one of the natural food dyes included in new recipes .

The Kennedy cousin accused of murder has been forced to remain in jail while waiting for his new trial. A judge has lifted a stay meaning that Michael Skakel may be granted bail at a later date, but that still leaves him behind bars for the time being. Judge Thomas Bishop ruled on October 23 that Skakel's trial attorney, Michael Sherman, failed to adequately represent him in 2002 when he was convicted in Martha Moxley's 1975 golf club bludgeoning. Skakel and Moxley were 15-year-old neighbors in wealthy Greenwich at the time of her death. Scroll down for video . In custody: Michael Skakel remains in jail for the time being but may be released on bail while waiting for his appeal trial for a 1975 murder . In removing the stay, Bishop said Sherman's errors were 'substantial and pervasive.' He said he didn't believe Skakel should be required to remain in prison for months or years while his ruling granting a new trial is appealed. 'This case was not a close call for this court,' Bishop said. Bishop said the case was sad for the victim's family. Skakel's attorneys want him to be freed while awaiting a retrial, saying that keeping him in prison would be a miscarriage of justice. Prosecutors objected to the request for bond and are appealing the ruling granting Skakel a new trial. Brutal: Skakel was convicted of murdering his Greenwich, Connecticut neighbor Martha Moxely (pictured) in 1975 by bludgeoning her with his mother's golf club and shoving the shattered shaft into her neck . Skakel, the 53-year-old nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel Kennedy, is serving 20 years to life. He wore handcuffs and leg shackles to court Wednesday and smiled and waved to supporters as he came into the courtroom. His current attorney, Hubert Santos, had filed a motion seeking a $500,000 bond. Santos . pushed for immediate bail, slamming the state's case against Skakel and . noting that Skakel's son was only 4 or 5 when he was sent to prison . more than a decade ago. 'He's entitled to get out as soon as possible,' Santos said, expressing concern that an appeal of the stay decision could take a month or two. Prosecutor Susann Gill said the state's case against Skakel was strong. Prosecutors argued Bishop doesn't have the authority to grant bond because of an automatic stay of his ruling while they appeal. Bishop lifted the stay Wednesday but decided he didn't have the authority to grant bail. 'Whatever inherent authority the court may have it's not unbounded, and I believe it's not applicable to this case,' Bishop said. Gill argued against terminating the stay, saying it would thwart the administration of justice by requiring the state to retry Skakel before an appeal is finished. 'The state is entitled to avail itself of the appellate process and seek vindication of a result it believes to be unjust,' Gill wrote in legal briefs. Case: Skakel's case for a new trial revolves around his defense attorney at the time Mickey Sherman, who Skakel has now successfully convinced a judge was 'too enamored with the media attention to focus on the defense' Thrilled at decision: Robert F. Kennedy Jr spoke to the Today show in his cousin's defense and says he is sure he will be found innocent at the retrial . But Bishop said he addressed that concern by having Skakel agree to waive his right to a speedy trial. Santos said automatic stays during appeals do not apply to cases like Skakel's and even if they did Bishop has the authority to terminate it. Skakel 'has been returned to the status of an innocent defendant awaiting trial,' Santos wrote in court papers, adding he was not a flight risk and contends it's 'highly unlikely' prosecutors will win their appeal. Gill said she disagrees that an appeal likely won't be successful. Sherman, the trial attorney, has said he did all he could to prevent Skakel's conviction. Weapon: This photo evidence used at trial shows the murder weapon, a 6 iron golf club that belonged to the late mother of Tommy and Michael Skakel . Martha Moxley was out causing . mischief on Devil's Night, the night before Halloween, in 1976. She was . ringing doorbells, spraying shaving cream, throwing eggs, and toilet . papering homes in her elite gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. The last house she happened upon was that of Michael and his brother Tommy Skakel. She left no later than 11pm, to walk the 150 yards or so to her neighboring house. But she never got there. Instead, her body was found beneath a tree in her back yard. She had been bludgeoned with a 6 iron golf club so powerfully that the shaft had shattered. Martha had been impaled in the neck with a shard from the shattered club. Her pants had been removed, along with her underwear, but there were no signs of sexual assault. Tommy . and Michael were initially suspects in the case after it was discovered . that the murder weapon had belonged to their late mother.

An 83-year-old man has become Britain's oldest convicted drug dealer after he was caught growing nearly 200 cannabis plants. Francis Cook was jailed for two-and-a-half years after turning to dealing to supplement his pension. His operation was foiled when police raided his bungalow and found books on how to grow the class B drug. Officers seized £1,391 in cash, scales containing traces of cocaine and invoices for equipment from his home. The grey-haired pensioner - nicknamed Snowy - also had keys to an industrial unit in his Ford Escort van. Police searched the unit, in Fareham, Hants, and found 182 skunk plants with a street value of £70,000. Cook’s fingerprints were found on a lightbulb and on one of three separate growing areas. Portsmouth Crown Court heard Cook had been released from prison on licence for others drugs offences. But he returned to crime when he wrongly thought he owed £38,000 for a previous confiscation order made by the courts. In mitigation, it was claimed he was paid just £300 for acting as a caretaker and looking after the crop. Busted: Cook was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison at Portsmouth Crown Court (above) for growing 182 cannabis plants . But Judge Ian Pearson ruled that Cook played a significant role in the operation. Cook, from Fareham, pleaded guilty to one count of producing a class B drug between April and August last year. Judge Pearson said: 'I take account of your age - you are nearly 84 - you must be the country’s oldest drug dealer and you are in ill health. 'Having said that, you have numerous previous convictions for drug offences with numerous custodial  sentences that arose from those offences. 'It’s a very sad day when I have to sentence an 83-year-old, nearly 84-year-old, man for offences like these.' An order was made for the drugs to be forfeited and destroyed. As he begins his sentence, neighbours in Meadowbank Road described their shock that softly-spoken Cook could have concealed such a crime. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'He seemed like a very respectable, elderly gentleman and I never saw anything to suggest he was up to anything dodgy. 'This is a quiet residential street packed with children and elderly people. I didn’t expect a dealer to be living in that house.'",Francis Cook wanted to supplement pension .

And despite a strong opposition from police, Mayor Michael Bloomberg and some of the property owners that have had their buildings used as a canvas, locals are embracing the creative installments of the British prankster while they last. The graffiti artist - whose visit to the Big Apple will culminate on Halloween - has hit all five NYC boroughs over the past few weeks, secretly spraying buildings and walls and posting pictures of the works on his website. But by leaving out the actual addresses, he has started a manhunt among the masses who are keen to see the pieces up close. Those who have located the sites have been busy attempting to create their own photo art.

Some owners, however, are going to great lengths to preserve the artwork. Banksy pieces have sold for up to $2 million. The 'Ghetto 4 Life' piece in the South Bronx, featuring a child purportedly spraying the message on a wall, is being watched by two overnight guards. Building owner David Damaghi said he hired the men in order to protect the painting for as long as possible. Sadly, an amazing sculpture of the Sphinx of Giza, made out foam, cement and cinder-blocks that was erected on a sidewalk in Queens, has already been dismantled.

The first All Hallows Eve-themed piece arrived on Friday and it was by far the most elaborate to date. Situated inside a fenced-off area at Houston and Bowery, it featured a Grim Reaper dummy endlessly riding around in a bumper car. Hundreds of enthusiasts crowded around the chain-link fence eager to nab a photo of the dramatic installation.

Mob: Banksy enthusiast are growing everyday, but they only have five days left. He finished up his work in New York on Halloween . However not everyone is a fan of Banksy. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg publicly condemned the artist, saying that graffiti is not art. 'Art is art, and nobody’s a bigger supporter of the arts than I am,' Bloomberg said this week. 'I just think there are some places for art, and there are some places (for) no art. 'And you running up to someone’s property or public property and defacing it is not my definition of art.' 'Graffiti is a sign of decay.' Not a fan: New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is not in support of Banksy, saying that graffiti is not art, 'it's a sign of decay' Banksy has also clashed with the NYPD. Promising to unveil a new piece every day for the month October, the artist put up a message on his website on Wednesday saying that the day's art had been cancelled 'due to police activity'. Rumors started that Banksy and his two assistants had been busted in Brooklyn's 79th precinct, which covers the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. It was also reported that the NYPD were actively hunting him, hoping to shut down his operation. However the police said there was no such vendetta.

Elizabeth Smart's sister Mary Katherine has long been seen in the kidnapping victim's shadow, but after her appearance during an hour-long special about the ordeal, it is clear that she is all grown up. Mary Katherine spoke to Meredith Vieira about the night in June 2002 when her sister was taken from the bed they shared and how she tried her best to go unnoticed. 'If he realizes I'm awake, maybe he'll take me as well and then my family will never know what happened to us,' she recalls thinking to herself. All grown up: Mary Katherine Smart talked about how she heard the man taking her sister Elizabeth from the bed they shared when they were children in 2002 . Then and now: Mary Katherine was 9 when the kidnapping occurred (left) and now she is 20-years-old (right) Mary Katherine was only 9-years-old when her then-14-year-old sister Elizabeth was taken by Brian David Mitchell. Now she is all grown up and 20-years-old, with long blonde hair just like her older sister. During the NBC interview, which aired Friday night, Mary Katherine and her mother Lois told how the beginning of that horrible night was a normal one in the Smart household. She and her sister shared a bed, and Elizabeth was happily playing the big-sister role by reading Ella Enchanted to Mary Katherine. She recalled: 'I was begging and crying and just so scared. I remember thinking, I know what comes after a wedding. And that cannot happen to me. That cannot happen' Bond of sisters: On the night of her kidnapping, Elizabeth had stayed up late reading to Mary Katherine from Ella Enchanted . In the middle of the night, a man walked into their room and threatened Elizabeth with a knife against her neck. 'I felt immediately awake. I could feel or sense my sister lying in bed next to me, she was asleep. I was so scared,' Elizabeth said during the interview. Mary Katherine told Vieira that she tried to lay as still as possible to make sure that she would not get taken as well, but then still knew she needed to get out of bed eventually to help her sister. 'I was just trying to work up enough courage to run into my parents room and tell them what happened,' she said. When she went into her parents' bedroom and raised the alarm- saying simply 'Elizabeth's gone'- it didn't seem real to her parents. Holding out hope: Mary Katherine was the one who remembered- four months after Elizabeth had been taken- that the captor could have been the man named Emmanuel who had done some handiwork around the house . 'Hearing those words coming from a sound sleep, it's like ""Oh, she's had a bad dream"" and when she continued ""No, she really is gone,"" I got up and went running down the stairs and my first view was at the window and the screen was, I could tell it had been cut,' Lois said. Not only was Mary Katherine the one to first alert her parents, but she ended up being the one to provide the pivotal final clue. Four months after her sister had been taken, Mary Katherine suddenly realized that she remembered the man who was in their bedroom that night. 'I was just waiting for my dad to come in to tuck me into bed. I was just thinking like maybe who could it possibly be and Emmanuel just popped into my head,' she said. Critical: Mary Katherine helped them come up with the sketch that they released, which later helped them identify Elizabeth's captor- Brian David Mitchell . Emmanuel was the name that Brian David Mitchell had told the Smarts when they offered to pay him to do some handiwork around the house after Lois saw him begging on the street months before the kidnapping. With Mary Katherine's realization, the Smarts were able to get a sketch of Mitchell and pushed for police to immediately release it. Officials were hesitant because they were following another lead, but eventually they succumbed and the sketch aired on America's Most Wanted. A short while later, a woman called in a tip saying that she thought she spotted that man in a Utah Walmart. She ended up being right, and when Mitchell, his wife Wanda Barzee and a well-covered Smart were brought into a police station, the kidnapped teenager was finally reunited with her father.","Mary Katherine shared a bed with Elizabeth and was in the room when her sister was kidnapped .

A family of wild African elephants has taken up residence in a Florida citrus grove.The National Elephant Center in Fellesmere opened earlier this year and the 225-acre facility became home to a family group of elephants: two mature females, Thandi and Moyo, and two adolescent males, Tufani and Tsavo, the offspring of Thandi, in May.The center aims to provide a home to any elephant in need and one day will be home to up to 45 elephants. Gentle giants: Jeff Bolling, CEO of the National Elephant Center checks the tusks of one of the four African elephants living on 225 acres in the heart of Florida's citrus grove region . Close-knit: The family group of four elephants spend their days roaming, wallowing, eating and interacting with each other . The site has been created especially for elephants, with water holes and habitats idea for foraging and mud-wallowing - two popular elephant activities. The abundance of citrus fruit doesn't hurt, either. Formerly a citrus plantation, there are juicy oranges ripe for the picking all over the site. John Lehnhardt, the executive director of the center, says Moyo was the first to discover the fruit. 'She sucked the orange to the end of her trunk, which is really part of their nose, and she picked it from the tree, put it in her mouth, and I just saw her eyes light up like, ""Oh my,""' Lehnhardt told NBC. 'They all started picking oranges like crazy.' Thandi and Moyo have been best friends since they were both orphaned by poachers as calves in Zimbabwe in the 1980s. Lehnhardt says the friendship has helped them deal with the 'enormous trauma' the pair has endured. Wide open spaces: The center is the only one operated by the U.S. zoo community to house displaced elephants . Bow down: One of the elephants allows Jeff Bolling to inspect it . After their families were killed, Thandi and Moyo were sold to a Washington zoo in 1983 before being sold on to Disney's Animal Kingdom in 1997. According to NBC, Disney allowed the four elephants to move to the National Elephant Center so that they could enjoy time together as a family before Tufani, 10, leaves the herd. Male elephants separate from their herds as teenagers or are pushed out by the family matriarch. Lehnhardt says the center will be a home for aging elephants from zoos around the country, but unlike a zoo, the center is not open to the public. 'We just want elephants to be elephants. They are family oriented. They're honest and straightforward. We should learn from them,' he told NBC. The Center for Conservation Biology reports that elephants in Africa are being killed as a rate of 35,000 to 50,000 per year for their ivory.","The National Elephant Center opened on a former citrus grove earlier this year .

The morning talk show host said that her 83-year-old husband could not remember whether or not he had an affair with Johnny Carson's second wife, as Carson's friend alleged in a new tell-all book. The affair between former NFL star Gifford and Joanne Carson reportedly took place in 1970, while Gifford was married to his first wife Maxine. Gifford married Maxine, his college sweetheart, in 1952 and were together for 26 years which means that the alleged Carson affair would have come during that time. Now, two wives later, it was up to Kathie Lee to answer the claims when she took her desk on the Today Show this morning. On defense: Frank Gifford's alleged affair with Joanne Carson reportedly took place in 1970 during his first marriage but today his third wife Kathie Lee had to explain the situation during her show . In Happier Times: Johnny Carson and his bride, actress-model JoAnne Copeland, are shown after their marriage in August 1963 at left, and Frank Gifford is seen at right in his NY Giants uniform that same year . 'I got the call and Frank was still asleep and... (she said) ""Tell me, tell me! It was a long time ago. Did you have an affair with her?""' she recalled saying. '""I can't remember, maybe?""' she said as her husband's response. 'No it's not true,' she followed up quickly. She was clear not to make total light of the claims, however, as she even threw in a jab about her husband's much publicized affair with a stewardess during their own marriage that was made public after it was revealed that the woman was paid by a tabloid to arrange the trysts. 'Although the man is capable of it as you know. It's not- he was friends with Joanne,' Kathie Lee said . Still together: This is not the first time that infidelity has been an issue for the former NFL star as his marriage to Kathie Lee (seen together in April) was rocked in 1997 from an affair . Reading the news: Kathie Lee opened up about the issue during her portion of the Today Show on Tuesday . Expressive: Kathie Lee made light of the alleged affair, saying that her husband can't remember . 1952: Frank Gifford marries college sweetheart Maxine Ewart. This was the same year he joined the NFL as a first-round draft pick. The couple had two sons- Jeff and Kyle- and a daughter Vicki who married Robert Kennedy's son Michael in 1981. They separated when it was revealed that he had an affair with their teenage babysitter. He died months later during a game of ski-football with relatives. 1970: When Frank allegedly had an affair with Joanne Carson, the second wife of Johnny. 1976: Frank and Maxine divorce. 1978: Frank marries Astrid Lindley. 1982: Frank meets Kathie Lee Johnson on the set of Good Morning America and they maintain a four year friendship. 1986: Frank divorces Astrid, and marries Kathie Lee on October 16 of the same year. 1997: Flight attendant Suzen Johnson is paid a reported $75,000 by tabloid The Globe to tape two trysts with Frank. Co-host Hoda Kotb held up one of the . local newspapers that had the story splayed across the front page where . Gifford is pictured with his then-wife Maxine and Joanne Carson is . pictured with her then-husband, famed Tonight Show host Johnny. Kotb mentioned that she thought that was Joanne in both pictures, and Kathie Lee was quick to note the similarities. 'She does look a little like Joanne doesn't she?' she said. 'It's never a dull moment in our house!' The news of the alleged Gifford-Carson affair broke on Monday when Carson's friend Henry Bushkin released an excerpt of his tell-all book where he details how he and Johnny broke into a secret apartment that Joanne was leasing without his knowledge. 'I have reason to believe my wife is cheating on me,' Carson reportedly told Bushkin. 'I also have an idea who the son of a b**** is that she's shacking up with.' When they arrived at the apartment and . saw six or seven framed photos of Gifford, who was also on television . as a frequent commenter for Monday Night Football, Carson began to cry. Now 70-years-old, Bushkin's . revelatory tale is just one of many he recounts in his memoir, 'Johnny .

Gifford's . well-publicized infidelities of the past add some semblance of . credibility to the claims, as his affair with flight attendant Suzen . Johnson in 1997 was splashed across New York City papers throughout the . ordeal. It came after he and Kathie Lee touted the strength of their marriage in infomercials for a marriage counselor and after they both told different versions of their personal histories in their respective biographies. According to a 1997 article in People Magazine, Frank wrote about his cheating past but said that his third wife, Kathie Lee, cured him of that. 'I get along great with women, but there's no sexual undercurrent anymore,' he wrote in his 1994 biography. Kathie .

Britons have enjoyed an extra hour in bed as the clocks went back to mark the end of summertime today. At 2am, clocks were wound back to 1am as Greenwich Mean Time returned. The change spells darker evenings until they are put forward again in March next year. The Daylight Saving Bill was introduced in 1916 by the House of Commons. Ian Westworth turns back Big Ben's hands. At 2am, clocks were wound back to 1am as Greenwich Mean Time returned . For some, it brings a heady excitement that Christmas is just a few short shopping weeks away. For others, it heralds months of doom and gloom until we see the sun again. Debating the effects of turning the clocks back has been a British pastime for more than a century, when the first Daylight Saving Bill was brought before the House of Commons. During the Second World War the Government moved the clocks forward one hour to help munitions factories maximise productivity and allow people to get home safely before the blackout. Between 1968 and 1971 the Government carried out the same experiment but was forced to end it after complaints in Scotland and northern England. The Daylight Saving Bill was introduced in 1916 by the House of Commons. Plans have also been mooted to move to Central European Time - something that would mean lighter winter evenings, which supporters claim would cut road deaths, boost tourism and reduce energy use. But the proposals have faced opposition from many in Scotland who do not relish the prospect of an extra hour of darkness in the morning. Clocks should have been put back 60 minutes at 2am this morning as the UK reverted to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).","At 2am, clocks were wound back to 1am as Greenwich Mean Time returned .

What started last March as lower back pain for a Maryland woman took only weeks to leave her paralyzed from the chest down – and ended with thousands of strangers paying her medical bills. Melissa Smith, already a two-time cancer survivor at the age of 26, was diagnosed by doctors at Johns Hopkins Hospital, in Baltimore, with Transverse Myelitis. The disease causes the immune system to attack the spinal cord, leading to paralysis. Unable to keep her head above water in a sea of medical bills, Ms Smith soon found herself in massive debt. Relief soon came in the most unlikely form, online donations from random strangers – donations now reach into the hundreds of thousands, she told The Blaze. Down but not out: Melissa Smith may not ever be able to walk again, but it hasn't robbed her of living her life . Stephanie Smith pitched her sister’s plight to Chive Charities for months. The website is a hub for publicizing people’s stories and helping them raise money. After months of pitching, the site agreed to take them on. Thousands were raised within minutes of the story going live, Stephanie Smith told the site.Soon the zeroes started multiplying. ‘When we started the reading the day the story went live, Chive told me to go to the GoFundMe site and I had like 40 people around me and I was thinking to myself, ‘Obviously we just finished reading, no one could have donated yet,’ she said. ‘It was almost to 10k when we shifted to that page!’ She gratefully added. ‘I cried, I was so shocked. I never imagined I could touch so many people.’ She'll never walk again: Melissa Smith is adjusting to her new reality, and plans to use the money for things that will make her life easier, including a new handicap-friendly home . Strangers have donated over $400,000 to help pay Melissa Smith’s medical bills. ‘I am so thankful and feel so blessed, so lucky, so loved and so honored that they chose me and believe in me so much,’ Stephanie Smith continued. ‘That’s what means so much to me, everyone has so much faith in me and its helping me find a little more faith In myself that I lost a little bit the last 18 months or so,’ she added. Proper attire required: Ms Smith can only stand wearing a special suit . The thankful sisters respond to every email they receive. ‘I don’t really know how to appropriately thank every single person for giving me that faith back and all of their support,’ said Stephanie Smith. ‘It truly has touched my heart so deeply and just want to give back in any way that I can for the rest of all time,’ she added. The ailing woman plans to use the money for a standing frame, another wheelchair, pay some of the medical debt and put a down payment on a handicap-friendly home, the two women told the site. Despite all the outpouring of goodwill, the former nursing student – she was booted from the program – still has difficulties coming to grips with her new reality. ‘I still have days where I worry about if someone will want to be with me, will I have a family, what am I going to do for a living now,’ she said. ‘I have a lot of fears but I’m in a very different place now than I was one year ago’ she added. ‘I wasn’t sure if I could handle my own life this time last year.’","Melissa Smith, 26, was diagnosed with Transverse Myelitis - a disease that causes the immune system to attack the spinal cord .

Criticised: John Bercow came under fire last night over the £7million plan for classrooms in Parliament . Speaker John Bercow came under fire last night over a £7million plan for classrooms in Parliament. He is backing plans for a new education centre dubbed ‘Bercow’s Folly’ to encourage thousands more schoolchildren to visit the Commons. But the centre, earmarked for land next to the Palace of Westminster overlooking the Thames, will cost £1 million a year to run on top of the £7million building costs. And some MPs say the scheme cannot be justified while taxpayers are still tightening their belts. Tory MP Jake Berry, parliamentary aide to Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps, said: ‘Squandering this amount of taxpayers’ money on classrooms is outrageous. 'At a time when Parliament itself is reducing its running costs, it is beyond belief.’ The Speaker last night hit back, with officials saying the education centre idea has already been ‘unanimously’ backed by key MPs. The row erupted after the Commons finance committee – meeting behind closed doors – was shown detailed plans for the education centre. MPs heard it involved building a classroom complex next to the House of Lords, complete with a new security entrance. It would be a temporary structure because the entire Palace could be refurbished in 10 years’ time and the centre might need to be relocated. The aim is to more than double the current 45,000-a-year visits to Parliament by schoolchildren and students. But three Tory MPs present at the finance meeting asked to be recorded as opposing the plan. Concern: MPs Jake Berry, left, and Barry Sheerman, right, have questioned whether the project is justified . The Mail on Sunday understands that . they thought it was a ‘nice idea’ – but also argued it was inappropriate . when Parliament itself was cutting its budget. The . MPs have declined to comment but Mr Berry, who is not a member of the . finance committee, openly said the project should be ditched. Labour MP Barry Sheerman, former chairman of the Commons education committee, also questioned whether it was justified. He said: ‘I support improving facilities for schoolchildren. But when services to MPs themselves are being cut back, we have to review going ahead with this scheme.’ Last night, a spokesman for Mr Bercow said the principle of creating a dedicated education centre had already been ‘unanimously approved’ by the ruling House of Commons Commission. He said the plan would allow an extra 55,000 young people a year to visit Parliament. The spokesman said: ‘Involving and enthusing young people in this way is key to addressing currently low levels of democratic engagement.’ The row comes after Mr Bercow enraged Tory MPs last week by rebuking David Cameron after he called Ed Miliband ‘a conman’ at Prime Minister’s Questions. However, other MPs insist Mr Bercow was right to rule that Mr Cameron’s ‘conman’ jibe was unparliamentary.","John Bercow is backing plans for the new £7million education centre .

Mr Denulder said: 'My daughter has got a leopard print coat that keeps her dry and warm. 'The . school want all the pupils to have a dark coloured coat, but when . children are walking home from school in the dark, it would be better . for them to wear more visible clothing. 'Simone's coat isn't brightly . coloured, it just makes her easier for drivers to spot in the evenings. It's just the same as any other coat - it's just that it's leopard . print. 'What's the difference? It's not offensive.' The school, which caters for 620 pupils aged between 11 and 16, claims the coat 'did not conform' to it's 'strict dress code'.

Simon Denulder banned his daughters Kelsey, 15, and Simone, 12, (pictured with their mother Kelly Shaw) from school after the latter was told she couldn't wear the coat . 'All parents and students were informed of the code in the summer. Was father right to pull both daughters out of school after one was banned from wearing leopard print coat? 'AGS students wear their uniform with pride and it is integral to the strong work ethic and successful ethos of the school. 'Mr Denulder was informed recently that a coat worn to school was inappropriate. This is because it did not conform to the school dress code.

Ash Green School in Coventry said the coat was 'inappropriate' and 'did not conform to the school's strict dress code' 'We would hope that Mr Denulder will decide to send his children back to a highly successful school.' After discussing the matter last week Mr Denulder agreed to return older daughter Kelsey to school ahead of her GCSEs, but not until after half term.

Avid fans of one red headed blogger were left bemused as Facebook linked her posts to a ‘similar’ page – that of a flame-haired porn star. Erika Napoletano, an author, marketing expert and former TEDTalk speaker, who blogs at RedHead Writing, realised when the social media giant gets it wrong, they get it very wrong. The site’s targeted advertising algorithms, used to tailor the ads a person sees on their page, suggested fans of RedHead Writing might also be interested in Camille Crimson’s page. Mix up: Blogger and marketing executive Erika Napoletano was bombarded with messages to say Facebook's targeted advertising was linking her blog page with that of Canadian porn star Camille Crimson . There Camille, a Canadian model, web developer and editor, says ‘I write on my blog about sexy things,’ describing herself as a ‘geeky redhead b***job devotee’. The social networking site linked Miss Crimson’s pages, which have 15,000 likes, ‘The Art of B***job’ and ‘Slow-Motion B***job’ with Miss Napoletano’s blog page, which has 11,000 likes. Writing her RedHead blog, Ms Napoletano, from Denver, Colorado, said: ‘For the past few weeks, I’ve gotten a flood (a metric f**kton, if you will) of emails, Facebook messages, and wall posts from readers informing me of the following: . 'Seth Stern: Speaking of branding, this “Similar to Redhead writing… Camille Crimson”, was posted immediately under this post in my news feed. ‘Two thoughts, #1, Facebook is sentient and knows what I want. #2, Facebook is drunk.’ But days later, taking the mix up in . good spirits, she took to her Facebook page posting: ‘Since Facebook . thinks I’m a porn star, I decided to rebrand. Enjoy today’s blog.’ Seductive: Flame-haired porn star Camille Crimson blasted the 'Facebook FAIL' The red head then added a gallery of seductive shots of her posing on a bed, topless and covering her modesty with her arm. She said: ‘Now, Camille’s a pretty hot sandwich and I’m flattered that Facebook thinks we’re similar. ‘After . all we are both redheads. We both have freckles. Might I also say that . we both respectively have a nice set of boobs? And we’re both industry . professionals.’ Initially Miss Napoletano assumed her fellow red head must have launched an advertising campaign targeting keywords and interest, including red hair or redhead. But she added: ‘Camille (a very lovely lady) contacted me and said she’s not running Facebook ads. So yeah – this is all the work of Facebook’s awesome algorithms. They’re drunk. How awesome is that?!’ Taking to her Facebook page, Camille Crimson added: ‘Facebook decided that this (non-porn) red head, Redhead Writing and I have similar pages. ‘She wrote a great piece about our common trait: our hair! 'Plus, she took some beautiful photos to highlight our potential similarities, (to clarify, I didn't buy any Facebook ads. Facebook FAIL).’ A Facebook spokesperson said: 'At Facebook we're always trying to help people discover things that might be interesting to them. 'We use some pretty smart, complex technology that gets it right most of the time. In this case, the technology made an unfortunate comparison. 'It's definitely not a reflection on Erika and we're glad she took it in good humour. We're satisfied that this is a pretty rare case.'","Adult actress's page linked to blog .

It has been a long-running passion and project for Emma Thompson – but two years after filming wrapped on her period drama Effie Gray, the movie has yet to be shown to the public. Two festival screenings in America have just been cancelled due to mysterious ‘unforeseen circumstances’ – five months after its much lauded Cannes premiere was also cancelled. Thompson not only stars in the drama about the love triangle between Victorian art critic John Ruskin,  his virginal wife Effie Gray and pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais, but also wrote the screenplay. Dakota Fanning (right) plays Effie Gray alongside Emma Thompson as Lady Eastlake. The film has yet to be shown to the public after a series of screenings were cancelled . However, her script has been the subject of a fierce legal battle, with American writer Gregory Murphy alleging that Thompson drew inspiration from his first play, The Countess, which had a brief run in London’s West End in 2005. Producers insist that although the film was pulled from the International Hamptons Film Festival in Long Island and the Mill Valley Film Festival in California, there was no legal bar to it being screened. A New York judge declared the script was ‘not substantially similar’ to Murphy’s work. After the ruling, Thompson pursued Murphy for £100,000 in costs. However the playwright has lodged an appeal, claiming that the ruling was flawed. American writer Gregory Murphy has claimed that the script, about a Victorian love scandal involving the title character (pictured) drew on his work The Countess and though a New York judge has ruled otherwise he is appealing the decision . The producers of Effie Gray must respond by next month but have apparently asked for an extension. The film stars Thompson’s husband, Greg Wise, as Ruskin; Dakota Fanning in the title role; and Tom Sturridge as Millais. Thompson plays fellow critic Lady Eastlake. The story scandalised Victorian society. In 1848, Ruskin married the 19-year-old Effie Gray – but after six unhappy years, she fell in love with her husband’s protege, Millais, and had the marriage annulled on the basis she was still a virgin – something confirmed by two doctors. It was said that Ruskin, who had seen naked women only in paintings, was repulsed by his wife’s pubic hair and refused to touch her. After Murphy first made his allegations, Thompson agreed to an extraordinary meeting with him at her London home in 2009, as first revealed in The Mail on Sunday. But after that failed to resolve the issue, the actress took Murphy to court, leading to the ruling that the American is now contesting.","Emma Thompson wrote and starred in Effie Gray due to debut at Cannes .

But for diver Tony Neal there’s one inspiring picture that has well and truly got under his skin. The underwater photographer so liked an image taken of him swimming over a wreck that he endured more than 30 hours of extreme agony to have the image recreated in stunning detail on his back. The picture, taken by fellow underwater photographer Alex Mustard, shows Mr Neal hovering above the sunken Royal Navy submarine  HMS E49 during a trip to the Shetlands in 2011. The E49 sank after hitting a mine in March 1917. There were no survivors. Underwater photographer Tony Neal was photographed by Alex Mustard above the wreck of the submarine E49 during a trip to the Shetlands in 2011. Tony has spent two years having the image recreated as a tattoo by artist Kirsty Peake, spending around 30 hours under the needle as the ink was added . Diver: Tony Neal (pictured) wanted the tattoo as a reminder of the dive and as a tribute to his father, John . Mr Neal, from Northampton, had the scene recreated in amazing detail by tattoo artist Kirsty Peake and ‘framed’ in an outline of an  oxygen tank. It took Kirsty several sessions spread over two years to complete the amazing blue and green tattoo. Mr Neal wanted it both to remember the dive and as a memorial to his dying father John, a former police officer. He said: ‘My dad had just found out he had cancer when I was about to go diving in the Shetlands, but he insisted I continue. When he saw Alex’s beautiful photograph of me in a diving magazine, his whole face lit up. Sadly he died last Christmas, aged 63, but the tattoo will always remind me of him.’ Mr Neal admitted the process had been ‘excruciatingly painful’. The blue ink was inserted into his skin with a ‘magnum’  tattoo needle – 49 points bunched together. He added: ‘I am glad to have done it, but I have no plans to have another one.’","Tony Neal got image inked on his back in tribute to his father .

"PUBLISHED: . 16:22 EST, 26 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:49 EST, 26 October 2013 . A man dubbed the 'glam scammer' has been arrested in Louisiana in the midst of allegedly planning an elaborate Halloween party that would enable him to fleece locals out of thousands of dollars. The man taken in by U.S. marshals was Michael Manos, 49, who is accused of leaving a trail of debt and despair in his wake right across the country. According to police, his modus operandi involves arriving in town, turning up in all the right places and being flashy and ostentatious, before charming the locals with tales of celebrity and reality TV shows. What happens on Bourbon St: Michael Manos rented an apartment on Bourbon St and took in all the locals with his ruse . He then allegedly uses his new-found friends to provide donations and services for flashy fundraisers, pocketing the money and skipping town. He has even duped actress Jane Fonda, who is pictured embracing the flamboyant con at a series of red carpet events, according to reports. The New Orleans Advocate reports that for his latest scam in New Orleans, Manos posed as Michael Morgan, a grandson of banking mogul J.P. Morgan. To add authenticity, he engaged real estate agents to find him a local property for purchase for the sum of around $2 million. He also held casting calls for a reality TV show he claimed would soon be shot about his life, called 'Bourbon Street,' with the tagline 'What happens in the street, stays in the street!' Manos began planning a Halloween party in the town which, according to the Advocate, he billed as 'a magical night of giving and glamour at the Hottest Halloween Party New Orleans has ever seen.' He solicited donations and local businesses pledged goods and services to the event, the proceeds of which Manos said would go to Covenant House, a charity that works with homeless children. Tickets were snapped up for $125 a pop but Manos was arrested picking up the red carpet for the event. Money bags: Manos pretended to be wealthy in order to fleece well-heeled locals of their cash in cities around the country . According to the Dallas News, Manos was born to a middle-class family in Poughkeepsie, New York. He suffered from dyslexia, hyperactivity and undiagnosed bipolar disorder as a child and grew into a troubled teen. He dropped out of school, became a male prostiture and petty criminal and did his first stint behind bars in the late 1980s for kidnapping and theft for which he was put on lifetime parole, essentially banning him from leaving the state. In photos snapped on the red carpet, his skin is smooth and tanned and his blond hair is carefully arranged to look artlessly tousled. He looks startlingly different in his mugshot, from which the face of a tired, balding, middle-aged man stares, than when he's embodying his various personae. Manos has so many aliases they are difficult to keep track of. A 'Wanted' posted from New York, lists 10: Michael Anthony Martin, Brooke Carrington III, Alexis Vanderbilt, Dain Alexander Manos, Dain Alexander Vanderbilt, Michael Alexander, Martin Carrington, Michael Dain, Michael Vanderbilt and Mladen 'Mordan' Stefanov. In Atlanta, Manos allegedly went by Christian Michael de Medici. It was here he allegedly managed to take in Jane Fonda, 'donating' a house to her charity - which he didn't own. Taken in: Jane Fonda was tricked by Manos, who donated a house that didn't belong to him to her charity . The Dallas News reports that in Dallas, Texas, Manos was Mladen 'Mordan' Stefanov, a Greek heir who was developing a reality TV show called 'Bella Boyz.' He fled Dallas in late-2009 but was tracked to San Francisco by a private investigator who had also been taken in by him. When police arrested Manos in San Fracisco, he was in possession of $10,000 cash, 30 credit cards in fake names and a bogus Bulgarian driver's licence. He eventually returned to Dallas, where he pleaded guilty to felony theft for the $87,000 in credit card charges. He was released from jail in July 2011 and made his way to Washington DC to carry out another audacious scam. Manos became Anthony Michael Manos in DC, a lobbyist and the star of a reality show called 'Two Gay Men,' about Manos and his dog Mimi. Gawker reports that before he was caught there, he tried to throw a fundraiser for John McCain, who had never met Manos or agreed to the event. That arrest led to his most recent jail stint. He was released in March and headed directly to New Orleans. Manos was arrested on outstanding warrants in both Dallas and New York. The Advocate reports that when he was arrested, Manos tried to explain to police his fears that the 'charity' gala wouldn't be able to go ahead without him. Already invested, venue the Eiffel Society and local businessman Ryan Exsterstein managed to keep event afloat and on Thursday night, the party on St Charles Avenue went ahead.","Michael Manos, 49, was arrested in New Orleans Wednesday .

The christening gown worn by gorgeous Prince George has certainly been given a run for its money. A white cotton and lace heirloom from Cambridgeshire has been preserved almost immaculately for 116 years. And this week four-month-old Theodore Thom became the tenth child to be christened in the hand-made gown, which has been passed through seven generations of his family and survived a flood in 2001. Since it was sewn in 1897 by his great-great-great-great-grandmother, a seamstress who lived to 103, it has had just a few alterations. The sleeves have been repaired and some lace flowers have been replaced - but otherwise it looks the same as in the age of Queen Victoria. Fashion statement: Theodore Thom was the fifth generation of his family to wear a 116-year-old christening gown. Pictured with (from left) grandmother Janet, cousins Ruby and Charlotte, aunt Natalie and father Robin . Heirloom: Theodore wearing the gown on the day of his christening with parents Robin and Hannah. It has had almost no alterations since it was sewn by his great-great-great-great-grandmother in 1897 . Hand-me-gown: A family tree showing each member of the Thom family, from Cambridgeshire, which has worn the 116-year-old christening robe . Theodore - whose full name is Theodore Robert Spzalek Thom - wore the gown on Sunday for his christening at St Andrew's Church in Girton, Cambridgeshire. Theo’s grandmother Janet Thom, 63, . who has kept the gown at her home in the village and wore it for her christening in 1950, said: 'The Royals seem to have got married at about the same time as my son and now they've got christened at the same time too - although it seems our gown has outlasted theirs a bit! 'I’m so glad the . whole family have worn it. It’s lovely. It’s a great thing to know the dress has been passed down from person to person. 'Family memories mean a lot and this is one of those things that our family can always remember.' Several photos of family members wearing the gown were destroyed when Mrs Thom's home was flooded in 2001. But miraculously the gown, which was also at their home, survived. 'We had four inches of water coming in and all the photographs were in a plastic box under the stairs,' said Mrs Thom, a retired nursery teacher. 'I was devastated'. Theodore's great-great-great-great-grandmother, known only as Grandma Boon, sewed the gown for the christening of her granddaughter May Spitty in 1897 in Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex. May's brother, West Spitty, also wore it before handing it down to May's son Donald Mercier. Donald ensured his daughter Janet - Theodore's grandmother - was christened in the gown, and handed it down to her when she grew up and moved to Cambridgeshire. Janet Thom pictured at her christening in 1950, when she was the fourth member of her family to wear the gown. She said: 'This is one of those things that our family can always remember' Janet Thom was watched lovingly at her christening in 1950 by her father Donald Mercier, right, who was the third person to wear the gown. It was sewn by Janet's great-great-grandmother Grandma Boon in 1897 . Fashions may have changed but the 116-year-old gown did not in this photo of Janet Thom's christening . She then brought out the antique garment for the christening of her three children, Natalie, 40, Eloise, 36, and Robin, 30. Finally, Natalie used the precious gown for her children Ruby May Kendrew, seven, and Charlotte Kendrew, five, before sustainable energy firm director Robin, who lives in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, dressed his son Theodore in it this week. Theodore's grandmother added: 'Theo’s christening was a great day and I’m glad there were lots of people there to celebrate. 'I’ll keep patching up the dress for as long as I can.' The ceremonial dress dates back to the Victorian era, in which ornate christening gowns were fashionable and prized by the families which owned them. Janet Thom christened her children in the gown. Pictured: her daughter Natalie Thom's christening in 1974 . Soon afterwards the gown was used for the christening of Natalie's sister Eloise, in 1976 . Since 1841, every Royal baby had been christened in a gown which was designed for Queen Victoria's first child. But Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor was the last Royal baby to wear it in 2004, when a replica of the gown was sewn which has been used for every Royal christening since. The replica was worn by Prince George, son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and third in line to the throne, at a private ceremony last week.

Five people were killed and more than 80 injured when a series of blasts rocked Patna on Sunday, shortly before the BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi was to address his party's much-awaited Hunkar rally. The first explosion occurred around 9.30am inside a washroom on platform no. 10 towards the Karbigahiya end of Patna Junction. This was followed by six more blasts in succession, both in and outside the Gandhi Maidan, the rally's venue. Panic: An aerial view of the crowd gathered at Gandhi Maidan for Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna, where the blasts occurred . Blasts: Smoke rises after a bomb exploded at the boundary of Gandhi Maidan . Emergency: Many of the injured were treated at Patna Medical College and Hospital . Address: The BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi appealed for calm after the blasts calling the attack 'saddening and unfortunate' Bihar's Director General of Police . Abhayanand said that altogether five persons were killed and 83 others . injured in the seven blasts, apparently triggered by low-intensity . improvised explosive devices (IEDs). The police also recovered four live bombs, which were defused later. One of those killed is yet to be identified. Timing . The first of the six blasts near the Gandhi Maidan took place near Udyog Bhawan at 11.40am, followed by another explosion 25 minutes later near Regent Cinema outside the boundary of the rally venue. Response: An injured man is taken to hospital by a policeman after the blast . Two more blasts occurred in quick succession near the old Gandhi statue and Twin tower within the ground at 12.10pm and 12.15pm respectively. The last two bombs exploded outside the ground near SBI main office and the children's park at 12.20pm and 12.45pm. There was, however, no blast after Modi rose to speak around 1.30pm. The explosions created panic at the ground and tens of thousands of people gathered there started running for safety. The DGP said a team of the National Investigation Agency had reached Patna to investigate the matter. He also claimed the state police had followed the mandatory security procedure before the rally. ""The . police have also arrested a suspect who is believed to have been . injured while planting the bomb [at the railway station],"" he said. Bihar . chief minister Nitish Kumar said the timing and day chosen for the . explosions indicated a deliberate plot to vitiate the atmosphere. However, he denied that there was any lapse on part of the state police. ""There . was no security input about the blasts either from the central agencies . or the state agencies,"" he said. Nitish also refused to speculate over who . was behind the attack. ""It will be too early to come to any conclusion. Let the investigating agencies probe the matter first."" The chief minister, who announced an . ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each for the families of those killed, said he . had cancelled his scheduled visit to Munger and Rajgir in the wake of . the tragedy. He said the . injured people were being treated at various hospitals. Denying the . possibility of a political conspiracy, Nitish said the motive of the . explosions was obviously to create disturbance in the country. He said Bihar did not have a history of such incidents during political rallies. ""This incident is a blot on the state record in this regard. The conspiracy behind the blasts will be revealed soon,"" he said. ""Regardless of the political differences, we need to stay united to foil the designs of divisive forces,"" he added. Conspirators behind the serial explosions appear to have hoodwinked the Bihar Police by planting a bomb at the railway station ahead of Gujarat CM Narendra Modi's rally at Gandhi Maidan on Sunday. The bomb planted inside a station toilet exploded around 9.30am, more than two hours before the next bomb went off at the rally venue. Investigation: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar (right) and Bihar Director General of Police Abhyanand (left) addressed members of the press after the attacks . Five more blasts occurred in an hour on the premises of Gandhi Maidan. Investigators are probing if the bomb was kept at the railway station to divert the attention of top Bihar Police officers who were busy monitoring security arrangements for the BJP rally. Senior police officers had reached Patna Junction with experts from the forensic science laboratory, a bomb disposal squad and sniffer dogs soon after the first blast at the rally venue was reported. There are apprehensions among police officers that the terror suspects, who are believed to have carried out the operation, might have sneaked into Gandhi Maidan and mingled with the crowd when senior police officers were busy monitoring the situation at Patna Junction. Patna SSP Manu Maharaj, meanwhile, said the arrested person had confessed to his involvement in the blasts. Preliminary investigation hinted that the attacks might have been carried by Indian Mujahideen. The police said the arrested person is a relative of a top IM operative who has been absconding. The Union home ministry swung into action soon after serial bomb explosions rocked Patna on Sunday and dispatched teams of the National Security Guards (NSG) and the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to Bihar. Minister of State for Home RPN Singh said the NIA and NSG teams have been rushed to Patna to probe the blast sequence. Support: NSG commandos arrive at Gandhi Maidan to support the security response and investigation . Initial reports indicated that the explosions were caused by low-intensity devices. The Centre assured full cooperation to the Nitish Kumar government. ""We are in constant touch with the authorities, who are updating us on the situation,"" Singh said. The minister also claimed that there was no specific intelligence input about the blasts in Patna. The ministry cautioned against politicisation of the blasts and Singh appealed to political parties to refrain from inciting people, as the blasts took place before BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in the state. The Centre has also sought a report from the Bihar government on the explosions.","Blasts occurred shortly before Modi was set to address rally .
