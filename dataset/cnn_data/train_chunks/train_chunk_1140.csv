"Women’s unemployment is rising to a 25-year high but the number of jobless men is falling, according to a new survey. The Fawcett Society has warned the situation is leading to a 'female unfriendly' labour market and claims the Government’s plans for growth were leaving women behind. It said that almost two out of three new private sector jobs are going to men. The Fawcett Society warn that 1.5million women could be out of work by 2018 under current jobs plan . The organisation said that women's unemployment could reach almost 1.5million by 2018 if the government continues with its current job plans. Unless action is taken, the labour market will be characterised by 'persistent and rising levels' of women’s unemployment, diminishing pay levels for women, and a widening of the gender pay gap, it was warned. The study found that almost three times as many women as men have become long-term unemployed in the last two and a half years - 103,000 women compared with 37,000 men. Women have borne the brunt of cuts to the public sector workforce so far, said the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for gender equality. Ceri Goddard, the organisation's chief executive, said: 'The labour market is in the midst of enormous change. 'Almost a million jobs are being cut from the public sector, while many of the jobs created by what growth there is in the private sector are low waged and insecure. 'While unemployment has fallen overall, our research shows that the situation for women is bleak. It warned of a 'female unfriendly' labour market and said two thirds of private sector jobs go to men . Maria Miller, Minister for Women and Equalities, said many women 'still experience barriers' 'Female unemployment has started to rise - and this will continue unless the Government does more than tinker around the edges of this issue. 'The Government’s various plans for growth continue to leave many women behind, with the majority of new jobs being created in the private sector going to men. 'At the same time, those women who do find work in this sector are likely to face lower wages and a wider gender pay gap. This ""head-in-the-sand"" approach ignores the fact that women are now nearly half the workforce - and has serious consequences. 'If the Government doesn’t address this growing problem, we risk returning to a much more male dominated labour market, with record numbers of women unemployed, those in work typically earning less, and the gap in pay between women and men beginning to grow instead of shrink. 'Not only is this bad for women, it’s hugely damaging for our economy. We are calling on the Government - in particular the Business Secretary - to take immediate action.' The Fawcett Society recommended the Government introduce a 'Women's Employment Strategy' to improve pay levels and greater job market equality. Maria Miller, Minister for Women and Equalities, said the Government was focused on the issue. She was quoted in the Huffington Post as saying: 'The workplace was designed by men, for men, and as we have seen, times have changed, and if we want women to achieve their full potential we need to make sure the workplace is modernised.'Many women still experience barriers, including lack of female role models, the cost of childcare, lack of workplace flexibility, and a lack of transparency around recruitment for senior positions.'","The Fawcett Society warned 1.5million women could be out of work by 2018 .

"One in ten had Botox at home or a friend's home . More than five in six people who have had Botox admit to having no idea what exactly was injected into their face. And new figures reveal that more people than ever are seeking help after botched procedures. A shocking 84 per cent of youth-seekers . admitted to having absolutely no idea what was going into their . faces when under-going the procedure - or even if the injection . given actually contained key ingredient Botulinum toxin. The national research carried out by a leading cosmetic surgery company has found that almost a third (29 per cent) of respondents said they had their treatment done at a local beauty salon, one in ten had one at home or a friend's home, and 3 per cent were treated at a 'beauty treatment party'. Many said they had no idea if the person administering the injection was appropriately trained to perform the procedure. Almost two-thirds (62 per cent) of the 1,500 respondents who have had or considered having non-surgical treatments thought the industry is not regulated properly , or that enough is . being done to protect people receiving treatment. A third . confessed to feeling nervous or frightened before, during and after the procedure . they underwent. The average age of Botox patients is 35-44, and 70 per cent opt for the procedure to look ‘a little fresher'. The non-surgical treatments industry, which encompasses treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers, is currently worth more than £1.7 billion. Transform Cosmetic Surgery have seen an alarming 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help . following ineffective treatments with non-registered 'faux-tox' salons. Worryingly, they say patients come to them after being treated in a non-clinical environment, despite being given a prescription-only medicine. A third confessed to feeling nervous or frightened before, during and after the procedure . The company is concerned about the . increase in patients undergoing treatment in less than sterile . environments, delivered by unqualified practitioners. A spokesperson for non-surgical treatments at Transform stresses the importance of knowing what's going into your face. They said: 'There are subtle differences in the chemical formulations of the main brands of Botulinum toxin available in the UK. 'This . has many implications. For example storage. 'Botox' should always be . refrigerated - and if it's not, you should quiz your practitioner. 'Similarly, . there are usually differences in pricing and the efficacy of each i.e. the effects of one may last longer than another.' Botulinum toxin is available under four product formulations: Botox, Vistabel, Azzalure, and Bocouture. While all four are generated from same bacteria, the Botox brand has most Botulinum toxin in it and lasts longest. Botox comes with a red or purple top, while for example Azzalure and Bocouture have blue tops. You can also tell them apart as Botox has a hologram and is kept in a fridge. Another spokesperson added: 'It's alarming to see the number of Brits being . treated by unqualified practitioners and in less than sterile . environments. 'As . part of our CLEAR Patient Charter and in support of current reviews . into the regulation of cosmetic surgery, Transform is keen to raise . awareness of misconceptions around line and wrinkle treatments. We have long suspected a lack of understanding and knowledge; . perhaps exacerbated by less than forthcoming information from some . practitioners. Transform see a 15 per cent rise in the number of patients seeking help following ineffective treatments . 'We . hope that in highlighting this, consumers who wish to undergo . non-surgical treatment for lines and wrinkles will ask better questions . of their practitioner, and themselves if they are seeing a great 'deal', . or a lower than usual price. At Transform, treatments are always . conducted in a clinical environment, and more importantly by fully . trained clinical staff.' Dr Hilary . Jones, an independent member of Transform's Clear Panel said: 'Informed . consent is vital for any medical procedure and cosmetic interventions . such as anti-wrinkle injections are no exception. 'It is essential that . each patient understands exactly which product is being injected into . their body and whether the brand of Botulinum toxin used meets stringent . standards of quality efficacy and above all safety, and has an enduring . and proven track record. If someone is offered Botox specifically for . example, that is exactly what they should be given and nothing else. 'We . want patients to be in a better position to make an informed decision . about their chosen practitioner and the wrinkle treatment being . administered. 'Botox . is one of four licensed toxin products used for the treatment of lines . and wrinkles. However, there are nuances between each and patients . should be looking to their practitioner to explain what product is being . used and why. According to consultant plastic surgeon and member of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, Mr Nilesh Sojitra: . 'Botox, Vistabel are the same product where former is 100units and latter 50units per vial. Azzalure formerly know as dysport is a cheaper alternative as is Bocouture. The cost of the the alternative products is cheaper and not always passed on to the patient. In my personal experience, I prefer Botox and Vistabel as the molecules are larger and therefore I feel more accurate to position in areas especially near they eye. 'Smaller molecules from other products may diffuse and move to areas where you don't want the product. 'Patients who have had the alternatives feel the effects may not last as long as Botox/Vistabel.' The scientific name for Botox is Botulinum toxin . One gram of Botulinum toxin is all that's required to make a whole year's supply of Botox . Botulinum toxin is available under four product formulations: Botox, Vistabel, Azzalure, and Bocouture .

"A Chinese tradition which sees women wear headdresses made from the hair of their dead ancestors appears to be going strong in this part of the country. Instead of throwing away their hair when they comb it, women who are part of China's Long-horn Miao minority instead save the strands and add them to their collection of hair that allows them to create spectacular headdresses. The hairpieces are brought out for special occasions and carefully woven around horn-shaped headdresses fitted to the heads of the young women and girls. Instead of throwing away their hair when they comb it, women who are part of China's Long-horn Miao minority save the strands and add them to the collection that allows them to create spectacular headdresses . The special hairpieces are brought out for special occasions and carefully woven around horn-shaped headdresses fitted to the heads of young women and girls . Every wig is passed down from mother to daughter and includes not just yarn and twine but also the hair from a line of female ancestors which the owners of the headdresses claim go back hundreds of years . The tradition is believed to have originated with the wearing of the horns as the cow was a sacred animal in the past for people in this rural area, a Chinese expert in minority cultures has said . Although there are now less than 5,000 people in the Miao minority, the strong tradition carries on, as revealed by these pictures taken in the village of Suojia, in Liupanshui city in southwest China's Guizhou province. Every wig is passed down from mother to daughter and includes not just yarn and twine but also the hair from a line of female ancestors which the owners of the headdresses claim go back hundreds of years. It is dyed and carefully maintained to keep it shiny and healthy. Shu Tu, 27, a Chinese expert in minority cultures said: 'The wigs are worn on all sorts of big occasions from weddings through to feast days, and traditionally they also used to be worn by the men but it seems as if it was at the end of the day too much effort for the menfolk - and they gradually dropped the tradition. Although there are now less than 5,000 people in the Miao minority, the strong tradition carries on . The headdresses are worn for a range of big occasions, including weddings and feast days . The headdress traditionally also used to be worn by men, but the custom has only been carried on by women . Shu Tu, 27, a Chinese expert in minority cultures, said: 'It's regarded as a living way for them to honour their ancestors' 'But it continued among the women and the hairdos that they have now include hair not only from the mother and grandmother but probably even the great-grandmother and even older - all woven together. 'It's regarded as a living way for them to honour their ancestors. Every time a woman combs her hair, she collects it, and she hands it to her daughter when her daughter marries. 'It probably originated with the wearing of the horns as the cow was a sacred animal in the past for people in this rural area, but this no doubt developed from a desire to decorate the horns and to honour not only the animal itself but also ancestors.' She added: 'For some people, their history is in books. However, for the Miao, their history is on their heads.'","Women in China's Long-horn Miao minority save strands of ancestors' hair .

"Culprit? Artist Walter Sickert was Jack the Ripper, a crime writer is suggesting . Crime writer Patricia Cornwell is promising to publish new research on the identity of Jack the Ripper which she claims will help to solve the mystery. The best-selling author believes she has 'cracked' the case by unearthing evidence that confirms Walter Sickert, an influential artist, as the prime suspect. Fans of the painter were critical of her first book for pointing the finger at the painter, but she has spent the last 11 years working to prove her theory. She says she has a lot more detail and predicts people will be surprised by evidence she has unearthed linking Sickert with the royal family. 'I feel that I have cracked it,' she said. 'I believe it’s Sickert, and I believe it now more than ever.' Furthermore, Ms Cornwell, 47, says the . artist had links to the royal family - perhaps backing some kind of royal . conspiracy in relation to the crimes. The bestselling author has been working with former Scotland Yard commander John Grieve to look through a selection of letters, held at The National Archives in Kew, allegedly sent to police by the killer. While she admits her evidence is only circumstantial, Ms Cornwell argues it hard to accept it is merely a coincidence watermarks on some of the letters match paper used by Sickert. 'Will we ever prove it? No — how can you? 'It’s a completely circumstantial case with the only real science that we can count on after all these years being the forensic analysis, which is really hard to feel is coincidental when you keep seeing water marks on paper that Jack the Ripper and Sickert had in common.' The author acknowledged that even if the artist wrote some of the letters, it does not mean Sickert was the killer. However, she added: 'In court, a jury might struggle with that. They are very confessional and violent letters.' The writer has spent millions of pounds investigating the unidentified killer - who killed at least five prostitutes in Whitechapel in the late 1880s. Investigation: Ms Cornwell, pictured, says watermarks found of letters allegedly sent by the Ripper to police shared the same watermark as paper used by the artist . The dedicated investigator even purchased Sickert’s desk, plus 32 of his paintings to have them tested for DNA. According to The Evening Standard,she plans on printing her new findings next year. She added: 'I have a lot more detail including more information on what I call the ‘royal conspiracy’. 'For a start — Sir William Gull was Queen Victoria’s surgeon. There have been rumours that Sir William Gull was helping to get rid of these prostitutes. Suffice to say there has been evidence that has turned up to say that Sir William was Sickert’s family physician.' Ms Cornwell's 2002 book on the topic, Portrait of a Killer: Jack the Ripper—Case Closed,  first included her theory that Sickert was the Ripper. The controversial book caused outrage in the art world and also among 'Ripperologists' -  who did not agree with her methods or conclusions. Ms Cornwell recently won a court battle against company she had hired to handle her finances - with a court awarding her £30 million. Patricia Cornwell’s new novel Dust is out now. Notorious: A poster for the capture of the serial killer . Numerous individuals have been accused of being the serial killer. At the time, police suspected the Ripper must have been a butcher, due to the way his victims were killed  and the fact they were discovered near to the dockyards, where meat was brought into the city. There are several alleged links between the killer and royals. First is Sir William Withey Gull, the royal physician. Many have accused him of helping get rid of the prostitutes' bodies, while others claim he was the Ripper himself. Another book named Queen Victoria's surgeon Sir John Williams as the infamous killer. He had a surgery in Whitechapel at the time. Another theory links the murders with Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor, also known as the Duke of Clarence. At one point, cotton merchant James Maybrick was the number one suspect, following the publication of some of his diary which appeared to suggest he was the killer. However the extracts are widely believed to be forged. Other suspects include Montague John Druitt, a Dorset-born barrister. He committed suicide in the Thames shortly after last murder. George Chapman, otherwise known as Seweryn Kłosowski, poisoned three of his wives and was hanged in 1903. Another suspected by polive was Aaron Kosminski. He was admitted to Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum and died there. Dr Thomas Neill Cream, poisoned four London prostitutes with strychnine and was hanged. Some of the more bizarre links include Lewis Carroll, author of the Alice in Wonderland books, who taught at Christ Church until 1881 - which was at the forefront of the Ripper Murder scenery. According to some sources Jack was actually a Jill - a theory posed by an inspector on the case at the time. Winston Churchill's father - Lord Randolph Churchill - has also been named as a potential suspect.","Writer spent 11 years and millions of pounds researching Jack the Ripper .

"A man who spoke out over a late-night brawl involving Sarah Palin's family has been fired for telling the media about it. Eric Thompson, 56, was at a party in Anchorage, Alaska, when members of the Palin's family - including Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol - allegedly lashed out at other guests before driving off in a stretch Hummer shouting 'Don't you know who we are?' Thompson, who was not involved in the brawl, gave a statement to police in Anchorage after the event, and later gave a detailed account of the fracas in a television interview - for which he paid a heavy price. Scroll down for video . Jobseeker: Mr Thompson posted a video online asking for help finding a job after he was fired from McKenna Brothers Paving Company . 'Brawlers': Mr Thompson said he saw Bristol Palin (right, next to her sister Willow) throw six punches at the party's host on September 6 . As soon as the interview had aired on ABC's Good Morning America, Thompson received a call from his employers at the McKenna Brothers Paving Company, who fired him immediately. He has now posted a video to YouTube explaining his plight and has started an online giving page for financial help while he looks for a job, which has amassed more than $9,000. In the clip he is seen walking the streets of Anchorage with a carboard sign, having told the camera: 'I was fired for telling the truth about the Palin brawl.' He has since expanded on his account of the brawl, saying that he saw Bristol Palin, 23, punch the host of the party six times in the face in response to being asked to leave - before the party descended into an incomprehensible 'dogpile'. Thompson told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'I wasn’t in the front yard, an employee of McKenna Bros. Paving, punching somebody in the face. That was the Palins. They did this, not me. 'Dogpile': Eric Thompson, right, is out of a job after telling the media about a fight involving Sarah Palin's family in Anchorage, Alaska, earlier this month . 'I feel that maybe they [McKenna Brothers] got squeezed. Maybe Palins do wield a little more, you know, power. ... Anybody that’s ever come against them, they seem to just, you know, find a way to destroy them.' Thompson also expanded on his account of the alleged fist-fight, which he says happened September 6. He told the Dispatch News that the Palins turned up at the home of Korey Klingenmeyer, an office manager at McKenna Brothers, in a stretch Hummer around 8.30pm, when there were about 70 people at the party. The party continued as expected until around 11pm, Thompson said, when he heard about a fight between Track Palin, a 23-year-old Army reservist, and an unnamed Anchorage local. Thompson then said he saw Klingenmeyer attempt to throw out Bristol and Willow Palin, Sarah's daughters, after hearing about the incident. He then claims Bristol's reaction to the 'polite' request was to smack Klingenmeyer in the face six times - 'straight, hard punches to the face.' When Klingenmeyer pushed her away from him, she reportedly fell over, leading to Todd Palin, Sarah's husband, stepping in. 'Battered': Host Korey Klingenmeyer (above) was reportedly smacked several times in the face during the encounter - despite being polite when asking the Palins to leave . Scene of the crime: The home of Klingenmeyer in Anchorage, Alaska . Thompson then said the confrontation descended into a 'dogpile' fight, and when it broke away Track Palin made offensive gestures and swore at the crowd as the Palin clan drove away. There have been mixed reports about the incident, with sources close to Palin reportedly disputing details of the fight, and saying the 'Don't you know who we are?' comment was misheard. Anchorage Police confirmed that the fight - involving around 20 people - took place, and said alcohol was probably a facotr. A spokesman said: 'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence. 'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence... Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.' Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office. MailOnline has contacted Sarah Palin and McKenna Brothers Paving for comment.","Eric Thompson, 56, was at party in Anchorage, Alaska, which Palins went to .

"Three Palm Beach County deputies have been disciplined for fawning over rapper 50 Cent while on the job. Sgt. Craig Laufer and deputies Pamela Gibbs and Yvane Moreland received 'verbal counseling' for what their supervisors described as 'unprofessional' behavior during the rapper's appearance  at the county courthouse earlier this month. Video shot by The Palm Beach Post shows the officers posing for photos with 50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis Jackson III, and holding onto his waist. Scroll down for video . Three Palm Beach County deputies have been disciplined for fawning over 50 Cent while on the job. Pictured: The rapper is flanked by deputies Pamela Gibbs and Yvane Moreland as he leaves Palm Beach County Court last month . While the two female deputies put their arms around Jackson's waist, disciplinary reports were given to all three, reports Palm Beach Post. 'During the incident, both (deputies) were seen holding onto Mr. Jackson's waist area and for a period of time Mr. Jackson was holding onto (Deputy) Gibb's around her waist, while walking through the courthouse,' according to their supervisor. According to the report, Laufer 'placed himself in a position to obtain a photograph with Mr Jackson as he was exiting from the Courtroom.' 'All parties involved placed themselves in a position of disadvantage by taking on a laize-faire (sic) attitude, due to Mr. Jackson's singing background, thus neglecting their assigned duties to their position,' the supervisor wrote. 50 Cent is photographed giving out autographs. Video shot by The Palm Beach Post shows the officers posing for photos with 50 Cent and holding onto his waist . 'It should be noted all deputies involved were in their class 'B' uniform, thus giving a poor perspective and lack of neutrality on behalf of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office.' The recommended discipline for the trio was 'verbal couseling.' The rapper was in court fighting an arbitrators order - in April he was ordered to pay a Bradenton earphone manufacturer more than $16 million in connection with a failed partnership to produce the entertainer's line of headphones. 50 Cent was ordered to pay Sleek Audio nearly $4.5 million in attorney fees and $11.7 million in damages. The U.S. District Court in Miami affirmed the award in late March after a three-year legal battle. Records allege that Jackson, a Sleek partner, stole the designs of over-the-ear headphones he asked the company to conceptualize and manufacture. Jackson has been selling headphones of a similar design under the 50-Over line with another manufacturer.

"On Earth, sex is essential for many lifeforms to survive - but elsewhere in the universe it might not even exist. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Richard Dawkins explained how the need for us to have sex is one of the great unanswered questions of evolution. He added the need for two genders to reproduce is 'problematic' and finding alien life could be key to discovering why we have male and females, instead of a range of genders. While Richard Dawkins (pictured) believes aliens and humans share certain traits, there are others that will fall by the wayside - including sex. He told MailOnline that sex is a great unanswered question of evolution, and finding alien life could help solve the mystery of why most animals rely on it to reproduce . Mr Dawkins made the comments to MailOnline at the the Starmus festival in Tenerife, an event that features talks from leading experts in space, science and astronomy. 'Does there have to be sex in an alien world? I think probably not,' Mr Dawkins explained. 'It's not at all clear what sex is doing anyway. It's problematic enough. 'I wouldn't put my shirt on there being sex [in an alien world]. If there is sex, why just two sexes? Why not three or four?' He continued: 'One outstandingly unanswered question [about evolution] is what's sex for?' Sex would be unlikely to be 'common between different life forms,' but discovering alien life could 'teach us about evolutionary principles,' he added. Dawkins told MailOnline he wants biologists to start to consider what other life might be like in the the likely event we discover we are not alone. 'The number of stars in current estimates is 10 to the power of 22, and it looks as though most of them have planets, so it's feasible to say the number of planets is in excess of 10 to the power of 22,' he said. 'It would seem to be rash to predict we're the only life form in the entire universe. 'On the other hand if there was only one planet that has life then it has to be this one, because here we are. 'The alternative is to say yes, we are alone. If you want to believe that then the origin of life on this planet has to be a quite staggeringly improbable event.' 'So we're left with the rather paradoxical result that people who are trying to work out how life originated on this planet are totally wasting their time, because the theory we're seeking is not a plausible theory, it's an exceedingly implausible theory.' Dawkins explained that if there is a plausible theory for the origin of life - one that has yet to be put forward - then there's going to be 'lots and lots' of life in the universe. 'I think there's lots of life in the universe, but that's just a hunch. It may still be very rare; it may be so rare that there are only a billion of them. 'If there are only a billion life forms then they will probably be so spaced out from each other that they'll never know each other and never come in contact. 'If they do come in contact, if we ever come in contact, it will almost certainly be by radio than by actually bodily meeting. And he believes that 'the fact we do see sex so ubiquitously [on Earth] is very telling. 'We do see no sex as well, asexuality does happen, so it's not absolutely essential. 'If you look at the distribution in the taxonomic tree of life, what you see is that asexual reproduction seems to crop up. 'With one exception, there is no major branch of animal - clade - all members of which produce asexually. 'The fact that it's sporadic, that it crops up here, here and here but not in major clades, suggests that when it does crop up it may flourish for a short while of evolution, but then it goes extinct. 'That could be a very telling fact.' In Dawkins' talk at the Starmus festival yesterday he spoke on alien taxonomy, and what we might expect aliens to look like. Dawkins pondered whether the way certain animals have evolved on Earth has been random, or followed a path that would be similar for any alien life forms. In particular, he discussed how organs such as eyes, on a world where light was abundant, would be very likely to evolve in a similar way. And even things such as religion, as society develops, would be shared by humans and an intelligent extraterrestrial race. On whether aliens might have their own religions Dawkins said: 'I think it wouldn't be totally unsurprising. After all, he said, religion has arisen in every single civilisation that anthropologists have ever looked at that. 'I suppose it's plausible that any alien life form which is on the way to developing the sort of technology that's capable of reaching us would be likely to go through a preliminary phase of uncertain groping in the dark,' he added. 'Before they hit upon truths like Newton's laws, which are universal, and Einstein's theory of gravitation, which is also universal, they might well go through a phase of groping in the dark. 'It's something we might recognise as religion.' Dawkins said he wants biologists to start to consider what other life might be like in the event we discover we are not alone - which he claims is increasingly unlikely. Mr Dawkins (pictured) also said he wants biologists to start to consider what other life might be like in the event we discover we are not alone - which he claims is increasingly unlikely. He believes there's lots of life in the universe, and its may be so rare and spaced out, it will never come into contact . The number of stars in current estimates is 10 to the power of 22, and it looks as though most of them have planets, so it's feasible to say the number of planets is in excess of 10 to the power of 22, said Dawkins. He said It would seem to be rash to predict we're the only life form in the entire universe. 'On the other hand if there was only one planet that has life then it has to be this one, because here we are,' he said. 'The alternative is to say yes, we are alone. If you want to believe that then the origin of life on this planet has to be a quite staggeringly improbable event.' The Starmus festival is an event held in Tenerife that features various talks from leading experts in space, science and astronomy. It hosts presentations from astronauts, cosmonauts, Nobel Prize winners and prominent figures from science, culture, the arts and music. Guests include Stephen Hawking, Richard Dawkins, Brian May, and Alexei Leonov - the first man to perform a spacewalk. 'The most important thing for me is to see people leaving Tenerife satisfied and inspired,' said astrophysicist Garik Israelian, who runs the event. This year's event, hosted at the Ritz-Carlton Abama hotel, runs from 22 to 27 September. 'So we're left with the rather paradoxical result that people who are trying to work out how life originated on this planet are totally wasting their time, because the theory we're seeking is not a plausible theory, it's an exceedingly implausible theory.' Dawkins explained that if there is a plausible theory for the origin of life - one that has yet to be put forward - then there's going to be 'lots and lots' of life in the universe. 'I'm just pointing out a kind of incompatibility between the belief that we're unique, which many want to believe, and hunting for the origin of life on this planet, which is a lost cause if you want to believe that,' he continued. 'I think there's lots of life in the universe, but that's just a hunch. It may still be very rare; it may be so rare that there are only a billion of them. Dawkins said if there are only a billion life forms then they will probably be so spaced out from each other that they'll never know each other and never come in contact. He believes if they do come in contact, it will almost certainly be by radio than by actually bodily meeting. 'That's because radio waves get propagated in all directions, and so we could be being bathed in radio emissions of some extraterrestrial civilisation,' he said. On what he expects to be found first, alien life or the origin of our life, Dawkins said: 'I would think finding a plausible theory of the origin of our life. 'If we can find a plausible theory then that pretty much means there's lots of life.' The comments were made at the Starmus festival in Tenerife. It hosts presentations from astronauts, cosmonauts, nobel prize winners and prominent figures from science, culture, the arts and music. This year's guests include Stephen Hawking (pictured),  Brian May and Alexei Leonov - the first man to spacewalk . One opinion he would like to distance himself from, though, is the possibility of life on Earth being seeded by aliens. 'I was interviewed by a creationist film and the man said ""can you think of any conceivable way in which life on this planet could have been intelligently designed?"" 'So I said the only conceivable way I can think of is not God, which is what [he wanted] me to say, but alien seeding. But I explicitly said I do not believe in alien seeding. 'If you really press me to think of how intelligence could ever have designed life on this planet, the only possibility would be alien seeding. 'That's very different from saying I believe in alien seeding. It's been distorted possibly maliciously by a creationist.' If there is life out there, however, Dawkins thinks it is likely they follow similar evolutionary principles to life on Earth. 'Does life have to be Darwinian? I think it does,' he said. 'I don't think there's another theory that's been suggested that could give rise to the sort of organised complexity that we call life. I'm kind of betting my shirt on Darwinism.'","Richard Dawkins revealed theories on alien life exclusively to MailOnline .
He explained the ways in which it might be different, and similar to our own .
Dawkins said the existence of sex is 'problematic' and he does not expect all aliens to use it to reproduce .
He also believes aliens may 'grope in the dark' with religion like humans .
And that some evolutionary principles, according to Darwinism, may be commonplace in the universe ."
"Free at last: Journalist Michael Scott Moore, 45, a resident of Germany, was freed by Somali pirates Tuesday after spending more than two years in captivity . A German-American journalist who was kidnapped in Somalia more than two years ago was freed Tuesday, according to a Somali police official and a leader of the Somali pirates who had held him. The journalist, identified by the German weekly Der Spiegel as 45-year-old Michael Scott Moore, was immediately flown to Kenya's capital, Nairobi, after being freed, Somali police official Mohamed Hassan said by phone from the town of Galkayo in north-central Somalia. Some of the pirates who held Moore reached a deal with negotiators after a ransom was paid, said Bile Hussein, a pirate commander in the Somali coastal town of Hobyo. Moore, who was moved from place to place as his captors tried to avoid detection, was most recently held near the central Somali town of Adado, Hussein said, offering no more details. Germany's Foreign Ministry confirmed that a 'German citizen who also had U.S. citizenship and who was kidnapped in Somalia was set free today' but wouldn't give further details. Der Spiegel, for which Moore had freelanced, reported on its website Tuesday that Moore was taken by plane to the Somali capital, Mogadishu. Spiegel's editor-in-chief Wolfgang Buechner said the magazine was grateful for the efforts of everyone who had helped bring about Moore's release. Scroll down for video . Kidnapped: Moore, a freelance reporter for Der Spiegel, was picked up by Somali outlaws in January 2012 while researching a book about piracy . Deal reached: The 45-year-old regained his freedom after a ransom was reportedly paid out to his captors . 'We never gave up hope and we're happy now with Michael and his mother Marlis that this nightmare is finally over,' he said. AFP reported via Yahoo News that sources familiar with the matter revealed that Moore appeared to be in good condition and 'thrilled to be free.' The journalist and author will now undergo a medical check-up and psychological counseling. Moore's mother, Marlis Saunders, from Redondo Beach, California, expressed her relief and joy after learning of her son's long-awaited liberation Tuesday. ‘We are just ecstatic that finally — after over 2 1/2 years — that he’s been released,’ Saunders told The Daily Breeze. According to a Nairobi-based environmental and human rights group, Moore was kidnapped by Somali pirates on the road to Galkayo airport in January 2012 while researching a book on piracy on a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. Plea: In this video released in May 2012, Moore appeared on camera at gunpoint asking for the governments of Germany and the US to pay his captors the full ransom . Prompted by one of the pirate speaking off camera in heavily accented English, Moore complained that he was in poor health, that he was being starved, and that his life in captivity was terrible . Over the past two and a half years, Moore's captors shared photos and videos of the hostage online as German and American officials negotiated for his release. In a video made public in May 2012, Moore appeared on camera at gunpoint asking for the governments of Germany and the US to pay his captors the full ransom to stop them from selling him to the radical militant group Al-Shabaab. Moore graduated from Mira Costa high School and made a name for himself as a surfing writer, publishing a book on the subject titled Sweetness in Blood. Prior to his captivity, Moore lived in Berlin and worked as an editor-at-large of Spiegel Online, Der Spiegel's English-language website. He also contributed articles to Atlantic Monthly, the Los Angeles Times and Salon. Although piracy once was a scourge off the coast of Somalia, it has dropped significantly as a result of armed guards aboard cargo ships and an international naval armada that carries out onshore raids.","Michael Scott Moore, 45, a freelance reporter for Der Spiegel, was freed in Somalia Tuesday and flown to Nairobi, Kenya .

"Police say Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer broke his wife's nose with a head-butt during an argument that began after she learned about his recent phone contact with another woman. Search-warrant records made public Tuesday say the July 21 argument came after Dwyer's wife came to believe her husband was cheating. Dwyer was arrested last week after his wife told police her husband assaulted her on July 21 and 22 at their Phoenix apartment. The arrest came at a time when the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell are under fire over a series of violent off-the-field encounters involving some marquee players, including Ray Rice, Adrian Peterson and Greg Hardy. Domestic violence: Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer (far right) is accused of beating up his wife, Kayla (center) for refusing to have sex with him and throwing a shoe at their young son (pictured) The NFL has said the Dwyer case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The day after his arrest, the Cardinals placed Dwyer on the reserve/non-football illness list, meaning he can't play for Arizona again this season. Dwyer is charged with aggravated assault, misdemeanor assault, disorderly conduct, criminal damage and preventing the use of a telephone during an emergency. Messages left for his lawyer, Jared Allen, weren't immediately returned Tuesday. Dwyer is scheduled for a status conference on October 6 and an October 9 preliminary hearing. His wife, 27-year-old Kayla Tobin Dwyer, left the state after the incidents, but came forward two weeks ago after Dwyer apparently sent suicidal text messages including a photo of a knife. Arrested: Dwyer was arrested Wednesday on aggravated assault charges in connection with two altercations at his home in July involving his family . Handcuffed: Phoenix police officers escort Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer,  to the 4th Avenue Jail following his arrest on Wednesday . In the first encounter, police say Dwyer attempted to kiss and undress his wife, but she refused. Someone who heard the argument called police, who showed up at the apartment but did not make an arrest. Dwyer hid in a shower and his wife said she hadn't been assaulted and denied he was in the home because the running back threatened to kill himself in front of her and their child if she told police about the assault, police said. The next day, Dwyer punched his wife in the face and threw a shoe at her and instead struck their 17-month-old son, whom she was holding, police said. The child wasn't injured. As his wife tried to call police, Dwyer grabbed her cellphone and threw it down from the apartment's second story, police said. Witnesses told police that Dwyer's wife said, ‘I'm calling the police’ as she held her swollen face and clutched her son. During a police interview, Dwyer acknowledged hiding in the bathroom when police responded to the first argument and sending a photo of a knife with suicidal threats after the first argument. Dwyer denied committing an assault, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home, threw a phone and that his wife bit his lip during the disputes, according to a police report. The subject of the second argument is unknown. Dwyer was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device and banned from having contact with his wife and so; he also cannot travel outside Arizona or be in possession of weapons, drugs or alcohol. Authorities depicted a stormy relationship between Dwyer and his wife, a flight attendant from North Carolina, that escalated into violence on July 21, four days before the Cardinals reported to training camp. Neighbors heard a fight and called police, who showed up at the residence but left without making an arrest because Dwyer hid in the bathroom and the woman said no one else was at the home, Sgt. Trent Crump said. The Cardinals havs suspended Dwyer from all team activities. Hot temper: Dwyer denied committing an assault or hurting his son, though he acknowledged that he punched walls in his home . The NFL said the case will be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy. The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues ever since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator. Then Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson was indicted on felony child-abuse charges. Last Wednesday, the Carolina Panthers decided that star defensive end Greg Hardy will not play any more games for the team until his domestic violence case is resolved. Hardy was convicted of assault on a female and communicating threats after the victim said the 6-foot-4, 275-pound player threw her in the bathtub and onto a sofa covered with guns before threatening to kill her. Hardy is appealing the ruling. Critics have been calling for NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's resignation for his handling of Rice's case. Rice was originally suspended for two games, then banned indefinitely after the video surfaced of his attack in the casino elevator. This is the second domestic violence case involving a Cardinals player. Inside linebacker Daryl Washington pleaded guilty to assaulting his ex-girlfriend and is serving a year of supervised probation. Washington has not yet been penalized by the NFL for the offense but is suspended for this season for violating the league's substance abuse policy. Sidelined: The Cardinals deactivated Jonathan Dwyer from all team activities following his arrest . Athlete: Dwyer, 25, signed with the Cardinals earlier this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four years with the Pittsburgh Steelers . Dwyer signed with the Cardinals this year and was their second-string running back after spending the last four seasons with the Pittsburgh Steelers. He scored a touchdown last week in Arizona's victory over the New York Giants. His best year for Pittsburgh was 2012 when injuries depleted the team's backfield in the middle of the season and Dwyer filled in and had 100-yard-plus games in consecutive weeks. Dwyer, from Marietta, Georgia, was a sixth-round draft pick of the Steelers out of Georgia Tech in 2010.","Arizona Cardinals running back Jonathan Dwyer was arrested last Wednesday on aggravated assault charges in connection with two altercations in July .

"The United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday it was making contingency plans in case all 400,000 inhabitants of the Syrian Kurdish town of Kobani fled into Turkey to escape advancing Islamic State militants. Some 138,000 Syrian Kurdish refugees have entered southern Turkey in an exodus that began last week, and two border crossing points remain open, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said. 'We are preparing for the potential of the whole population fleeing into Turkey. Anything could happen and that population of Kobani is 400,000,' UNHCR chief spokeswoman Melissa Fleming told a news briefing in Geneva. Scroll down for video .

The United States and Arab allies bombed Syria for the first time on Tuesday, killing dozens of Islamic State fighters and members of a separate al Qaeda-linked group, pursuing a campaign against militants into a war at the heart of the Middle East. Army General Martin Dempsey said the raids in northern Syria - which employed Tomahawk missiles, B1 bombers, F16, F18 and F22 strike fighters and drones - will have successfully proved to the radical Islamists that even strongholds such as the city of Raqqa do not represent a 'safe haven'. American air power was backed by 'participation or support' from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Jordan and the UAE - a coalition of nations that has agreed to assist with the destruction of ISIS - with Britain not involved in the overnight strikes.

There was also a U.S. attack on a separate band of Islamist militants in Syria - the Al Qaeda-affiliated Khorasan Group, who were said to have been planning an 'imminent attack' on a Western target. On Monday, Syrian Kurds battled to defend the key border town of Kobani from an Islamic State advance as Kurdish youths from Turkey rushed to their aid. A first airlift of supplies for up to 200,000 people is due to arrive at Adana airport from Amman, Jordan on Wednesday, to be followed by three more flights later in the week, Fleming said. Strong presence: Military leaders have said about two-thirds of the estimated 31,000 Islamic State militants were in Syria. The U.S. has also been increasing its surveillance flights over Syria, getting better intelligent on potential targets and militant movements . Attack: Late this morning the U.S. released footage of Tomahawks being fired from the USS Arleigh Burke - a guided missile destroyer stationed in the Red Sea . Rupert Colville, U.N. human rights spokesman, told the briefing on Tuesday: 'Our biggest worry at the moment would be if Kobani itself, the town, fell.' At least 105 villages around Kobani have been captured by Islamic State forces since Sept. 15, including at least 85 over the weekend, he said. The U.N. rights office had reports that an additional 100 villages had been abandoned or evacuated for fear of being captured, he said. 'We have received very alarming reports of deliberate killing of civilians, including women and children, the abduction of hundreds of Kurds by ISIL, and widespread looting and destruction of infrastructure and private property,' he said, using another name for the Sunni militant group. Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Arab participation was essential for Obama as he looked to expand the American campaign of air strikes to Syria from Iraq, where the U.S. military has already carried out 190 strikes as of Monday. Several Arab countries have offered to join the United States in air strikes against Islamic State targets, a senior U.S. official told reporters on Sept. 14. But the United States has so far refused to detail which nations have given private assurances to Washington that they would join in air strikes in Syria, part of a broader strategy against the Islamic State that includes training and arming moderate Syrian opposition fighters. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power said in television interviews over the weekend that other nations were willing to join air strikes in Syria. Vital allies: All the U.S. partners in the airstrikes against Syria are Middle Eastern nations. They are Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan and Bahrain. Here, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, second from right, and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, left, and their representatives, pause for photos at the end of their meeting in New York on Monday . 'I will make you a prediction,' Power said on ABC. 'We will not do the air strikes alone if the president decides to do the air strikes.' Several Arab states have powerful air forces, including Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia, for example, has also already agreed to host U.S. training of Syrian opposition fighters. But many Gulf Arab states have been reluctant to be seen aggressively joining the U.S. campaign in Iraq and Syria, fearing in some cases reprisals by extremists or forces loyal to the Syrian government. The White House last week declined to 'telegraph' when strikes might occur or what preconditions stood in the way. Obama will give a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday to make the case again for world action against Islamic State. Powerful air force: Seen here is a Royal Saudi Air Force Panavia Tornado IDS, part of the nation's substantial air fleet . The Kobani region, which has some 440 villages, is also host to between 200,000 and 400,000 Syrians displaced from other parts of the country including Raqqa, Aleppo and Homs, he said. 'So potentially the population movement could be much greater than it's been already even though it's been very large and very fast,' Colville said. Turkish authorities are checking arriving Syrians to ensure they are not fighters, 'to maintain the civilian character of asylum', Fleming said. Young Syrian children are also being checked for measles and polio vaccinations, she said. Fleming called for support for the government of Turkey and other neighbouring countries - Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Egypt - that are already hosting more than 3 million Syrian refugees. 'If you want to put it into proportion, this 138,000 that just arrived in Turkey represents about the number that all of Europe has taken in in the three years of the Syria war,' she said.

"Residents in Barcelona fed up with the hordes of tourists crowding their streets have taken their protest against mass tourism to one of the city's most famous landmarks. Around 300 people organised a noisy demonstration around the Sagrada Familia to complain about the holidaymakers make their lives a misery. One protester, Abel Maruny, said: 'I'm fed up with being elbowed. I'm not a rude person but at times I run out of patience.' Hot spot: Gaudi's Sagrada Familia is an imposing sight, which more than three million tourists visit each year . Neighbour Mireia Daniel, 40, added: 'The last few years have been terrible. I can't even take my son to his nursery in a pushchair.' The number of tourists visiting Barcelona has more than tripled in the last 20 years. More than three million people visit the Sagrada Familia, a large Roman Catholic church and Unesco World Heritage site designed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudi, every year. Las Ramblas: The number of tourists visiting the Spanish city has more than tripled in the last 20 years . Tourist favourite: The Casa Mila apartment building known as La Pedrera, designed by Antoni Gaudi . The protest, which took place on Wednesday, followed demos by residents in another working-class neighbourhood - La Barceloneta - against drunken Magaluf-style holidaymakers and illegal tourist flats. Months of discontent there erupted after a group of tourists were spotted coming out of a supermarket in the former fishing district naked. Protestors involved in the Sagrada Familia demo carried banners which said: 'We want a neighbourhood we can live in.' and T-shirts which read: 'I'm not guiri,' a slang term used to describe Anglo-Saxon visitors to Spain.

"Bombs lighting up the sky at 3am, the ear-shattering noise of endless blasts and her home shaking constantly under the impact of rockets are just some of the heartbreaking experiences a 16-year-old Gazan teen is documenting on Twitter. Farah Baker lives opposite Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital. She can not eat breakfast without a bomb disturbing her meal, burning cars lay outside her front door and her neurosurgeon father has shown her 'a fragment from the brain of a 9-year-old child'. Every day she fears she might die. Scroll down for video . Under attack: Farah Baker lives opposite Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital. She has survived three wars and is pleading for the latest one to stop . Farah, 16, can not eat breakfast without a bomb disturbing her meal . On Monday a rocket landed in a park next to the hospital, reportedly killing 10 Palestinians, nine of them innocent children. 'This is in my area. I can't stop crying. I might die tonight #Gaza #GazaUnderAttack #ICC4Israel #AJAGAZA,' she wrote. The three-week conflict has so far claimed the lives of 1,060 Gazans, most of them civilians. Israel has lost 48 soldiers and another three civilians have been killed by Palestinian rocket fire, according to official figures. 'They are bombing heavily in my area. This is the worst night in this war. I just want you to know that I might martyr at any moment #Gaza,'she said. This is just one of the thousands of terrifying incidents Farah and her 6-year-old sister have endured throughout their short lives. Their home has been in the middle of a war zone three times already. Their bedroom windows are constantly shattered by attacks. For three-weeks, Farah has told how she is trapped inside her house in the middle of one of the fiercest strikes on Gaza. She is often without power and unable to do simple things such as walk outside or visit a school friend. 'We are sitting in darkness bc th power is off, flares r lightening up th area just like it's midday,we're just hearin bombs,drones,f16s#Gaza,' she wrote on Monday. 'Not only my area is suffering of this night, all parts of #Gaza strip are hearing bombs and seeing flares, this is y we've no shelters,' she added. Farah fears for her life from her home as she watches flares light up the sky every night . Farah has over 20,000 followers on Twitter and is documenting the horrific sites of war she is seeing from home . Farah once witnessed a window fall on  her little sister. 'She's shaking and unable to breathe,' she wrote . During a brief ceasefire from shelling on 25 July, Farah posted her joy of being able to walk outside her house with less of a risk of being killed. 'July 25 There's a ceasefire today for 12hrs. I'll get 2 th street and keep walking walking walking till I get exhausted & miss home #Gaza #AJAGAZA.' 'There's a ceasefire today for 12hrs. I'll get 2 th street and keep walking walking walking till I get exhausted & miss home #Gaza #AJAGAZA,' she wrote. Farah described how her sister covers her ears to try and hide the sound of the bombs . She is desperate for the rockets to stop falling. 'I am crying,' she wrote in one heartbreaking tweet . Farah can not escape the blasts and says she might 'martyr at any moment' 'I AM GOING TO HANG OUTTTT! I can't believe this!!!!!!! I'm going to meet my best friend #Gaza,' she said.

"Despite fast-flowing lava trickling down from the crater just 15 metres away, a cameraman has captured the dramatic aftermath of Iceland's volcanic eruption. Valdimar Leifsson, 61, risked his life to get these stunning close-ups of molten lava flowing from the Bardarbunga volcano. A giant burning mass of molten remains can be seen smouldering in the foreground as the lava continues to spurt from the Holuhraun eruption's crater behind. 'You feel very, very small in a moment like this in front of a 100m-high melted lava fountain,' said Valdimar. 'I realised acutely how small and insignificant we are, compared to the awesome power of natural forces. The heat emanating from the lava is much more visible during the night. 'Standing close to the margin of the lava field, one realises the unbridled force of the eruption.' Validmar - who along with his son Arnar Steinn and wife Bryndis - has captured many eruptions on the island, added: 'The lava is flooding towards you over the endless black sand and is glowing in the dark. 'You can hear a constant hissing sound from the crater. It is like you are watching the creation of the earth. And sometimes you think the earth is going to open up under your feet.' Valdimar travelled from the nearest civilisation to get the eruption, from a small farming village in Modrudalur three to four hours away. 'One sees almost nothing but black sand, and at times, you have to rely on small road markers,' he said. 'It's like being on the moon.' Too close for comfort? The fearless cameraman ventured within 15 metres of molten lava to capture these apocalyptic scenes from the Icelandic eruption's aftermath . Despite fast-flowing lava trickling down from the crater, Valdimar Leifsson, 61, risked his life to get the stunning close-ups . The lava glows in the dark as it rolls along the black sand towards the cameraman and his equipment . Leifsson travelled four hours from the nearest settlement to capture the photographs with his son Arnar Steinn and wife Bryndis . Ready for your close up? The photographer has captured volanic eruptions many times before and is seemingly unafraid of the phenomenon . A giant burning mass of molten remains can be see smouldering in the foreground as the lava continues to spurt from the crater behind . The set up:  Leifsson aims his camera at the volcano still smouldering away to capture the stunning shots . 'It's like you're watching the creation of the earth,' says Leifsson of the incredible sight . View from above: The volcano Bardarbunga first began violently spewing lava and molten ash in August . Setting up: 'The heat emanating from the lava is much more visible during the night,' explains Leifsson, who set up his equipment specifically to capture it in the dark . As Leifsson braved the heat metres from the volcano, a geologist and teacher trying to photograph the Northern Lights by a lagoon in south east Iceland 90 kilometres away captured these equally stunning shots which he said reminded him of 'Lord Of The Rings'. In just eight degrees, by the lagoon Jokulsarlon in south east Iceland, Orn Óskarsson from Selfoss town in south west Iceland, said: 'We were meant to be photographing the Northern Lights using the lagoon and the ice blocks in the foreground but we got the red glow from the eruption of Bardarbunga instead. 'The eruption on the north side of the Vatnajokull glacier started two weeks before, so we knew about it but we did not assume we would see the glow.' Red sky at night: The clouds in the sky reflect the erupting volcano of Bardarbunga.  The glow is created by a pool of lava lying in the volcano's crater . 'I was born in Iceland and I'm 59 years old, so I have seen a lot of eruptions in my lifetime. But this was totally new for me,' said photographer Orn Óskarsson . Only reflect: A lack of wind, clear sky and temperatures of over eight degrees celsius allowed Óskarsson to capture the bright reflections . The glow is created by a pool of lava lying in the volcano's crater and reflecting in the sky above. And as it bounces back down onto the waters of a lagoon, pictured in the foreground, the red glow stretches to become a rippled red pillar. The noise and sights of the eruption were blocked by small intervening mountains and Europe's largest glacier - Vatnajokull - which stands at 1000 to 2000 metres high. Yet the lack of wind, a clear sky and temperatures of over eight degrees celsius, allowed Óskarsson to clearly see the bright reflections. The photographer said: 'As I was born in Iceland and I'm 59-years-old, I have seen a lot of eruptions in my lifetime. But this was totally new for me. It was more like a scene from Lord of the Rings - I have never seen a reflection like this from other eruptions.'","Valdimar Leifsson, 61, risked his life to get the close-ups by setting up his camera 15 metres away .

"Scientists have found the brain's 'misery molecule' believed to be responsible for all of our feelings of stress and anxiety . Scientists have found the brain's 'misery molecule' believed to be responsible for all of our feelings of stress and anxiety. Researchers believe that the protein - named CRF1 - could also be linked to depression. A team from Heptares Therapeutics, a medical company based in Hertfordshire, used one of the world's most powerful x-ray machines to study the brain's pituitary gland. It has long been known that the gland controls stress, depression and anxiety by releasing stress chemicals, the Sunday Times reports. Now, scientists have discovered the response is triggered by CRF1 - which is found in the outer membranes of pituitary cells. Fiona Marshall, chief scientific officer at Heptares, told the paper: 'Stress related diseases such as depression and anxiety affect a quarter of adults each year, but what many people don't realise is that these conditions are controlled by proteins in the brain, one of which is CRF1.' She added that now they have worked out the structure of it and how it works it could open up potential to design drugs to control it. CRF1 sits in pituitary cells and detects the stress molecules detected by the hypothalamus, a portion of the brain which produces hormones that control, body temperature, hunger and moods - among others. A team from Heptares Therapeutics, a medical company based in Hertfordshire, used the Diamond Light Source (pictured) one of the world's most powerful x-ray machines to study the brain's pituitary gland . When it picks one of these molecules up, it triggers the parent cell to release the hormones which lead to stress and anxiety, the paper reports. Using the Diamond Light Source, based in Harwell, Oxfordshire, which produces powerful x-ray beams, researchers were able to study the protein's structure and pin point areas which could be targeted by new drugs. Ms Marshall said they had identified a 'crevice' which would be an ideal area to aim a molecule which could be specially designed to block CRF1 - effectively disabling it. She said the team now hope to use this research method to analyse molecules involved in type 2 diabetes - with the hope of one day developing a drug which can be taken orally as opposed to the injections which sufferers of the condition have to use.","Researchers found the protein - named CRF1- in the pituitary gland .

"The Ohio football stars charged with raping a 16-year-old girl in a night of degradation and humiliation have been found guilty. In emotional courtroom scenes, both defendants Trent Mays, 17, and Ma’lik Richmond, 16, wept uncontrollably as Judge Thomas Lipps handed down his verdict, describing their actions as ‘profane and ugly.’ As Mays and Richmond were comforted by their attorneys and their families sobbed, prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter pressed for a stern sentencing reminding the judge: ‘They showed absolutely no regard for what happened to the victim. Scroll down for video . Reaction: Ma'lik Richmond, right, openly weeps after learning the verdict in his trial at the juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio today; he was sentenced to at least one year at a juvenile detention center . Together: Trent Mays, 17, left, gets a hug from his father after Trent and co-defendant Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found delinquent on rape and other chargesk . Emotions: On the left, Defense attorney Walter Madison, right comforts Ma'lik Richmond, left; right, Mays enters the courtroom ahead of the judge's decision . ‘In the case of Mays once the information got out, there was a very conscious decision to turn it on her. ‘The lack of remorse was appalling’ Today, as both Steubenville High . School students faced the reality of the consequences of what happened . that August night last year, their remorse appeared overwhelming. Both have been sentence to a minimum of one year in a juvenile detention institution with the maximum stay of until they are 21. Judge Thomas Lipps talks from the bench to the families of Trent Mays and Ma'Lik Richmond after he pronounced them delinquent on rape and other charges after their trial in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio . Family members console each other as Judge Thomas Lipps (not shown) delivers the verdicts in the trial of Ma'lik Richmond, 16 and Trent Mays, 17, in juvenile court in Steubenville, Ohio, March 17, 2013 . Family ties: Ma'lik Richmond, center, stands with his father, Nathaniel Richmond, left, and attorney Walter Madison after he and co-defendant Trent Mays, 17, were found delinquent . Mays faced an additional charge of the . use and dissemination of nude images of a minor. He received the same . sentence for that to run consecutively. His minimum detention is two . years. His actions were, according to Judge . Lipps, ‘more egregious’ making it inappropriate that he should face the . same sentence as Richmond. Guilty: Ma'lik Richmond, top, hugs his mother Daphne Birden, after closing arguments were made on the fourth day of the juvenile trial on Saturday . Court proceedings: Ma’lik Richmond, 16, (left) and Trent Mays, 17, (right) in court on Saturday; both were found guilty today of raping a teenage girl last summer . Trial by social media: The messages over Twitter, Instagram and text that were exchanged that night and the next day have become central to the case - and to the outrage it has caused nationwide . Verdict: Two protestors hug outside the Jefferson County Justice Center after hearing the verdict in the trial . Richmond’s father, Nathaniel, who has . been present in court every day made his way over to his son, fell to . his knees and told him that he loved him. ‘My life is ruined,’ Richmond told attorney his Walter Madison, who was clearly shocked at the verdict. Mays father, Bryan, held his head in his hands as the defendant’s sister Rhiannan and mother wept. Both defendants took the opportunity . to address the victim and her family – present for the verdict and . visible to the defendants but out of view of the main court in a . screened off section of seating. Mays was composed as he said: ‘I would . like to apologize to [the victim] and her family, my family and the . community. No pictures should have been sent let alone ever taken.’ But though Mays apologized quite specifically for taking pictures of the victim and sending them nowhere did he mention or offer an apology for the rape. In every communication with the victim following the night of 11 -12 August he repeatedly denied raping her. In fact in an incriminating detail it is an allegation he denies before it is ever made. Again and again his texts show him turning the blame on the victim, hectoring her, pressurizing her not to go to the police and telling her that the rape ‘didn’t happen.’ Standing in court, convicted of that crime and filled with apparent regret, the rape remained a crime for which he does not apologize. In court: Trent Mays, 17, talks with one of his defense lawyers, Brian Duncan yesterday . When it came to Richmond’s turn, he . walked towards the victim and her family, across the courtroom, weeping; . ‘I would like to apologize. I had no intention to put you guys through . this. I’m sorry. I don’t know what to say. ‘I ruined her life.’ At this, he could no longer speak . because he was overcome with tears, and was walked back to this seat by . Fred Abdalla Jr, Chief Probation Officer for Jefferson County Juvenile . Court. Apologies followed from Bryan Mays, . Greg Aggresta – Richmond’s guardian who, along with his wife Jennifer . have been in court every day. The Aggresta’s have spoken openly about . their support for Richmond and love for him ‘whatever happened.’ Today in court they appeared emotionally shattered. Richmond was not in their care when the events took place. The Ohio rape convictions do not mark the end of the scandal that has gripped the small town of Steubenville and America at large. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, right, answers questions about the successful prosecution of two juveniles . Ohio State Attorney General Mike DeWine has revealed that a Grand Jury will be called on April 15 with as many as 16 other youths facing possible charges. Speaking just moments after Judge Thomas Lipps handed down his verdict, Ohio State Attorney Mike DeWine has revealed: ‘We’ve gone a long way in this investigation and we’re almost there. The grand jury will finish up that investigation.’ He said that there were 16 people of interest who had so far refused to co-operate with the investigation. The Grand Jury will seek to resolve this and while he acknowledged it is more commonly concerned with criminal cases in the adult court he said it also served as ‘an investigating tool’ in matters relating to Juvenile Court. The three key prosecution witnesses – all of whom admitted being present and participating in the events of August 11-12 – were all granted immunity on condition of their testimony. Many campaigning groups have heavily criticized the controversial decision but it was a decision that the victim’s family understood as solicitor Mr Bob Fitzsimmons explained: . ‘You had three boys, eye witnesses to what happened. They [Attorney General’s office} had to make a difficult decision to grant three people we all think were probably criminally liable immunity. ‘Their conduct was reprehensible and despicable but sometimes you have to make deals.’ All three could still face charges outside the State of Ohio if they are found to have sent nude images of a minor across county lines. The victim herself is from Weirton, barely three miles from Steubenville but across state lines and in West Virginia. Summing up: Judge Thomas Lipps listens to prosecuting attorney Marianne Hemmeter give a closing argument Saturday; he declared the defendants guilty today . Mr Madison said: ‘To some extent they blame themselves.’ It would be hard to understate the . intensity of the courtroom scenes as all three young people  - . defendants and victim – and their families took in the devastation this . case has wrought on their lives. This was not a time of jubilation on the victim’s family’s part – they declined the opportunity to address the court. This was a time for the defendants to . absorb the fact that this finding will be, as Mr Madison put it, ‘an . escort for the rest of their lives.’ Across days of often appalling testimony the court has heard texts, tweets and emails between the defendants and their friends. Small town: Both defendants played football for Steubenville High School's team Big Red . They have heard about pictures, been . reminded of vile video rants and seen the reality of what these boys did . and how they behaved, who they were, when nobody else was looking. The case has scandalized America and scarred the small town of Steubenville, Ohio. Mays and Richmond will begin their . sentence today. They will be taken to an institute just northwest of . Columbus, Ohio where they will be assessed and a decision made as to . where they should spend their time in custody. ‘So much of what happens with their . future depends upon their attitude and how they embrace their . rehabilitation,’ said Judge Lipps. ‘There is plenty of room to demonstrate your good character. There is also plenty of room to make mistakes.’ On the map: The working class town of Steubenville, located in eastern Ohio, has a population of around 18,000 .","Judge ruled today that Trent Mays, 16, and Ma'lik Richmond, 17, both students at Steubenville High School, are guilty of raping girl, 16, at alcohol-fueled party last summer .

"A retired couple have hit out at a hotel's food standards after they contracted gastroenteritis while on holiday in the Canary Islands. David and Lynne Fossey, from Bristol, claim they were left bed-bound just days into a two-week stay at ClubHotel Riu Oliva Beach Resort, Fuerteventura. David, 71, said he was struck down with severe stomach cramps, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting within hours of Lynne, 65, suffering similar symptoms a few days into their trip. David and Lynne Fossey, whose holiday to the Canary Islands was ruined when they were struck by illness . David said the all-inclusive hotel - which they booked through Thomson - 'regularly' left food uncovered, and meals were served 'lukewarm'. They claim they ate all of their meals during the holiday at the hotel. The couple, who have been married for 47 years and visited the hotel in 2013, allege they spent two days confined to their room, too ill to leave. The resort doctor, called when their conditions worsened, diagnosed the couple with gastroenteritis and prescribed capsules and rehydration salts. David said: 'My wife and I wanted a relaxing holiday together in the sun and were looking forward to returning to the Riu Oliva Beach Hotel after visiting the year before and having a wonderful time. 'But this was ruined when we both began to feel unwell midway through the holiday. We were unable to leave the hotel, enjoy the weather, the facilities or our remaining time away together. The Thomson's Riu Oliva Beach Hotel which the Fosseys returned to after a wonderful holiday the year before . 'I was disappointed with the hotel this time. My wife and I noticed in the restaurant that some of the food was regularly left uncovered and on occasions the food was served lukewarm and I noticed that on occasions freshly produced food was often added to food already out on the buffet. 'Compared to our last visit the previous year, the hotel looked run down and required decorating. 'I noticed plaster coming off the wall. It was simply not the same hotel I had holidayed at the previous year.' The couple have instructed lawyers Irwin and Mitchell to investigate on their behalf, adding that 'we would like answers on what caused us to become ill', adding that they have ongoing symptoms.. Amandeep Samra, spokesman for Irwin Mitchell's international personal injury team, said: 'Aside from making holidays extremely unpleasant, gastroenteritis can have a long-term impact on a sufferer's health. 'Our clients have described how they had been looking forward to their holiday. 'They did not expect to fall ill or continue to suffer illness upon return home. These new claims are still being investigated and we hope tour operator Thomson will work with us to ascertain what caused our clients to fall ill. 'The tour operator also continues to investigate these claims and their position on whether liability is admitted or denied is awaited.' Thomson issued this statement after being contacted by Travelmail: 'Thomson is sorry to hear of Mr and Mrs Fossey’s experience at the ClubHotel Riu Oliva Beach Resort this summer. 'As we understand legal proceedings for this case have started, it would be inappropriate for us to comment further. 'We would like to reassure customers that Thomson closely audits all resorts to which we operate to ensure that health, hygiene and comfort levels are maintained in line with industry standards.'","David and Lynne Fossey have asked lawyers to investigate holiday illness .

"Increased temperatures on America's West Coast are not a result of human-caused climate change, but rather naturally occurring wind changes according to a new study. The 1 degree Fahrenheit of warming that has been recorded on the coast of the northwest Pacific Ocean is due to weaker winds and changing ocean circulation, not a buildup of greenhouse gasses. These weaker winds accounted for more than 80% of the warming trend along the Pacific Northwest coast between Washington and Northern California, and 60% of the warming in Southern California. Scroll down for video . Getting hotter: Temperature increases on the coast of the northwest Pacific Ocean (above) are due to weaker winds and changing ocean circulation . Not expected: In places like Oregon (above) 80% of the warming trend is due to weaker winds, not global warming . This was discovered in a study conducted by researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington. 'Changing winds appear to explain a very large fraction of the warming from year to year, decade to decade and the long-term,' said study leader James Johnstone according to the Los Angeles Times. The slower the wind gets, the less evaporation that occurs, which then leads to lower pressure, less rain, and, over time, higher temperatures. Greenhouse gasses do, however. play some role in the rising temperature, just not as much as had been assumed in this region of the world. Most of the warming occurred between 1900 and 1940 the study found, when the wind was much weaker and greenhouse gasses far, far lower. Keeps rising: temperatures in places like Washington (above) have increased roughly 1 degree Fahrenheit over the past 100 years . Some however are calling this study into question, including Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research., who questions if there is enough data, and the quality of the data, from the first half of the twentieth century to make these claims. He also said this study in no way calls into question 'the concept of global warming.'","According to a new study increased temperatures on the West Coast of America are the result of changing wind patterns, not global warming .

"Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev always acted like a 'bully' and a 'tough guy' at high school but appeared harmless, according to an ex-girlfriend he once allegedly slapped. Nadine Ascencao, 25, has spoken out about her relationship with the man who allegedly planted two bombs at the Boston Marathon last week, killing three people and injuring more than 180. Despite this heinous crime and a disturbing pattern of verbal and physical abuse towards women, Ascencao has claimed the man she once lived with did not appear to be capable of 'anything major'. 'He was a little tough guy, but I thought that was it,' she told the Wall Street Journal. 'In high school, everybody acts like that. Like a bully guy, you know?' 'Bully': Suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, pictured at boxing matches, was a 'bully' and a 'little tough guy' when he was at high school according to his former girlfriend . 'He was just like a normal person that sometimes like wanted to scare kids in high school but that was it.... He was a little tough guy, but I thought that was it.' Despite her claims, Ascencao was once allegedly the victim of Tsarnaev's temper; police records show she was the woman who accused him of slapping her on July 28, 2009, The Journal reported. She refused to speak to The Journal about the incident, but records show she told police he had slapped her in the face during an argument over another woman - presumably Katherine Russell, whom he met at a club that year and went on to marry in 2010 - at his home in Cambridge. She was 'crying hysterically' and called . 911 to report that she was 'beat up by her boyfriend', Cambridge Police . Officer Angela Pereira wrote in the arrest report. 'Abuse': Tsarnaev allegedly once slapped the woman around the face during an argument in 2009 . He admitted to slapping her and was . arrested on charges of assault and battery, the complaint said. The . charges were dismissed before trial. While Ascencao would not say when she dated Tsarnaev or for how long, records also show they lived together for a short time at an apartment on Norfolk Street. Ascencao added to The Journal that she was 'disgusted' by his alleged part in the deadly bombings. When she learned he had died, 'I didn't even cry or anything', she said. Ascencao's neighbors said FBI agents visited her home early on Friday morning to clarify the relationship she had with him. The agents left three hours later and briefly returned in the afternoon.

Summer 2006 Tamerlan Tsarnaev graduates Cambridge Rindge & Latin School, where he met Nadine Ascencao . 2009 While a student at Boston's Suffolk University, Katherine Russell meets Tsarnaev at a nightclub after they are introduced by a girl friend. Russell's lawyer, Amato DeLuca, said Tsarnaev was seeing another woman at the time. 'They went out for a while, and then they stopped and then they went out again,' she told Newsday. July 2009 Nadine Ascencao calls police to claim she was 'beat up by her boyfriend' after he allegedly slapped her across the face during an argument about another woman . Spring 2010 Russell, who has fallen pregnant with Tsarnaev's child, drops out of college in her senior year. She gives birth to their daughter Zahara, who is now three, and converts to Islam . June 2010 Russell and Tsarnaev marry in a ceremony in Dorchester . Around 11 months after the alleged slapping incident, Tsarnaev, 26, married his wife, Katherine Russell. She has not spoken publicly since Tsarnaev's death early Friday in a shootout with police. But three of Russell's friends told National Public Radio's Laura Sullivan that Tsarnaev would often insult Russell and call her names, such as 'slut' and 'prostitute.' He was known to fly into into fits of rage where he would throw objects at Russell, including furniture, friends said. Sometime around 2008, his erratic and violent behavior escalated as he stopped smoking and drinking and suddenly became heavily involved in Islam. He met Russell in 2009 while at a nightclub and her lawyer, Amato DeLuca, said he was dating another woman at the time - presumably Ascencao. However, 'they went out for a while, and then they stopped and then they went out again', DeLuca said. In Spring 2010, Russell dropped out of college after falling pregnant with his child. They now have a three-year-old daughter Zahara, indicating the little girl was born before their June 2010 wedding. Around that time, he demanded that Russell, born a Christian, convert to Islam - and she complied. Getaway: She is leaves a law office in .

'We cannot begin to comprehend how this horrible tragedy occurred. Our hearts are sickened by the knowledge of the horror he has inflicted.’ She added: ‘In the aftermath of the Patriots’ Day horror, we now know that we never really knew Tamerlan Tsarnaev.’","Nadine Ascencao, 25, said Tsarnaev 'was a little tough guy' in high school .

"The UK is the fourth richest nation in the world with the average family better off than those in France and Japan, according to official figures yesterday. Gross domestic product per capita – the total size of the economy divided by every man, woman and child in Britain – was £21,692 in 2012. The measurement was only higher in the United States, Canada and Germany. This means the UK was ahead of Japan, France and Italy as well as the emerging 'BRIC' economies of Brazil, Russia, India  and China. In 1997, the UK was only the sixth wealthiest nation in the world, behind the US,  Canada, Japan, Germany and France. Gross domestic product per capita ¿ the total size of the economy divided by every man, woman and child in Britain ¿ was £21,692 in 2012. The measurement was only higher in the United States, Canada and Germany . The report by the Office for National  Statistics added that the UK is now one of the best performing economies in the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. This follows  the slowest recovery since the Second World War. 'Throughout 2013 and in the first quarter of 2014, the UK has moved from having one of the slowest growth rates in the G7 to one of the fastest,' it said. But it said output in Britain is still 0.6 per cent below its pre-crisis peak, having crashed 7.2 per cent in the 'Great Recession' of 2008 and 2009. Italy is the only other country in the G7 not to have clawed back its losses. The figures mean the UK was ahead of Japan, France (pictured) and Italy . However, the UK looks set to reach that milestone in the current second quarter of the year. Last week, a report by the Confederation of British Industry suggested the British economy is growing at its fastest pace for a decade. Wages here have also lagged behind the rest of the G7 since 2007, falling 5.1 per cent once inflation is taken into account. However, wage growth is now picking up and inflation has fallen back below the 2 per cent target, easing the squeeze on family finances. Britain is also set to be the best performing major economy in the developed world this year, according to forecasts from the Bank of England and the International Monetary Fund. Last year, the recovery was being driven by consumer spending and the revival of the housing market but it is now broadening out into manufacturing and business investment. This week, a report showed British manufacturers are enjoying one of their best spells for more than two decades with new orders coming in from all over the world. Meanwhile figures yesterday showed the construction industry, which was hammered in the recession, racked up its 13th consecutive month of growth in May. The sector's purchasing managers' index of activity – where scores above 50 represent expansion – went from 60.8 in April to a still strong 60 last month. Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit, the research group behind the survey, said: 'The UK construction sector is enjoying its strongest overall phase of expansion since the  summer of 2007. Residential building remains a key engine of growth.' But the recovery has failed to boost the public purse, with the Government on course to borrow another £95.5billion this year. The national debt, already at £1.27trillion, is set to hit £1.4trillion this year – or more than £55,000 per household. In the eurozone, official figures have fuelled fears of a deflationary spiral where firms hit by falling profits cut investment and staff. Inflation fell from 0.7 per cent in April to  0.5 per cent in May, well below a target of  2 per cent.  Unemployment in the eurozone was 11.7 per cent in April, compared to the latest reading of 6.8 per cent in the UK.","UK only lags behind United States, Canada and Germany .

"Virgin America is Twitter's 'hash-tag favourite' airline. At least according to a new study, measuring the popularity of - and distaste for - the major US airlines on social media. American Airlines, Delta, jetBlue, United and Virgin America were rated in eight categories including cost, luggage and crew. Scroll down for video . United Airline was praised for its crew, but the same could not be said about delays and cancellations . Overall, Virgin America had the most positive tweets, ranking highest for customer service, delays/cancellations, luggage, security, and charges/fees. JetBlue was in second place overall, followed by Delta. And while United Airline was praised for its crew, the same could not be said of customer feedback about delays and cancellations, luggage restrictions and charges and fees. American Airlines were not too popular either, scoring badly on crew, entertainment, seating and security. Infographic shows how US airlines were rated against each other, in accordance to customers' tweets . Many people find complaining on Twitter can be productive, especially now that airlines and travel companies have social networking teams to respond. But some online complaints - even those directed at a specific company - will go unnoticed. The new technology, created by a company called Luminoso, allows companies to analyse data from large amounts of tweets, so they can easily see feedback from customers. Its website explains: 'Luminoso is based on a learning algorithm that understands words contextually, rather than relying solely on their dictionary definitions, and sorts them by their meaning. Top notch: Virgin America was the airline most valued on social networking sites, according to Luminoso . 'So instead of just finding the key words, Luminoso can find the key concepts, ideas, thoughts, and feelings that drive your consumers' choices. Code experts at the company used language processing technology to analyze more than 157,000 tweets directly mentioning five airline handles. Words such as 'hate' would drive down an airline's raking in the luggage category while 'love' in conjunction with 'wifi' or another aspect of their service, would increase its popularity.","Virgin America came out on top, while United Airlines ranked the worst .

"If you're a billionaire oil tycoon and it's your birthday, a Colin the Caterpillar cake just isn't going to cut it. Hiring a pop star to perform at your private party is more like it, which is what Kazakh energy boss Kairat Boranbeyev is said to have done to celebrate his birthday in London this week. Mr Boranbayev reportedly paid former Pussycat Doll and X Factor judge Nicole Scherzinger 'in excess of £100,000' to play a private gig for him at his house in Mayfair on Sunday night. Scroll down for video . Businessman Kairat Boranbayev, second left, is said to have paid Nicole Scherzinger to sing at his birthday, while other guests included Kazakh pop star Baigali Serkebayev, right, from Kazakh band, A Studio, who put this picture of the host and some of his guests on his Instagram feed . Former X Factor judge and Nicole Scherzinger, 36, performed at a private gig in Mayfair on Sunday evening . Earlier that day, Miss Scherzinger put a photograph of herself, her dancers and her dog at rehearsals . The 36-year-old American pop star was chauffeured from her hotel in London's West End to Mr Boranbeyev's home near Berkeley Square, where she spent more than three hours performing hits such as Don't Cha and Your Love to a small group of his family and friends. Earlier in the day Scherzinger, whose boyfriend is motor racing star Lewis Hamilton, had taken a picture of herself rehearsing at the house with her friends Natalie Romero and Nigerian performer, Diddi, as well as her tan and white English bulldog, Roscoe. The singer wasn't the only pop star at the businessman's birthday party - Russian Eurovision singer Dima Bilan and Mitya Fomin were also there, as well as Kazakh pop star Baigali Serkebayev, from the popular group A Studio. Mr Boranbayev, who was pictured standing with a group including Mr Serkebayev on the pop star's Instagram feed, is well known in his native Kazakhstan, where he ran Russian-Kazakh oil and gas firm, KazRosGas LLP, for eight years until his resignation earlier this year. The oligarch, who was one of the firm's founding partners, said he wished to pursue new business opportunities after his time at KazRosGas. He is a keen football fan and one-time owner of Kazakh's most famous football side, FC Kairat. And he is no stranger to hiring pop stars to help him celebrate.  When his daughter Alima Boranbayeva married the Kazakh president's grandson, Aysultan Nazarbayev a year ago, the happy couple were said to have paid singer Kanye West $3million to perform at the wedding. After helping Mr Boranbayev celebrate his birthday, Miss Scherzinger went on to Boujis nightclub in London's South Kensington, where she left the VIP area to dance with clubbers on the main dancefloor. As well as her successful gig for the Kazakh, she was celebrating her boyfriend's win at the Singapore Grand Prix with shots of tequila and vodka, before leaving the club at 3am and getting into a car with two of her female dancers. Miss Scherzinger performed a set at the birthday party before heading to Boujis in South Kensington . Night on the tiles: The 36-year-old singer left the venue hand in hand with her two female dancers at 3am . After changing out of her silver sequinned dress into a patterned jumpsuit, Miss Scherzinger was later seen taking her dog for a late night stroll around Piccadilly Circus, which she documented via Instagram. Slipping into something more comfortable, Nicole donned a printed tracksuit with a black fitted cap and white slippers. The caption which accompanied the images read: 'Late night walking Roscoe on the streets of #London after a great show tonight w/my girls @natalieromerolv @diddi_e #hotelslippers'. 'Late night walking Roscoe': After the show, Nicole Scherzinger and her dancers went for a walk with her dog . Outfit change... The former X Factor judge changed into a printed tracksuit and slippers for the evening walk . Ahead of her night out Nicole was seen returning to her hotel with her tan-and-white English bulldog after jetting in from a weekend trip to Los Angeles. Framing her face with a pair of sunglasses, Nicole, 36, looked ready for the gym, wearing a loose-fitting white top, black leggings and black-and-white trainers. The singer took to her Instagram account to share a snapshot of Roscoe nuzzling her next to the caption: 'Me & Roscoe so proud of you babe @lewishamilton winning #f1 #SingaporeGP #1 XO' In a follow-up shot hours later, Roscoe was also the star of the show when Nicole went to rehearse with her dancers. 'Rehearsing for my private gig in #London tonight w/our mascot #TeamRoscoe,' she wrote. Hamilton, 29, bought Roscoe in February 2013, saying that he had dreamed of owning an English bulldog ever since he was a child.

"With long flights, late nights and constant pressure to look good, the jet set lifestyle can wreak havoc on even the glossiest of A-listers. But Hollywood's finest have a new weapon in their anti-ageing arsenal: a smorgasbord of pills and supplements that they swear make all the difference. These are not the sort of supplements you will see lining the shelves at Tesco. From stomach calming probiotics to wrinkle-busters that fix the skin from within, the new breed of Hollywood super-supplements have some serious science to go with them. Anti-ageing arsenal: Celebrities are increasingly turning to pills to keep wrinkles and cellulite at bay . Probiotics might have been around for a while, but the new super-strength variety are currently topping the Hollywood beauty wishlist. 'It's all about calming the digestion and flattening the stomach,' reveals LA nutritionist Kimberley Snyder who adds that demand for 'power probiotics' shoots up during awards season. Although there's plenty of choice when it comes to probiotics, the brand that currently has cult status among A-listers is Symprove, £21.95, which comes in a liquid form and calms the stomach, while tackling bloating at the same time. Both symptoms are caused by stress, which is why magnesium is also a popular pill among the glitterati. 'Magnesium is a great relaxer,' former supermodel Rosemary Ferguson told Grazia magazine. 'It soothes the muscles, so it's brilliant for stress, and is fantastic for sleep. 'That's why bathing in Epsom Salts is so good, as you absorb magnesium through the skin.' Effective: Jennifer Lawrence and Lopez turned to supplements to help them survive the awards season . One A-list convert to the power of Epsom Salts is Hunger Games star, Jennifer Lawrence, who began using the remedy on the recommendation of her friend and personal trainer, Dalton Wong. 'Epsom Salts help to get rid of any bloating in the body before slipping into a red carpet dress,' Wong revealed. 'It’s a great trick that anyone can use if they’re working up to wearing a particularly clingy dress.' Also on the shopping list is Japanese scientist Dr Miyayama's 'super conductor' supplement, Fulphyl which costs a truly A-list £160 per bottle. Fulphyl, another liquid supplement, contains fulvic acid which helps transport nutrients and vitamins around the body, as well as an anti-oxidant in its own right. According to nutritionists, the supplement can help maximise the effectiveness of other pills, as well as halting damage caused by wrinkle-causing free-radicals. Wrinkles and free-radicals are also the target of French cosmetic doctor Dr Daniel Sister's Youth pills, £64 for a one-month supply. Combining amino acids and marine enzymes, the supplement is said to boost volume while repairing and strengthening skin from within. While Dr Sister's pills can help calm skin, nothing soothes as fast as Hungarian organic brand, Eminence Calm Skin VitaSkin Solution, £36.22. Cocktail: The A-list use supplements tackle everything from extra pounds to unsightly acne . Read more in this week's Grazia, which is  out now . Because the average A-lister travels almost constantly, jet lagged skin is a serious problem, which Eminence tackles with detoxifying milk thistle. Also included are anti-oxidant green tea, garlic oil and lecithin, all of which help to get rid of lumpy, bumpy skin and rashes - essential if your job includes stepping off planes in front of paparazzi. Not surprisingly, the all-natural, all-organic supplement has proved popular with health conscious stars, including Jessica Biel and Megan Fox - both of whom use the pills. But though skin and sleep are key parts of keeping A-listers glossy, the perfect body is a priority, which is why supplements like Functionalab's Beauty Dose Body Toning supplement, £33, and Verdesse's green coffee slimming pills, £14.95, are so popular with stars such as Katy Perry and Jennifer Lopez. Green coffee proved particularly popular in the run up to the Oscars, thanks to studies which show it can boost weight loss by an impressive 10 per cent. According to a study conducted by scientists from the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania, the fat-busting impact of the pills occurs even when taken in relatively low doses. Joe Vinson, who led the study, said: 'Based on our results, taking multiple capsules of green coffee extract a day — while eating a low-fat, healthful diet and exercising regularly — appears to be a safe, effective, inexpensive way to lose weight.'

"A revolutionary powder claims to be able to discover what a person has eaten, what medication they’re on and even their sex, all from a single fingerprint. Developed by researchers at Newcastle University, the powder contains nanoparticles that stick to the ridges of prints more effectively than current powders. This improves the clarity of the prints by up to 40 per cent, and can pick up chemical and trace elements that reveal details about the criminal's behaviour. A revolutionary powder (pictured)  claims to be able to discover what a person has eaten, what medication they're on and even their sex, all from a single fingerprint. The SupraNano powder contains nano particles that stick to the ridges of prints more effectively than current powders . And the results can be obtained within minutes of the sample reaching the Arro SupraNano lab at the northeast university, or when ran through an analytics test kit. The Arro SupraNano powder produces similar results to technology recently developed by researchers from Sheffield. Their microscopic technology is called . Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging . (MALDI-MSI) and it traces drugs, hair and cleaning products in . fingerprints. It has been developed by researchers at Sheffield Hallam University’s Biomedical Research Centre (BMRC). The technology uses MALDI-MSI to produce multiple images of fingermarks. This can reveal tiny changes in shape, and reveal particles and other elements hidden within the ridges. These details can be important background information in a criminal investigation, especially if the suspect's fingerprint is not on the police database and a positive ID cannot be made. ‘A murder case can cost between £1m and £3m, with most of that in time and legwork,’ said Arro SupraNano's managing director Eamonn Cooney. ‘But with this test you can say male or female, whether they are on medication, what their lifestyle is, are they taking or distributing drugs, or if they are a terrorists. ‘If you took 100 suspects and had each of them take the test then you could narrow it down to two or three very quickly.' A fingermark is made up of material from the surface of the skin, and from gland secretions. Conventionally, . fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted using a . powder and compared with prints on a police database to identify a . suspect. The technology behind the new powder and test was first developed by Professor Frederick Rowell at Sunderland University in 2005. It picks up traces of drugs, explosives and gun residue within the fingerprints ridges. Additionally, . when people ingest a medicine or drugs, they are metabolised and pass . out through the pores of the skin as nanoparticles. It launched in January and is now being sold around the world, with the patented analytic test set to go to market in the coming months. These nano particles improve the clarity of the prints by up to 40 per cent, and can pick up chemical and trace elements that reveal details about the criminal left on fingerprints (pictured).

Additionally, when people ingest a medicine or drugs, they are metabolised and pass out through the pores of the skin as nano particles . The company recently received the Forensics and Expert Witness E Magazine's annual product development award. ‘Fingerprinting has not changed much in many years,’ continued Mr Cooney. ‘You go to a crime scene, brush with powder, lift the print with tape, take a photo and record it on a national database. But we've done two new things with nano particles. ‘Our powder adheres much more closely to the ridges and troughs of a fingerprint, as the particles are chemically very sticky. ‘[This] is really important as for comparison you're looking for 12 to 20 points, and prints are often smudged.

Their microscopic technology is called Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionisation Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MALDI-MSI) (pictured) and it traces drugs, hair and cleaning products in fingerprints . ‘You can now see the details much more clearly and there is less background staining.’ Law enforcement groups have praised the powder and said it could be used for serious crimes, such as murders, sexual assaults, and arson. ‘Even if you drink a cup of coffee we can detect the caffeine. Or if you smoke,’ added Mr Cooney. The powder also has potential benefits outside of crime investigations, in medicine for example. ‘Because of what you can find on the surface of the skin, this could be used medically - you might even be able to tell how a drug will perform before a person even takes it,’ concluded Mr Cooney. ‘It's amazing what you can find through fingerprints.’","The powder was developed by Arro SupraNano at Newcastle University .

"It's no secret that Whole Foods isn't the most cost-friendly of grocery stores, but a new survey shows just how much more customers pay at the natural food retailer compared to other regional supermarkets. New York investment firm Wolfe Research recently did a study, comparing baskets of groceries at the upscale organic market to other stores across the nation and confirmed that tags at Whole Foods are through the roof. In one instance, Wolfe totaled 60-72 items at Whole Foods and then compared them to prices for the same exact products at Houston's HEB, a Mariano's grocery store in Chicago, and a Wegmans market in Washington, DC. Scroll down for video . This above graphs shows a comparison of prices at Whole Foods with regional grocery chains throughout the U.S. Expensive: Prices at Whole Foods in almost every case of the study were higher by a wide margin . Prices were lowest at HEB where the final total came to about 220, much less than the more than 250 spent at Whole Foods. Mariano's and Wegmans groceries also rung in less than Whole Foods, by about 30-40 dollars. In another smaller survey, Wolfe bought between 11 and 17 organic or conventional produce items at the three regional grocery stores and compared them again to Whole Foods. Prices at HEB and Mariano's remained considerably lower than Whole Foods, but in this sample Wegmans ended up being the more expensive store by a small margin. Prices are seemingly becoming a problem for the national grocery chain, which saw only a small increase in same store sales for the last quarter. Bring them back: Whole Foods is reportedly instituting a loyalty rewards program and national marketing campaign to drum up more business . Whole Foods reported a rise of 3.9 per cent, which is minimal compared to the sales increases of 8 per cent seen in the past. And now the chain is getting desperate to turn out more business, since their stock prices have fallen 40 per cent since late October 2013. 'The emergence of the multi-pronged competitive attack on Whole Foods by generally lower-priced competitors suggests to us that Whole Foods’ business model faces a very real, clear and present danger,' Wolfe analysts wrote last week. As a response, Whole Foods will making a few changes to increase business including starting a loyalty rewards program and launching a national marketing campaign for the first time. Prices at Texas grocery chain HEB were the lowest in each comparison, with prices lower than Whole Foods by a margin of about 30 dollars in the larger sruvey . Chicago chain Mariano's had consistently lower prices than Whole Foods in both studies as well, despite being a supermarket with similarly organic and natural products . Wegmans, a grocery chain based in the Mid-Atlantic region, with outposts in Washington, DC, actually had higher prices than Whole Foods in one of the surveys .","Prices at Whole Foods were, on average, much more expensive than groceries at HEB, Mariano's and Wegmans ."
"A man who brought two women home from a Manhattan nightclub has been robbed after allegedly being drugged. Michael Curreri took the two unidentified woman back to his apartment near Gramercy Park last weekend after a night at Tao, a restaurant and nightclub in midtown, on Saturday. The New York Post reports that Curreri, 23, told the police that after arriving at his apartment at around 1am, the women stripped off their clothes and took a shower with him when they arrived at his apartment. Sporting his wealth: Michael Curreri, pictured posing with a Porsche, was robbed by two women that he brought home from a well-known Manhattan bar . Expensive goods: A $10,000 Rolex and $800 sunglasses were taken from Curreri's apartment by the two unidentified women after he was reportedly drugged . Then one of the unidentified women made him a cocktail, and he does not remember anything after that. His Mac laptop, his $10,000 Rolex watch, a $2,000 passport holder, an iPhone, and an $800 pair of sunglasses were all gone when he woke up. 'I’m sure that’s not how he expected the night would end. If it’s too good to be true, it probably (isn’t),' an unidentified source told The Post. Little is known about the 23-year-old other than the fact that he graduated from George Washington University in 2012 and reportedly worked as an intern for the United Nations. On the case: Police say that this type of crime is unfortunately frequent, and unlike Currceri (pictured), many victims don't come forward . No leads: Curreri's brother (not pictured) was in the apartment at the time of the robbery but did not hear anything . His Instagram and Facebook accounts . were public briefly before he shut them down, and he was seen posing in . photos with Porsche cars. Curreri . and his two new 'friends' were not the only ones in the apartment on . 19th Street and 3rd Avenue at the time of the incident. His brother William was reportedly sleeping in the apartment at the same time and did not hear anything. He wasn't left completely out of the incident, however, since the women reportedly made off with his iPhone as well. Where they met: Tao is a popular restaurant with a well-attended bar in midtown where Curreri met the women . 'These cases are very common in Manhattan. What usually happens is the victim— the man— is drinking at a bar and picks up a call girl. He gets drunk and brings her back to his apartment,' an unidentified law enforcement source told The Post. 'It’s very embarrassing for the victim so in some cases he won’t report it, particularly if he’s married.' The case is still open but there is very little information to go on. One of the women was white and the other was black, both had long hair and both weighed between 115 and 120 pounds. The investigators said that there is no indication that they were prostitutes.","Michael Curreri, 23, brought two women home with him from Tao, a restaurant in midtown, late Saturday night and they gave him a cocktail .

"Facebook founding president Sean Parker has hit back at a ValleyWag report claiming he hired people to plow snow into the middle of the street so he could have super fast internet access. The billionaire entrepreneur says he did not hire a work crew to plow the snow into the middle of West 10th Street so he could drop Time Warner Cable for Verizon FiOS and claims he hasn't lived at the house for years. Parker’s desire for FiOS was so great that he was willing to upset the fragile relationships most New Yorkers share with each other in such close quarters, a source told Gawker's ValleyWag. The article also said he paid to have the snow shoveled into the road up to his house, but then stopped short. He also said he only found out about the incident after reading MailOnline's report detailing the accusations. Clear path: A worker was seen Friday morning shoveling snow in front of the 10th Street home as the street was covered in snow . Careless: The snow was piled into the road without any care for neighbors or drivers . High and dry: Sean Parker, pictured at the 2012 SXSW Music Festival, is denying a ValleyWag report claiming he had the snow cleared to make way for a Verizon crew . 'This was news to me,' Parker wrote in an email. 'I just learned of this via your article.' The snow was pushed into and up the narrow one-way street away from the home to provide a Verizon crew space to hook up his $20million dollar pad with faster internet access than cable could provide, the source said. Pictures show a clear disparity in the snow cover leading traffic east towards Fifth Avenue from the six bedroom, seven-and-a-half bath palace and the bare pavement west towards Sixth Avenue. Parker said he no longer lives in the tony townhouse and has not 'for almost 2 years.' 'My wife and I have been living in midtown and we have no idea what is happening on that block,' he added. Parker admitted preparations have been underway for the new owner, but said he has not been kept in the loop, adding that he 'can't imagine why anybody would be digging around in the snow.' The brazen move came as New Yorkers have been suffering through the one of the coldest and snowiest winters in recorded history due to the Polar Vortex. Central Park has already received 56.6 inches of snow already, with nearly half falling this month alone, according to the National Weather Service. This winter is already into the top five snowiest in history. The city has a realistic shot at . reaching the all-time record of 75.6 inches set during the winter of . 1994-95 with another month-and-a-half of realistically cold enough . weather for winter storms. All clear: Orange cones and a lack of snow mark the front of the tony townhouse . Infuriating: Neighbors are said to be furious at the lack of regard for their safety by piling the snow into the middle of the busy, narrow street . Fantasy wedding: Parker's lavish wedding to Alexandra Lenas took place in a California redwood forest . A Verizon spokesperson declined to . speak about the matter to Valleywag, and Sean Parker did not immediately . return a MailOnline message seeking comment. Parker . potentially tossing snow into the street for his own convenience isn’t . the first stunt involving the billionaire that has furrowed more than a few eyebrows. He . and wife Alexandra Lenas were married last year in a lavish ‘Lord of . the Rings’-themed wedding ceremony in the middle of a California redwood . forest that cost the Napster co-founder several million dollars.

The bridge to destruction: Parker's wedding planners significantly modified the forest, even building a stone bridge . Destroyed: Some of the work even damaged the protected redwood trees - leading to millions in fines . The wedding featured a cottage, fake ruins, waterfalls, staircases and a huge dance floor near iconic redwoods and a stream with threatened steelhead trout. Environmental damage caused by the event cost Parker another $2.5million paid to the California Coastal Commission to settle fines related to building the movie set-like wedding without proper permits.","Sean Parker has denied to MailOnline a ValleyWag report claiming the billionaire pushed the snow into the street .

"Waitrose is to start selling a range of ‘blemished’ fruit in an attempt to curb the colossal levels of food dumped for being imperfect. The supermarket will introduce a range of apples that have been damaged by poor weather conditions alongside its normal selection of more attractive fruit. Britain’s top supermarkets have been criticised for wasting tonnes of misshapen fruit and vegetables that is considered too ugly to be sold. Waitrose has decided to tackle the obsession with perfect produce, stocking specifically labelled Cripps Pink, Braeburn, Royal Gala and Cox varieties of apples. Perfectly edible: Waitrose is to start selling a range of ¿blemished¿ fruit in an attempt to curb colossal levels of food waste . The supermarket also announced last week that it would sell packets of mixed tomatoes – one of the most wasted products – that are misshapen or have been bashed after falling from the vine. The apples in the ‘weather-blemished’ line originate from Waitrose-backed farms in Africa where unseasonal weather has left up to 70 per cent of crops damaged. Waitrose apple buyer Greg Sehringer said: ‘We are lucky that our customers are savvy enough who understand the unpredictability of farming and to trust that the fruit will be just as delicious, even if the apples don’t look as perfect as usual.’ An estimated  fifteen million tons of food valued at £19billion is thrown away across the UK in total every year . Strict EU rules on misshapen fruit and vegetables were relaxed in 2009 following years of criticism. Marketing standards detailing acceptable sizes and shapes were scrapped altogether for 26 types of produce, including carrots, cauliflowers, cucumbers, leeks, plums and onions. However they were kept in place for a number of popular items, including tomatoes, apples, grapes and pears - meaning that ‘substandard’ produce has to be specially labelled. But a report by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers last year found that up to three quarters of vegetables grown in Britain ends up never being eaten. It found that 30 per cent never make it to the supermarket shelf because they are considered too ugly to be sold. While there are no exact figures on the amount of food discarded by supermarkets, a House of Lords inquiry this year heard that fifteen million tons of food valued at £19billion is thrown away across the UK in total every year. Illustrating the amount of supermarket water, Tesco revealed that in the first six months of 2013 it generated 30,000 tonnes of food waste of which 21 per cent was fruit and vegetables. Speaking about Waitrose’s decision to introduce the range, the NFU’s Guy Poskitt said: ‘Of course I welcome this news, but as farmers we’re always keen to get as much value back to the farm and reduce waste, so none of us intend to grow inferior produce. ‘And if supermarkets market these so-called ugly vegetables as a cheaper alternative, what will happen in good years when we have bumper crops of attractive produce? ‘The last thing we want to end up doing is putting our best produce in value ranges.’","Retailer will stock 'blemished' fruit alongside regular range of produce .

"CBS show 48 Hours this weekend will air parts of a haunting voicemail recorded during the last minutes of a young woman's life as she was murdered - despite the victim's mother expressing her outrage. The Saturday-night crime series which airs at 10pm (EDT) focuses on the 2012 murder of Weight Watchers executive Danielle Thomas by her live-in boyfriend, lawyer Jason Bohn, in New York. During Bohn's trial, it was revealed that Thomas' phone recorded a four-minute message that includes her screams and pleas for her life. Danielle Thomas was murdered by her live-in boyfriend Jason Bohn (seen right, weeping at his murder trial) at their Queens apartment in 2012. Her mother is devastated that CBS plan to play her daughter's pleas for her life from a voicemail that recorded her last moments . At one point she says, 'Jason, I love you,' and there are seven seconds of silence - except for a barking dog - possibly the moment she was strangled. The recording was played during Bohn's trial earlier this year but because the court proceedings weren't televised, it hasn't been heard publicly outside the courtroom. CBS requested a copy through the Freedom of Information Act because its contents were crucial to the jury's deliberations and were used by both the defense and prosecution, said Susan Zirinsky, senior executive producer of 48 Hours. 'We do not use an enormous amount of it, less than some of the people who put the whole text out,' Ms Zirinsky said. 'Hearing it is pretty chilling.' Janie Thomas Bright, Miss Thomas' mother and a special education teacher in Danville, Kentucky, said she made it a point to leave the courtroom when the recording was being played during the trial. Ms Bright, who was interviewed for the 48 Hours story, doesn't want to hear it on television, either. Danielle Thomas pictured with her mother Jamie Thomas Bright, left, and her grandmother Juanita Hardgrove, right, during a family trip to Disney. The Florida business executive was murdered by her boyfriend in their Queens apartment in 2012 . 'My mother and I begged them not to use it,' Bright said. 'But once the trial was complete it was in the public record.' She said CBS has told them at about which points the recording will be used on Saturday's show, and she plans to mute her television when those moments come up. Bohn had been violent in the past and Miss Thomas had a protection order against him at the time of her death . 'I don't think I can bear to hear her voice,' she said. The recording isn't used extensively, but snippets are sprinkled throughout the story. Bright said she has already heard part of it on a promotion that CBS aired in advance of the show, with Bohn, an Ivy League-educated lawyer, saying: 'In five seconds I'm going to let you up, and you need to answer quickly, or else you die.' At another point, he tells his girlfriend: 'You're so stupid, you think I'm going to stop. I'm not going to stop.' Bohn's defense team argued that Bohn was mentally ill because he had been abandoned by his mother as a child. The prosecution says this doesn't excuse murder. The recording was used as evidence of Bohn's state of mind. 'If no one felt this wasn't the important element in the case, we would not have gone after it,' Ms Zirinsky said. She said CBS does not use the material randomly or gratuitously. The story itself raises many issues, including the role of mental illness and childhood trauma in criminal actions and the need for people not to follow their instincts. Thomas had reported Bohn to authorities for abusive behavior before the night of the murder but stayed with him, even telling her mother she'd say yes if he asked her to marry him.","The Saturday-night crime series focuses on the 2012 murder of Danielle Thomas by her boyfriend, Ivy League lawyer Jason Bohn, .

"The Astor family name conjures up images of the Gilded Age and one of American’s richest families at a time of great prosperity and optimism for the country, but as these pictures of the family’s 420-acre estate show they and their iconic home have fallen on hard times. Rokeby in Hudson Valley, New York has been owned by the Astors for nearly 180 years. The 43-room main house was built in 1815 and then added to by every new owner so that it came to represent the classic 'American Gothic style.' Today it remains home to a slew of less-than-wealthy heirs to the Astor and Livingston fortunes, but looks more like a rundown museum than the home of what was once one of America's richest families.

She . says the lonely squalor of the third floor was startlingly contrasted . to the grandeur of the rest of the property and she felt ashamed when she climbed the stairs. She recalls how the roof leaked, the windows were splintered and there wasn’t much heat to speak of. Often they didn't have the cash to buy food and bartered with neighbors to survive, she revealed. After boarding school, she moved to Poland then returned to Brooklyn in 1998 where she converted to Orthodox Judaism and she and her husband had a son, Shlomo. But in 2005, she and her son returned to her ancestral home and lived there for six years. She says it remains 'dirty and rundown' to outsiders but has drastically improved since she was a young girl. Her father, now in his 70s, has been the chief caretaker of the property for almost 40 years. He still lives in an 18-by-11-foot room that hasn't changed a bit, according to The Post.

"Giants, devils and incredible human towers are the calling cards of the Barcelona's Festes de la Merce, or Festival of the Virgin of Mercy, the colourful annual event taking place now in the Catalan capital. Held in the name of the city's patron saint, who apparently conquered a plague of locusts in 1637, La Merce is a combination of some 600 events throughout the city. Adults and children in Dancing Devil costumes (Correfocs) are ever-present, armed with fireworks and crackers, while 'fire beasts' - more elaborately costumed participants or creations - shoot pyrotechnics at the gathered throng. The daredevil art of the Castellers is world renowned as they build remarkable human towers possible in the Placa de Jaume. Thousands pack into the square as the groups, distinguished by colour, skillfully rise into the air before a child climbs to the top at the end. The Giants of Santa Maria del Mar, massive papier-mache effigies of kings, queens and nobles, can also be seen dancing on the stage in front of the Town Hall or in the streets as part of their own parade. The festival has run in some form since 1871, becoming more of a general Catalan celebration from 1902 onwards one local government official recognised its potential. Catalan dances, music from the region and around the world, and a range of other activities take place  to bring their huge community together and make this one of the world's great festivals.

Julie, who is brain dead, is unable to walk or speak. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Julie Henson (above with father), who is brain dead, was sexually assaulted multiple times by one of her nurses . Convicted: Paul Bugarcic (above), 34, a certified nursing assistant at Cherry Hills Health Care Center, was caught assaulting Julie by a camera her parents set up to monitor her progress . One in a million: Julie (above, before her accident) went brain dead as a result of a simple prank, when a girl pulled a chair out from under her at work and her brain started to swell as a result of the injury . She was also helpless to Bugarcic's repeated sexual assaults. 'She couldn’t even fight back, she couldn’t say (anything),' Julie’s father told CBS 4 Denver. 'And if we didn't have that camera in there to catch it, he would've kept on doing it.' Making things even worse was the fact that the family knew, and trusted, Bugarcic. Julie's mother, Debbie Henson, says when she watched the video, she could not believe what she was seeing. 'I watched it and I went, ""No,""' she said. Julie began suffering severe headaches back in 2011 after a coworker pulled a chair out from underneath her and she hit her head. She soon had brain swelling and then a cyst. The doctors who preformed surgery on her said that there was a 'one in a million chance something might go wrong,' and it did, leaving Julie severely brain injured.

"Jasmine Tridevil's 'three breasts' have gotten their 15 minutes of fame, but they've finally been exposed as a sham after all. Florida station 10 News has now outed Tridevil third breast as fake after obtaining a luggage theft report filed earlier this month by the 21-year-old at Tampa International Airport. In the report, Tridevil (going by her real name Alisha Hessler) lists the contents of a bag which was stolen off the American Airlines conveyor belt, including a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' inside. Cops eventually tracked down the thieves using surveillance footage, and returned Hessler's black nylon bag - but not before taking an official inventory. Scroll down for video . Con artist: The 'three-breasted' woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' has been exposed as a phony, after a lost luggage report was released. The report, filed earlier this month at Tampa International Airport, lists a $5,000 '3 breast prosthesis' as one of the contents of Tridevil's lost bag. It was eventually tracked down and returned . Contents: The above property receipt shows that Hessler's suitcase was stolen at Tampa International Aiport and returned earlier this month with a '3 breast prosthesis' inside . Earlier Tuesday, Tridevil's story began to fall apart when internet-rumor site Snopes connected the young woman to a Tampa, Florida massage therapist named Alisha Hessler. Snopes discovered that the website JasmineTridevil.com is registered to a person named Alisha Hessler, and that Tridevil bares striking resemblance to a Tampa masseuse named Alisha Jasmine Hessler . A website for Hessler's business - Alisha's Golden Touch - lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoaxes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted women'. If Alisha Hessler is the woman behind Jasmine Tridevil, it may not be the fist time she has made national news. In December 2013, a Tampa woman named Alisha Hessler made headlines when she had a alleged attacker stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding up a sign that reads 'I beat women'. Debunked? Yesterday, a woman calling herself 'Jasmine Tridevil' (left) announced that she had undergone plastic surgery to add a third breast. That woman has now been connected to Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler (right) who owns the domain name JasmineTridevil.com. The two women bear a striking likeness . Damning evidence: A website for Hessler's business 'Alisha's Golden Touch' lists that she is a 'provider of internet hoazes since 2014' and a 'specialist in massage for three breasted woman [sic]' Likeness: YouTube videos of Hessler showing off her massage skills also bare a similarity to Tridevil, who says she underwent the procedure to become unattractive to men . A view of the home where Alisha Jasmine Hessler, aka Jasmine Tridevilm lives in Tampa Florida on Tuesday, September 23 . Police tried to contact Hessler about the alleged attack outside a night club but she 'stopped returning [their] calls' and never filed formal charges. In March 2013, she was taken into custody in Hillsborough County, Florida and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information'. News of Tridevil's third breast emerged Monday, when she announced that she paid $20,000 for the addition in order to become a reality star. She says she has hired a camera crew to follow her around Tampa, documenting the 'struggles' she faces as a three-breasted woman. Hessler has gone into hiding since news of Tridevil grabbed national attention. She was nowhere to be seen at her run down home in one of Tampa's poorer neighborhoods. And if Hessler really is Tridevil, her 80-year-old grandfather Kenneth appeared not to have any idea about the radical transformation. Attention grabber? In December 2013, a woman also named Alisha Hessler made national headlines when she alleged that she was attacked outside a nightclub by a man . News maker: Hessler subsequently made the man stand on a street corner wearing a dunce cap and holding a sign reading 'I beat women. Honk if I'm a scumbag'. The story made national news . Speaking to MailOnline from his home in North Barrington, Illinois he said: 'We don't know what to believe. We did not know a thing about this'. While Tridevil claims to have paid $20,000 for the operation, Hessler's rundown home in Tampa suggests someone who has struggled to make ends meet. A decaying leather sofa had been dumped outside the tile and brick single story home which has rusting iron bars covering the downstairs windows. Liar: Hessler was also arrested in March 2013 and charged with 'fraudulent use of personal information' Broken plastic blinds have been drawn and the front garden is overgrown with weeds. Neighbors said they hardly saw Hessler. 'She keeps very odd hours,' said one neighbor. 'You'd see her coming in at 6am when I'd be leaving to drive to work. She seemed nice enough but I don't believe her getting another breast. I just saw it on the news and it's fake. She just wants to make a name for herself.' Other facts of Tridevil's story also don't line up, like fact that she shied away from showing her breast when interview by a WTSP reporter this week. 'I don't feel comfortable doing that just yet,' Jasmine said. '[Because] that's also going to be on my show where I'm actually walking out on the beach with this top on and I want to save that.' The only other pictures of her third-breast are self-produced, and no other third-party pictures have emerged...other than the WTSP footage. In one YouTube clip, Tridevil's third breast appears to be a different skin color than her other limbs. Surgeons are also barred from performing procedures on patients with mental health issues, and Tridevil made it known that she 'added the third breast in order to become unattractive to men. While the procedure is possible, surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity'. The ethical code outlined by the American Board of Plastic Surgeons dictates that 'the principal objective of the medical profession is to render services to humanity with full respect for human dignity.' Cosmetic surgeons are under strict guidelines to solely 'enhance the norm' of a patient's body. Selfies: The only pictures to emerge of Tridevil's third breast are self made. Tridevil did show her breast, but only very briefly to a WTSP reporter this week. She said she wasn't comfortable showing the breast too long because she wants to save it for her self-produced reality show . Scam? Tampa masseuse Alisha Hessler is pictured above in the social media photos. She owns the domain name to JasmineTridevil.com . However, Tridevil claims a surgeon agreed to carry out the operation on the grounds she kept their name a secret. She says the medic took tissue from her abdomen and used it to fashion the third breast - a procedure commonly used for normal breast enhancements. The massage therapist, who recently celebrated her 21st birthday, has shared dozens of pictures of her new look in custom made bikinis on her Facebook fan page in a bid to convince followers the surgery was legitimate. Despite scheduling interviews, creating a fan page, and hiring a film crew, Tridevil insists her apparent surgery was not an attempt become famous. 'I got it because I wanted to make myself unattractive to men,' she claims. 'Because I don't want to date anymore.' MailOnline's calls to Hessler were not answered Tuesday morning. Unethical: While the operation to add a third-breast is physical feasible, experts say that no surgeon would agree to carry out such a procedure on someone who may not be mentally well .","The woman calling herself Jasmine Tridevil lost a bag at Tampa International Airport earlier this month .

"Whether it’s plain vanilla or something more exotic, when ice cream is frozen solid it’s almost impossible to scoop from the tub. Now an inventor says he’s created a device to solve the problem, and it’s all to do with the angle at which you approach the task. Rather than scooping with your wrist in a sideways motion, Michael Chou suggests pushing the scoop away from you, bringing the power of your arm and chest muscles into play. Michael Chou, 35, invented the new scoop design after becoming frustrated at not being able get ice cream out the tub when the dessert was frozen solid . The 'Midnight Scoop' design changes the way people scoop ice cream when it is frozen solid . His Midnight Scoop – said to be the first change in design since the ice cream scoop was invented by Alfred L Cralle in 1897 – has a curved handle which allows you to channel those forces. Aerospace engineer Mr Chou, a 35-year-old father of two from Michigan in the US, said: ‘Every time I scooped ice cream I couldn’t help but feel there was a better way. I like my ice cream frozen and hard – melting it with a hot spoon or letting it sit out for half an hour ruins it.’ It has taken nearly two years for the scoop to come to fruition. Made from a coated and forged aluminium alloy, it will cost £30. Mr Chou said: ‘It’s called the Midnight Scoop because I spent so many late nights drafting and designing on the drawing board. ‘I designed the scoop to rely on something that never runs out – mechanical force supplied by the arm and chest. My background in aerospace engineering has made me familiar with mechanical forces. But more importantly I am a father, and that has made me familiar with ice cream!’ 'I decided I needed to come up with a simple way to scoop hard ice cream without melting it, and without creating some overly-complex product that would break eventually.' Made from a coated and forged 6061 aluminum alloy, they will be sold for a little over £30  once the Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign ends in October. Rather than spooning ice cream with your wrist in a side-on motion, Michael suggests pushing it chest-on so you can use their arm and chest muscles . The scoop has a curved handle which gives extra force and means there is no need to use your wrist . Mr Chou, an aerospace and mechanical engineer from South Lyon, Michigan, said: 'The most common ice cream scoopers today are ones that someone designed decades ago and went 'good enough'. 'Since then, they haven't changed and that's not good enough for me. 'I used some innovation to fundamentally change the way ice cream is scooped. 'The idea went through 38 official redesigns. I just wanted to make sure I had the design right, that it worked the way it was supposed to, and that it would last as long as possible. 'I designed the Midnight Scoop to rely on something that never runs out - mechanical force supplied by the arm and chest. 'The curved handle - as it is symmetrical - also allows for complete ambidextrous use. 'It's actually called the Midnight Scoop because I spent so many late nights drafting and designing on the drawing board - usually after midnight. Mr Chou said that he needed a fast and efficient way to get ice cream out of the tub for his son and daughter . 'All in all, it's been roughly two to three years since the original idea came to me. 'Everyone that has tried it - from family to ice cream parlours - has wanted to keep our scoop. 'My background in aerospace engineering has made me familiar with mechanical forces and the materials the Midnight Scoop is made from. 'But more importantly - I am a father, and that has made me familiar with ice cream. 'That was part of what drove me to create the Midnight Scoop - I needed a fast and efficient way to get ice cream to my son and daughter. 'Also, the scoop allows them to scoop ice cream a lot easier. It's a win win!' Thje new design has taken two years and 38 redesigns to come to fruition, 117 years after the first ice cream scoop was first invented by Alfred L. Calle  in 1897 .","Michael Chou's 'Midnight Scoop' changes the way people serve ice cream .

Now guitarist and physicist Dr David Robert Grimes has described the physics underlying these techniques in the journal Plos One. And, he says, using his methods guitar players can improve their technique and become better musicians. Scroll down for video . An Oxford University researcher has revealed equations for playing guitar. Dr Grimes (shown) studied the physics underlying certain guitar techniques. He wanted to understand how guitarists could manipulate pitch. This included the use of string bending, vibrato and whammy bars . There have been plenty of songs written about spiders and their webs, and now scientists have found the creatures are musical in their own right. Using lasers, researchers found spiders pluck their complex constructions like guitar strings to gather information about their surroundings. Spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies so that when a thread is plucked, the sound created carries information about prey, mates, and even the structural integrity of a web. The discovery was made by researchers from the universities of Oxford, Strathclyde, and Sheffield who fired bullets and lasers at spider silk to study how it vibrates. They found that spider silk can be tuned to a wide range of harmonics. 'Very good guitarists will manipulate . the strings to make the instrument sing,' explains Dr Grimes. 'On a . piano, you've got the 12 chromatic notes in a scale. On a guitar, you . can bend the strings to get the notes in between. 'I wanted to understand . what it was about these guitar techniques that allows you to manipulate . pitch.' Dr Grimes is a postdoctoral researcher in Oxford University's Department of Oncology, and normally spends his time working on mathematical models of oxygen distribution in order to improve radiotherapy in the treatment of cancer. But he is also a keen guitarist, and has been a session musician and member of a band in Dublin in the past. In spare time at his previous position at Dublin City University and now at Oxford University, he worked out the physics behind the instinctive playing of the best guitarists. Dr Grimes derived equations describing how string bending, vibrato and whammy bars change the pitch of a note. He found that the properties of the strings had a big effect on the change in pitch - in particular the Young's modulus (a measure of how much the string stretches under force) and how thick the strings are. He found that the properties of the strings had a big effect on the change in pitch - in particular the Young's modulus (a measure of how much the string stretches under force) and how thick the strings are. He says his research could be useful to string manufacturers and digital instrument modellers (stock image shown) This is one of the equations derived by Dr Grimes. He tells MailOnline it explains the bending of a note: 'It says that the pitch is related to the length of the vibrating string length, the angle you bend it through, the tension of the string T, the area of the string A and finally the Young's modulus of the string E' He also worked out how easy hammer-ons and pull-offs are, depending on the height of the guitar strings above the finger board. Finally, he confirmed the equation for string bends experimentally, measuring the frequency of the sound produced for strings bent through different angles on a guitar. 'I took one of my oldest guitars down to the engineering lab at Dublin City University to one of the people I knew there and explained that I wanted to strip it down to do this experiment,' explains Dr Grimes. 'We had to accurately bend the strings to different extents and measure the frequency produced. 'He was a musician too and looked at me with abject horror. But we both knew it needed to be done - we put some nails into my guitar for science.' The physics of vibrating strings and string instruments has been long understood, but no one has previously worked out how effects like bending the string change the pitch of the sound. Another unknown was pitch depends on the tension of the string, the force applied, and the angle through which it is bent. 'It turns out it's actually reasonably straightforward,' says Dr Grimes. 'It's an experiment a decent physics undergraduate could do, and a cool way of studying some basic physics principles. 'It's also potentially useful to string manufacturers and digital instrument modellers.'","An Oxford University researcher has revealed equations for playing guitar .

"There's no denying the HTC One was among the leading handsets of 2013 sweeping the board of awards - so there was always going to be a lot of pressure on its successor. The Taiwanese firm has now officially unveiled this follow-up device - called the HTC One (M8) - but does it live it up to its predecessor? The screen on the flagship handset has been made slightly larger at 5-inches, up from 4.7-inches, and HTC has added an extra camera sensor to the rear of the device to capture more depth information. Scroll Down for Video . HTC's One (M8) handset, pictured, was officially unveiled at an event in London. It has a 5-inch, full HD screen, duo camera with 4.1 Ultrapixel on the rear, and a 5MP camera on the front . The handset has a 5-inch, full 1080p HD screen, a . quad-core 2.3Ghz Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor and up to 32GB of built-in storage. It additionally has a MicroSD slot meaning the phone's storage can be increased up to 128GB. The handset has a duo-camera on the rear of the device with a depth sensor, as well as a 4.1 Ultrapixel sensor. While the camera on the front of the handset is 5MP. The HTC One (M8) runs on HTC Sense 6.0, on top of Android 4.4 KitKat. HTC has also added amplifiers to the dual frontal stereo speakers that automatically pick out specific . sections of music - such as the vocals, or the bass - and adjusts them . individually to improve the playback and prevent distortion. To turn the screen on, users can now tap the screen, as well as press the power button on the top of the device. Elsewhere, its Li-Po 2600mAh battery is said to have a 20-hour battery life. This duo-camera set up has been designed to help people not only take better, clearer photos, it means these photos can be refocused using the device's new advanced photo tools. Elsewhere, the unique dual frontal stereo speakers now feature built-in amplifiers that  automatically pick out specific sections of music - such as the vocals, or the bass - and adjusts them individually to improve the playback and prevent distortion. The phone is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 2.3GHz quad-core processor, has 2GB of RAM and a Li-Po 2600mAh battery which HTC claims will last for 20 hours. Prices for SIM-free versions of the handset haven't officially been announced by HTC, but Carphone Warehouse in the UK is offering it for £42 per month SIM-free for £549.95. The HTC One (M8) is being rolled out globally, staring in the UK and online in the U.S. today. It will then be available in U.S. stores from 10 April. The exact release schedule for other countries has not been announced yet. The phone comes in three colours - Gunmetal Grey, Glacial Silver and Rose Gold. In the UK, the phone is available on Three for an upfront cost of £49 and a choice of four 24-month price plans. These start at £38 a month for 600 minutes and 2GB of data, up to £44 a month. Google is said to have approached HTC when it originally began building its Nexus range back in 2012, but the Taiwanese firm was too busy with its smartphones, such as the HTC One (M8) pictured, so Google is believed to have teamed up with Asus instead . HTC is also launching a range of cases for the One (M8) that react to touch gestures. These cases, pictured, will be available in seven colours including blue, left, black, right, and green. They have a dotted appearance on the front that shows basic details, including the time and weather, without the case being opened . The handset will also be available . from EE in Gunmetal Gray and Glacial Silver online on the 26 March, and . through EE stores on the 27 March. Customers . who buy the HTC One (M8) on a £37.99 per month EE Extra plan, with an . upfront cost of £29.99 - before 10 April will get twice the amount of . data of EE’s standard 4G plans - taking their monthly limit up to 4GB - . for the duration of their contract. This also includes unlimited minutes and texts to use in the UK and Europe. 'The HTC One was a standout device, in terms of both hardware and software, and deserved many of the accolades it was awarded from customers and critics. 'As much as this was a boost for HTC, it meant that any successors would have to live up to the hype and be significantly better. 'HTC is selling the HTC One (M8) as the 'best just got better', and while that's true for some of its features, other improvements feel marginal. 'The duo camera is a nice feature, but didn't wow us. It was difficult to test the new sound options in the speakers during our brief hands-on, and we couldn't test battery life. 'The screen has been made larger, and this makes it slightly more difficult to use than its predecessor, but this is a minor flaw. 'HTC has moved the touch buttons from the front of the handset and they are now software-based, again a minor flaw but will slow existing HTC One users down. 'The Taiwanese firm has also removed the plastic strip seen in the casing of the One, and the One (M8) is now made entirely of lightweight metal, This makes it feel more expensive than its predecessor, and noticeably so next to the likes of Samsung's plastic Galaxy S5. 'The most impressive improvements are software-based. The advanced photo editing tools, including the new refocus options made possible with the addition of the rear-facing depth sensor, are great. They certainly give Nokia's 1020 a run for its money. 'The new touch gestures are a simple addition, but make a huge difference to how we used and interacted with the device. And the fact these gestures work with the new cases is even more impressive. 'However, there isn't anything in this handset that makes it leap out as a must-have device. It may be that we've been spoilt by the fingerprint scanners and tracking features of Apple and Samsung devices, or it may be that HTC just wants to keep things simple - either way, the device feels too similar to the current HTC One to justify paying an extra £549 for.'

"The parents of a popular track star at the University of Pennsylvania who committed suicide on Friday, begged her not to go back to school when she revealed she was unhappy over Christmas. The death of 19-year-old freshman Madison Holleran has rocked UPenn community and sent shockwaves through her hometown of Allendale, New Jersey. And the tragedy has come even more into focus as her devastated family and friends have revealed her sadness stemmed from the strains the student found herself under since going to college. Her father James Holleran told the New York Post the student was struggling with her school workload while a family friend revealed her supportive parents told her she could stay home or transfer at Christmas. But sadly the determined teen insisted on going back. Holleran posted an image of a sunset over Rittenhouse Square to her Instagram account around 6pm on Friday night - just an hour before police say she jumped to her death from a city center building. She was pronounced dead at the scene at 7.17pm, the New Jersey Record reported. No one else was injured. Loss: Madison Holleran, a track and field star at UPenn, has jumped to her death. Her father James, right, said she had taken her life because she was overwhelmed by the workload at her new school . Final moments: She posted this image of Rittenhouse Square to Instagram an hour before her death . Her . father told the New York Post that she killed herself because she was . overwhelmed with schoolwork at UPenn - changing her from the happy . student she had been throughout high school. 'There . was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn,' James Holleran tearfully told . the Post. 'She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and . stress.' Mr Holleran said that she had told her parents in December that she was feeling suicidal and was seeing a therapist. 'We . knew she needed help,' he said. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost . confidence in academics and she also lost confidence in her track . abilities.' On the day that . she jumped to her death, her father texted her that morning encouraging . her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she . would. But just hours later, . she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family . on top of the parking garage before she jumped. Her family would not . detail the contents of the note. Distraught: Madison, who was one of five children, poses at a Penn meet with her mother Stacy . Beautiful: Hundreds of friends have shared their condolences on Madison's social networking pages . Popular: Madison, pictured left with a friend just months ago at Halloween, was remembered as 'bright and well-liked' by university staff . Mr Holleran said that he did not blame the school for his daughter's suicide but that he wanted to warn other parents. Family friend Bob Weckworth said the high-achiever ultimately couldn't cope with the expectations she'd set herself. 'People talked to her within hours of her act of suicide and there were no red flags, warning signs, nothing,' he told the Daily News. “This kid didn’t have a boyfriend. There were no drug issues. There were no mental health issues in her background. It was just the last two, three weeks where they saw a change in her,' said Weckworth. 'Something snapped.' 'She got a 3.5 her first semester, and I think just the high expectations that she put on herself was that that’s just not acceptable. 'She was not happy at Penn, but the parents had told her then, ‘Don’t go back. We’ll transfer. We’ll look at other schools. There’s no reason to go back, it’s OK,’' he said. Madison's funeral will be held today and her family have asked well-wishers to donate to . the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in lieu of flowers. Holleran . was a member of the university's varsity track and field team at UPenn. Her teammates were given the option of whether or not they wished to . compete in Saturday's meet. The school also canceled formal recruitment for sororities, in which Holleran was set to take part. 'The . entire Penn community is deeply saddened by the death of Madison . Holleran,' Penn president Amy Gutmann said in the statement. 'She . was bright and well-liked with an incredible future ahead of her. There . are simply no words that can properly convey the sense of heartache . that we all feel at such a tragic loss.' 'Our thoughts and prayers are with . [Holleran's] family and friends,' said Steve Dolan, Penn's director of . track and field, in a statement to the Daily Pennsylvanian. Promising: The athlete had been one of the most promising track stars to come out of her New Jersey county . Missed: The UPenn community was shaken by the death of Holleran, right, on Friday evening . 'This is a challenging time . for everyone involved with the program, but we will support each other . in the weeks to come and help her teammates and friends find their own . ways to honor her memory.' Holleran, . who was majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, had been a . standout track and soccer athlete in her high school. She originally planned to play soccer at Lehigh University before switching her mind, and choosing to run at Penn. She had been named to the . New Jersey Star-Ledger's all-state girls track team last year, while the Record . named her its Spring Athlete of the Season and Girls Indoor Track Athlete of the Year in 2013, the Star Ledger reported. Northern Highlands Girls Varsity Soccer, for which Holleran had played, tweeted: 'RIP . Madison. You are our beloved NHGS sister forever and always. You have . and always will be such a special person. We love you.' A funeral for Holleran, who is one of five children, is expected to be held on Tuesday. Tragic: She fell to her death on this Philadelphia city center street, but there has been no indication why . The tragedy is the third undergraduate death at UPenn since the start of winter break, the Daily Pennsylvanian reported.

"SpaceX is set to build the world's first commercial site for orbital rocket launches in the southernmost tip of Texas. The move was helped by $15.3 million (£9 million) in incentives from Texas that will allow SpaceX to have greater control over the timing of its launches. The company has said it plans to launch 12 rockets a year from the Boca Chica Beach in Brownsville, a short walk from the Gulf of Mexico and a couple miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border. Scroll down for video . SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he plans to build the world's first commercial site for orbital rocket launches in the southernmost tip of Texas. The move was helped by $15.3 million (£9 million) in incentives from Texas . Governor Rick Perry's office said Monday it will provide $2.3 million (£1.36 million) from the Texas Enterprise Fund. The state will offer an additional $13 million (£7.7 million) from the Spaceport Trust Fund to the Cameron County Spaceport Development Corporation to pay for infrastructure development. 'Texas has been on the forefront of our nation's space exploration efforts for decades, so it is fitting that SpaceX has chosen our state as they expand the frontiers of commercial space flight,' Governor Perry said in a prepared statement. SpaceX plans to make an $85 million investment and create 300 jobs. The company already has a rocket testing facility in McGregor that employs 250 people. In April, Nasa agreed to lease launch pad 39A at Cape Canaveral to SpaceX. The company also launches from California. Pictured is today's launch of the AsiaSat 8 satellite on a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral . Its chief executive Elon Musk, said, 'In addition to creating hundreds of high-tech jobs for the Texas workforce, this site will inspire students, expand the supplier base and attract tourists to the South Texas area.' A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket thundered off its coastal launch pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida today to put a commercial communications satellite into orbit. On its second launch attempt of the day, the 224-foot (68-meter) rocket lifted off at 4 a.m. EDT/9am GMT, blazing through partly cloudy, pre-dawn skies as it headed into space. The first try, 2-1/2 hours earlier, ended less than a minute before liftoff when a computer found a potential problem with the rocket's first-stage engine, SpaceX officials said in a live webcast. The issue was resolved, clearing the rocket for flight. Perched on top of the Falcon 9 was a communications satellite owned by Hong Kong-based Asia Satellite Telecommunications Holdings, or AsiaSat. The spacecraft, known as AsiaSat 8, will become the fifth member of an orbital network that provides telecommunication services to the Asia-Pacific region. AsiaSat hired privately owned SpaceX for two satellite launches, the second of which is due to launch later this month . Brownsville Mayor Tony Martinez said he always knew Brownsville had a good shot at landing the facility. Locations in Florida, Puerto Rico and Georgia had apparently been considered as well. 'It's a barrier breaker,' Mayor Martinez said. 'It opens up a lot of doors for a lot of things.' He said SpaceX hopes to have the first launch in 2016. Gilberto Salinas, executive vice president of the Brownsville Economic Development Council, which also contributed funds, said the region's work is just beginning. One of the site's biggest hurdles seemed to be its environmental impact. The site is bordered on three sides by state park land that's managed by the federal government as part of the Lower Rio Grande Valley National Wildlife Refuge. But in late May, the Federal Aviation Administration released a final environmental review that found the project was unlikely to jeopardise the existence of protected animal species and would create few unavoidable impacts. Rick Tumlinson, co-founder of Space Frontier Foundation and Texas Space Alliance, said in May that SpaceX's establishment of its launch site in Texas would be significant. 'What that means is we could at some point see flights originating in Texas that are carrying astronauts or passengers to the space station, orbital space hotels, to the moon and eventually even we might see human beings boarding spacecraft in Texas and flying to Mars,' Mr Tumlinson said. 'That's huge.' The company has said it plans to launch 12 rockets a year from the Boca Chica Beach, a short walk from the Gulf of Mexico and just a couple miles north of the US-Mexico border . Carissa Bryce Christensen, managing partner at The Tauri Group, a Virginia-based space and technology consulting firm, said in an interview in April that having its own launch site would give SpaceX predictability. 'SpaceX has made an absolute winning career of controlling its own destiny,' Bryce Christensen said. 'SpaceX is arguably the most integrated launch company there is. They do it all themselves.' SpaceX's Dragon cargo ship already ferries supplies and experiments to and from the International Space Station for Nasa. In April, Nasa agreed to lease launch pad 39A at Cape Canaveral to SpaceX. The company also launches from Vandenberg Air Force base in California. SpaceX has proposed launching its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy - under development - rockets from Boca Chica. There has been no indication that SpaceX will do space tourism at the Texas site.","SpaceX said it plans to launch 12 rockets a year from Boca Chica Beach .

"There is no such thing as being fat and healthy, scientists warn. They have strongly refuted suggestions that a person’s physical fitness is more important than their  weight. The ‘fat and fit’ myth has been punctured by research involving 61,000 people and covering a period from the 1950s to the present day. The theory was that good metabolic fitness, that is, having normal blood pressure and being able to process sugar easily, would protect people from the consequences of obesity, such as heart disease and diabetes. A new study by Canadian scientists has strongly refuted suggestions that a person's physical fitness is more important than their weight . However, the new research, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that even though high blood pressure, poor blood sugar control and high blood fats are important indicators of disease, the excess weight itself remains critical. Seriously overweight people who displayed none of these warning signs were nonetheless found to die younger than people at a normal weight. Canadian scientists, from  the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, conducted a review of eight studies published from 1950 onwards to find out whether these metabolic indicators were linked to premature death and heart disease in normal-weight, overweight and obese people. The 'fat and fit' myth has been punctured by research involving 61,000 people from the 1950s to the present day . They classified the participants by Body Mass Index (BMI), which gives weight guidelines based on height, and measured lipid profile (blood fats), glucose tolerance (sugar), blood pressure and waist circumference, as well as other metabolic features. Bad results in these tests have been dubbed ‘the metabolic syndrome’ and increase the risk of a range of diseases. Those supposedly ‘fat and fit’ have been described as having ‘metabolically healthy obesity’ because they do not have the metabolic syndrome. Normal-weight individuals can also have a poor metabolic profile, such as high blood pressure or poor sugar control, despite having a healthy BMI. But the study showed that obese people with a good metabolic profile were still more likely to die young or have heart problems in the long term than those of normal weight. The scientists also found those with metabolic syndrome were at greater risk of disease regardless of whether they were fat or not. Dr Ian Campbell, a GP and medical director of the charity Weight Concern, said the issue was not well understood. He said: ‘I’ve read studies that suggest obesity doesn’t make you die any earlier at all, and it’s likely that genetic predisposition will play a large part in whether being overweight results in a range of diseases that may shorten your life. ‘Many other studies conclude that overweight and obesity make you more prone to disease and premature death.’ He added: ‘It’s clearly a good idea for anyone who is overweight to get as fit as possible because being more active helps in weight loss, and it mitigates the metabolic effects of being fat. ‘In my experience, getting exercise is the quickest way to lose weight.’","Canadian scientists carried out research examining 61,000 people from the 1950s to the present day .

Along with a million-dollar yacht called the Andrea Aras, the couple have a grand, six-bedroom lakeside home, a beach property in Florida and a $30,000 Lexus, investigators found. Colin Chisholm III, claims he is from a long line of Scottish aristocracy and is a wealthy broadcasting executive, according to court filings today. 'Scottish aristocrats' Colin Chisholm the Third, 62, and his wife Lady Andrea, 54, have been charged with $165,000 in welfare fraud while it is alleged they were living on a $1.2million yacht in Florida . The couple not only owned a $1.2million yacht but also a $30,000 Lexus and beach property in Florida . The couple are still at large after a search was launched by law enforcement last month. Calls to the family home by MailOnline went unanswered today. The Chisholms also had $3 million in bank accounts which they failed to declare, according to Hennepin County Attorney's office. The couple were receiving public assistance for their medical care and food stamps in Minnesota for years while also allegedly collecting welfare in Florida. According to the criminal complaint filed in February, the Chisholms applied for more than a dozen forms of medical assistance, welfare payments and food stamps. Lady Chisholm had her prenatal care for the couple's son in 2006 paid for by the state while claiming to be desitute. In the welfare applications, the couple allegedly lied about where they were living and who they were living with. Noble roots: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy . Colin Chisholm did not declare that he ran a business nor Lady Chisholm that she had a dog kennel which breeds championship-worthy Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. Lady Chisholm is alleged to have claimed for state prenatal care despite having millions of dollars in the bank . According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the couple trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands. Chisholm is listed as the president and CEO of TCN Network, a satellite TV company serving the Carribbean. More than $1 million dollars flowed through accounts he controlled as part of that company, the complaint states. The couple were living with Lady Chisholm's mother in Minneapolis when they first applied for welfare in 2005. However for the next two years, they resided on their Florida yacht, and later at a beach property in the state, none of which was ever declared, investigators claim. In April 2007, the Chisholms came back to Minnesota and filled out forms for more benefits. In March 2008, they moved into a luxury home in Deephaven with Andrea’s grandparents Eloise and Francis Heidecker. Francis died in February 2009 at age 94 and by September of that year, Eloise Heidecker and the Chisholms were evicted from the home. They immediately moved to another Deephaven home on Lake Minnetonka with stunning waterfront views. The home, built in 1909, is believed to have six bedrooms, five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres. None of these details were declaired on welfare forms - nor the fact Andrea Chisholm had power of attorney and controlled the finances of her elderly grandmother. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said on Friday: 'It is truly outrageous when persons of considerable means steal from the government and all of us taxpayers through abusing the social welfare system. 'We will prosecute this case with all the capacity we have.' Hennepin County’s Human Services and Public Health Department terminated all welfare benefits to the Chisholms at the end of March 2012. Prosecutors will ask that the judge be allowed to impose a longer sentence than the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines call for because the Chisholms committed a major economic offense.

"More than 20 UK music festivals have banned the sale of 'legal highs' at their events this summer after a spike in the number of people dying from the drugs. The festivals, which include T in the Park, Bestival, Lovebox, Global Gathering and Sonisphere, will also take part in a 'digital blackout' on Monday to highlight the danger of taking the drugs. The websites and social media accounts of the 24 festivals involved will go dark for a day from 9am, and music fans will be met with a black window, a grey light bulb and the message 'Don't be in the Dark about Legal Highs'. Scroll down for video . Twenty four UK festivals, including T in the Park, will ban the sale of legal highs on their grounds this summer . The festivals backing the ban have a combined audience of half a million and online audience in the millions . Blackout organiser the Association of Independent Festivals said its members had banned legal highs after minister Norman Baker warned authorities are involved in a 'race with chemists' in India and China who are producing potentially dangerous new drugs on a weekly basis. Deaths from legal highs increased almost seven times in just three years, up from 10 in 2009 to to 68 in 2012 according to data St George's, University of London. AIF's co-founder and vice-chairman, Ben Turner, said: 'Legal highs are a serious concern for any festival organiser and the issue is only going to get bigger. 'The substances have managed to fly under the radar purely by evolving faster than the monitoring bodies can regulate. On Monday the festival websites will also feature a 'blackout' where users will be greeted with this screen . The users can follow a link to information about the risks of taking legal highs and other information . 'Banning it at our festivals is only part of the battle however, we need to make fans aware of the dangers of legal highs and help them make safer choices when having fun on-site.' AIF said festivals backing the blackout . have a combined capacity of more than half a million people and an . online followers well into the millions. It added that it hopes to make . the blackout an annual event. It is working with Angelus Foundation, a charity set up to educate people about the risks of legal highs. Angelus founder Maryon Stewart added: 'Legal highs are a huge but hidden problem because young people are acting in ignorance and no-one is measuring the harms. 'As the lead organisation raising awareness of these substances, Angelus is delighted the festivals are taking the issue seriously and helping to keep their audiences safe. Ministers warn about the risk from drugs being created in China and India faster than they can be regulated . Deaths from legal highs has spiked sharply in the last three years, up from 10 in 2009 to 68 in 2012 . 'We are determined to keep expanding our prevention programme into new areas and bigger events until everyone gets the message that the effects of these substances are unpredictable and high risk.' Norman Baker said this week that the Government was examining the way the problem of legal highs was dealt with in other countries, including New Zealand where substances are set to be banned unless trials prove they are safe. The Liberal Democrat minister said the Government was 'open-minded' about how to tackle the problem and an expert panel was reviewing the situation.

"Nearly two thirds of Germans think they would be better off if they had not swapped the Deutschmark for the euro. This is the largest number ever to voice doubts on the single currency since it replaced the building bloc of the postwar 'economic miracle' a decade ago. Some 65 per cent of Germans thought their personal situation would be better if they still had the D-mark, compared to 36 per cent of French who miss the franc, according to the survey by Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation released on Monday. Financial fracas: German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke about a number of issues including the decreasing support of the Euro in her country as a new poll shows the majority of Germans feel they never should have switched currencies . The Germans are also less attached to the European Union, suggested the poll, which was conducted July 3 to 8 in both countries. Some 49 per cent of those Germans questioned said they would be personally better off if the EU did not exist, compared to 34 per cent of French who said they would be better, or much better off without the EU. The poll, also carried out in Poland, showed only 28 per cent of Poles believed they would be better without the EU. Nevertheless, despite their apparent skepticism about the euro on a personal level, 69 per cent of Germans said they believed the EU was a model for the rest of the world, compared to 56 per cent of French and 59 per cent of Poles. Germany has largely managed to ride out the recession that has engulfed most of the world due to its strong export market and solid industrial base. But the economy is now slowly heading south and, with no end in sight to the euro crisis, disillusion with the currency that their chancellor Angela Merkel has staked her career on is expected to grow. Last week the country's highest court green-lighted the bailout funds for the euro that will cost German taxpayers £151billion - 60 per cent of all tax revenues for this year. Old over new: 60 per cent of Germans feel they would have been better off if they stuck with the Deutschmark (left) rather than switching to the communal Euro (right) Germans who bought into the assurances that the euro was a strong currency that would be good for trade, good for banks, good for savings and would do away with pricey, pesky foreign exchange transactions when going on holiday to boot, now find themselves deeply disillusioned with it. Only the political and banking elite are still fighting for it, believing its failure would be a failure of the entire European project. Many experts believe it will still be Greece that rips the eurozone apart, despite the hundreds of billions in aid which has flooded into the country. Bankruptcy would be a tectonic shock to the euro zone from which it would probably not recover. The world economy would be plunged into turmoil and recession the like of which has not been seen since the great depression of the 1930's. The so-called troika of the EU Commission, the European Bank and the IMF has recently been intensely monitoring Greek efforts to make the cutbacks demanded of it for more aid. They have been severely disappointed at what has been achieved so far - just one third of savings targets reached in the past two years. If the IMF turns off the money tap, so will other countries like the Netherlands and Finland, who have linked their aid directly to the IMF.","65 per cent of Germans think the country shouldn't have switched from Deutschmark to Euro .

"This is the dramatic moment that a Syrian fighter jet was shot down by an Israeli missile.

A Syrian fighter jet is seen in flames after it was hit by the Israeli military over the Golan Heights on Tuesday . But it presented another challenge to Israel's oft-stateddesire to stay on the sidelines of a conflict on its northerndoorstep, in which al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front rebels took overa border crossing on the Golan last month. The Israeli military said its U.S.-made Patriot missile air . defence system shot down a Syrian Russian-built Sukhoi fighter . plane that had 'infiltrated Israeli airspace' over the . territory, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. It was the first time in three decades that Israel had . downed a Syrian warplane.

"A London-based French model who acted in a film about a hostage crisis was gunned down with her mother as they parked up outside the Kenyan mall, it emerged today. Anne Dechauffour, 27, and her mother Corinne, 54, were shot in their car as Islamic militants stormed the shopping centre in Nairobi. Their deaths are among a number of heartbreaking stories that are emerging from the terror atrocity that has seen at least 61 innocent shoppers killed since it began on Saturday. Cut down in her prime: London-based French model Anne Dechauffour who was shot dead by Islamic militants with her mother as they parked outside the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi . Cruel irony: Anne had appeared in a short film about a hostage crisis before her death . According to reports, Anne had been visiting her mother, an artist who had remarried and settled in Kenya ten years ago. Her father, Michel, is believed to run a luxury hotel, the Rock Leopard Lodge, in Kenya's Meru National Park. Anne had appeared in a short film about a hostage-taking before her death, it was reported in The Times. She was a student in cinema and linguistic sciences and was working part-time as a model. Francois Hoffman, director of the Cours Florent drama school, told Le Parisien: 'She had potential. She had a fragility that felt like an extension of childhood.' The murder of the two women, who were from Nice on the French Riviera, has caused outrage in France. Operation: Kenyan soldiers move in formation, clearing the top floor balcony and interior of the Nairobi mall . Out in force: Kenyan soldiers comb the rooftop of the Westgate mall on the fourth day of the siege . Evasive action: Kenyan soldiers and policemen crouch down behind a wall near the car park as they prepare for the next stage of the assault on the mall on Tuesday . The . Paris based anti-terrorism bureau opened an investigation into 'murder . and attempted murder in association with a terrorist organisation'. Corinne's . brother, Gabriel, was reported to have arrived in Nairobi accompanied . by representatives of the French Foreign Ministry on Sunday. The two women were among at least 61 civilians killed when Al Shabaab gunmen stormed the Westgate shopping centre and took a number of hostages during a five-day siege that Kenyan officials claimed had finally ended yesterday. The number of victims, gunmen and hostages has been unclear throughout the crisis as has the progress of the operation to secure the mall. Kenya's President tonight announced that his country had 'ashamed and defeated' its attackers, but even as he spoke shots were heard inside the mall. Gunshots also rang out this morning, but government spokesman Manoah Esipisu said they came from Kenyan forces going room to room, firing protectively before entering unknown territory. Victim: Dr Juan Ortiz-Iruri, whose daughter Juanita survived the mall attack by playing dead next to his body after he was shot by terrorists . A 13-year-old girl survived the mall massacre by pretending to be dead next to her father's corpse. Dr Juan Jesus Ortiz-Iruri had just pulled up in a basement car park under the shopping centre when he was shot in the chest. His daughter, Juanita Ortiz, sustained gunshot wounds to her leg and hand, but managed to evade a possible follow-up hit by lying still for up to four hours. Her brother Luis, who flew to Kenya from Australia, told The Times: 'For a couple of hours, maybe four, she sat in the car until someone came and got her and carried her into an ambulance. 'They left my father because he was dead.' Dr Ortiz-Iruri had recently been offered a job as a senior technical adviser in the Centre of Maternal and Newborn Health at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The family was due to leave Kenya today and Juanita was reportedly excited about moving to England. A father taken hostage at the mall sent a chilling final text to his nephew asking him to look after his one-year-old daughter. Lorry driver Thomas Otieno, 29, phoned his parents on Saturday to say his life was in danger. The next the family heard was a text he sent to Michael Wasonga two days later saying: 'Pray for me, that I will come out alive and meet another day.' In another message he listed his estate, including 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£214) in his bank account, a motorbike and two cows. A final text asked Mr Wasonga to care for this daughter. Mr Wasonga, 30, told The Times: 'After that, I knew he wasn't going to come out.' Kofi Awoonor was a Ghanaian poet, professor and former ambassador to Brazil, Cuba and the United Nations. Ghana's ministry of information said Awoonor's son was injured and is responding to treatment. Awoonor's work drew its inspiration from the traditions of his native Ewe tribe. Ghana's poetry foundation said on its website that Awoonor went into exile after Ghana's first president, Kwame Nkrumah, was driven out in a coup in 1966. Tragic: John Henry Martey Newman, chief of staff at the Ghanaian presidency, signs the condolences book for Ghanaian poet Kofi Awoonor, who was killed in the mall attack . He studied at the State University of New York at Stony Brook and his dissertation was published in 1975. He returned to Ghana and was later jailed for his alleged involvement in a coup plot. His time in prison was recounted in The House by the Sea (1978), the foundation said.

"Investigators who are trying to determine why a passenger jet dropped more than 5,000 feet in Turkish airspace say the co-pilot ‘fiddled’ with aircraft controls. The incident occurred while the captain of the Jet Airways Boeing 777-300 was taking a nap during a Mumbai-to-Brussels flight in August. The co-pilot claimed she was busy doing work on her tablet and did not notice the drop in altitude as the plane carried around 280 passengers. Scroll down for video . Under investigation: A report by Boeing says the co-pilot fiddled with the aircraft's controls, says an official . India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation launched an investigation and is reviewing a report prepared by The Boeing Company, which analysed the digital flight data recorder’s records. A senior DGCA official told The Hindustan Times: ‘This appears to be a serious act of criminal negligence on part of the co-pilot. ‘It wasn’t as if the plane went into a free fall and the pilots were unaware of it. 'The Boeing report clearly establishes that the co-pilot fiddled with the controls of the aircraft after which the plane dropped 5,000 feet.’ In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, the airline said: ‘Jet Airways has initiated an internal inquiry into the matter and shared the Boeing report with the regulator to assist with the investigation. However, the airline is unable to comment till such time the full investigations are over. 'Safety is of paramount importance to Jet Airways, as is also the welfare of our guests and crew and the airline will always take appropriate steps to ensure the same.’ The pilots received an emergency call from an air traffic controller in Ankara, who demanded to know why the aircraft had descended from its assigned flight level of 34,000ft. Other aircraft were flying at the altitude that the commercial aircraft had descended to, and the airspace over Turkey is busier than normal as airlines avoid conflict zones in Iraq and Ukraine. The interior of a Boeing 777 cockpit is pictured in this file photo . The co-pilot awakened the pilot when the air traffic controller asked them to immediately ascend to 32,000ft. But the crew did not report the incident to India’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in their post-flight report. The regulator was alerted when it received an anonymous text message about the uncontrolled descent involving the Mumbai-based airline. DGCA officials have suspended the pilot and co-pilot pending the outcome of the investigation. A source told the Times of India: ‘The commander was taking controlled rest, which means he was sleeping as per global airline norms where pilots take rest in the cockpit by turn on long flights. ‘The co-pilot, who was supposed to ensure that the aircraft flew steadily on its assigned path, told DGCA investigators that she was on her electronic flight bag, a tablet that has all aircraft documents loaded on to it.' India’s aviation regulator is looking into whether the captain's controlled rest was permitted at that time.","Incident occurred while Boeing 777-300 aircraft was en route to Brussels .

"Brutal: A Swedish man is to stand trial for killing his girlfriend in a brutal sado-masochistic sex game. The acts he allegedly performed on her were similar to those carried out in the novel Fifty Shades of Grey, pictured . A Swedish man is to stand trial for the 'Fifty Shades of Grey' killing of his girlfriend in a brutal sado-masochistic sex game which ended in her death. A 28-year-old German woman was hit 123 times with a wooden blackboard pointer as she was bound up with nylon tights and condoms. Her 31-year-old 'master' said she was a willing 'sex slave' in their games. But after her death police discovered her diary in which she wrote: 'You once said you did not want to see me in real pain. I am subservient but no masochist.' The man was charged this week in connection with her death last October. Police said he raised the alarm when she stopped breathing during their violent sex session and he tried to resuscitate her before the ambulance arrived at his home in Umea, northern Sweden. The victim was treated for two days in the intensive care ward of a local hospital before her life support machines were switched off. She had sustained terrible brain damage as a result of her airways being restricted.

"A Japanese lingerie brand has created a bra that can only be removed when its wearer is experiencing ‘true love’. The underwear comes with a heart rate monitor that syncs with a mobile phone app which automatically unhooks the bra when the wearer’s pulse hits its so-called ‘True Love Rate’. Manufacturer Ravijour insists the bra will not continually burst open whenever its wearer goes for a jog however, as it says the app can recognise the difference between a heart rate increase caused by exercise, and a sharp spike brought about by romantic excitement. Innovative: The underwear comes with a heart rate monitor that synchs with a mobile phone app which automatically unhooks the bra when the wearer's pulse hits its so-called 'True Love Rate' The bra works by monitoring heart rate increases specifically caused by hormone levels secreted by the adrenal medulla – the gland that releases adrenalin into the bloodstream. The bra’s in-built heart monitor reacts to any increase in the wearer’s pulse rate by sending a signal to the mobile phone app via Bluetooth. The app then monitors the changes for a few minutes to try to work out exactly what caused the increase, and when the level reaches its ‘True Love Rate’, the bra literally bursts open.

"A young couple jailed for burglarizing Miley Cyrus and stealing her $100,000 sports car have said they were inspired by the notorious Bling Ring. Aspiring models Naomi Charles, 21 and boyfriend Tylor Scott, 19, both pleaded guilty to breaking and entering the singer’s home on May 30 this year. It has now emerged that just like the infamous teen gang, the young woman was the leader of the two, and the lure of fame the trigger. Bling ringed: Aspiring models Naomi Charles, 21, and boyfriend Tylor Scott, 19, burglarized Miley Cyrus home in Studio City, LA in May, stealing jewellery and her $100,000 car, after being inspired by the Bling Ring gang . Crime: The couple scaled a fence to enter singer Miley Cyrus' home and stole jewellery, purses, clothing and her $100,000 Maserati . Charles and Scott scaled a fence and entered the We Can’t Stop singer’s home in Studio City, LA, while she was on tour and stole an unknown amount of jewellery, clothing and purses, as well as her 2014 Maserati Quattroporte. Miley Cyrus’ assistant reported the burglary the following day after noticing items out of place in the home. The car was found a few days later in Simi Valley, 45 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, LAPD said at the time. Charles, a Los Angeles resident, and Scott, from Arizona, were arrested on June 5 in North Hollywood, after being recognised from the surveillance video of the theft – just like the infamous Bling Ring members. The Bling Ring was a group of seven teens and young adults based around Calabasas, California who burglarized the homes of several stars, including Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Megan Fox, Rachel Bilson, Ashley Tisdale and Lindsay Lohan, in the late noughties. Bonnie and Clyde: The thieving two appears to have been in a relationship, posing images of them kissing on social media . Inspiration: Charles told police the couple were inspired by the infamous Bling Ring, a group of teen burglars whose story was brought to the big screen in 2013, starring Emma Watson and Katie Chang . Hot wheels: The couple also stole Miley's $100,000 Maserati, which was found abandoned 45 miles from Los Angeles a few days after the burglary . Talk to the hand: Miley, pictured in concert during her Bangerz Tour in Mexico City on Friday, have yet to comment on the guilty verdicts . Last year, the Bling Ring story was turned into . a movie directed by Sofia Coppola and starring Emma Watson as the best . known of the bunch – Alexis Neiers. After . pleading guilty in 2009, Ms Neiers went on to star in a reality-tv show . about her life, in effect, gaining minor fame as a result of her . crimes, something which may have inspired Charles. Before . committing the burglary, Charles shared photos of expensive cars and . wads of cash on Twitter, with the caption: ‘Life goals.’ The ‘fitness model’ also posted on social media that she wished she ‘was like Miley’. The Bonnie and Clyde-couple both pleaded guilty to guilty to felony residential burglary on Monday, September 22, telling police of their inspiration, TMZ reports. Charles was sentenced to one year in county jail and four years probation, while Scott, who has a previous criminal record, was given a harsher sentence. Scott, . who also pled guilty to felony grand theft and admitted to bringing a . firearm to the burglary, was sentenced to five years in state prison. Miley Cyrus, who is currently on her South American leg of her Bangerz Tour, have not made any comments on the verdicts, instead posting snaps of herself in bed and on stage on her Instagram.","Naomi Charles, 21, and Tylor Scott, 19, burglarized Miley Cyrus LA home .

"Germany is breaking one of its major post-war taboos by announcing there will be an annual Veterans' Day to remember fallen soldiers. The country's defence minister has unleashed a storm of criticism from opposition politicians and pacifists who object to the army being honoured given Germany's bloody past in the 20th century. German Defence Minister Thomas de Maizière has proposed May 22 as an annual Veterans’ Day to honour former soldiers living and dead. Taboo: Germany will have an annual Veterans' Day to remember fallen soldiers, including those pictured here who invaded Austria in 1938 . This would mean honouring those troops of both world wars who acted as aggressors - and in the case of the Nazis in World War 2 - often as criminals. 'Against the background of our operations and the questions they pose our society, it is time to speak objectively and openly about our veterans' policy,' de Maizière said. The centre-left Social Democratic Party is against the move. 'I'm sceptical whether there can be a day that really reaches society,' said SPD defence spokesman Rainer Arnold. 'If the defence minister wants to do something for former soldiers, he should get some money and improve their social security, instead of invoking some cheap 'ideal honour',' said Left party defence spokesman Paul Schaefer. Tributes: German soldiers, such as these ones engaged in the trenches in the First World War, will be honours on the Veterans' Day . The Green Party was equally scathing. Their defence expert Omid Nouripour called the Veterans Day nothing but a 'fig-leaf' for a minister who is 'avoiding his core duties'. He condemned the Veterans' Day as 'superfluous', unless it was used to open a debate on military operations abroad - and also honoured development workers and diplomats abroad. Germany's first foreign military mission since World War II took place in 1991 during the second Gulf War. Since then since 300,000 German soldiers have been in action abroad and more than 100 have been killed. More than 5million German servicemen fell in WW2, and 2million in the First World War. There has not been a specific day to honour the military dead ever since the Third Reich fell in 1945.","May 22 will honour Germany's living and dead soldiers .

"The University of Pennsylvania women's lacrosse team allegedly ran riot in a Philadelphia Irish pub on Saturday - stealing liquor, smoking marijuana in the bathrooms and flashing their private parts 'to the adulation of the rest of the party'. Fado Irish Pub in Center City sent a strongly worded email to women’s lacrosse coach Karin Brower Corbett and UPenn’s Athletic Department alleging 'absolutely deplorable behavior' that resulted in considerable damage to the popular bar. No disciplinary action has been taken yet, but the incident at the pre-planned party is under investigation. Scene of the alleged crime: This is Fado Irish Pub in City Center in Philadelphia where the UPenn women's lacrosse team allegedly ran riot on Saturday . In the email, Fado's manager Casey Neff said that the team members broke a handing lighting fixture, stole a bottle of liquor from behind the bar and also tried to swipe a six-pack of beer. Neff said that the lacrosse players smoked drugs in the bathroom and one woman exposed her genitals to the loud appreciation of the rest of the group. Most damningly, Neff alleges that the group tipped less than $52 on a $1,300 bill. 'We want people to have fun. We are happy that people come out,' Neff said  to The Daily Pennsylvanian. 'But that was well above and beyond the standard of normal behavior. 'They broke the light fixture, and they literally cheered about it — ‘yeah!’ — are you kidding?' Lacrosse team: This is the UPenns women's lacrosse team. It is not known who from the team is allegedly responsible for the damage at Fado's nor if anyone in this picture is responsible . Fun times: This picture shows members of the UPenns women's lacrosse team - who as a group were allegedly responsible for bad behavior at a Philadelphia bar on Saturday - it is not known if anyone in this photograph was involved . Despite his objections, Neff said he will not be filing a police report. 'We don’t know any individual who broke anything, it was a group. We were not able to single out anyone,' he said. He does want compensation from the University though. Neff also alleged that this is not a one-off occurrence from UPenn students - claiming they have taken cocaine in the toilet and also had sex there too. Indeed, local managers in City Center met to discuss actually banning UPenn students from their bars. 'We will assess reservations case by case and do a thorough job finding out what the event is for,' Neff said. 'It would be unfair to exclude [students from one university] based on the actions of a few. 'I know of several students that are regulars and not only behave well, but are some of our favorite customers,' he said in the email. Lively: This is Fado's on a normal evening in City Center, Philadelphia . Penn Athletic Communications Director Mike Mahoney issued a statement that said, 'We have been made aware of the allegations by Fado, and we are deeply concerned about them. 'Our coaches and senior staff are meeting with the members of the women’s lacrosse team, and we will continue to thoroughly investigate the allegations around this event. 'If the description of incidents around this event is accurate and found to involve our team and their guests, this was deplorable behavior that will not be tolerated.'","Fado Irish Pub in Center City in Philadelphia has accused the University of Pennsylvania's women's lacrosse team of running riot on Saturday .

"The mother of Columbine High School shooter Dylan Klebold is planning a memoir in which she will confront the 'indescribable grief and shame' she has lived with since the 1999 tragedy. Crown Publishers said on Tuesday that it had acquired a book by Susan Klebold, saying she was compelled to share her story after the murders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and other schools. The book is currently untitled and has no release date. Klebold will donate any author profits to mental health research and charitable organizations. Scroll down for video . Susan Klebold, pictured in 2003, the mother of Columbine killer Dylan Klebold, is writing a memoir to confront the indescribable grief and shame she feels since her son murdered 13 at his high school in 1999 . Eric Harris (pictured left) and Dylan Klebold (right) pictured in 1999. They killed 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School before taking their own lives . Dylan Klebold and fellow senior student Eric Harris killed 12 students and one teacher and injured 26 others at the Colorado school before taking their own lives in 1999. The large-scale attack also involved a fire bomb used to distract fire fighters. At the time, it was the worst school shooting in the country's history before 2012, when shooter Adam Lanza killed 20 students and six teaching staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Susan Klebold has previously described her feelings in an essay for Oprah Winfrey's O magazine and in interviews for Andrew Solomon's book, Far from the Tree. Mrs Klebold and her husband Tom Klebold, have spoken little to the press following the Columbine tragedy, The New York Times reported in 2004, but did not move or change their names. In her lengthy essay for O Magazine in 2009, Mrs Klebold wrote: 'In the weeks and months that followed the killings, I was nearly insane with sorrow for the suffering my son had caused, and with grief for the child I had lost.' She continued: 'But while I perceived myself to be a victim of the tragedy, I didn't have the comfort of being perceived that way by most of the community. I was widely viewed as a perpetrator or at least an accomplice since I was the person who had raised a 'monster.'' Mrs Klebold also told author Andrew Solomon: 'I can never decide whether it’s worse to think your child was hardwired to be like this and that you couldn’t have done anything, or to think he was a good person and something set this off in him.' Susan Klebold, the mother of Columbine High School shooter Dylan Klebold, is planning a memoir, Crown Publishers said on Tuesday . The killers' diaries from the time offered chilling details about their activities in the months before the attack. They had 'to do' lists, with each purchase of gasoline or a weapon marked off, and they had a hit list with at least 42 entries, all of them blacked out. On a calendar entry for April 20, 1999, the time 11.10 is at the top - an approximate reference to the time the attack began. Elsewhere in the calendar are notations including 'get nails' and 'get propane, fill my clips' and 'finish fuses'. 'Once I finally start my killing, keep this in mind, there are probably about 100 people max in the school alone who I don't want to die, the rest MUST (expletive) DIE!' Harris wrote in a journal entry from October 1998, six months before the attack. A scrawled entry in Klebold's day planner apparently sketches out April 20, 1999, down to the minute, starting with a 6am meeting, a 10.30am 'set up,' an 11.12am 'gear up' and at 11.16am, 'HAHAHA.'","Susan Klebold, mother of shooter Dylan Klebold, said she wanted to share her story after the Sandy Hook massacre .

"A grandfather has helped answer the concerns of travellers across the globe by creating a portable lock which can secure almost any door in the world. Bob Fitzjohn, 66, form London, developed The EasyLock device at his kitchen table after raising more than £10,000 from crowdfunding website, IndieGogo. This device, which weighs less than an iPhone, will completely secure any type of door that opens inwards, anywhere on the globe, providing extra security for guests using hotels, B&Bs, or even beach huts. Scroll down for video . This lock, which weighs less than an iPhone, will completely secure any type of door that opens inwards, anywhere on the globe . It works by being fastened across the door's latchplate and hooking onto the outside of the doorframe. The lock is then secured in place with an adjustable handle. It also allows users to open the door slightly to check a caller's identity and pass through slim items. Mr Fitzjohn, an entrepreneur, said he spent hours drawing up the designs and making the prototypes at his kitchen table before setting up an online scheme to get money from members of the public to help him produce the invention. Bob Fitzjohn, 66, invented TheEasyLock device  after raising  £10,000 from crowdfunding website, IndieGogo . He was appealing for £10,000, but eventually managed to secure almost £10,500 with donors praising the idea. In return for their money, Mr Fitzjohn offered people a number of free EasyLocks depending on the amount they had pledged. One member of the public offered £2,500 in the early stages of the campaign with Mr Fitzjohn promising to send him 50 free EasyLocks once the invention had been finally produced. The new product is being sold for £24.95, and is being advertised as 'the perfect gift for a travel lover'. Mr Fitzjohn said he spent hours drawing up the designs and making the prototypes at his kitchen table . Mr Fitzjohn said: 'The design process took months of development and testing. I made a great many of sketches by hand and on the computer and I drove the family mad whilst I built functional lock after lock on the kitchen table. 'My thoughts were with my grandchildren when I designed The EasyLock. One day they'll be off travelling the world, and I wanted to create a solution that would keep them 100 per cent safe and sound, no matter where they stayed. 'My thinking in creating the lock developed into wanting to provide all others that may find themselves in a vulnerable position with complete security, whether a student in cheap lodgings, an isolated elderly person who fears living alone, or simply you or I when we stay in a B&B or hotel.' Mr Fitzjohn said he persevered for more than a year in developing the lock, which now sells for £24.95 . Bob Fitzjohn is glad that he has persevered for over a year in developing the lock. 'It is a dream come true that TheEasy Lock is now available for the public to purchase. My hope is that TheEasyLock will bring safety and peace of mind to many people, right across the globe.' It is the latest security invention developed for travellers that has been widely praised. Earlier this year a beach safety device called the Beach Vault was launched. Invented by holidaymaker Marcal DaCunha, the product is a unique locker that can screw into the sand and hold personal items such as purses, mobile phones, small tablets and money. It can be sealed shut by a special waterproof lid to stop any liquid seeping inside, and then covered by a towel and pillowcase. Whenever a sun-seeker is lying on the towel to relax, the 12ins-deep and 6ins-wide container is completely concealed.","Bob Fitzjohn raised more than £10,000 on crowdfunding website Indiegogo .

"Swarms of deadly hornets have killed more than 40 people and injured more than 1,600 in northern China.

Swarms of deadly hornets have killed more than 40 people and injured more than 1,600 in northern China . Victims of the attack have been left with deep, dark craters in their skin the size of bullet wounds . Terrifying: One victim told local media that 'the more you run, the more they want to chase you' Over the past three months the cities of Angkang, Hanzhong and Shangluo have been worst affected. The Chinese term for hornets is 'hu feng' and local experts believe the culprit is the Asian giant hornet or Vespa mandarinia, which grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting. The insects' highly toxic stings can lead to anaphylactic shock and renal failure. Horror: Some victims described being chased about 200 metres (656 feet) by a swarm . One victim told local media that 'the more you run, the more they want to chase you' and some victims described being chased about 200 metres (656 feet) by the deadly insects. Authorities have mobilised a special medic team and trained more medical personnel to treat victims. An Ankang official told Xinhua that firefighters have been removing hornet nests. The provincial government said hornets are most aggressive in behaviour when they mate and migrate in September and October. The dry and warm weather this year has contributed to the ferocity of attacks. The Chinese term for hornets is 'hu feng'. Those behind the deadly attacks this summer appear to be the Asian giant hornet, or Vespa mandarinia. The Asian giant hornet grows up to 5cm long with a 6mm sting  which injects a large amount of potent venom. The hornet sting can be extremely painful to humans and has been compared to a hot nail being hammered into the body, . The head of the hornet is orange and quite wide in comparison to other hornet species. The . Asian giant hornet is intensely predatory; it hunts medium- to . large-sized insects, such as bees, other hornet species, and mantises. Hornets are most aggressive in behavior when they mate and migrate in September and October. Attacks are difficult to prevent because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites. One of the victims, named only as Mu, said she has spent two months in a hospital undergoing 13 dialysis treatments. She has 200 stitches, but still can not move her legs. She told Xinhua, the Chinese state-run news agency: 'The hornets were horrifying'. 'They hit right at my head and covered my legs. All of a . sudden I was stung and I couldn't move. 'Even now, my legs are covered with sting holes.' 'Most of the deaths are due to allergies to the venom, said Shunichi Makino, director general of the Hokkaido Research Centre for Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, told CNN. 'It's very difficult to prevent the attacks because hornet nests are usually in hidden sites,' he said. 'The venom of an Asian giant hornet is very special compared with other hornets or yellow jackets,' he warned. 'The neurotoxin -- especially to mammals including humans -- it's a special brand of venom.' Meanwhile fears are growing that giant Asian hornets are headed for Britain. The species is four times the size of our native honeybees and has decimated the bee population in France. The dark invaders with yellow feet are thought to have arrive in France in a delivery of Chinese pottery from the Far East in late 2004. The insects have colonised huge swathes of France, spreading along waterways, and with a few hornets capable of destroying 30,000 bees in a couple of hours, honey production has plummeted. It has colonised 39 of France’s 100 administrative departments. The hornets pick on honeybees as they leave their hive until the colony is so exhausted that the hornets can move in and ransack it. Groups of Asian hornets hover in front of a beehive, picking off single honeybees, decapitating them and stripping off their wings and legs before making off with the 'meat ball' to feed their young. It is a further problem for the British honeybee, which is struggling to cope with changes in farming and climate and already has one Far Eastern invader to contend with - the varroa mite, which feeds on the bees and makes their hives more vulnerable to disease.","At least 37 patients are in a critical or serious condition in hospitals .

Ukrainian authorities had barred aircraft from ground level to 32,000 feet but the downed aircraft was cruising at 33,000 feet, still within range of  ground-to-air missiles, when it was hit. There was speculation that the doomed Flight MH17 had taken a short-cut across the disputed region of eastern Ukraine to save fuel. As relatives gathered at airports for news of missing loved ones, it emerged that airlines had twice been warned about the risk of flying over an area where two Ukrainian military aircraft hadalready been shot down this week. In April, the International Civil Aviation Organisation advised carriers to consider alternative routes after outlining ‘the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civilflights’. On Monday, Eurocontrol – the body that coordinates all traffic across European airspace – sent out an official note to airmen,known as a Notam, repeating the warning and saying it ‘stronglyadvises’ avoiding the airspace. Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 taking off from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam before it was shot down . But many carriers continued to use the route because it was shorter and therefore cheaper. Flight MH17 had taken off from Amsterdam at lunchtime and was flying at around 33,000ft on one of the main routes from Europe. The jet was travelling at 33,000 feet at 490 knots when it disappeared from radar screens while approaching the Russian border. It . is believed that the Malaysian Airlines pilots ignored several warnings . to avoid the airspace over Ukraine. It is understood the Malaysian . Airline jet used the Ukrainian route to save fuel as diverting north or . south would have taken longer. Earlier on Thursday, air . accident investigators were planning to inspect the proposed flight plan . lodged by pilots on board Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 to see if they . flew over a warzone as a cost-cutting measure. An unverified image posted online show Ukrainian inspecting what appears to be wreckage from the doomed flight . The . 17-year-old jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine despite British, . European and U.S. commercial aircraft being warned against using the . airspace since April. One . aviation expert revealed: 'Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other . carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, . which means less fuel and therefore less money.' In April, the European Aviation and Safety Agency warned: ‘Taking into consideration the recent publication by the Russian Federation of a series of notices to airmen (NOTAMs) modifying the Simferopol FIR which is under the responsibility of Ukraine, and their intent to provide air traffic services (ATS) within this airspace, the Agency draws the aviation communities’ attention to the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civil flights. ‘Due to the unsafe situation where more than one ATS provider may be controlling flights within the same airspace from 3 April 2014, 0600 UTC onwards, consideration should be given to measures to avoid the airspace and circumnavigate the Simferopol FIR with alternative routings. ‘ . On July 8, the State Aviation Administration of Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian aircraft after rebels shot a military transport aircraft that was flying over 20,000 feet. Safety regulators will investigate why the pilots of the jet, pictured, decided to fly through a warzone . The restriction warned commercial aircraft against using Ukranian airspace. A Notice to Airmen, seen by Mail Online warned: ‘Due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control (ATC) instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities and for the related potential for misidentification of civil aircraft, UK aircraft  operators are strongly advised to avoid, until further notice, the airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.’ The EASA supplied airlines with a list of alternative routes avoiding the conflict zone. The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority had also banned its aircraft from the Crimea region. The suspected shooting down of a large passenger plane while flying at altitude presents airlines and their passengers with an extremely serious new development in air travel, according to aviation experts. The European Air Safety Authority issued airlines with a number of alternative routes avoiding Ukraine . European and US air safety bodies warned against using Ukrainian airspace since April because of the risk . Norman Shanks, the former head of group security at airports group BAA, and professor of aviation security at Coventry University, said there had been suggestions airlines had been warned to avoid the route because of the violence below. But many carriers continued to use it because it was shorter and therefore cheaper. He said: 'It is a busy aviation route and there have been suggestions that a notice was given to aviators telling airlines to avoid that particular area. 'But Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money. 'I expect the area will be declared a no fly zone and aircraft will have no choice but to take a different, longer route.' Airline carriers are avoiding the area where the passenger aircraft crashed, as well as the east of Ukraine in the wake of the tragedy. Russian Aeroflot, UTair and Transaero, German Lufthansa, Turkish airlines, Italy's Alitalia and America's Delta have diverted all their planes away from the strife-hit region. 'After the incident we have decided to avoid Ukrainian airspace,' a Turkish Airlines spokesman said. Air France and Virgin have also decided to temporarily re-route flights to bypass Ukraine, according to RT. Delta tweeted: 'Out of an abundance of caution, Delta is not routing flights through Ukrainian airspace.' Prof Shanks said it was 'extremely unusual' for political disputes to spill over and endanger the lives of civilians travelling in commercial flights in the skies above. And he suggested those behind the shooting 'deliberately' targeted a passenger plane as it would have been obvious from its appearance that it was a commercial aircraft and posed no military threat. He said: 'This is probably the first time this has happened in recent history. The aircraft was flying at such a height that it is unlikely to have been a military aircraft. 'You would be able to tell it was a civilian aircraft not a military aircraft with the naked eye because of the jet plumes behind it. 'This would almost certainly have to be a deliberate act, for whatever reason - we can only speculate. 'It should have been quite visible to people on the ground that it was a civilian aircraft, by the size of it and the shape of it. Anyone who has looked at a civilian aircraft or large military aircraft will know the difference.' He said the plane's black box could contain vital clues to help piece together what the pilots knew during their final moments in the cockpit. But he warned that tracing the flight recorders could be very tricky as they are probably 'now in a war zone' somewhere in the Ukraine. He added: 'The pilots and passengers could well have been totally unaware that this missile was heading for them.' Aviation experts fear that MH17 used the route through Ukraine as it was shorter and saved fuel . If today's incident is confirmed as a deliberate act then Ukraine airspace could well be closed down, meaning diversions for UK carriers who currently fly to and over the area. ‘This could be a very serious development,’ said David Kaminski-Morrow, air transport editor of Flightglobal magazine. He went on: ‘If reports are true, we are not talking about small-arm fire but serious weaponry. Normally even if planes fly over a war zone they can go high enough for the conflict not to be a worry. ‘Any decision about the opening or closing of Ukranian airspace will be a matter for the Ukrainians. It could well be that part or all of that airspace will now be closed. ‘Also, individual airlines, including UK carriers, could decide to detour around Ukraine.’ Mr Kaminski-Morrow continued: ‘It's really quite incredible that it should be Malaysia Airlines involved in this, after what happened earlier in the year. ‘This is not a small airline on a faraway route. This was a major airline flying from a European destination to a capital in the Far East. There must be serious concerns about how the airline can recover from this. ‘There will obviously be political as well as aviation concerns from all this. This will run and run.’ Air crash investigators will look for the aircraft's black boxes to determine what exactly happened to the jet .","European Aviation and Safety Agency warned pilots to avoid Ukraine in April .

"Glamorous: 23-year-old Kate combines looking good with milking 500 cows three times a day . With her . long blonde hair extensions, cut-off denim shorts and perfectly applied . fake tan, Kate, 23, from Herefordshire, certainly isn't your average . farmer. But while she might look as though she spends her days in the beauty salon, work for the 23-year-old begins at 5am and doesn't stop until the sun goes down. Her work includes milking 500 cows three times a day, overseeing calving and clearing the yard of muck, as well as feeding duties. Despite the long hours and backbreaking work, Kate, who says her friends 'don't really understand' what she does, says she has no plans to ever do anything else. 'Dairy farming is a passion and it's 24 . hours a day,' she explains. 'I dream about cows in my sleep and then I wake up and think . about them. 'If I'd been in it for the money, I would have done something . else,' she says, adding: 'I'm obsessed with them!' But not everyone is amused by her choice of career, among them her mother Lesley who confesses that she wishes Kate had chosen to do something else. 'I do find that when I tell people my . daughter's a dairy farmer, they're not all that impressed,' she admits. 'It does drive . us round the bend sometimes that she's so obsessed with it all. 'I was slightly hoping that as she got into it, got . more experienced she got she would think ""This is too much like hard . work"" and get out. 'But it didn't work out like that at all. The more she . got into it, the more you could see that there was no turning back.' Quite how obsessed with cows, in particular the Holstein Friesian dairy breed, she is becomes clear when you watch First Time Farmers, the Channel 4 reality series in which Kate stars. Although . co-stars Robbie, 23, and James, 26, clearly adore their animals, only . Kate has a bedroom full of cow-themed clothing, soft toys and posters. Even her chat up lines include cows. 'Are you good at calf rearing or what?' she asks one hapless prospective suitor. 'I'm the best in the West Midlands! I'm a top . calf rearer!' Passionate: Kate loves all things Holstein Friesian cow and gets up at 5am to milk 500 of them each day . Beautiful: Kate is based in Herefordshire which sits on the Welsh border and is prime dairy farming country . Fellow farmer: Robbie, 23, whose family own a herd of rare breed pigs, is more typical of young farmers . 'There are definitely two sides to me,' she sheepishly admits. 'When I'm at work, I'm very focused but when I'm at Uni, I like to go . out, party hard and have a good time.' Despite her penchant for enjoying the odd pint, most of Kate's life revolves around farming, whether studying for her degree in Herd Management or conducting a research project that involves raising 10 calves by hand. 'I literally woke up one morning and . decided I wanted to be a farmer and milk cows,' she laughs. 'It literally is an . obsession.' Like her mother, however, not everyone thinks Kate's passion for cattle should dictate her choice of career, although Kate herself is determined to prove them wrong. 'You have got to be quite a strong . personality if you're female and you're going to go into dairy farming,' she explains. 'I . definitely do have a point to prove. 'People don't take me . seriously because of how I look. The boys call me Barbie because . I've got my blonde hair extensions in, false eyelashes in, my fake tan, . my nails and stuff. I'll prove them all wrong! 'If I meet someone in the . pub or I'm out somewhere and they ask what I do and I say I milk cows, I actually have to get out my phone and show them . pictures of me milking because they don't believe it. 'Their first guess . is usually a hairdresser or a beautician or something. I really have to . persuade them that I do really do this. 'It's only when I start coming . out with all the [dairy farming] terms, they're like, ""Oh yeah, she does . actually know what she's talking about."" I'm like, ""Yup, there you go""!' For now, what the boys think is the least of her concerns. 'I haven't really got time for somebody . else,' she admits. 'If I wanted a boyfriend, I could get one, like tomorrow. But I . don't really have time to spend with anybody.' With 500 cows to milk three times a day, Kate's life is certainly a busy one but she doesn't seem to mind in the slightest. 'I think people . really do call me the crazy calf lady,' she giggles. 'It's funny though, so I don't mind!'

"Fashion has never been known for its love of fat. From size zero scandals to revelations that models eat tissues to stay slim, the pressure to be slender is on. But one group of fashionistas is bucking the skinny trend. The last few years have seen an explosion in 'fatshionista' blogs, with the curvy girls behind them stepping away from the computer and into the style spotlight. Two of the most popular are Fuller Figure, Fuller Bust's Georgina Horne and Arched Eyebrow supremo, Bethany Rutter - both of whom star in Clements Ribeiro's new campaign for Evans. Glamorous: Georgina poses in the paint stroke swimsuit, £35.50, from the Clements Ribeiro for Evans range . Fatshionista: Fellow British blogger Callie Thorpe also stars in the Evans campaign along with two US writers . Despite their success and undoubted grasp of style, the pair have complained that the media - and the fashion industry as a whole - still fails to recognise that larger women want cool clothes too. '[Fatshion blogging has become popular] simply because we don't have a face or a . voice anywhere else,' explains Rutter, 22. 'All UK fashion journalism is written by . slim people for slim people, so there's almost no point reading . magazines if you're fat. 'That's why the internet's become such an . important place for plus-size fashion.' Horne, 23, adds: 'Plus size . bloggers are women who are not afraid to admit to being bigger, happy . and fashionable. 'With so much pressure to shift those extra pounds and . tone up for summer, we are a breath of fresh air. It's OK to be fat. Fat . doesn't mean unhealthy, undesirable or a failure. It's just a size.' What's more, notes Rutter, ignoring bigger women puts the fashion industry at odds with one of the biggest social trends of the last 50 years: the fact that people are getting fatter. Fashionable: The bloggers, including Horne (far left) and Rutter (far right) pose with designers Clements Ribeiro . Blogger: Bethany's blog, Arched Eyebrow, shows how larger ladies how to make the most of their looks . Outdated: According to Rutter, fashion industry attitudes are very last season . According to the Department of Health, 'in England, most people are overweight or obese.' And statistics released by the government would appear to back this up, with 61.3 per cent of adults and 30 per cent of children aged between 2 and 15 either overweight or obese. Health problems associated with being overweight or obese cost the NHS more than £5 billion every year. 'We know . people are getting bigger - that's a fact,' explains Rutter. 'The sooner fashion catches onto that the better.' Despite their complaints, it seems that some parts of the fashion industry are beginning to take note, not least husband and wife design duo, Clements Ribeiro. The pair have created a directional collection for plus-size emporium, Evans, which includes chic dresses and wearable little tops festooned with lashings of their trademark colourful print. 'After three collections in which we tried to create smart capsule wardrobes, including some serious eveningwear, we decided to come up with a surprise turn by creating a holiday range that is playful and easy,' explained Ignacio Ribeiro. 'The shapes are very casual and straightforward and the prints are full of wit. It is infused with the urban energy the bloggers inspired us with, but also ready for a week of fun in Rio. Along with Rutter and Horne, other 'fatshion' bloggers to star in the campaign include UK writer, Callie Thorne and US fatshionistas, Nicolette Mason and Marie Denee. Stylish: American blogger Nicollette Mason is one of two from across the pond to star in the Evans campaign . Help: Horne's blog, Fuller Figure, Fuller Bust, invites readers to break out of their comfort zone and enjoy fashion . Do you feel that the fashion industry is . moving away from its thin ideal? Personally, I don't see 'thin' or 'fat' or any other shapes or sized as a fashion choice. Some women are . naturally thin, some want to be thin, and fashion is not necessarily to . blame or the only influence. What I do think is that larger women are . becoming more vocal and proud to be bigger. Not all of them want to lose . weight and wear baggy sacks until it happens - they want choices, . patterns, colours, daring cuts, a range of prices. They want to see . women who can wear those clothes modelling them, and they wants people . to accept these facts. It's great to see an increase of larger models, . if only they weren't called 'plus' size when they're not. Do you have any tips for bigger girls who need a self-esteem boost? First and foremost - confidence can not . be gained by putting others down. 'Real woman have curves' and 'I'd . rather be hungry than have diabetes' are stupid phrases that empower no . one. Be happy with yourself, and if you're not, and you can make . positive changes then do so. Listen to the compliments people give you, . not the insults. What was your favourite part of the Evans shoot? My favourite part was actually spending . time with all the girls. Those four ladies are so inspiring and . passionate and I loved hearing such an intelligent debate take place. Do you feel that the fashion industry is . moving away from its thin ideal? Yes! It's definitely upped its game . since realising how much money there is in plus size fashion. We know . people are getting bigger - that's a fact - and the sooner fashion catches onto that the better. The high street is a bit of a . wasteland if you're fat - most branches of H&M and New Look just . don't seem to carry their plus ranges, so that could definitely be . improved. I'm really grateful for the Swan collection because it shows . Evans knows how to treat women who want sleek, chic, fun pieces on the . high street, available for fat women. Do you have any tips for bigger girls who need a self-esteem boost? Get online! Create conversations on . Twitter, find a support network of fellow fat girls, be inspired by what . others are wearing, find your feet by looking at endless photos of . sassy plus size women on Tumblr. Knowing you're not alone makes a . massive difference. What was your favourite part of the Evans shoot? Getting to meet Nicolette and Marie . (who are, honestly, inspirations for the places you can go with fatshion . if you work hard and are given the right platform), and hang out with . Georgina and Callie who I already knew! Oh and play . with loads of fun clothes and accessories, AND meet loads of great new . people who are making such an effort to keep Evans up to date.

"A 'degrading and dangerous' Facebook page which invites followers to name and shame women and their sexual behaviour has caused an uproar after gaining more than 10,000 likes in just a few weeks. The page, called 'Prague Sluts' because it refers to women in the capital of the Czech Republic of Prague, was set up three weeks ago and asks followers to send in pictures of 'easy girls' and to write short descriptions about them. Now it has been flooded with thousands of 'likes' and hundreds of photos showing scantily-clad local women. Pictures that were uploaded to the Facebook page show two women posing for selfies . Photos posted on the page are often accompanied by comments speculating on the women's sexual exploits . The identities of the women pictured on the Facebook page are not concealed like they are in these images . Typical comments include things such as: 'She lost her virginity when she was 13 and has slept with half of Prague. She's a real slut.' Although it doesn't give the women's real names, there is no attempt to hide their faces so identifying who they are is easy to those who know them. Critics have now slammed the page saying it is damaging to the women's reputations and to their safety. Facebook commentator Nikola Dvorakova wrote on the page: 'Can you prove that the things about the girls posted on this page are true? 'I don't think you realise what harm this can brings to those accused.' And women's rights campaigner Jitka Bezdekova also waded into the debate, calling the site 'abhorrent'. This photo of two girls standing together was also posted on the relatively new Facebook page . A photo grab of the page shows it has attracted nearly 10,000 followers since it first began operating . The Facebook page, which has been labelled 'degrading and dangerous', has gathered thousands of followers . She said: 'This is an abhorrent site and is completely degrading and dangerous for the young girls who find themselves being put on the page. 'They have not given their permission for their photos to be used in this way and despite asking for them to be taken down they are ignored by the people behind the page.' A local police spokesman said: 'We are looking into the matter and if there is a clear case of defamation or breach of privacy we will take action.'","New Facebook page encouraging details of sexual exploits causes anger .

"A British father cheated death when a can of bug spray exploded in his hand, catapulting him through the wall of his first-floor Spanish flat, onto the street five metres below. Daran Cooper had been preparing a meal to celebrate his 48th birthday on Tuesday when he was distracted by a cockroach that his partner Carmen had been trying to kill with the spray. Taking the can from Carmen, Daran began spraying the bug, when the explosion happened. Lucky to be alive: Daran Cooper recovers in hospital after being treated for a broken arm and cuts to his head . Destroyed: Mr Cooper's flat in Torrevieja, with the frame of the balcony wall stripped bare following the blast . Speaking from Torrevieja Hospital, Daran said: 'I started spraying at the cockroach, and some of the gas must have got into the washing machine. 'A moment later, there was the click of the wash cycle, followed by an almighty bang as I flew through where the wall used to be. 'There was glass and all kinds of stuff in the air, but miraculously I stayed conscious all the time, and all I could think of, was that I had to protect my head.' The blast totally ripped out the wall of his partially enclosed balcony, but Carmen escaped unscathed, while their five-year-old son Sebastian was tucked up safely in bed. Daran fell onto the pavement just next to a parked car. 'I’m just glad to be alive,' he added. 'If I’d lost consciousness, I would have died. 'I made sure that my arms and hands took the brunt of the fall, and by sheer luck I was wearing Superman underpants at the time!” His main injury was a bone that went through his elbow, which needed an operation on Wednesday. Daran also suffered a broken wrist, bruising and head wounds that required stitches. Debris: The remains of the wall can be seen strewn across the street beneath the flat . Clear-up: A firefighter inspects the damage to the outside wall of Mr Cooper's apartment . 'It was an incredible escape', said Daran’s father Harry. 'The wall and window were taken out and it could have been so much worse for our son. 'The emergency . services were excellent and they did everything possible for Daran. We’re just happy that he’s alive! It certainly was nothing to do with . him blowing out the candles on his birthday cake!' Investigators have been at the scene, but so far there has been no official explanation for what caused the explosion. One of Daran's neighbours, who lives opposite, said: 'I always park my car beneath that window and, luckily, today I left it a bit further away. 'If I hadn't have done so, then my car would have been completely destroyed.' Investigators initially believed the explosion had been caused by a gas leak, which would have sparked an evacuation of all nearby properties. But fire crew sources think the insecticide reacted in some way with the man's domestic appliances - a fridge and a washing machine - that were close by. The fate of the cockroach is unknown.","Daran Cooper was celebrating his 48th birthday at his flat in Torrevieja .

"Eva Rausing died as a result of the dependant abuse of drugs . For eight weeks after the death  of drug-addicted millionairess Eva Rausing, her husband carried out a bizarre and desperate  charade to convince their servants  she was alive. Tetra Pak heir Hans Rausing banned staff from entering the couple's  squalid 'crack den' bedroom in their otherwise-immaculate £70million London mansion. He said she was suffering a fever and he was taking her temperature three times a day. In fact he was covering her rotting body with 12 layers of clothes, blankets and plastic sealed with industrial tape before covering it in deodorant to mask the smell. By the time police raided the 50-room house in Cadogan Place, Belgravia, 48-year-old Mrs Rausing was so badly decomposed that she had to be identified from a fingerprint and the serial number on her heart pacemaker. The full disturbing details of her death and its aftermath were revealed yesterday at Westminster Coroner's Court. Hans Rausing, 49, one of Britain's richest men, was excused from attending the inquest as he continues to receive treatment for drug addiction and a mental breakdown. He was instead represented by  a phalanx of lawyers and public relations officials, led by the Prime Minister's older brother Alex  Cameron QC. In a statement read to the court, Mr Rausing, an heir to his family's £4.3billion packaging fortune, said the couple's lives had plunged into addiction. 'We both felt that our lives were completely hopeless.' Describing his wife's last moments, he said she slid from their bed with a thump. He found her lying sideways on the floor, her head resting on a pillow. 'I heard her exhale and then she did not move at all. I saw her alive for a few seconds. I went to her and grabbed her hands, and tried to pull her up – I shouted “Eva, Eva, Eva”. I turned her towards me and saw her eyes had dimmed. She had stopped breathing before I reached her. I knew she had died – I was absolutely certain she was dead. 'I sat with her for a period of time then covered her up with a blanket and duvet. I could not look at her. I could not cope with her dying.' The inquest was told Mr Rausing could not face the 'reality of her death' and had little memory of what happened before or afterwards. Eight weeks later, on July 9, he was stopped while driving his red Bristol sports car erratically. Hans Rausing said he sat with the body of his dead wife then covered her up with a blanket and duvet . Hans Rausing told staff that his wife - who lay dead in their home - had a fever and he was taking her temperature twice a day . PC Darren Reynolds discovered him . 'vacant and unsteady' with a warm crack pipe in the footwell between his . legs. Cannabis and a white powder were also found. The officer's suspicions were aroused . further when he discovered a carrier bag full of unopened letters to Mrs . Rausing in the boot. He asked Mr Rausing where his wife was and his eyes 'welled up' before he claimed she was in California. A team of officers discovered the . lower floors of his home were beautifully kept but the three housemaids . revealed they were banned from entering the second floor where the . couple lived. Police discovered it was strewn with . rubbish, swarming with flies and Mr Rausing had barricaded the bedroom . shut with furniture and tape. Inside the master bedroom the bed was . covered with tarpaulin and TVs, including one huge 50in screen. Syringes . and drug paraphernalia were nearby. Describing the scene, PC Reynolds said . he 'could only describe it as looking like a squat' and was immediately . struck by the stench. 'My immediate thoughts were there was something, or someone, decomposing. 'There were items, TVs, all over the floor – it was overwhelming.' Hans Kristian and Eva Rausing, pictured on their wedding day, spent their last years as co-dependant recluses . Officers began removing layers from . the mound of material before uncovering a 'head of blonde hair' and . calling in the murder squad. Mrs Rausing was still clutching her . crack pipe. Her pacemaker had been fitted six years earlier during heart . surgery to repair drug damage and revealed her heart rate shot up to . six times its normal level in her final moments. Experts said she died at around 7.20am on May 7 when her heartbeat leapt to 384 beats per minute. The typical rate was 65. Post-mortem tests found traces of cocaine, heroin and amphetamines and no evidence that she had  been assaulted. Mr Rausing was arrested on  suspicion . of murder but was convicted of preventing her lawful burial and handed a . ten-month  suspended jail term. The inquest heard police have been . unable to discover who  supplied her the drugs and her  husband said she . had 'her own sources'. Hans Rausing's father and grandfather . made billions from building up Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging company . which saw off the  milk bottle. He was brought up in Sweden and moved . to England in 1982 before spending several years travelling in Asia, . where he was first intro- duced to drugs. Hans Kristian Rausing appearing in the dock at West London Magistrates Court, was convicted of preventing the lawful and decent burial of a body . While in rehab he met Eva Kemeny, . whose father Tom was a multi-millionaire executive with Pepsi-Cola, and . they were married in 1992. They were teetotal for several years until Eva drank a glass of champagne to celebrate the eve of the new Millennium. Mr Rausing said they had a 'very close . relationship' and 'loved each other very deeply' but relapsed into a . sordid life of drug abuse, retreating to their bedroom as their . addictions deepened. In April, she travelled to Malibu to . attend a rehab clinic for cocaine abuse but was thrown out after she was . caught with a secret stash of valium pills. The last time her housemaids saw her alive was when she returned on April 29. Mr Rausing said her health began to decline and he noticed she was not taking care of herself. Westminster Coroner's Court heard how the husband had failed to report the death of his wife and kept her body under duvets . He believed the battery on her pacemaker had failed and she did not bother returning to Harley Street to have it fixed.

"No longer, it seems, is just one honeymoon location enough. ‘Dual’ honeymoons – when you travel to more than on location during your post nuptial break – are fast becoming the latest and most desirable way to show your wife you care. The latest celebrity couple to split their honeymoon along geographical lines is Rebecca Adlington and fellow swimmer Harry Needs. Twos company: Rebecca and Harry Needs stand outside the Universal Studios sign in Orlando, Florida . After tying the knot in August at The Ashes near Leek in Staffordshire, the couple started their romantic getaway in Rome in Italy before flying to Orlando, Florida. In a series of photographs published on Instagram and Twitter the couple documented what fun they had during the  trip. When in Rome Olympic swimmer’s husband tweeted a series of three pictures of the couple enjoying an evening out with the caption 'Roma #honeymoon' Soaking up some sun in Italy the newly weds pose in front of the sea for a snap for Instagram . When in Rome! The couple pull faces while enjoying an evening out during the first leg of their honeymoon . Rebecca put a shot of her and Harry with the sea behind them up on Instagram with the caption ‘Our Italian adventure #honeymoon’. Obviously keen to take in the sights, there is a picture of them in front of the Altare della Patria - also known as the Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II - in the busy Piazza Venezia. They also visited the Vatican, the Pantheon and walked around the city’s famous Roman ruins. Part two: Rebecca flew to Disney World Florida in Orlando to enjoy the second week of her honeymoon . Never scared of making a splash, Rebecca laughed and smiled her way down the resort's log flume ride . Next stop – via a Virgin Atlantic flight – was Disney World Resort in Florida, Orlando, where they were joined by fellow swimmer Michael Gunning. Rebecca tweeted, 'Hello Orlando!! So excited to be spending the week here! Great flight with now off to hotel-theme park tomorrow!!' on their arrival. The trio rode on the famous long flume-style ride called Splash Mountain and visited Disney's Animal Kingdom. On one picture she put on Instagram of the ride Rebecca commented, ‘Sums up our trip…. @harryneeds loving life - @michaelgunning1 scared and me laughing/smiling the whole way through!!! #splashmountain #disney’. It's behind you! Mr and Mrs Needs walked around sights including Altare della Patria during their Rome trip . The 25-year-old ex-Olympic champion then posted a picture of her and Harry standing in front of the famous Cinderella Castle  with the caption ‘where dreams come true’. She also found a pair of bridal style Minnie Mouse ears with a veil and posed for a shot in one of the gift shops. 'Couldn't help myself today,' she wrote. 'Was a Disney bride!' Lastly, Harry and Rebecca visited Universal Studios, another theme park in Orlando which has – as well as all sorts of rides and attractions – a ‘romantic’ restaurant and pool. The ex Olympic gold medallist looked relaxed while standing in front of ancient Roman ruins in Rome . The time of their life? The couple packed in many different sightseeing locations as well as two continents . The couple could well have visited The Wizarding World of Harry Potter while here. Keen to keep her followers abreast of their movements Rebecca put up a picture of the couple standing happily outside of the Universal sign. She wrote underneath, ‘Such an amazing day at Universal!!!!!!’ 'Couldn't help myself today.... Was a Disney bride!' Rebecca wrote  after trying on bunny ears in Disney World . To fuel duel honeymoon bookings, new websites are popping up every day that are designed to help tailor your honeymoon to more than one location. Honeymoondreams advertises a 'multi-centre' honeymoon intended to be 'an ideal compromise between you and your partner. You may love relaxing on a beach, while your other half likes to discover the local culture.' The 25 year old wore a bright two piece bikini while relaxing by a pool during her honeymoon in Italy . Likewise Blacktomato has options ready in case 'one draw dropping luxury destination just isn't enough'.

"With a cry of 'O zapft is' Munich's mayor Dieter Reiter tapped the first keg of 2014's Oktoberfest festivities in the Bavarian capital of Munich where 6.4 million revellers are expected over the next 16 days. The annual beer festival's tents were packed well before lunchtime on Saturday as thousands of locals and tourists took part in a tradition that's taken place in some form since 1810, and inspired imitations the world over. Sellers of traditional lederhosen and dirndls did a roaring trade in the lead-up with a majority of first-day festival goers looking the part. The thousands who managed to gain entry on the opening day were undeterred by an average 2.58 per cent hike in the price of beer that this year exceeds the 10 Euro mark in some halls. In seven of the festival's main tents in its heartland in Munich, punters will part with at least the equivalent of £8 for a glass measuring 1.76 UK pints, of which two out of three won't be filled properly according to an official on duty last year. The annual festival brings hundreds of millions to the local economy, with an estimated £252m flowing at the venues themselves, while hotels and hostels get a boost of more than £230m for their hugely inflated room rates.

"An inventive photographer captured this collection of stunning images that show highways in the night sky. Kevin Cooley used a long-exposure lens to take these images of the light trails left by aircraft in the skies over the U.S. His long-exposure technique does not just capture the trail of light left behind the planes as they pass over head, but also the eerie stillness of the landscapes they illuminate.

"A Russian fisherman who expected nothing more than a haul of tench and carp ended up catching a 4,000-year-old pagan god statue from the bottom of a riverbed. Local archaeologists have hailed Siberian Nikolay Tarasov's finding as 'unique and amazing' as well as 'probably worth its weight in gold'. Mr Tarasov was fishing on a day off from his driving job in the village of Tisul in southern Russia. Not your average catch: Archaeologists hailed the ancient find as 'unique and amazing' and 'worth its weight in gold'. The figurine has almond-shaped eyes, a large mouth with full lips, and a ferocious facial expression . He said: 'I used a net, rather than a line, and was hauling it in when I felt the net go heavy and thought it had snagged on a rock. The pagan god 12in (30cm) long, 2in (5cm) wide and carved from bone . 'I pulled it in by getting my pal to help and was going to chuck it away. But then I stopped when I saw it was a stone with a face. 'I washed the thing in the river - and realised it was a statuette.' The figurine has almond-shaped eyes, a large mouth with full lips, and a ferocious facial expression. 'I took it to a local museum. I needed to sit down when the experts told me that this object was carved at the very beginning of the Bronze Age. 'On the reverse side on the head the carver etched plaited hair. Below the plait there are lines looking like fish scales. The people I showed it to quite literally jumped for joy. 'I suspected it might be a couple of hundred years old, but had not considered it might by older,' he told The Siberian Times. The curators of the museum passed on the find to experts in the city of Kemerovo, where they dated it at more than 4,000-years-old, and explained it had been carved in horn which later fossilised. The statuette is 12in (30cm) long and 2in (5cm) wide. Marina Banschikova, director of Tisul History Museum: 'Quite likely, it shows a pagan god. 'Items from this period are very rare, the only things we have dated approximately to the same age are a stone necklace and two charms in the shapes of a bear and a bird. The finding was made in a lake in the village of Tisul in southern Russia (marked) 'Nikolay has given us this treasure free of charge. He didn’t ask for any kind of compensation - though it is probably worth more than if it was a gold statue. 'Now we have to devote more time studying his find which is both unique and amazing.' The area around Tisul is known to have been inhabited in ancient times. Currently the theories are that the statuette belonged to the Okunev or Samus cultures. Okunev culture was a Bronze Age society dated to the first half of the 2nd millennium BC in Minusinsk Hollow of southern Siberia. To sell it and make profit however was never on the mind of Mr Tarasov, who said: 'People should see it, and learn the history of their region. It is quite clearly precious for the museums of any country.' The Bronze Age was a period characterised by the use of bronze, early forms of writing, and other early developments of urban civilization. It is the second period of the three-age 'Stone-Bronze-Iron' system for classifying and studying ancient societies. The Bronze Age was a time of intensive metal use and of developing trade networks and began around 4,000 years ago. In order to make bronze, tin is mined and smelted separately, then added to molten copper to make a bronze alloy. The overall period is characterised by . the adoption of bronze in many regions, though the place and time . of the introduction and development of such technology was not simultaneous. Worldwide, the Bronze Age generally . followed the Neolithic period, but in some parts of the world, the . Copper Age is sandwiched between the Neolithic and Bronze Age. The Altai Mountains, in what is now southern Russia and central Mongolia, have been identified as the point of origin of a cultural moment called the Seima-Turbino Phenomenon. It's believed that climate change in the region around 2000BC and the following ecological, economic and political changes triggered a rapid and mass migration westward into northeast Europe, eastward into China and southward into Vietnam and Thailand across a frontier of some 4,000 miles. This migration took place in just five to six generations and led to people from Finland in the west to Thailand in the east employing the same bronze making technology and, in some areas, horse breeding and riding.","Siberian Nikolay Tarasov, 53, wants no .

"A neighbour from hell with 80 criminal convictions has been evicted from her house after leaving it in such a squalid state it will be months before it is habitable again. The walls may still be standing but inside the two-bedroom property police officers found holes in the walls and ceiling, carpets pulled up and wallpaper ripped off.

"Finland’s largest airline is asking customers to fry with them as it becomes the latest carrier to use a mix of recycled cooking oil and jet fuel to power a long-distance flight. Finnair is using the biofuel to drive the engines of an Airbus A330 aircraft on a nine-hour demonstration flight from Helsinki to New York on Tuesday. It will be the airline’s inaugural transatlantic flight using a fuel mix containing the type of oil used to fry fish, chips or chicken. Come fry with me: Finnair is using recycled cooking oil to power a flight from Helsinki to New York . Finnair said it will be able to reduce its net carbon dioxide emission by 50 to 80 per cent by switching to a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly fuel source. But biofuel is more than twice the price of conventionally produced jet fuel and it is too costly for any airline to operate with it exclusively. Tuesday’s flight coincides with the opening day of the UN Climate Summit in New York. Kati Ihamaki, Finnair’s vice-president of sustainable development, said: ‘The UN Climate Summit is an important gathering to fight climate change, and we wanted to take this opportunity to highlight the climate benefits of more widespread adoption of environmentally sustainable biofuels in aviation. Let's fry away: KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has been using cooking-oil-based fuel on flights in Europe since 2011 . Finnair's biofuel mixture is being provided by SkyNRG Nordic, a joint venture between SkyNRG and Statoil Aviation, and is partly manufactured with cooking oil from restaurants. Finnair isn’t breaking new ground with its Helsinki-to-New York flight, however. It first flew with biofuel in 2011 and several airlines have been using the mixture for years. But Finnair said it is hoping to establish a biofuel hub with its partners to develop the supply chain and lower the cost of sustainable biofuel while reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.","Finland's largest airline is using the biofuel to power an Airbus A330 .

"Residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build what would be Britain's largest Muslim cemetery on rural land. The proposed 11-acre site in Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull, West Midlands, would include a total of 11,000 graves for followers of Islam. Currently, the largest Muslim-only cemetery in the UK is in Ilford, Essex, which has 5,000 plots. Residents living in a picturesque rural village have hit out at controversial plans to build what would be Britain's largest Muslim cemetery on rural land . It means the development - which would include 95 parking spaces for visitors - will become the country's biggest if it gets the green light. The graveyard would be able to comply fully with Sharia law which states Muslims are traditionally buried in their own section of land, next to others of the same faith. Islamic law also stipulates a method of bathing and shrouding the bodies before being buried with their heads facing towards Mecca. Today, residents of the village - which has a population of just 613 - criticised the move and said questioned the need for the cemetery. It would mean the facility could eventually hold over 18 times as many people as currently live in the village itself. Locals are also objecting the plans for the cemetery based on concerns surrounding the impact it will have on traffic as well as the surrounding greenbelt land. Grandfather-of-four Gerry Chauke, 55, said: 'There is ample room for graves to accommodate the local population here.' Map shows the proposed sites for 4,000 graves and another 7,000 nearby, close to Solihull in West Midlands . The proposed 11-acre site in Catherine-de-Barnes, near Solihull, West Midlands, would include a total of 11,000 graves for followers of Islam . Plans for a large plot of 4,000 graves was made in January and received 160 objections and 180 submissions of support were sent to Solihull Council. The application was originally withdrawn amid the storm of protest. But in July the plans were resubmitted and the second application for an adjacent Muslim-only cemetery was received by the authority this week. Both applications are due to go before the planning committee next month. Conservative councillor Alison Rolf, for the Bickenhill ward of Solihull, said: 'My main concern is that they are building on the greenbelt land. 'When the first application was taken down local people were delighted that it had gone away, but it's come back with very little adjustment. 'I understand people's frustrations.' Residents say the plans, if given the go ahead will have an impact on the roads in the surrounding area . One representative for the Catherine-de-Barnes Residents' Association who has lived in the area for 31 years, but did not want to be named, said: 'There's no need for it. 'The borough has sufficient provision for the next 20 years.' Leader of Solihull Council, Conservative councillor Bob Sleigh, said he also agreed the needs of local people could already be met at the borough's current plots. He said: 'There is no need for this extra site in Solihull. We have identified our population need and made provision for that. 'This is an extremely large proposal. 'Obviously people are concerned about the scale of the development and its threat to greenbelt land around Catherine-de-Barnes. 'I don't believe the case has been made to overcome the very special measures which apply to greenbelt land.' The development - which would include 95 parking spaces for visitors - will become the country's biggest if it gets the green light . Both cemeteries - which were submitted by different applicants but through the same agent, Cemetery Development Services - have received backing from the Muslim community in Solihull, who said there was a desperate need for more burial spaces. Funeral director Mohammed Khalil, of Birmingham-based ZUQ Funeral Services, said even 11,000 burial plots would barely provide enough space for the next 50 years. He said: 'The local Muslim population is growing rapidly, but the cemetery Muslims use is mostly Handsworth which is nearly full. 'Birmingham Council are making some provision but we still need more in the vicinity of the population. 'Don't forget, the people who came here in the 1950s and 1960s are now old and dying fast. 'Before, they used to send people back home to their families in Pakistan and Bangladesh. 'But apparently now all their families are here and they have no-one back home. 'They are saying 'this is our country now.' 'We are living here and dying here so we should be buried here.'","11-acre site near Solihull could include 11,000 graves for followers of Islam .

"The bargain beaches of Bali lead Cape Town and Sri Lanka are the best value winter sun escapes for Britons this year, according to a new survey. Despite price swings for tourists in many countries, the Indonesian island province and South Africa's 'Mother City' have remained steady over the past 12 months, according to the annual Post Office Travel Money survey. A basket of 10 items, including an evening meal for two, will cost just £40 in Bali this winter, a nine per cent drop due to the weak Indonesian rupiah, the study of long-haul destinations showed. Scroll down for video . Bali's pristine beach areas boast the best value for tourists, says the Post Office Travel Money survey . Kuta Beach in Bali, which topped the survey of best long-haul winter escapes ahead of Cape Town . The items surveyed, also including cup of filter coffee, bottle of local lager, can or bottle of Coca-Cola, glass of wine, cocktail at a bar, a chocolate bar, bottle of mineral water, sun cream from a supermarket and insect repellent, cost £47 in Cape Town where the South African rand has fallen. In Sri Lanka, which has moved up to third from fifth place in the same survey last year, the same items cost just under £50. These figures are less than a third of the most expensive locations with the 10 items costing £161 in Dubai, where prices have skyrocketed to make it the most expensive of the 34 destinations reviewed. Dubai prices for the items have risen 64 per cent since last year while Singapore (£155), Auckland in New Zealand (£133) and Muscat in Oman (£126) are also at the priciest end of the spectrum. Table Mountain overlooks Blouberg beach in Cape Town, number two on the tourism affordability scale . 1 Bali, Indonesia - £40 (-9%) 2 Cape Town, South Africa - £47 (-6%) 3 Sri Lanka (various) - £50 (-9%) 4 Kololi, Gambia - £51.33 (-26%) 5 Phuket, Thailand - £54.90 (+1%) 6 Tamarindo, Costa Rica - £56.19 (-47%) 7 Mombasa, Kenya - £65.23 (0%) 8 Tokyo, Japan - £65.98 (-36%) 9 Mauritius (various) - £72.66 (-24%) 10 Tobago (various) - £71.68 (-9%) 1 Jumeirah, Dubai - £160.61 (+64%) 2 Singapore - £155.34 (+29%) 3 Auckland, New Zealand - £133 (+10%) 4 Muscat, Oman - £126 (£48%) 5 English Harbour, Antigua - £117.53 (+48%) 6 Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt - £117.32 (0%) 7 Penang, Malaysia - £115.85 (+35%) 8 Miami, USA - £114.33 (+18%) 9 Darwin, Australia - £109.47 (-12%) 10 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - £104.68 (+17%) Source: Post Office Bestsellers and Fastest Growing Currencies Report (September 2014) Sri Lanka has moved from fifth to third in the poll . While a three-course meal for two with a bottle of wine was just £27 in Bali, it would set a couple back nearly £114 in Singapore and more than £99 in Dubai. The survey, in conjunction with holiday company Travelbag, showed that in the last 12 months the long-haul destinations where the local currency has fallen most against the pound were Gambia, South Africa, Jamaica and Japan. Prices in resorts have fallen the most in Costa Rica, followed by Japan, Gambia, Mauritius and China. But as well as the hike in costs in Dubai, prices have gone up in a number of other resorts, with hefty increases in Antigua (up 48 per cent), Muscat (up 48 per cent) and Vietnam (up 39 per cent). Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'It all adds up to a polarised picture for UK holidaymakers. On the one hand there are great savings to be made in popular long haul resorts and tourists will be 'quids in'. 'On the other, people who make the wrong destination choice could fall victim to much increased resort prices and find themselves out of pocket.' Former best value destination Sri Lanka recorded a nine per cent fall in prices due to a drop in prices in local resort areas. The strength of the pound sees the introduction of four new entrants in  the Long Haul Report top 10, with Tokyo moving to eighth, Mauritius to ninth and Tobago, the cheapest of six Caribbean islands surveyed at £72, sneaking into the top 10. Perhaps the bargain of the year is Tamarindo in Costa Rica, where tourist staples have almost halved since 2013 to be £56. Travelbag's Rianne Ojeh said there has been a significant rise in demand for destinations such as Sri Lanka, Mauritius and St Lucia, 'where sterling is strong and the cost of living is low'. 'The biggest increase year-on year is for Japan as consumers are recognising that the country is now much better value than in recent years,' Ojeh said. 'Rising prices in Vietnam, Antigua and Dubai haven't yet impacted on demand as we have great value packages for these destinations.'

"A disgruntled commuter has hit back at delays on First Capital Connect trains by disfiguring a picture of the group CEO's face every time his service is late. Oli Beale has decided to vent his frustration at the company's late-running services by altering an image of CEO Tim O'Toole - who is the boss of parent company First Group. He then posts his surreal and bizarre creations to a Tumblr blog called Tim's Faces. Oli Beale has hit out at delays on First Capital Connect trains by altering a picture of the group CEO Tim O'Toole every time his service is late. Above is Mr O'Toole, who is head of parent group First, as he looks usually and his face superimposed onto that of EastEnders actress Pam St. Clement as character Pat Butcher . Mr Beale then posts the images on to his Tumblr blog - which is called Tim's Faces. In one (left) the CEO's head has evidently been squashed and right, he appears with no hair . In one of the images (left) the CEO's facial features have been removed - with rather disconcerting results - while in another Mr O'Toole's face is plastered all over his suit . Mr Beale also Photoshopped Mr O'Toole on to the front page of Hello! Magazine (left) and took a picture of his face merged with the bottom half of the Queen's head as it appears on a bank note . In most of the posts, Mr Beale also includes which service - and how long it was delayed - under the image. The blog already contains hundreds of altered images and GIFs - including one of the CEO transformed in to Pat Butcher, another of him on the front cover of Hello! magazine and even one of Mr O'Toole looking very like singer Susan Boyle. On the blog, Mr Beale - who works in marketing - explains why he decided to take the unique approach to making a complaint about the company. In a post which is addressed to the CEO, Mr Beale writes: 'Every time my train is delayed I’m going to edit your face. Why? Because you are the CEO of ‘First’ and therefore ultimately responsible for the train line ‘First Capital Connect.’ I want you to understand that little delays matter. 'It’s an awful train line, Tim. It really is. Don’t get me wrong, Tim there have been times I’ve seriously questioned myself over this. I’m aware that this is not normal behaviour. Mr O'Toole also appears as Homer Simpson on the blog (left) and in another his head is replaced by a shrimp . The CEO's face is turned upside down (left) and in another he has green skin like the Incredible Hulk and 'I love train' written on his forehead . In another (left) the CEO has bulging eyes and a mustache, while in another he sports a rather fat-looking lip . Mr Beale includes some Gifs in his collection - such as this one of the CEO looking like Space Invaders . 'I have to hide my screen from other commuters while I’m doing ‘my work’.  Once I spent two hours making you a little suit made out of repeating patterns of your face. You have to ask yourself some serious questions when you find yourself doing a thing like that. 'The thing is, Tim, it helps me get through the stress of the journey. Editing your face is very cathartic.' He continues: 'So, what’s my beef with First Capital Connect? To start with, the trains are pretty rubbish. You have to admit. Old. Knackered. A bit smelly. There is NEVER a seat on the way home after work and sometimes there isn’t one on the way in. Have you ever stood up from London to Brighton, Tim? Mr O'Toole transformed into a fist (left) and looking very like 'hot convict' Jeremy Meeks (right) The CEO's features on the face of terrifying clown IT (left) while his eyes have been put on the face of a brown Labrador in a suit (right) Mr O'Toole's face replaced with an egg (left) and his eyes and mouth Photoshopped on a bathing woman covered head to toe in soap suds .

Women fainting on the “dark stretch” between Horley and Croydon. I’ve seen vomit in Balcombe and smelt some of the finest B.O. in Sussex. 'However, the thing I’m going to focus all my baffling attention on is the fact that every train is delayed. You may well have ruddy-faced analysts telling you that: “We’re actually running a service with 79% of trains running on time.” But take it from me. A man at the fried-chicken smelling coal-face. Almost every single train to and from work is delayed.' In response, Tim O'Toole said today: 'This is definitely one of the most creative complaints that I've seen and Oli’s work is an improvement on my photo!

'But there's a serious point here: . trains on this section of the route are frequently held up in the area . around London Bridge and I'm sorry that Oli and others get delayed . because of this. 'It's . mostly because we have to share tracks around the station with many . other routes and operators, and there is plenty of improvement work . going on in the area for the Thameslink Programme. 'This . will result in a brand new station and dedicated train tracks and . platforms for Thameslink services and there will be a fleet of new, . longer, trains as well from 2016 which we've been developing with the .

"A US teenager and her family have been offered a free trip to Kenya after their holiday in the African country was ruined when she was mistaken for a British terrorism suspect known as the ‘White Widow’. Kenya’s government said the 15-year-old girl was 'harassed by police' in Mlolongo, near the capital of Nairobi, 'on accusations of looking like' Samantha Lewthwaite. The 30-year-old woman, who was born in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, and moved to Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire as a teenager, is subject to an Interpol Red Notice as one of the world’s most wanted fugitives. Free trip: The 30-year-old was offered a holiday to Kenya by way of an apology . 'White Widow': Samantha Lewthwaite is one of the most wanted terrorism suspects in the world . To make amends, embarrassed Kenyan government officials have offered an all-expenses-paid holiday to the family and ordered an investigation into the incident. Lewthwaite was married to Germaine Lindsay, one of four Islamist suicide bombers who killed 52 people in the 7/7 bombings on the London Underground and a bus in 2005. The mother of four has been on the run from international authorities for nearly three years after she was charged in December 2011 with plotting a bombing campaign across Kenya. The Muslim convert has been linked to the Somali Islamic extremist group al-Shabab, which is responsible for a string of deadly attacks in Kenya, including the assault on a Nairobi shopping mall that left at least 67 people dead a year ago. There has been no confirmed sighting of Lewthwaite since she escaped from Kenyan police in Mombasa in 2011, reportedly using a false South African passport and alias. Wanted: Interpol has issued a Red Notice for Samantha Lewthwaite, who is accused of plotting attacks . She is wanted in Kenya on charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit a felony. Last month, Kenyan detectives who are hunting her admitted the trail had gone cold and they believe she has undergone plastic surgery to evade capture. In a statement, police chief inspector Abednego Kilonzo said she had constantly changed her appearance, name and location while on the run.","Government officials said the teenager was 'harassed by police' near Nairobi .

"Marcus Wareing said the poor hygiene report was due to a 'technicality'. He is appealing against the rating . He may be a two-star Michelin chef, but Marcus Wareing has scored just one out of five for kitchen hygiene by failing a routine inspection. The chef, who runs a restaurant at London’s five-star Berkeley Hotel, where diners are charged £115 for a dinner tasting menu, was criticised over the presence of fruit flies, warned of E.coli risks and told to buy a new vacuum-packing machine. Inspectors said pest control experts should be called in to control a ‘fly infestation’. The damning report three weeks ago, giving him just one star out of a possible five, represented a severe setback for Wareing, 43. He cooked for the Queen on her 80th birthday and his withering judgments on aspiring chefs have made him the star of the BBC’s Great British Menu series. But last night the chef hit back, insisting the Westminster City Council report highlighted a ‘technicality’ and that he would appeal against the rating. The Lancashire-born chef told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It is something that happened and we put it right. ‘We simply needed a vacuum-packing machine as we only had one. The FSA [Food Standards Agency] Guidance recommends two. We weren’t aware the regulations had changed last year. It was a technicality and we hold our hands up to it and purchased the new machine within a week.’ He added: ‘To go from five stars to one star just for that seems too radical, given my 25 years of kitchen experience. ‘If they were taking Michelin stars away like this, well, it’s quite scary. My kitchen is a bloody Rolls-Royce that has customers in it, on my chef’s table, daily. ‘Food safety, and the health of my team and customers, is not something I would knowingly jeopardise.’ A one-star rating translates as ‘major improvement necessary’ and represents a sharp decline in standards since the restaurant’s previous inspection in 2011, when it earned an exemplary five-star rating. Inspectors who visited the Marcus Wareing restaurant on June 5 cited ‘cross-contamination risks’ after seeing a vacuum-packing machine in the kitchen being used for both raw and cooked foods. The report said such equipment ‘cannot be effectively cleaned and disinfected in between use to eliminate the risks associated with pathogens such as E.coli’. Mr Waering has been told that pest control experts should be called to the five-star Berkeley Hotel to control the kitchen's 'fly infestation' Inspectors also noted the presence of ‘fruit flies in the ground kitchen’ and recommended management ‘seek the services of a qualified pest control technician’, as well as a lack of anti-bacterial soap, and staff washing their hands without soap. Embarrassingly, inspectors noted that at the time of their visit ‘raw fish was stored above cooked crab in the fish fridge’, one of the most basic health risks catering students are warned to avoid. The council inspectors also said  it ‘was very disappointing to note that the record-keeping had ceased since April 2013’. James Armitage, the council’s food safety manager, said: ‘Since the inspection we have revisited the restaurant to check compliance with the notice. From our last visit they had complied with the notice and we believe they are already well on the way to regaining their five stars.’ In 2006, Great British Menu viewers chose Wareing to cook his dessert of egg custard tart with Garibaldi biscuits for the Queen’s 80th birthday banquet.","53-year-old chef runs restaurant at London's five-star Berkeley Hotel .

Abe, 27, is an adrenaline junkie from San Francisco whose job includes going on epic adventures on slopes, surf and in the sky, and capturing them for others to envy on his camera. As part of his role as a senior production artist for GoPro, Abe takes incredible images of himself and others living it up, from surfing the world's finest breaks to skiing the resorts of France, Chile and New Zealand. No wonder he considers this the 'perfect' job. It helps that he's a bit impressive at all of these things, with some shots including him mid backflip on the snow or grinding on his skis. Oh, and he also mountain bikes and climbs, but just as much he enjoys capturing the sunset after a big day's action.

"A commuter who was taken ill on a packed train while five months pregnant was forced to sit on the floor because none of her fellow passengers would give up their seats. Victoria Poskitt, 40, has hit out at train bosses for not allowing her to sit in first class after she felt woozy on a morning service from Surbiton in south west London to Waterloo. She said rail firm South West Trains - which does grant 'pregnancy passes' to women but only if they are more than 20 weeks pregnant and have a season ticket - told her 'policy is policy' and she should have found a guard or pulled the emergency cord if she felt ill. Baby on board: Fellow passengers did not give up their seat when Victoria Poskitt, 40, felt woozy on a crowded commuter train. She also attacked South West Trains for not giving her a pass to sit in first class instead . Mrs Poskitt, who works as the head of communications at the teachers' union the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, attacked the incivility of her fellow passengers in an interview with the Evening Standard. 'Simple human decency should have prevailed,' she said. She added: 'I thought [South West Trains] might be willing to make an exception, particularly after I told them about what happened, but after conversations with various managers they’ve flatly said ""no"", saying policy is policy. Anger: Mrs Poskitt said 'simple human decency should have prevailed' 'I don’t honestly know [what to do next]. I keep trying with South West Trains, I’m throwing myself at their mercy because they could make all the difference to the last few months of my pregnancy.' Over the last 12 months South West Trains has handed out 575 upgrade tickets to pregnant women. They allow the women to sit in first class, but because Mrs Poskitt does not have a season ticket as she only works in central London three days a week, she was not eligible for one. A spokesman for the South West Trains Network Rail Alliance told MailOnline: 'We are sorry to hear that Ms Poskitt felt unwell recently on one of our services. 'We have the most extensive upgrade scheme of any rail operator to help our customers who are expecting a baby. This provides first class upgrades to women travelling with valid weekly, monthly or annual South West Trains season tickets whenever standard class seating is not available. It covers pregnant women who are within 20 weeks of their due delivery date. 'For customers who travel less frequently, we have priority seats available on our services similar to the system on the London Underground. 'We also provide mums-to-be with badges to highlight that they should be given a seat whenever possible and we have offered this to Ms Poskitt. 'As on other forms of transport, our experience is that fellow passengers will give up their seat for mums-to-be and other customers such as elderly people and we are sorry and surprised this did not happen.' MailOnline contacted Mrs Poskitt but she was unavailable to comment further.","Victoria Poskitt, 40, was taken ill on a crowded train from Surbiton, London .

Filmed in Norway at the weekend, the entrancing 37-second footage shows green lights dancing and flashing across the sky. Stunning display: The video of the Northern Lights was captured in Norway . The varying green hues of the Aurora Borealis are both captivating and mysterious as they dance majestically through the sky. The latest Northern Lights display was created after a solar blast on Friday, September 12. As a result of the blast a large amount of clouds, which were made up of magnetically charged particles, were pushed towards Earth. Although green was the primary colour during this recent Northern Lights display in Norway, varying colours such as pinks, reds, blues and yellows are also frequently visible during displays. Magnetic green curtains: The attractive green waves almost resemble curtains as they dance in the sky . The colours are created during a process known as a coronal mass ejection which is a massive burst of solar wind and magnetic fields. There are two types of Aurora - Aurora Borealis, which means ‘dawn of the north’, and Aurora Australis’, known as ‘dawn of the south.’ They are caused when electrically charged particles from the sun enter the Earth’s atmosphere. These so-called geomagnetic storms occur when a solar wind or cloud of magnetic field hits the Earth’s magnetic field. Usually the charged particles from the sun are deflected by the Earth’s magnetic field, but some do manage to enter the atmosphere and collide with gas particles. These collisions emit light. Stunning: The Northern Lights look like a natural fireworks display . As a result, Aurora is most common around the magnetic poles and is most often seen in areas with little light pollution. Auroral displays appear in many colours although pale green and pink are the most common. Shades of red, yellow, green, blue, and violet have also been reported. The common, greenish-yellow colour is caused by colliding oxygen molecules approximately 60 miles (96km) above Earth. Rare, red auroras are produced by oxygen molecules situated much higher up, at around 200 miles (321km). Nitrogen produces blue or purplish-red aurora.","Spectacular Aurora Borealis captured in amazing video from Norway .

"The former headmaster of a pricey Florida prep school lost his discrimination case against the school when his daughter decided to brag about the $80,000 deal on Facebook. Patrick Snay was the headmaster of Gulliver Preparatory in Miami  for several years when they decided not to renew his contract in 2010. Snay, now 69, claimed the $30,000- a-year school was discriminating against him based on his age and that they retaliated against his daughter Dana, then a student at the school. Blunder: Dana Snay ruined her dad Patrick Snay's chances of an $80,000 settlement with the school he used to work at when she bragged about the deal on Facebook . Let go: Patrick Snay (left) worked at Gulliver Preparatory for several years when they decided not to renew his contract in 2010. He claimed they discriminated against him based on his age (he is now 69) and won a settlement . Good deal: Gulliver attorneys initially agreed to pay Snay checks of $10,000 in back wages; $60,000 for his attorneys and an $80,000 settlement . In November 2011, the school agreed to settle with Snay, paying checks of $10,000 in back wages, $60,000 to his attorneys and a $80,000 settlement. But Snay never got a dime after Dana boasted about the win on Facebook - violating the deal's confidentiality agreement. 'Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver,' she wrote to her more than 1,200 friends. 'Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT.' That post was seen by current and former Gulliver students, and eventually made its way back to the school's attorneys. Four days after the deal was signed, Gulliver notified Snay that he wouldn't be getting any of the settlement. Mistake: Snay violated the terms of the agreement, however, when he told his daughter about the deal . Whoops: 'Mama and Papa Snay won the case against Gulliver. Gulliver is now officially paying for my vacation to Europe this summer. SUCK IT,' Dana Snay wrote . While Snay initially won an order to enforce the agreement, Gulliver appealed and won the right not to pay in Florida's Third District Court of Appeals yesterday. 'Snay violated the agreement by doing exactly what he had promised not to do,' judge Linda Ann Wells said. 'His daughter then did precisely what the confidentiality agreement was designed to prevent.' As part of the agreement, Snay promised not to tell anyone about the agreement besides his wife. In his deposition, Snay said he felt he needed to tell his daughter because she suffered 'psychological scars' from her time as a student at Gulliver and knew that he was mediating with the school's attorneys. 'We knew what the restrictions were, yet we needed to tell her something,' he said. Snay is now headmaster at $20,000-a-year Riviera Preparatory School in Coral Gables. His daughter is now studying at Boston College, according to her Facebook. Snay can still file a motion for rehearing and appeal to the Florida Supreme Court in the case. Appeal: Gulliver appealed and won the right now to pay Snay the settlement based on Dana's Facebook post.

"A southwest Florida woman will now spend the rest of her life in prison after being found guilty of killing her autistic stepdaughter by gagging her so tightly the little girl became brain dead. Misty Stoddard, 37, blinked away tears after a Sarasota jury took just two and a half hours to convict her of the first-degree murder of 11-year-old Melissa Stoddard on Friday. Melissa died of suffocation in December 2012 after being tied to a wooden plank with her mouth duct-taped shut. She had moved in with her father and his second wife - Misty - just five months earlier to escape her mothers abusive household in North Carolina. Guilty: Misty Stoddard, 37 (left), has been convicted of the first-degree murder of her stepdaughter, Melissa Stoddard, 11 (right), after a jury found she tied the girl to a plywood sex board and taped her mouth shut . Key evidence: The defense claimed the wooden board - seen here from the bottom - Melissa Stoddard was tied to was purchased by her father so that he could practice sadomasochism with his wife . There she had been 'touched' by her brother, with her mother sending Melissa away for protection. The wooden board was propped up in the courtroom near the jury throughout the trial and described as a 'home made torture device', The Herald-Tribune reported. With holes drilled through the plank, the prosecution demonstrated how Melissa would be tied to the board each night. The defense maintained Melissa's father, Kenneth Stoddard, created the board to act out sexual bondage fantasies with his wife. Misty Stoddard said her husband would tie her up and abuse her against her will. She said her DNA was found on the board as a result of the sexual acts. The defense also claimed Melissa was only restrained twice and that it was because she had a tendency to become violent. Misty Stoddard said she was worried what Melissa might do around her newborn child. Melissa's stepmother Misty Stoddard (left) and her biological father, Kenneth Stoddard, have both been charged over the death. Kenneth Stoddard will stand trial on manslaughter charges in August . But the court was told Melissa's body was covered in injuries at the time of her death. There was a black scab on her lower back, likely to have been caused by her attempts to break free from the board, and scars on her lips were consistent with being gagged. 'Parenting is hard and parenting an autistic child is harder. But parents do it every day,' Prosecutor Suzanne O'Donnell said. 'They don't kill their children.' A woman who shared a cell with Stoddard for a few days testified against her, saying she confessed to duct-taping Melissa's mouth shut the night the child was rushed unresponsive to hospital. A teacher at Melissa's school Oak Park School testified that he had notified a state agency anonymously in the weeks leading up to Melissa's death after becoming suspicious over what was happening at home. Tragic: Melissa Stoddard was just 11-years-old when she died. She suffered from autism and loved to swim and sing . Melissa came to school with stitches above her eyebrow, however Misty Stoddard had emailed the school saying she had banged her head. The teacher, Paul Squea, said Melissa had never hurt herself in class so he  filed a child abuse report to the Florida Department of Children and Families' website. Around the same time, a local social worker made an unnanounced visit to the Stoddard home to see why Melissa had been missing weeks of school. Misty Stoddard wouldn't let the woman inside, instead speaking to her on the porch. She had Melissa was out running errands with her father. The social worker did not return to the house. Misty Stoddard breaks into tears as she testifies in her own defense in Sarasota, Florida, this week . With the evidence stacked against, Stoddard's case that she was also a victim of absue and that Melissa's treatment was instigated by her husband did not stand up. She was subsequently found guilty, and first-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence in prison in Florida. She was also convicted of aggravated child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. Kenneth Stoddard has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated battery and tampering with evidence. He is scheduled to go on trial in August. var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 640; p.config.height = 360; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS'); .","Misty Stoddard, 37, has been convicted of the first-degree murder of her stepdaughter, Melissa Stoddard, 11 .

"Chelsea Handler is the queen of late night snark and has made a career out of cheerfully taunting celebrities. But the chat show host, who will bid farewell to her E! show Chelsea Lately in August, admits she is quitting because she is totally fed up of stars. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the statuesque blonde, 39, said: 'To be quite honest I don't really care . about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore. In order . to make that happen I had to just stop doing my show. Straight away. Scroll down for video . Sick of it! Chelsea Handler says that after seven years of taunting celebrities, she's over it- saying: 'I don't care about Justin Bieber and I don't want to talk about him anymore'. The blonde is seen interviewing the teen idol on 2011 . 'I had to stop doing my show - straight away!' Chelsea Handler - seen here hugging Justin Bieber on her show in 2010 . Network buddies: Chelsea Handler is leaving E! home to Keeping Up With The Kardashians. She will film her last show in August . Bieber, 20, has often been on Chelsea . Lately, flirting with Chelsea and prompting her to tell him once: 'I'm . always better when you're here.' And talking about the troubled teen . idol's drink driving arrest in January, she gave him the advice: 'Don't go out. It's . okay to party and have fun and be crazy, but don't hurt other people. You have to do that in the confines of your home. And yeah, I'm all . about that. I've got a party at my house all the time. ... I'm just a . danger to myself, not to others.' Chelsea announced her departure from the E! in May,  instantly being linked with a move to CBS to take over from Craig Ferguson on the Late Late Show. However, Chelsea denied the rumours, saying: 'I've . had seven years of being on the show but I was just kinda over it and . tired and I have a really proper new exciting project which will be . announced in the next two weeks which I'm super happy about. 'I'm . excited more than anything about that. 'I'm not doing CBS Late Late. Anything being rumoured is not what I'm doing. I'm going to do a show. It will be a refresh situation, a little bit more mindful and a little . bit more interesting for me and my viewers.' Despite being in a Hollywood clique - and highly protective of friends who include A listers Jennifer Aniston, Cameron Diaz and Reese Witherspoon - Chelsea said she was exhausted of being made to cover the shenanigans that surround the Kardashians. Even though she is on the same network as Keeping Up With The Kardashians - and Khloe stood in for her while she was away in April - she said: 'I think if you participate in the celebrity world . then you don't really have a choice but to be involved in the drama. 'You . end up getting so into the mix that it changes the topics of the day. You can sit around and complain about all that s**t and the Kardashians . all day but if you're participating in it then what can you do?

Enough is enough: Kris Jenner appears on Chelsea Lately - while Khloe Kardashian even stood in for Chelsea when the host was away in April . Just like college: Chelsea, seen with her sidekick Chuy Bravo, said she was 'glad I went' Currently on tour with a show based on . her New York Times bestseller Uganda Be Kidding Me, Chelsea plans to . take some well deserved R&R when the tour finishes.

'I want to talk to people who have changed the course . of the world. Inventors, invaders and people who have been doing . exciting stuff.' E! told Variety the last month of Chelsea Lately would feature special guests and special episodes. And as ever Chelsea had a sense of humour as she announced the end of the show, saying: 'I . myself am more surprised than anyone that I was able to hold down a job . for seven years, and it was a fantastic seven years. 'I will always look back at my time on E! as most people look back at their time in college. I’m glad I went.' The show will be replaced by a new, longer episode of E!'s entertainment news.

"Middle aged women who regularly do aerobics, Zumba or step classes are protecting themselves against breast cancer, research shows. Doing half an hour’s vigorous activity a day – including squash or a spinning class – reduces the risk by a fifth. Scientists also found that obese women are over 50 per cent more likely to develop the illness than those who are slim. Women who did three hours of vigorous physical activity a week were found to be at 21 per cent lower risk than those who did little or no exercise . Around one in eight women in the UK eventually get breast cancer – around 50,500 a year – but there is growing evidence that a healthy lifestyle can hugely lower this risk. Researchers at Oxford University spent three years following 126,000 women who had been through the menopause, and recorded whether they developed the disease. They also filled in detailed questionnaires about how often they exercised, their weight, diet and drinking and smoking habits. Women who did three hours of vigorous physical activity a week were found to be at 21 per cent lower risk than those who did little or no exercise. This includes intensive gym classes such as spinning or dance workouts – but not gentle jogging, walking or cycling. And women with the highest body fat were 55 per cent more likely to have developed the illness than those who were slim. Scientists have known for some time that being overweight or obese increases a woman’s risk of breast cancer. They think that fat cells increase levels of the hormone oestrogen, which encourages the growth of tumours. But the Oxford team suspect that exercise may provide greater benefits in protecting against cancer, aside from simply preventing weight gain. One theory is that intensive physical activity further lowers the amount of oestrogen. Figures show that fewer than half of women meet the NHS’s recommended exercise guidelines of at least two-and-a-half hours a week . A breast cancer drug rejected by the NHS rationing body can extend survival times by five months, a study has revealed. Eribulin could benefit up to 1,200 British women a year – but was turned down by NICE in 2012 because of a lack of evidence. However a study involving 1,800 women found it increased survival time by three months for those with a type of breast cancer known as HER2 negative. And for women with another form called triple negative, the average survival time increased by five months, scientists at Leeds University found. The drug – which costs many thousands of pounds a year – is given as an injection at the same time as women have chemotherapy. The findings will be presented at the National Cancer Research Institute Conference in Liverpool today, and have been hailed as ‘encouraging’. Campaigners hope the research will prompt NICE to re-assess whether the drug could be given to patients on the NHS. Professor Tim Key, a Cancer Research UK scientist from the cancer epidemiology unit at Oxford University, said: ‘What’s really interesting about this study is that [reduction in breast cancer risk] does not appear to be solely due to the most active women being slimmer, suggesting that there may be some more direct benefits of exercise for women of all sizes. 'We don’t yet know exactly how physical activity reduces risk ... but some small studies suggest that it could be linked to the impact on hormone levels in the body.’ He said that more research was needed to look at the link between women’s hormone levels and the apparent prevention of cancer. Women who are slim and fit in middle age have probably been so for most of their lives, so will have been experiencing any potential cancer-protecting benefits for years. But Professor Key said that taking up exercise or losing weight in middle age could still help prevent the illness. Figures show that fewer than half of women meet the NHS’s recommended exercise guidelines of at least two-and-a-half hours a week. But Alison Cox, head of cancer prevention at Cancer Research UK, said this study ‘confirms that the benefits of staying active go beyond just burning calories’.","Healthy lifestyle can hugely lower the risk of developing breast cancer .

"Rebecca Hough, pictured with her son, Max, was told by the swimming pool manager to stop breastfeeding her son . Swimming pool staff told a mother to stop breastfeeding in case her baby vomited into the water. Rebecca Hough was swimming with 10-month-old Max in Liskeard, Cornwall, when he became hungry - so she got out of the pool, moved a few steps away and began feeding him. But the 23-year-old said she was told to retreat further to the changing rooms and not come back for half an hour in case Max was sick. Ms Hough, from Torpoint, Cornwall, . complained the intervention by a manager at the Lux Park Leisure Centre . left her feeling angry and embarrassed. 'He's . a breast fed baby and always has been,' she said. 'I got in the pool . and he was a bit unsettled, so I decided to give him a really quick . feed, as more of a comfort thing than anything else, rather than a full . feed. 'I went to the side of . the pool and up some steps away from the pool. I noticed the lifeguard . go onto his walky talkie, and then a manager came out to speak to me. 'They told me I would have to leave and not come back until the milk had digested. 'The pool wasn't busy and I wasn't showing off my boobs, but they asked me to sit in the changing rooms. 'I just said it was fine, but I was a bit embarrassed and when I left and got home I started to get a bit angry.' The Equality Act 2010 makes it illegal to discriminate against a woman for breastfeeding in a public place. The manager involved has since written to apologise to Ms Hough, who lives with her partner Chris Conn, 32, a diving instructor. But Tempus Leisure, which runs the pool, insisted staff were simply trying to maintain water quality. The half an hour period was imposed to make sure Max had digested all his milk. Marketing manager Marc . Laundon said: 'This is very much an issue of maintaining water quality . as we work hard to keep the water in all our pools safe and clean. 'The member of staff was concerned that a baby that has just been fed could very easily be sick in the pool. Ms Hough was also banned from returning to the water for half an hour in case Max was sick . 'This . would obviously not be pleasant for other users and could potentially . lead to a pool closure which would inconvenience many other customers. 'At . the moment we don't have a specific policy on breastfeeding on poolside . as we assume most customers realise the implications and it has not . previously been an issue. 'The . centre manager in this instance has written to the customer apologising . for any upset and made a judgement in advance of a company-wide policy . being introduced that it is currently acceptable at that centre. 'We . seek to make our facilities open and welcoming to everyone of all ages . but the priority is always the health and safety of everyone.' Ms . Hough added: 'I'm a confident feeder but some girls aren't and . something like that could really shake their confidence. I was polite . but I should have argued against it. 'It's . a lovely pool - really warm and clean and I have been there loads of . times - but I felt really embarrassed by being asked to leave when I . wasn't doing anything wrong.'

"Mercedes recently teased a self-driving truck that it claims could hit the roads within the next decade. And now, the German firm has removed the camouflage from its Future Truck 2025 prototype to reveal even more features, including how the truck's 'Highway Pilot' will scan the road ahead. In addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track, the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control. Scroll down for video . The German firm has taken the cover off of its Future Truck 2025 prototype (pictured) to reveal more features, including how the truck's 'Highway Pilot' scans the road ahead. In addition to stereo cameras and radars that keep the truck on track, the vehicle also features reclining chairs and even a tablet remote control . The prototype truck was originally put through its paces on a German Autobahn in July, during a trial carried out in front of executives from truck-maker Daimler. During . the trial, the truck was covered in a camouflage, and trucker Hans Luft was seen toying conspicuously with an iPad . behind the wheel of the 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle. Clad . in mystery-enhancing adhesive foil, the Mercedes prototype is equipped . with aerodynamic fins and radar that scans the road 250 meters ahead. The system constantly monitors cars around it to stay in the same lane, and keep at the optimum speed set by the driver. It . also makes fuller use of features already found in current production . models, by networking on-board sensors with automatic braking, stability . control and lane-warning systems. Once . the system is switched on, the driver's seat can become an office chair . or swivels to a 'rest position', Daimler said - potentially allowing . vehicles to drive for longer than current daily working limits for . truckers. However, to overtake or change lane, the driver must take manual control. This camouflage has now been removed. On the front of the truck is a series of LEDs, . which illuminate the front fascia and headlights when the . engine is started. When the lights flash orange, it alerts fellow drivers to the fact the truck is driving itself, and these lights turn blue when a human driver is back in control. Images of . the Future Truck 2025 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining . driver's seat, tablet computer controls and 'mirrors' and a chill-out . space. The . driver’s seat can also be turned by 45 degrees, to make it more . comfortable on long journeys, and the tablet can be removed and used to . watch films, for example, when the truck is in autonomous mode. The truck is also equipped with radar sensors and camera . technology that helps the autonomous driving system, . called Highway Pilot, plot the road ahead. The . technology is similar to how an autopilot on an aircraft works, and in . the Future Truck 2025, the stereo camera scans the road 328ft (100 . metres) ahead; 45 degrees . horizontally and 27 degrees vertically. These cameras can identify single and two-lane roads, obstacles including moving and stationary objects, . pedestrians and more. The camera is fitted to the instrument panel behind the windscreen. Future Truck 2025 also . makes fuller use of features already found in current production models, . by networking on-board sensors with automatic braking, stability . control and lane-warning systems. As the vehicle's name suggests, the intention is to launch a roadworthy version by 2025. On the front of the truck is a series of LEDs, which illuminate the front fascia and headlights with white lights when the engine is started. When the lights are blue (pictured right), a human driver is in control . Images of the Future Truck 2025 also reveal a wooden cabin fitted with a reclining driver's seat, tablet computer controls and 'mirrors' and a chill-out space. The driver's seat can be reclined and turned by 45 degrees, to make it more comfortable on long journeys (pictured) The . vehicle is still a prototype, and is still undergoing tests, but it has . been built to travel at speeds of up to 80 km/h (50 mph). The . world's biggest truckmaker is confident its technology can . overcome regulatory and legal hurdles - even if the scale of wage and . fuel savings on offer spells likely conflict with freight unions in the . long run. Following the tests in July, Daimler Trucks chief Wolfgang Bernhard said: 'Autonomous driving will revolutionise road freight transport and create major benefits,' said . 'We . aim to be the number one manufacturer in this market of the future . which we believe will offer solid revenue and earnings potential.' 'This truck will not just remain a prototype,' Bernhard said. This image reveals a comfortable, chill-out space in the cabin of the Future Truck 2025 prototype. As the vehicle's name suggests, Mercedes-Benz's intention is to launch a roadworthy version over the next decade . The German firm demonstrated a camouflaged version of the Future Truck 2025 prototype in July. It was driven on a German Autobahn, and was a major step in an escalating race to develop self-driving vehicles . In addition to Google's self-driving cars, Sweden's . Scania, a unit of Volkswagen, is also working on 'platooning' technology that allows several trucks to travel in tight convoy with a . sole human driver in the lead vehicle. Autonomous . driving proponents face the twin challenges of meeting safety concerns . while persuading lawmakers that accident liability can still be . established. But the potential gains may offer powerful incentives to overcome them. Daimler . said its truck model still requires human oversight while freeing the . driver to perform back-office tasks such as handling bookings and . billing, or planning future itineraries. Fuel . and driver wages each account for 27 per cent of current operating costs . for a typical haulage firm, according to a study by France's CNR, a . government agency that monitors the sector. 'Once you include travelling expenses, total driver costs rise to a full third, the biggest item,' a CNR official said. During the trial, trucker Hans Luft was toying conspicuously with an iPad behind the wheel of his 40-tonne heavy goods vehicle . Even . without removing the drivers, he added, 'their share of total cost will . fall if there are other productivity gains - if you use a little less . driver for a given distance, so to speak.' The automated vehicles also save fuel by driving more economically, according to Daimler. Even . once legal and technological obstacles are cleared, however, . self-driving trucks may face further resistance - not least from unions . that wield serious clout in many countries. 'We would have concerns,' said Adrian Jones, a transport official at Unite, Britain's biggest union. 'We need to maintain the very high standards that we've got,' he said. 'What's the point being there if you're not paying any attention and you're not supervising in effect?' Opposition . is also likely in France, where the government last year scrapped an . environmental truck tax after widespread protests brought highways to a . halt. Labor . representatives will be 'extremely vigilant about the impact on jobs, . wages and road safety' if attempts are made to introduce self-driving . trucks, the Paris-based CFDT union said.'We . must resist any temptation to consider that a driver is resting when . the truck is on auto-pilot,' spokesman Fabian Tosolini. 'That's not what happens in planes, for good reason.' How it works: The truck can scan the road ahead for vehicles and monitor them, ensuring there are no collisions. The driver's seat can become an office chair or swivels to a 'rest position', Daimler said - potentially allowing vehicles to drive for longer than current daily working limits for truckers. A tablet is used to control the system, and drivers can also see routes and information about the truck .","Mercedes-Benz teased its Future Truck 2025 during tests in July .

"Retired boxer Mike Tyson may be famous for his aggressiveness, but he showed his compassionate side last week when he came to the rescue of an injured motorcyclist who had crashed on a Las Vegas interstate. Attorney Stephen Stubbs said his client, 29-year-old Ryan Chesley, was on Interstate 15 in Las Vegas at about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday when a taxi cut him off and he went down. Stubbs said Chesley was lying on the ground when he looked up and recognized Tyson, who was yelling at people not to touch Chesley in case they inflicted further injuries. Despite the shock of the accident, and of meeting 'Iron Mike', Chesley still found time to take a picture of the boxing champion whilst waiting for the emergency services to arrive. Scroll down for video . Got time for a pic? Mike Tyson appeared on the scene of a motorcycle crash, helped the victim, then disappeared! Grateful motorcyclist Ryan Chesley also sent this thank you letter, along with a fruit basket, to Mike Tyson after the former boxer came to his aid after the accident . 'He thought he was hallucinating,' Stubbs said. 'He thought he was in some other world.' Chesley, who had broken bones and torn ligaments, could still use his right hand and snapped a cellphone picture of the heavyweight boxer. As soon as paramedics arrived, Tyson 'just left, like some kind of superhero,' Stubbs said. Mike Tyson's assistant, Steve Lott, said the fighter received a fruit basket a handwritten thank-you note from Chesley on Friday. Mr Chesley also sent this fruit basket to Mike Tyson for helping comfort him while waiting for paramedics . Mike Tyson is lifted into the air after defeating Frank Bruno in their WBC Heavyweight bout back in 1996 . 'Thank you so much for looking over me after my accident,' said the note, which Lott provided to The Associated Press. 'It has to be the most reassuring thing in the world to have Mike Tyson telling people not to touch me.' Half the fruit in the basket had been consumed by Monday, Lott said, and the pistachios were a particularly popular item. Chesley broke bones, tore ligaments and will need surgery but has since been released from the hospital, Stubbs said.","The former boxer, known for his outrageous behavior, was very quick to respond to Ryan Chesley after he fell from his motorcycle and comforted him .

"A mechanic who beat his lover's newborn baby to death may have been jealous because she wouldn't have a baby with him, a judge said. Michael Pearce, 33, has been jailed for nine years for the manslaughter of six-week-old Alfie Sullock after hitting him with a shoe and a plastic bottle. He had offered to look after the newborn so his girlfriend could have her first night out after giving birth. But in a 'momentary loss of control' he lashed out at the child, who died four days later suffering from bleeding on the brain. Michael Pearce (left) who has been found guilty at Newport Crown Court of killing six-week-old Alfie Rhys Sullock (right) but he was cleared of murder . Today, it emerged his outburst came just hours after his 29-year-old girlfriend, Donna Sullock, told him she would not have a baby with him. Mr Justice Baker asked whether jealousy had played a part in the killing. He told Pearce: 'Alfie died as a result of you having inflicted upon him multiple blunt force injuries. 'It may well be that, due to your denials... whether you were motivated by jealousy as a result of Donna’s refusal to have your child earlier that evening.' And disputing Pearce’s mitigation, the judge added: 'This was not a momentary loss of control by a sleep-deprived parent. Alfie was only in your care for a short time.' On August 16 last year, Pearce suggested Ms Sullock had a night out so she could get to know more people in his area. Former holiday rep Ms Sullock, who lived in Cardiff, had met Pearce while six months pregnant and had started to spend most weekends at her boyfriend’s house. Prior to her girls’ night out, she went to a local pub with Pearce - where he drank four pints of beer within an hour. Pearce asked Ms Sullock to have a child with him - but she said no. During the course of Pearce’s trial, the Crown said the defendant showed 'obsessive' behaviour towards Ms Sullock - and had showered her with gifts just a few weeks into their relationship. Ms Sullock said that, when she left the house for her night out, Alfie was 'happy and healthy' and did not have as much as scratch on him. While babysitting Alfie, Pearce sent Ms Sullock a text saying: 'You can trust me you know'. But at 9.11pm he dialled 999, after claiming he had gone to the toilet and returned to see Alfie had stopped breathing. When paramedics arrived moments later, they found the baby lifeless and blue. Pearce was home alone babysitting Alfie last year when paramedics were called to his address in Nelson, Caerphilly, south Wales. A . trial at Newport Crown Court heard it was  the first time divorcee . Pearce had been left alone with the baby. Alfie died after suffering . head and abdominal injuries. Motorcycle mechanic Pearce was today cleared by a jury of Alfie's murder, but convicted of manslaughter. Mother Donna Sullock pictured holding her baby boy Alfie - who died in August last year while in the care of Michael John Pearce, 33 . Ms Sullock (right) broke down in tears after the jury's verdict that Pearce (left) was guilty of manslaughter . During the . trial, the defendant's counsel had queried whether Ms Sullock may have . accidentally hurt her son while getting ready and whether Alfie's . bruising was caused by medics trying to revive him. Those two claims . were both disputed in court by Alfie's mother and paramedics. Pearce, . who had drunk five pints of beer that evening, said he had 'no idea' how Alfie was injured. He said he raised the alarm after returning from . the toilet and noticing Alfie had stopped breathing. As the jury delivered its majority verdict, Ms Sullock broke down in tears. The . former holiday rep, who had clutched her son's teddy while attending . every single day of her former boyfriend's trial, later said: 'We are . disappointed at today’s verdict but satisfied he will still go to prison . for what he has done. 'Whatever sentence he gets will never be long enough for taking Alfie's life away. We have been through a year of hell. 'Thanks . to everyone for their support-friends, family, the community, people . who don’t know me have given me and my family amazing support. Rest In . Peace Alfie.' A healthy and happy Alfie was born at the University Hospital of Wales (UHW), Cardiff, on July 6, 2013, following an uneventful pregnancy. Ms Sullock, who lived in Fairwater, Cardiff, discovered she was expecting while working abroad in Crete. She returned home to the UK, and six months into her pregnancy she became friends with Pearce following a chance meeting in Fairwater. Healthy and happy: Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died . Donna Sullock, mother of Alfie Sullock, pictured outside Newport Crown Court . The pair later became an item, although prosecutors said Pearce began to display 'obsessive behaviour' towards her and even asked her to give him a child just weeks into their relationship. On August 16, Ms Sullock travelled from her home in the Welsh capital to Pearce's home in Nelson to stay over the weekend. However, magistrate's son Pearce suggested she go out with his friend's girlfriend for a 'girly night out'. Before then though, Pearce went out to a nearby pub and drank four pints of beer in 45 minutes. He returned home and looked after Alfie while Ms Sullock got ready. The baby's mother said her son was healthy and breathing normally before she left. Less than half an hour into her night, a worried Ms Sullock asked if her son was doing okay. The defendant sent a text saying: 'you can trust me'. He also texted her photographs of Alfie during the evening claiming it was to 'reassure' her the baby was okay. In the half an hour that followed, at 9.11pm an ambulance was called. The seven-minute call was later played to the jury in full. When asked by the operator did he see what happened, the defendant replied he had simply given the baby a bottle and then the child had stopped breathing. Earlier during the case, prosecutor Michael Mather-Lees said: 'Children do not go cold instantly.' Alfie was first taken to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil before being transferred to UHW. On August 20, life support was withdrawn and Alfie died, the court heard. A Home Office pathologist later gave a provisional cause of death as 'blunt trauma head injury'. Following the completion of the case, Ms Sullock wished to thank family, friends as well as total strangers for their 'amazing support' during her 'year of hell'.","Michael Pearce, from Caerphilly, bludgeoned Alfie Rhys Sullock to death .

"Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein raised eyebrows when he skipped the Cannes premiere of his latest film Grace of Monaco earlier this year. But rather than working on his next film, Mr Weinstein was in Jordan visiting the Zaatari refugee camp, home to more than 120,000 Syrian who have fled their country . Here he describes how visiting the camp and talking to the families that call it their home filled him with both hope and heartbreak: . Film producer Harvey Weinstein with wife Georgina Chpman at the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, which is home to 120,000 Syrian refugees, including children . Mr Weinstein at his wife visited the camp at the invitation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to create a storytelling project about the plight of the Syrian refugees who had flooded into Jordan . There are two Champs-Élysées in the world. One is in Paris. It's filled with movie theatres, boutiques, markets, and fantastic restaurants. Two months ago, I found myself walking down the other Champs-Élysées, nicknamed by aid workers, in the middle of the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan. Zaatari is a ramshackle city of tents and containers, home to about 120,000 Syrian refugees. The streets of this Champs-Élysées are lined with makeshift stores. Where the walkways of its Parisian namesake are bordered by ethereal street lamps, here electricity is jimmy-rigged and borrowed from street lamps. It was incredible to see an improvised pizza-delivery place, a wedding-dress-rental shop, and, my personal favorite, a baklava bakery. The bakery was run by a family of mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, and grandchildren, and overseen by several brothers. They had survived the atrocities across the border. While at the camp Mr Weinstein visited the baklava bakery of Syrian refugee Abu Tamarak. The Zaatari camp is full of shops including a pizza delivery place and a wedding-dress rental shop . While in Jordan, Mr Weinstein, pictured, met with Queen Rania, who told the film producer that there are about 1.3 million Syrians who have fled to her country, with 630,000 of them registered as refugees . They each had unimaginable stories of heartbreak - their houses had been blown up, they saw men shot right in front of them, mid-sentence, mid-conversation. What’s more, the people who pulled the trigger could equally have been from any side. They not only survived, but also endured to re-create their bakery to feed their fellow refugees. Their pride in their desserts was as tangible as a sculptor’s in his creation. Their generosity was unparalleled. Every time I tried to pay for something, a hand would slap me away. 'What, are you trying to insult us? Eat. Enjoy.' Whenever I hear someone say 'Eat. Enjoy,' it reminds me of the way my grandmother spoke to me. It reminds me that we are all the same. We are family. I came to Zaatari and Jordan to accompany the writer Neil Gaiman and my wife, Georgina Chapman, who, together, had been invited by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to create a storytelling project about the plight of the Syrian refugees who had flooded into Jordan. I met with Queen Rania and asked her why Jordan was so generous with its refugee policy. According to the Queen, there are now about 1.3 million Syrians in her country with 630,000 of them are registered as refugees. She said that her husband, King Abdullah II, on seeing women and children fleeing danger, felt that there was really no decision to make, it was the right thing to do, and Jordan will always do the right thing. Mr Weinstein said that the resilience of children living in the camp is both heartbreaking and uplifting. He added: 'What has happened here in this desert has brought them the chance to experience joy again' As a father, a leader, and a humanitarian, King Abdullah II opened his doors. This is not something we would allow in our country, or in England. Not on this scale, when the burden on the country’s infrastructure and services is almost crippling. It is the sacrifice of the Jordanian people, and those in Syria’s other neighboring countries—Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon—that allows for the survival of the Syrian refugees. Queen Rania and I talked about movies, and politics, but most importantly about the importance of education and its potential to transform the Arab World. When education comes to the Middle East, and to young women in particular, and they realize they can be what they want to be, the world will grow different. When the women marched against gun violence in Ireland, the men listened. One hopes the same would happen as women take up more prominent positions in Middle Eastern countries where they are currently oppressed. UNHCR briefed us on what was happening inside Syria—about the level of the destruction and the violence that has ravaged the country. Many of the refugees don’t know any more who it was that attacked their village, who kidnapped their friend, who slaughtered their family, who they were running from. The Syrian army, the Free Syrian Army, al-Qaeda, ISIS, splinter groups of any and all of them—there are so many factions in play now. Every minute of every day unimaginable acts of cruelty, so dark, so grotesque, are being meted out to innocents across great swathes of their beloved country. What man does to another man never ceases to amaze me. Mr Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman and friend Neil Gaiman enjoy a snack with Syrian refugee Um Murad and her daughter in the family's pre-fab caravan. Miss Chapman holds a young baby and she and Mr Gaiman listen to UN aid workers at the camp talk about the conditions the refugees are facing there . I listened with Georgina and Neil to a man who was beaten in front of his family—his wife and young children—for over an hour and a half. You could see his mobility had been eviscerated and that a man who needed to be the proud and strong family leader had been brought to his knees by sheer human cruelty. Neil told me about 11-year-old Rania. A mortar fell on her house in the middle of the night. Her father died. Rania and her five sisters lived, but she is missing a third of her jaw. The volunteer medic who attends her had recently run out of painkillers. Our translator said with despairing wonder, 'How does she sleep at night?' I do not know how to answer that question, nor do I know how we can sleep at night, when this is happening. Each tale we heard, each journey, was more harrowing than the last. UNHCR introduced me to a group of young adults learning English, 10 women on one side, 10 men on the other. We talked movies. Their favourite actress? Angelina Jolie. Why? She is a great actress and had also visited the camp twice, unheralded. They love her for her craft, but also for her humanity. I asked about actors. They told me they identified with characters who did the right thing, the hard thing, to make sure good triumphed over evil. Then they had a question for me: Why, after we told the world that chemical weapons were our line in the sand in the Syrian conflict, did we do nothing? America is their movie star. We are their Shah Rukh Kahn, Wahlberg, Cruise, Stallone: the guys who do the right thing. How to explain that after Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. and U.K. became tired? That we do not want to see our own sons and daughters in harm’s way? The Zaatari camp, which is nicknamed by aid workers as the Champs Elysee is described by Mr Weinstein as a ramshackle city of tents and containers, home to about 120,000 Syrian refugees . The work of the UNHCR is filled with a lot of sacrifice and very little thanks. They are building cities in the sand, erecting shelters as quickly as refugees arrive, providing health care, education, water, support, and protection for the millions forced to leave their homes in the biggest humanitarian crisis of our time. We visited a camp that had opened two weeks before. It was only home to 4,000 refugees. Sadly, and not so slowly, it will undoubtedly fail to reach its capacity to shelter 120,000 refugees. The stories of their various journeys across the border were harrowing - each tale a nightmare. But the 'child-safe' areas in the camp were a source of profound inspiration, and hope. Here, children who had only weeks ago been too traumatized by their journey to speak, laughed and played openly. I watched 10 young kids (more than 50 per cent of these camps’ populations are children) playing soccer with an imaginary ball. Five against five, screaming and cheering, their imaginations working overtime to create joy in the middle of a desert. The resilience of children is both heartbreaking and uplifting. What I saw on the faces of those soccer players, I knew I would remember long after everything has faded. What has happened here in this desert has brought them the chance to experience joy again. The work isn't done, but it’s a hell of a start.","Film producer Harvey Weinstein visited Zaatari, a refugee camp home to more than 120,000 Syrians in Jordan .

"Twenty-six Italian women who claim to be having affairs with a priest have written to Pope Francis begging him to lift the Catholic clergy's vow of celibacy. In an extraordinary letter addressed to His Holiness, the unnamed women say they are just a 'small sample' of believers being forced to 'live in silence' because of their relationship. The letter starts: 'Dear Pope Francis, we are a group of women from all over Italy (and further afield) and are writing to you to break down the wall of silence and indifference that we are faced with every day. A group of women have called on Pope Francis to life the church's vow of celibacy. He is pictured here in St Peter's Square, Vatican City . 'Each of us is in, was or would like to start a relationship with a priest we are in love with.' The 26 women signed with just their name and the initial letter of their surname, plus the name of their hometown, but they did write their surnames and telephone numbers on the envelope. 'As you are well aware,' the letter reads, 'a lot has been said by those who are in favour of optional celibacy but very little is known about the devastating suffering of a woman who is deeply in love with a priest. 'We humbly place our suffering at your feet in the hope that something may change, not just for us, but for the good of the entire Church.' 'We love these men, they love us, and in most cases, despite all efforts to renounce it, one cannot manage to give up such a solid and beautiful bond. 'Unfortunately, this brings with it all the pain of not being able ""to live it fully"". This continuous giving and then letting go is soul destroying. The unnamed women say they are just a 'small sample' of believers being forced to 'live in silence' because of their relationship (file picture) Pope Francis arrives in Saint Peter's Square for his inaugural mass at the Vatican . 'When this enormous pain leads to a definitive separation, the consequences are no less devastating and both parties are often scarred for life. The only other alternatives are either for the priest to abandon the priesthood or for the relationship to carry on in secret. 'In the first scenario, the dramatic situation the couple is faced causes enormous suffering to both parties: we would also like the men we love to live their priestly vocation fully, serving the community and continue the mission they have been passionately and devotedly engaged in for a great many years. 'We wish to stand by their side and support them in their calling which is strengthened by the vital force of love they discovered with us.' 'The second scenario, that is, when the couple chooses to continue a relationship in secret, involves living one’s life in a constant state of hiding, frustrated by an incomplete love, with no hope of childbearing; a love that cannot see the light of day. 'It may sound like a hypocritical situation, remaining celibate but keeping one’s companion secret. Unfortunately, however, this is often the only and painful choice that has to be made because of the impossibility of giving up such a strong love that is rooted in the Lord.' About 6,000 Italian men have left the priesthood to marry, compared with a total of 33,000 parish priests now in service. The Pope has previously supported the tradition of celibacy, but has suggested his position might waiver. 'For . now, I am in favour of maintaining celibacy, with all the pros and cons . that come with it, because in 10 centuries there have been more . positive experiences than errors,' he was quoted saying in 2010, before . he became Pope, in the book, On Heaven and Earth. The Pontiff has disclosed he had a girlfriend in Argentina as a young man before choosing to become a priest. He . has argued that celibacy is more Church tradition than hard and fast . doctrine, pointing out that, up until the year 1100, some priests choose . it while others did not.","The 26 unnamed women say they are being forced to 'live in silence'

"Royal memorabilia is sought after by collectors around the world, particularly those pieces associated with weddings. The general public aren't immune to the lure of marriage keepsakes either: it is rare to find a house in the UK without a commemorative mug or tea towel from either Charles and Diana's wedding or the more recent marriage of the Duchess of Cambridge to Prince William. And now, an exiting new auction will offer collectors a unique opportunity to own a very special souvenir: a piece of the wedding cake from Kate and William's big day. Legacy: At the Julien's auction in Beverly Hills, a slice of cake from the 2011 royal wedding of  Prince William, and Kate Middleton is on sale . The cake is to be auctioned at Julien's auction house in Beverley Hills, California, as part of a special sale that will see a collection of the late Lady Diana Spencer's dresses go on sale alongside the wedding cake. Diana's dresses are expected to reach prices up to $130,000 (£80,000), while the single slice from the 2011 nuptials is estimated to fetch between $1000 (£600) and $2000 (£1,200). Best not to actually eat it: The cake (pictured) comes in a presentation tin and is estimated to fetch between $1,000 and $2,000 . The cake was a bespoke creation, crafted by cake-maker Fiona Cairns. It took her five weeks to complete the confectionery masterpiece. The elaborate gateau was covered in cream and white icing and decorated with 900 delicate sugar-paste flowers. The culinary masterpiece took centre-stage at the Buckingham Palace reception held in the picture gallery on the day of their wedding. Fiona, 59, whose confections are sold in Harrods, Selfridges and Waitrose, was contacted by St James's Palace in February and asked if she would make William and Kate's wedding cake. Bakers prepare the Royal wedding cake in the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace . Finishing touches: Staff perfect the special cake, that was covered in cream and white icing and decorated with up to 900 delicate sugar-paste flowers . It appears that the humble slice of wedding cake may be worth its grand price tag as Fiona says that creating the dessert was a meticulous and exhausting task. 'We reflected some of the architectural details in the room so the garlands on the walls were reproduced loosely on the fourth tier - we've used roses, acorns, ivy leaves, apple blossom and bridal rose.' The bride wanted elements from the Joseph Lambeth technique of cake decoration, where intricate piping is used to make three dimensional scroll work, leaves, and flowers. Royal wedding memorabilia is extremely collectible and hard to get hold of, the Julien's auction will offer a rare opportunity to fans, pictured - Kate and Will on their wedding day in 2011 . Kate also gave Fiona detailed instructions for her to include 17 different blooms and foliage for their meaning or symbolism - known as the 'language of flowers'. With this in mind it seems that such an iconic component of the wedding should be deserving of such a royal price tag. Also under the hammer is a blank invitation to the same wedding, printed on Queen Elizabeth II's Buckingham Palace stationary.

"A 900-year-old Norse code has finally been cracked, and experts believe it’s the Viking equivalent of a Valentine’s day card. The message, which is thought to say in part ‘kiss me’, means scientists may have stumbled upon a nearly millennium-old love letter. It came after PhD student Jonas Norbury unravelled the mysterious Jötunvillur code, which dates back to as early as the 9th century. The 'Kiss me' carving, thought to have been made in the 12th or 13th century, was written in cipher runes, the most common code known from medieval Scandinavia . The ‘Kiss me’ carving, thought to have been made in the 12th or 13th century in Sigtuna, Sweden, was written in cipher runes, the most common code known from medieval Scandinavia. ‘The problem with this code system is that it is impossible to read because the code gives many possible solutions,’ Mr Nordbury told MailOnline. Mr Nordby, from the University of Oslo, is the first person to study all the findings of runic codes in Northern Europe, totalling around 80 inscriptions. ‘In the cases I have been able to read, the text they contain personal names.’ Mr Nordby, from the University of Oslo, is the first person to study all the findings of runic codes in Northern Europe, totalling around 80 inscriptions. One such inscription is pictured here. The carvings are thought to say that it was written by 'the most knowledgeable man west of the sea' To read the jötunvillur code, you would replace the original runic character with the last sound of the rune name. For example, the rune for f, pronounced fe, would be turned into an e, while the rune for k, pronounced kaun, became n. While this sounds straightforward jötunvillur code is written in a way that makes the interpretation ambiguous. Mr Norby added that jötunvillur can only be written and not read, which would make it pointless for use in a message. ‘It is, however, possible - with some uncertainty - to interpret the runic inscription on a piece of bone found in Sigtuna as ""Kiss me""’. Mr Norby bases his interpretation on his work on the jötunvillur code, but is keen to highlight that there are differences to the two codes that could mean the message is something different althought. ‘For the jötunvillur code, one would replace the original runic character with the last sound of the rune name,’ he explained in an interview with Forskning.no. ‘For example, the rune for “f”, pronounced “fe,” would be turned into an “e,” while the rune for “k,” pronounced “kaun,” became “n.”’ Cryptologists previously thought the code was used to communicate secret messages, but Mr Nordby thinks the pattern might have been vital in the teaching of rune instead. The carving was discovered in Sigtuna, Sweden. Cryptologists previously thought the code was used to communicate secret messages, but Mr Nordby thinks the pattern might have been vital in the teaching . One of the reasons for his claim is that the jötunvillur code is written in a way that makes the interpretation ambiguous. Mr Norby says that jötunvillur can only be written and not read, which would make it pointless for use in a message. Instead, Mr Nordby thinks the Vikings memorised rune names with the help of the jötunvillur code. The ‘kiss me’ carving suggests that the code may also have been used as a type of puzzle for others to interpret. ‘People challenged one another with codes. It was a kind of competition in the art of rune making. This testifies to a playfulness with writing that we don’t see today,’ said Mr Nordby.","Carving thought to have been made in the 12th century in Sigtuna, Sweden .

"Men who beat cancer and who burned more than 12,6000 kilojoules a week exercising, almost halved their risk of death, a new study found . We all know exercise is good for us but now scientists have found that physical exercise significantly increases the life expectancy of cancer survivors. Men who beat cancer and who burned more than 12,600 kilojoules or 3,011 calories a week exercising, almost halved their risk of death, a new study found. The research supports a previous study that found the most physically . active cancer survivors are much less likely to die of cancer and heart disease. Scientists from the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine studied 1,021 men with an average age of 71 who had been previously diagnosed with cancer. They found that men who burned more than 3011 calories per week by exercising, were 48 per cent less likely to die than those that did little exercise and expended less than 2,100 kilojoules (502 calories) a week, Medical Express reported. Co-author of the study, Dr Kathlee Wolin explained that many cancer survivors are living longer because of early diagnosis and better treatment. ‘Physical activity should be actively promoted to such individuals to enhance longevity,’ she said in the study, which was published in the Journal of Physical Activity & Health. While there has been plenty of research that shows regular exercise boosts the life expectancy of healthy people, this study is among very few that show exercise also extended the life of cancer survivors. Scientists from the Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine studied 1,021 men with an average age of 71 who had been previously diagnosed with cancer.

Scientists studied 1,021 men with an average age of 71 to come up with their findings. A previous study found that the most physically active cancer survivors were 38 per cent less likely to die from the disease if it was to strike again. They were also 48 per cent less likely to die of cardiovascular disease after their cancer treatment. Scientists used data from Harvard’s Alumni Health Study, which surveys male alumni who attended the university between 1916 and 1950. In 1988, participants detailed their exercise habits in a questionnaire that quizzed hem how often they went walking, climbed stairs and participated in sports. The exercise of the same men was updates in 1993 and they were followed until 1998. The study found that men who burned more than 12,400 kilojoules per week were 48 per cent less likely to die of any cause following cancer treatment and their findings were adjusted for age, weight, smoking and early parental mortality.

"A 25-year-old woman is facing up to 50 years in jail after allegedly having sex with a 13-year-old boy. The teenage victim told police that he had a four month long sexual relationship with married Britney Rosenfield. The boy gave graphic descriptions to police of the various places he had sex with Rosenfield, including her bedroom, living room and laundry room. Britney Rosenfield faces up to 50 years in jail after allegedly admitting to having sex six times with a 13-year-old boy . Rosenfield is alleged to have admitted to officers in Casper, Wyoming, that she had sex six times with the boy. When she made her first appearance in court she was accompanied by her husband and mother. Her lawyer asked Natrona County District Judge David Park not to read out the list of charges she was facing. According to the Casper Star-Tribune the judge declined and Rosenfield was told she faces one count of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor and one count of second-degree sexual abuse of a minor. An arrest report revealed that Rosenfield reported to Casper police she had been engaging in sexual intercourse with the boy since August. The boy went into greater details with social workers, according to court documents. Rosenfield, 25, stood before Judge David Park at Natrona County District Court . He said the incidents occurred in several rooms of Rosenfield’s house, including the living room, the defendant’s bedroom and the laundry room.

"Britain's most feckless parent is about to father his 15th child with his 13th lover. Jobless Jamie Cumming's own mother is now so sick of his philandering ways that she's pleaded with him to stop having babies and start taking responsibility for his actions. Lorraine, 55, said her son needs to find a job before his 19-year-old girlfriend gives birth so he can start paying maintenance rather than let each mother claim benefits. Feckless: Jamie Cumming, holding his son's hand, has had 14 children with 13 different women - and another baby is on its way . The 34-year-old's latest lover is due in November but Lorraine has branded her son as 'useless' and said he needs to try to be a decent parent to all his other children before having more. 'I love Jamie and I love all of my grandchildren. But enough it enough. It is time for my son to stop fathering babies and start being a father,' embarrassed Lorraine told The People. Jamie, from Dundee, has had numerous jobs and has been a barman and a security guard in the past but has never been able to hold down a job. He first told his mother and his father Harry he was going to become a dad, aged just 17. 'I love Jamie and I love all of my grandchildren. But enough is enough. It is time for my son to stop fathering babies and start being a father.' His girlfriend Kelly Dulley gave birth to a little girl in February 1995 and everyone believed the couple would go on to get married. But once the baby was born, Jamie started a relationship with Kelly's cousin. Their relationship lasted 10 years but the couple struggled to have a baby despite receiving IVF treatment through the NHS. While they were trying for a baby Jamie had managed to father another child with a woman who gave birth to his first son in 1997. She has since moved to France and neither Jamie nor his family have seen her or the child since. 'Around the same time in 1997, Jamie got another girl pregnant - Kelly's cousin's pal,' said Lorraine. Trouble: Jamie is about to father his 15th child with his 13th lover . In November 1998 he fathered another child after a one-night stand with a neighbour's daughter and less than three years later in July 2001 he became a father again. Fourteen months later his sixth child, a boy, arrived and occasionally Jamie gives some money to the boy's mother but does not contribute towards his other children. A few months later he fathered a . seventh son and shortly after that in 2002 another woman gave birth to . his eighth child, another boy. In . 2004 Jamie was in new a relationship and together they have three . children - a seven-year-old, a two-year-old and a 13-month-old baby. By December 2007 Jamie's tenth child had arrived and five months later his 11th son was born. Jamie, . who has five siblings, also fathered a child with an Australian woman . who took their son back with her after she'd given birth. Lorraine . regularly keeps in contact with her 14 grandchildren and often meets . with their maternal grandparents but she feels humiliated because her . son is refusing to raise or support his own children. He . often spends Christmas day flitting between each of the women and will . sometimes spend his money buying lavish gifts rather than buying food . and clothes. Other relatives have pleaded with him to stop fathering children but they believe he is addicted. Jamie . has refused to comment while five of the mothers were unavailable, four . declined to comment and the others refused to be named. Kelly Dulley said she could not say anything because she didn't raise her child either. One of the women who got involved with Jamie Cumming claims he pretends he is available by saying he lives in a battered old caravan. Paula Ryan, 31, became pregnant with Jamie's son Cayden after they were together for a few months. She said Jamie would take her away for romantic weekends in Fife and Ayr and claims it was the best relationship she'd ever had. Ms Ryan said he was extremely affectionate and was a real charmer. She said she had no idea he was with other women at the same time and only knew about two of his children. When she fell pregnant five months into the relationship other people told her how many children he had. Jamie has not contributed financially to her son Cayden's upbringing.","Jamie Cumming, 34, first became a father aged 17 ."
"An Australian man created an inch-wide hole in his head using an ointment he thought would help treat his skin cancer. The 55-year-old entered a Brisbane hospital with a large lesion on his right temple after allegedly using Black salve, an ‘alternative medicine’ ointment. The man is believed to have been applying the salve for four months and he did not turn to professional medical care until there was a black hole in his head. Black hole: The 55-year-old man had allegedly been using Black salve, a corrosive 'alternative medicine' treatment condemned by medical professionals, for four months . Doctors at Princess Alexandra Emergency Department in Brisbane were shocked when the man entered the ward in September last year. He was using a ‘strong narcotic analgesic used to relieve pain’ to combat the agony and doctors initially believed they would have to operate. However, he was sent home to tend to the wound with proper instructions and it healed within three months. The man had admitted to staff he had been applying an alternative medicine to the area, which staff believe was a type of Black salve. Dangerous: Black salve, made from blood root, has been condemned in several countries . The ointment, also known as drawing salve, contains sanguinarine – derived from bloodroot – and is often mixed with zinc chloride, working as a corrosive. The paste is used on a topical area, . moles, scars and sometimes cancer, it destroys skin tissue, leaving . being a black scar which later falls off. Black . salves were popular in the early 1900s to treat skin lesions, but have been listed as a 'fake cancer treatment' by the U.S. Food and Drug . Administration (FDA) since 2004, and the organisation is actively trying . to ban it in the U.S. In . Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) condemned the . ointments as recently as 2012, although they are not yet banned. The . TGA says it is ‘unaware of any credible, scientific evidence that . black salve, red salve or cansema can cure or treat cancer.’ However, the warnings have not stopped the widespread use of Black salve in Australia. ‘I think it’s used a lot more commonly than we realise,’ dermatologist Dr Erin McMeniman said. ‘Patients . are often quite secretive about where they get it from, but . dermatologists often end up seeing cases where there are major . complications. ‘Most . commonly the tumour is not adequately treated and then 12 months later . it’s still growing beneath the scar the cancema [black salve] has . produced.’","Australian, 55, had inch-wide hole in his temple after using 'drawing salve'

"It is typically associated with eating too much and exercising too little – but one in ten people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes is a perfectly healthy weight. Official figures show that the risk factors for the disease are far more complex than is often assumed. The National Diabetes Audit found that a small number of sufferers – 0.4 per cent – are actually underweight. Scroll down for video . Testing blood sugar: In Type 2 diabetes, sufferers must eat a special diet and monitor their blood sugar . Charity Diabetes UK, which analysed the data, said it highlights that weight is not the only risk factor. Older people are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, as are those with a family history of the disease. Those from a black, South Asian or Chinese background are also at higher risk. And scientists are concerned that some people who look thin might have internal fat wrapped around their organs. Although largely hidden, this fat produces hormones and other substances that affect cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar levels, raising the risk of a host of health problems including diabetes. Research in July by London Metropolitan University found that 15 per cent of healthy weight children had high internal fat. In Type 2 diabetes, which makes up 90 per cent of cases, the body becomes resistant to insulin, the hormone that breaks down sugar in the blood. Sufferers must eat a special diet and monitor their blood sugar. The other 10 per cent of cases are type 1 – a condition that prevents insulin being made, and is not tied to weight. In England alone, 3.2million adults are thought to have type 2 diabetes, including 850,000 who have not yet been diagnosed. NHS officials estimate that will soar to 4.6million by 2030. A programmable insulin pump administers insulin continuously through catheter into the subcutaneous fat . Diabetes UK studied data on more than 200,000 patients from the National Diabetes Audit and found that almost nine out of ten type 2 sufferers had a body mass index of more than 25 – classed as being overweight. More than half of those who had been newly diagnosed were obese. But 11.3 per cent were of normal weight. Barbara Young, of Diabetes UK, said: ‘Crucially, we need to make sure that people identified as being high risk are then given the support they need to make the lifestyle changes that can help prevent it.’ She said obesity was still the main driver, adding: ‘Diabetes has become a national health emergency. These new findings show we will only ever begin to turn back the rising tide of type 2 diabetes if we finally get to grips with the obesity epidemic.’ She added that losing just a few pounds can reduce your risk of developing the serious illness, which can cause early death, and called for new policies and laws ‘that make it easier for people to make healthy choices’.","In England alone, 3.2million adults are thought to have type 2 diabetes .

"A federal agent who sent topless pictures of himself to the woman at the center of the Petraeus and General Allen scandals was told to 'stay the hell away' from the investigation but took it upon himself to 'nose around', it was revealed today. After receiving a half dozen harassing emails from an anonymous account - but later linked to Petraeus' mistress Paula Broadwell, Jill Kelley, the Florida woman who served as a volunteer social liaison officer at the Tampa military base, contacted a male FBI agent that she knew and had previously worked with. During a prior exchange, when the agent was trying to establish a friendly relationship with the married mother-of-three, he sent her shirtless photos of himself adding to questions over his true intention behind going above-and-beyond his work duties to help her with the threats. Because he was not a part of the cybercrime unit at the FBI nor did he have any training regarding electronic threats, he was never assigned to the case once he brought it to the agency's attention yet he still felt it necessary to involve himself. New scandal: A federal agent was pulled off the investigation into David Petraeus's illicit contact with Paula Broadwell when the agent reportedly became obsessed with Jill Kelley, another woman involved in the probe . The New York Times reports that an unidentified senior official said that the agent's superiors 'told him to stay the hell away from it, and he was not invited to briefings'. The FBI declined to identify the agent, . who is now under an internal investigation by the agency's Office of . Professional Responsibility. Shortly thereafter, the agent was barred from the case over concerns that he 'might have grown obsessed with the matter,' the Wall Street Journal reports. Even . after he was prohibited from involvement in the case, the agent, described as Right wing, decided . to contact Republican congressman David Reichert about the . matter because he assumed that the investigation had . stalled. Reichert then told fellow Republican Rep. Eric Cantor. Revealed: The investigation into anonymous emails sent to Kelley led FBI officials to David Petraeus's affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell . The Times says that the agent's 'worldview' made him believe that the issue was being kept quiet to help President Obama, as the entire investigation took place in the months leading up to his re-election. He complained that senior FBI officials were going to 'sweep the matter under the rug,' the FBI learned. What the agent didn't know was that . investigators had traced the harassing emails back to accounts used by . Broadwell, David Petraeus' 40-year-old married biographer. Jealous: Broadwell sent Jill Kelley, far right, threatening emails warning her to stay away from Petraeus. Pictured with Kelley is her husband, Scott, and Holly Petraeus .

Party host: Kelley, 37, is a volunteer who organizes social events for military families in the Tampa area. She often hosts the events at her million-dollar Bayshore Boulevard home . In one of the emails, Broadwell . accused Kelley of touching 'him' underneath a table and another email . asked if Kelley's husband was aware of her actions, according to the . newspaper.

September 6, 2011: . David Petraeus was unanimously appointed to be the head of the Central Intelligence Agency after spending over 37 years in the military. November 2011: .

The FBI first officially knew that Paula Broadwall was sending threatening emails to Jill Kelley, . a family friend of Petraeus. There is no indication that Kelley had any . sort of romantic affair with Petraeus, but the threatening nature of . the emails from Broadwell suggest that she felt threatened in some way . by Kelley's close connection to Petraeus. End of Summer 2012: . Knew for months: Attorney General Eric Holder learned of the investigation at the end of the summer . Broadwall's affair with Petraeus is . thought to have formally ended in July, though it was not until the end . of the summer that the FBI realized it was Petraeus emailing . Broadwall because he had been using a Gmail account established under a . pseudonym for their personal communications, some of which was sexually . explicit in nature. At an unspecified date at the end of the summer, the FBI investigators notified the Attorney General's office- and Attorney General Eric Holder . himself- because they needed the authority to interview Broadwall and . Petraeus. In telling the AG, investigators were clear that they were . looking into the possibility of pressing criminal charges against . Broadwell for either her threats against Kelley or any illegal action . that stemmed from the communication with Petraeus. September 2012: . Broadwell was first interviewed at some point in September, when she admitted to the affair and turned over her computer. October 2012: .

"A Sudanese woman sentenced to death for marrying a Christian was forced to give birth with her legs chained, it has been revealed today. Meriam Ibrahim was shackled as her baby daughter was born in jail in Sudan where she is awaiting execution for marrying a Christian U.S. citizen. Amid the joy of seeing his child for . the first time, her husband Daniel Wani has spoken of his anger at the treatment she received during labour. Proud: Father Daniel Wani, a U.S. citizen, from Manchester, New Hampshire, holds Maya for the first time after being allowed to visit to his wife, Meriam Ibrahim, who was sentenced to death for marrying him, a Christian . Cruel: . Martin, above, is pictured with his father on the heartbreaking visit. His family claim he is American because . his father has been granted U.S. citizenship. He is being held with Meriam because the authorities claim he is a Muslim and will not release him into the care of a Christian . Mr Wani told The Telegraph: 'They kept a chain on her legs. She is very unhappy about that.' He said that he had initially been refused permission to see his daughter, but authorities eventually let him in to the prison - and his wife was momentarily freed from her chains. Mr Daniel Wani was then able to hold his daughter Maya for . the first time after she was born five days early in the hospital wing at Omdurman Federal Women’s Prison in North Khartoum yesterday. Meriam has spent the past four months shackled to the floor in a disease-ridden jail after being sentenced to death by hanging earlier this month for converting from Islam to Christianity and marrying a Christian man. Her lawyer Mohaned Mustafa Elnour said the couple are 'happy and proud' of their new arrival and that it has brought a momentary ray of light to an otherwise bleak and desperate situation. Mr Elnour: 'This is a special moment for them. Daniel is delighted that he is able to see his new daughter so soon. 'The family are taking some time to enjoy the birth before they return to fighting the injustice of Meriam's sentence.' Daniel, a 27-year-old biochemist who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire, also got the chance to hold his 20-month-old son Martin, who is being held in the barbaric prison with his mother. The photo is especially poignant as Meriam will never see her beautiful daughter grow up. She is set to hang sometime in the next two years as the authorities said she will be executed when she has finished weaning Maya. And before the birth, Meriam made the defiant claim that she would rather die than give up her faith. In a heart-wrenching conversation with her husband during a rare prison visit, Meriam told him: 'If they want to execute me then they should go ahead and do it because I’m not going to change my faith.’ Loving: Meriam and Daniel married in Sudan. Daniel left New Hampshire to visit her in Sudan and arrange for his wife and son to join him in America when she was arrested . An . Islamic Sharia judge said she could be spared the death penalty if she . publicly renounced her faith and becomes a Muslim once more. Meriam . insists she has always been a Christian and told her husband she could . not 'pretend to be a Muslim' just to spare her life. She told him: 'I refuse to change. I am not giving up Christianity just so that I can live. 'I know I could stay alive by becoming a Muslim and I would be able to look after our family, but I need to be true to myself.’ Daniel revealed his wife’s defiant stance during an . exclusive interview with MailOnline at his modest home in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. Sitting . beneath glamorous photographs of his wife taken at their wedding in . December 2011, he said: 'My wife is very, very strong. She is stronger . than me. 'When they . sentenced her to death I broke down and tears were streaming down my . eyes. Our lawyers were passing me tissues. But she stayed strong. 'She . did not flinch when she was sentenced. It was amazing to see, . particularly because she is the one facing the death penalty.’ Daniel . was in Khartoum trying to arrange for Meriam and their 20-month-old son, . Martin, to live with him in the US when his wife was arrested in . September. She was three weeks pregnant with their second child. The authorities will not release Martin into the care of his father because they claim he is a Muslim too. Bleak: The Omdurman Women's Jail in Khartoum, Sudan where Meriam Ibrahim is being held. It is overcrowded and riven with disease . She . spends much of her time shackled to the floor, is not receiving much nutrition in her food and is rarely allowed outside. Both she and her bewildered son have contracted various illnesses because of the poor sanitation at the jail. A . report by Human Rights Watch claims the prison is 'beset with . overcrowding’ and suffers from 'poor sanitation, disease and the deaths . of many children living with their mothers’. Daniel, who is originally from South Sudan, but is now a naturalized American, was initially refused permission to visit her. Daniel told MailOnline: 'They say the . marriage is void. Now, even my wife is no longer my wife. And my son is . not mine and my new daughter is not mine. They say I am a stranger to . them. 'I know my wife puts . on a brave face but I can tell that she is in quite a bit of pain. She . doesn’t get to leave the room for weeks. 'She . has suffered medical complications while in jail, but no one knows the . full extent of what they are because she is in prison. It’s a difficult . time. To see her walking in chains is difficult.’ Daniel, . who is wheelchair-bound because he suffers from muscular dystrophy, . cuts a forlorn figure as he wheels himself around his empty house. His . child’s bed lies unused, as does a child-sized toothbrush. Daniel keeps . himself busy by studying the regular barrage of paperwork that his . legal team send him. Like many in Sudan, both Daniel and his wife’s childhood were blighted by civil war. Daniel managed to escape the brutal conflict in 1998 when he travelled to America with his brother Gabriel. The . biochemist returned to Sudan to marry Meriam at a Christian service in a . chapel which was attended by around 500 people in December 2011. Most who were at the wedding ceremony could vouch for the pair being committed Christians, defence lawyers say. But witnesses who were willing to give evidence on her behalf were barred from testifying because they were Christian. She even produced a marriage certificate identifying herself as a Christian. Despite . this, the judge determined that because her father was a Muslim, even . though he abandoned the family while they were living in a refugee camp . in the South East of Sudan when she was six, she too was a Muslim who . had broken the law by leaving Islam. But . her mother, who is now dead, brought her up as Christian. Her mother . was born in Ethiopia to Christian parents, but fled to Sudan because of . famine, and chose to raise her daughter in the same religion. Meriam was arrested in mid-September, three weeks after her second child was conceived. At . first the couple dismissed the allegations against them as trivial, but . when the case grew more serious Daniel went to the American Embassy in . Khartoum for help. 'I . thought this would be the one place which would help me, but they told . me they didn’t have time to do anything,’ Daniel said. 'I was upset . because now that I am American citizen I thought they would help me. 'I . was threatened. They said “well your wife isn’t American, so we can’t . help”. I felt disgusted. My home is in America and still they won’t . help. It’s getting uglier and it’s not going in the right direction.’ Mr Wani said the State Department asked him to provide DNA evidence proving that Martin was his biological son. Rotten . care: Martin is given a drink by prison guards. Daniel is desperate to . be allowed to take him home and is fiercely critical of the U.S. Embassy . for failing to help them and Martin in particular, who is American . He . added: 'I have provided wedding documents and the baby’s birth . certificate, but this is clearly not enough. It’s very upsetting that . they don’t believe me. 'They want me to take a DNA sample in Khartoum, then send it to the US for testing. It’s as if they don’t believe a word I say.’ The Sharia court has postponed her sentence, to give her time to recover from childbirth and to wean the new baby. Her . lawyer, Mohaned Mustafa Elnour, a Muslim, has received death threats . for defending her but has already lodged an appeal. If he does not . succeed at the Appeal Court, he will take the case to Sudan’s Supreme . Court. Mr . Elnour said the case hinges around the testimony of two men who claim . to be her brothers, and one woman who claims to be her mother. In . court they claimed that she had disappeared from the family home in a . small village in the east of Sudan and then discovered her living in . Khartoum, married to a Christian man. But . the lawyer said all three witnesses have proven to be liars because . their evidence to the court has been highly contradictory. He . suggested that the trio are making up their story in an attempt to . claim ownership of Meriam’s flourishing general store in a shopping mall . on the outskirts of Khartoum. Mr . Elnour added: 'We can prove that Meriam’s mother died in 2012 and that . the two others are definite fraudsters. But the court is not interested . in our evidence.’ A petition calling for her release had last week reached more than 661,000.","Meriam Ibrahim's legs were chained as she gave birth in Sudanese jail .

"Eric Frein obsessively collected military memorabilia, dismissed his fellow war re-enactors as dilettantes, and took his hobby so seriously that he spoke French during a simulated Vietnam War-era interrogation, according to a filmmaker who interviewed the man now suspected of ambushing a Pennsylvania State Police barracks. Frein appears in an upcoming documentary about Vietnam re-enactors called 'Vietnam Appreciation Day,' identifying himself by name and saying that re-enactments are 'about teaching the public and showing the equipment that was used, talking about the history of it all.' Frein, 31, is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring another trooper in the Sept. 12 ambush outside a rural barracks. He has managed to elude hundreds of law enforcement officials looking for him in the heavily wooded Pocono Mountains of northeastern Pennsylvania. Scroll down for video . Killer? Frein, 31, is charged with killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring another trooper in the Sept. 12 ambush outside a rural Pennsylvania State Police barracks . Determined: Frein made sure every detail of his look was just right, Bresnan said, and lost himself in the simulated battles that featured authentic period military rifles firing blanks . Police have yet to find Frein, who has so far eluded authorities for 10 days . The documentary's director, Patrick Bresnan, recalled Frein as odd and aloof, segregating himself from the other re-enactors. Frein and two of his friends 'kind of viewed the other re-enactors as, in their words, playing cowboys and Indians,' Bresnan told The Associated Press on Tuesday. '""They are playing war,"" is what he says, ""and we're here because we want to preserve the history of war and we want to meet veterans and we want to catalogue their stories.""' Frein made sure every detail of his look was just right, Bresnan said, and lost himself in the simulated battles that featured authentic period military rifles firing blanks. 'If you saw Eric go through the woods, it was very scary,' he told The Associated Press. 'He was absolutely serious when he was going through the brush, hunting Viet Cong at these re-enactments.' The director added he did not feel Frein posed an actual threat. 'With Eric and his friends, they are so much more educated than the average re-enactor that we figured they were too smart to harm anyone,' he said. Police have called Frein a survivalist with a vendetta against law enforcement. They believe he's hiding in the woods where he grew up and his parents still live. But there was no indication Tuesday that authorities are imminently close to catching him. Frein attended East Stroudsburg University for one semester as a history student in 2005 and then again for two semesters in 2011 and 2012 as a chemistry major, but he didn't graduate, said Brenda Friday, a university spokeswoman. He also attended classes off and on at Northampton Community College from 2008 to 2013 but never received a degree, said spokeswoman Heidi Butler. Frein once worked as a part-time, seasonal employee at the Boy Scouts of America's Camp Minsi in the Poconos, according to Craig Poland, scout executive with the Minsi Trails Council. As the search for Frein continued, NBC's 'Today' show aired footage from 'Vietnam Appreciation Day.' An undated photo provided by the Pennsylvania State Police shows what they say are magazines for an AK-47-style assault rifle that they have recovered from the woods in the manhunt for Eric Frein . In one clip, Frein talked about the difficult terrain where one of the re-enactments took place — an eerie prelude to the real-life manhunt playing out in the area around Canadensis, where authorities have been closing roads and residents have been unable to get back to their homes due to the heavy police presence. 'We had to find them, and we just walked around for two days straight,' he said in the clip. Though Bresnan last saw Frein in 2011, the director remembered Frein and his friends clearly. 'They really identified with the soldiers of Vietnam because they came back to the U.S. and were rejects from society,' Bresnan said. 'Eric and his friends definitely identified with the underdogs and rejects.' Fellow director Ivete Lucas, who appeared in an NBC News interview with Bresnan, told the news station 'Eric actually thought that the way that the other re-enactors reenacted in front of the veterans was inaccurate. 'So he thought they were - they seemed like they were playing war games instead of being very accurate and precise and showing exactly how it was in Vietnam, so he preferred to do the tactical battles in the woods because they - that way they could really get into that mindset and not offend or you now, stir emotions in veterans.' The directors' comments come after State. Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters 'I do believe we are close to him at this point,' ABC News reported. 'We're following up on tips, we believe they're very credible,' Bivens also said. 'And yes, there is a lot of police activity. It's been ongoing throughout the night.' On Sunday, Bivens said 'Based on our investigations, we know Frein has prepared and planned extensively for months or maybe years,' according to CNN. He also said 'I am convinced that Frein has engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, specifically the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight.'

"Ari Wibowo sheds his skin like a snake every 41 days and must constantly smear his body with moisturiser to stop it hardening and seizing up. The Indonesian teenager has a rare skin condition that doctors in Indonesia have been unable or unwilling to treat and which has left him with an extraordinary appearance. He suffers from Erythroderma, an inflammatory skin disease also known as 'red man syndrome', that causes the skin over almost the entire body to become scaly and flake off. Scroll down for video . Ari Wibowo has a condition called Erythroderma that makes his skin scaly and flake off . Ari has shed his skin every 41 days since he was born 16 years ago. He must soak his body in water every hour - night and day - and smear himself with lotion every three hours to prevent drying out. Photographer Nurcholis Anhari Lubis, 35, has documented the little boy’s condition as part of an essay project and describes the boy's skin condition as ‘scaly like a snake about to shed his skin’. ‘It’s really sad because he was not born normally and has scaly skin all over his body, similar to being severely burnt, from the sole of his feet up to his head,’ Mr Lubis told Daily Mail Australia. ‘If the boy doesn't moisturise or soak his skin in water, his body would shrivel and harden up like a sculpture and he won't be able to move,' Mr Lubis said. 'If he leaves it unattended for too long, he won’t be able to speak because the wrinkles inside his mouth would go hard and it would dry out all his blood in his body.' Mr Lubis said Ari's family were told by doctors at the hospital where he was born that it did not have the resources to treat the condition, and asked them to take the infant away. He and his family now live by a routine of constant washing and dressing his skin with creams. Still, the boy is trying to live a normal life in his village. 'He eats normal food like everyone else and his favourite snacks are instant noodles and crackers,' Mr Lubis said. ‘He had trouble making friends when he was younger and would often go and play with the other kids but most of the time, they would avoid him because he is different to everyone else.' Ari must contantly wash and moisturise his skin to stop it from drying out . Ari has had trouble making friends because he looked different and people feared his condition may be contagious . Photographer Nurcholis Anhari Lubis has documented Ari's life for an essay project . Ari is taking lessons, but is forced to study alone because of ignorance about his condition in the community. ‘No schools are willing to accept him because they fear his skin condition would be contagious to teachers and other students,' Mr Lubis said. Ari also suffers prejudice because of superstitions in his village. Mr Lubis said many people blame Ari's condition on a superstition that if a woman mistreats animals while she is pregnant then it will affect her unborn child. Some people believe Ari's mother ‘tortured a lizard’ she found in the family home when she was pregnant with Ari. ‘I do not believe the myths but in Indonesia, there are still a lot of people who believe this,’ Mr Lubis said. Jakarta-based Mr Lubis spent four days with the little boy and his family. ‘When I approached Ari for a photo shoot, he looked very shy but didn't feel embarrassed and was happy to share his story,’ he said. ‘My interests have been to document lives and the way humans live in their own world, interacting with it and struggling to change it into their own way.' Ari has trouble talking because of the condition and the vision in his right eye is impaired, while the left must be kept moist with constant drops.

"Checking your work email at home or taking a call from the boss at weekends could be damaging your health, experts have warned. A study of 57,000 people found that more than half worked outside their normal hours - a trend driven by the ease of accessing work documents on smartphones and computer tablets. The researchers found that those who worked in the evenings and at weekends were more likely to complain of insomnia, headaches, fatigue, anxiety and stomach problems. Muscular problems and cardiovascular issues were also linked to working outside of normal hours, the German researchers found. Checking your work email at home, or taking a call from your boss at the weekend could be damaging your health, experts have warned. German researchers argued recreational time completely free of work is essential to help the body recuperate. File picture . The scientists, whose work is published in the journal Chronobiology International, call for far stricter rules to stop work invading people’s home life. They said technological advances have created an ‘always-on’ culture which is ramping up pressure for people to be constantly available to work. And they argued that recreational time completely free of work is essential to help the body recuperate. The authors, from the Society for Labour, Industrial and Organizational Psychological Research in Oldenburg, Germany, based their findings on two major surveys of workers across Europe. They wrote: ‘Information and communication technologies, such as computers and smartphones... have the potential benefit and the potential inherent danger of making it possible for employees to be available any time and anywhere. ‘This changes not only our work organisation, but probably also our patterns of social participation and integration.’ They added: ‘Free time should be free time, otherwise it must be expected that it cannot fulfil functions of recovery and recuperation.’ Lead author Dr Anna Arlinghaus, a public health expert at the, said: ‘Our findings indicate that even a small amount of supplemental work beyond contractually agreed work hours can lead to health issues. ‘The correlation is very strong.’ Some large companies and even governments are beginning to raise concerns about the burden of mobile working. Separate research, carried out by technology retailer Pixmania in 2012, found that access to a smartphone adds two hours to the working day. The study found workers who checked their email at home were more prone to cardiovascular problems, headaches, anxiety, stomach problems and  muscular complaints. File picture . More than 90 per cent of office workers have an email-enabled phone, with a third accessing them more than 20 times a day, the research found. German car maker Daimler last month  installed software on its 100,000 employees’ computers that automatically deletes emails if they are away on holiday. Daimler spokesman Oliver Wihofszki said: ‘The idea behind it is to give people break and let them rest. Then they can come back to work with a fresh spirit.’ Managers at Deutsche Telekom agreed to stop sending emails to staff during evenings, weekends and holidays, while in 2011 Volkswagen announced company servers would stop routing emails to employees’ BlackBerrys in the evening. France recently introduced rules which safeguard people working in the digital and consultancy sectors from work email outside office hours. And the German government is looking at similar measures. Dr Arlinghaus said: ‘Employers should start to look at how they can minimise their employees’ supplemental work. ‘It often needs to start at the top, with bosses taking the lead and attempting to change the culture at work. 'Not every country will implement regulations like France, so companies should look to make improvements of their own accord.’","German study of 57,000 people found more than half worked out of hours .

"Long have clothing designers, High Street brands and travel agents worshiped the  'Kate effect' - where anything the Duchess of Cambridge touches turns to commercial gold. Now it seems Prince William is commanding serious pulling power of his own after a recent royal trip to Malta caused a 71 per cent spike in interest in the area.

Kate was due to travel to the small travel for her first official solo overseas visit but due to the effects of acute morning sickness had to pull out. Into the breach came Prince William, whose role as understudy has sparked a 71 per cent increase of travel interest to Qawra, a popular district in St. Paul's Bay on the northeast of the island. Hotel searches also increased by 60 per cent to the tourist resort of nearby Mellieha and by 41 per cent in Bugibba, which is located adjacent to Qawra.

"Abuse claims: Mahdi Hashi faces life in jail if found guilty of terrorism charges . A British man who disappeared after being stripped of his citizenship claims he was tortured in an African prison before being handed over to the CIA and forced to sign a confession. Mahdi Hashi, who vanished last summer in Somalia, has described for the first time his 'horrific' ordeal at the hands of the secret police in the neighbouring state of Djibouti, who he claims worked closely with US interrogators. The 23-year-old, who lived in London, alleges that he was stripped and repeatedly slapped before being threatened with electrocution and sexual abuse by officers who were attached to Djibouti's intelligence service. Speaking from a top security prison in New York, where his family tracked him down just before Christmas, Mr Hashi claims he was so frightened by the threats of torture that he signed the confession demanded by his American interrogators. In a 35-minute conversation with his British lawyers last week, Mr Hashi also told how he was made to watch as a Swedish detainee was beaten in front of him: '[The man was] stripped to his underwear and hung upside down. 'They beat the soles of his feet, poured cold water on him and said they would electrocute him. There was screaming all around me and it was pretty horrific.' Mr Hashi claims that the next day he was taken out of his cell and warned that if he did not co-operate he would be abused and beaten in the same way. He says the Djibouti interrogators . then stripped him to his underwear, blindfolded him and told him he . would be sexually abused. During . the first three weeks of his detention, Mr Hashi claims he was . interrogated only by Djibouti officers in a cell in the intelligence . headquarters near the US Embassy in a downtown area of the capital, . Djibouti City. Other . detainees sharing his cell told how they had been tortured. He said many . had been forced to endure 'beatings, being sexually abused, being . pinned down naked and their testicles beaten'. Mr . Hashi claims that he was then handed over to the Americans. He . described how the first team of two US interrogators ignored his pleas . to alert the British authorities to his detention and torture. Jails: Mahdi Hashi is in the Metropolitan Correction Center in New York where his family tracked him down just before Christmas . He claims they knew that he had been badly treated, but let him believe that he faced far worse if he refused to co-operate. A second team of three American interrogators – whom he says treated him better – then persuaded him to sign a confession and 'disclaimer' in which he agreed to waive his right to silence. It was also believed at first that Mr Hashi was held for a time at America's military base in Djibouti, Camp Lemonnier. Mr Hashi, a former care worker, lost contact with his family while staying in Somalia last year. When they began looking for him, they were told by Foreign Office officials that the British Government could not provide assistance because Home Secretary Theresa May had issued an order depriving him of his UK citizenship over allegations of Islamic extremism. Now it has emerged that between August and the middle of November he was being questioned by teams of agents from the CIA and FBI while being held in Djibouti. Mr Hashi was picked up with two Swedish Somalis by Djibouti police after he travelled to the country during the summer. After his alleged four-month ordeal, Mr Hashi was shackled and put on a plane to the US, where he is now to stand trial on charges of terrorism. Critics have warned that Mr Hashi's case raises serious concerns about America's reliance on torture techniques and rendition programmes in the fight against terror. Many of these have been highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film Zero Dark Thirty, which focuses on the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. A US Marine at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti City. Mr Hashi claims US interrogators persuaded him to sign a confession . In the movie, which is released on Friday, a prisoner is waterboarded for information about future terror attacks; later, the same prisoner gives up the code name of Osama Bin Laden's courier. It is this information that eventually leads to his capture and death in an isolated Pakistani compound on May 2, 2011. Critics of Zero Dark Thirty, who include Senator John McCain and filmmaker Alex Gibney, say the film is an endorsement of torture because it connects 'enhanced interrogation' to successful and accurate intelligence. Mr Hashi's UK lawyers, Faisal Saifee and Saghir Hussain, claim CIA interrogators fully exploited the torture techniques of the secret police in Djibouti. Mr Hussain said: 'These revelations will cast serious doubts on the credibility of the evidence that is being used against Mahdi. 'The prosecuting authorities in the US should be compelled by the trial judge to explain the exact circumstances in which this evidence was gathered. 'If Britain is involved in rendition to Djibouti or America, Government Ministers need to be reminded that the police have opened a criminal investigation against Jack Straw for the allegations of complicity on the renditions of Gaddafi opponents to Libya. 'The events leading up to the kidnapping and rendition of Mahdi Hashi seem to indicate that while the Government may have changed, old practices continue.' Mr Straw, who was Home Secretary and then Foreign Secretary in Tony Blair's Labour Government, has always strenuously denied these allegations of complicity in rendition. Asim Qureshi, a spokesman for human rights charity Cageprisoners, said: 'We believe that because of the problems that the UK Government has had with deportations and extraditions, it has been easier for them to remove the citizenship of individuals, thus allowing them to be victims of rendition by third-party countries.' Last night it emerged that a British court will hear Mr Hashi's case to restore his British passport. It raises the prospect that his American trial could take place before his lawyers have the chance to challenge the Home Secretary over her decision to strip him of his nationality rights. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission in London dismissed Mrs May's attempts to block Mr Hashi's claim and lifted an anonymity order stopping the media from reporting his case. Documents have also been released by the US Attorney's Office of the Eastern District of New York, which reveal that Mr Hashi and two Swedish men were detained in Africa by 'local authorities' in August before being handed over to the FBI on November 14 and flown to New York the following day. Detained: Mr Hashi was believed to be held for a time at America's military base in Djibouti, Camp Lemonnier (pictured) They accuse the three men of providing material support to al-Shabaab, which is fighting a war against the US-backed government in Somalia. America claims Mr Hashi carried out weapons and explosive training with al-Shabaab and was 'deployed in combat operations to support military action in Somalia'. It adds that he allegedly participated in 'an elite al-Shabaab suicide bomber programme'. If convicted, he faces life in prison. Mr Hashi arrived in London at the age of five after his family left Somalia. Had he remained a British citizen, he would have been put on trial in the UK over allegations of supporting international terrorism. His family strongly deny that Mr Hashi has ever been involved in terrorism and insist that he was planning to return to London to complete his education. The case has led to allegations that the US and the UK governments may have conspired to kidnap him and then send him to Djibouti, where America has a counter- terrorism base. His parents, Mohamed and Kaltun Hashi, first became concerned about their son's safety after being tipped off that he had been taken to a prison in Djibouti. The information was passed to them by another prisoner after their son begged him to get a message to his family. The note contained claims that he had been 'mistreated' and was being interrogated by men working 'for America'. After the prisoner was released, he made his way back to Somalia where he contacted Mr Hashi's wife. Although his mother-in-law travelled from Mogadishu in Somalia to the Djibouti prison in a bid to contact him, prison staff refused to say whether he was there. The family also approached the US authorities, but were told that they had no information about him. In October, The Mail on Sunday revealed that, even though Mr Hashi was not in the UK, the Home Secretary had used a little-known power to deprive him of his rights as a British national. Mrs May has issued at least nine of the deprivation of citizenship orders – which do not require a court order – against British nationals, the majority of whom have been Muslim men. The most public case was that of the Russian spy Anna Chapman, who was married to a UK national. The order signed by Mrs May, and seen by The Mail on Sunday, states that Mr Hashi lost his rights to live in the UK because of the 'public good'. The letter adds: 'As Secretary of State, I hereby give notice... that I intend to have an order made to deprive Mahdi Mohamed Hashi of your British citizenship. 'This is because I am satisfied that it would be conducive to the public good to do so. The reason for this decision is that the Security Service assess that you have been involved in Islamicist extremism and present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom due to your extremist activities.' Mr Hashi's family say they only discovered the harsh terms of the order when they approached the Foreign Office for help to find him. On October 10 last year, the Foreign Office wrote back, saying: 'It is our understanding that Mr Mahdi Mohamed Hashi is no longer a British national, and as such has no right to receive Consular assistance.'","First shocking interview with Mahdi Hashi from his New York cell .

"For the third consecutive quarter, Samsung's profits have taken a hit. And the smartphone maker has reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years, after profits plummeted by 60 per cent compared to this time last year. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September. Scroll down for video . Samsung (headquarters in Seoul pictured) has reported its lowest quarterly earnings in more than three years. Compared to a record-high of £6 billion ($9.5 billion) in 2013, the company achieved £2.5 billion ($3.8 billion) profits for July to September this year . These figures are in line with what Samsung predicted earlier this month, and the firm is blaming the drop on weak sales of its new Galaxy model. The South Korean electronics giant became the biggest smartphone brand thanks to the popularity of earlier Galaxy models. But the larger screen on Apple's new iPhone 6 has been linked with luring customers away from the larger Galaxy range. While in China, local brands are making inroads into Samsung's business. Despite a drop in profits, Samsung has retained its leading position in the global smartphone market during the last quarter. But, it was the only top five manufacturer to record a sales decline. Apple, Xiaomi, Lenovo and LG all posted more than 15 per cent growth in their smartphone shipments, according to market research firm IDC. Samsung's shipments fell 8 per cent to 78.1 million smartphones in the third quarter, and its market share eroded to 24 per cent from 33 per cent this time last year. Samsung's rise to the world's top smartphone maker was helped by its partnership with Google's Android operating system. But other Android handset makers are matching Samsung in terms of performance, features and design. Shares of Samsung Electronics did rise 4 per cent, however, in Seoul. Although the earnings were weak, they were better than some forecasts. Plus Samsung said it is expecting a strong fourth quarter in the run up to Christmas. In response to the dramatic drop, Samsung has vowed to revamp its smartphone range to win back customers. Executives at the South Korean firm said it would overhaul its lower-tier line-up to boost price competitiveness, and use higher-quality components to set its devices apart. 'The mid-to-low end market is growing rapidly, and we plan to respond actively in order to capitalise on that growth,' said Samsung Senior Vice President Kim Hyun-joon during a conference call with analysts. In a rare acknowledgement, the company's head of investor relations added that Samsung had lagged behind changing market conditions. The company's response 'was not quick enough,' said Robert Yi. It plans a significant change in smartphone strategy for next year to seek more 'efficiency,' suggesting that the number of new handsets might be reduced. This would allow the company to focus more on each product. The earnings are below the median of analysts' expectations of £3 billion ($4.9 billion), according to FactSet, a financial data provider. The decline in Galaxy sales has also hurt demand for Samsung components such as an advanced display called OLED. 'The operating margin declined due to increased marketing expenditure and lowered average selling price,' Samsung said. The company said it 'cautiously expects increased shipments of new smartphones and strong seasonal demand for TV products'. Analysts claim the bigger iPhones released last month (shown) will likely take away customers who favoured the Galaxy's larger screens. In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales have been overtaken by local rivals . The latest news comes despite the launch of the Samsung Galaxy S5 (pictured) earlier this year, which was received by mostly rave reviews. The Galaxy S5 handpicked features from its competitors and put them all into a single handset, with some calling it a 'superphone' In emerging markets, such as India and China, Samsung's smartphone sales were overtaken by local rivals. 'Rather than seeking stability, Samsung should seek to distinguish [its phones] with Galaxy's design policies,' Lee Seung-woo, an analyst at IBK Securities said. The company moved the launch of the Galaxy Note 4, a large smartphone with a stylus, to late September from October after Apple unveiled the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. It also began sales of the Galaxy Note 4 in China last month, getting an early start in the world's most populous country before Apple. Last month, Samsung also received upbeat initial responses to its Galaxy Note Edge smartphone (shown), a smartphone with a curved side screen that can display weather, news, apps and other information. But the supply volume for the Edge smartphone will be limited, not giving a big boost to its earnings, analysts said .

With growth momentum in smartphones sagging, Samsung is moving to step up its presence in the semiconductor business. This week, Samsung announced a £9 billion ($15 billion) investment plan to build a new semi-conductor fabrication plant in the South Korean city of Pyeongtaek. The construction will begin before the summer next year and begin operations during the second half of 2017.","Samsung has reported its lowest quarterly earnings in three years .

"If you’re running out of sockets for all your gadgets, there is now a simple solution. Midlands-based Group Gear is selling a power plate complete with two UK 3-pin sockets, as well as two built-in USB ports. The £20 device fits any backbox, up to a depth of 25mm, and is fitted by unscrewing the existing socket and replacing it with the new plate. The £20 USB socket, pictured, is available from Midlands-based firm Group Gear. The plate features two standard UK 3-pin sockets and two USB ports. It fits any backbox up to a depth of 25mm and USB ports are limited to 2 Amps, meaning only the required power is delivered to the devices . The 2 Amp Intelligent Split Power Supply gives a superior charging rate over other Standard USB Charging Plates. Rather than limiting the individual ports to half the overall allowance per port, resulting in slower charging times, the Group Gear USB Charging Plate can power up to 2 Amp from one port. It fits any standard double backbox with a minimum depth of 25mm. It is surge and spike protected, meaning it protects devices from damaging power increases. If no device is connected, the transformer shuts down and power is not supplied to the USB ports. Once a device is plugged in this activates the amplifier and power is supplied to the required USB ports. Many gadgets, from phones to tablets and cameras, feature a micro-USB to USB cable that either plugs into a laptop port, or connects to a 3-pin plug. Other devices feature a proprietary connector, including Apple's Lightning range, connected to a USB. This plate lets people charge four of these devices at the same time. And because the USB ports are limited to 2 Amps, only the required power is delivered to the individual gadgets. If the current exceeds this, it automatically trips off to protect the products. The 3-pin sockets have an output of 13A, 250V AC. ‘Fed up of running out of sockets? You need the revolutionary solution for USB charging’, explained Group Gear. ‘The . two USB ports [allow] you to free up your UK mains sockets for use with . other appliances.

"It might look like your average tower from the outside, but inside, satellites, liquids and fish are plummeting 360 feet (110 metres) to the ground. The drop tower in Bremen, Germany, provides nearly 10 seconds of free-fall to anyone who wants to study the effects of weightlessness on different objects. Also known as the ZARM tower, the building works as an Earth-based version of the International Space Station by briefly placing subjects under the microgravity conditions they would find in space. Scroll down for video... The drop tower in Bremen, Germany, provides nearly 10 seconds of free-fall to anyone who wants to study the effects of weightlessness on different objects . To use the tower, you take a lift up to the top, hook your chosen test subject to a capsule sled and watch as it rapidly falls 360 feet to the ground. Gizmodo reports on how the structure was used for ‘inducing motion sickness in fish,’ as zoologists R.H. Anken and R. Hilbig explained in a 2004 paper published in Advances in Space Research. Previous research found that fish get motion sickness when they move from 1g to microgravity. So the researchers rigged up a camcorder-equipped centrifuge and began dropping the fish in the tower to understand how microgravity affected them, and by association, the human body. As well as the affects of microgravity on fish, the tower has been used to better understand fluid dynamics, process engineering, combustion and materials science. For instance, scientists also used it to understand the behaviour of something called Bose–Einstein condensate- a cloud of ultra-cold atoms which occupy the same quantum state and so act like one supersize quantum particle. The researchers placed the Bose–Einstein condensate in a capsule and dropped it down the shaft inside. Since 2007, the ZARM facility has also offered a catapult mode in which the capsule is propelled vertically to the top of the tower and then drops back down the deceleration chamber. Using this mode the microgravity experiment time can be extended from 4.74 to 9.3 seconds . The idea was to get the quantum object in free fall to watch it expand during a second or so of weightlessness. Such timescales of the condensate’s evolution would be difficult to replicate in laboratory setting because gravity tugs at the atoms and skews the results. Since 2007, the ZARM facility has also offered a catapult mode in which the capsule is propelled vertically to the top of the tower and then drops back down the deceleration chamber. Using this mode the microgravity experiment time can be extended from 4.74 to 9.3 seconds. Unlike the drop mode, the capsule and its enclosed experiment experience an acceleration of up to 35g before the experiment begins. The tower’s current experiments can be viewed here.

"A frail 82-year-old woman has been served with an eviction notice in hospital where she has been since suffering a brain injury nine months ago. Relatives of Joan Parker have spoken of their outrage after a senior NHS manager last week issued her with a letter telling her she had seven days to leave the hospital. The drastic measure was taken by hospital bosses after the great-grandmother became embroiled in a merry-go-round with the local council, which has failed to relocate her to a sheltered home. Homeless: Joan Parker, 82, has been served with an eviction notice from the hospital where she has been a patient since suffering a brain injury nine months ago . The widowed pensioner suffered a brain injury in a fall at her home in February and now requires a warden-patrolled flat which can meet her medical needs. She was declared medically fit by doctors in June but has been trapped in the hospital for months because council officials have failed to find her appropriate accommodation. The bed-blocking situation is all the more painful for Mrs Parker because she herself worked as a warden at a sheltered housing block for most of her working life. Last week the chief operating officer of the hospital served her with a letter telling her to leave her bed within seven days. Eviction: The letter Mrs Parker received from the hospital asking her to leave within seven days. She was so enraged that she tore it up . Her son David, 49, said yesterday: 'He could have posted it to us or even called us, but no. Instead, he decided to serve it directly on a frail 82-year-old lady while she was all alone in her hospital room. 'I think that is as callous as it gets. Mum, to her credit, tore the letter in half there and then and gave it back to him.' He continued: 'The options are very limited. My mum wants to remain as independent as she can. 'She . doesn't want to go into a care home, she wants sheltered housing. We . are at a point of crisis - Mum is homeless as of tomorrow.  We are . desperate and on every waiting list we can be on.' Mr Parker added that because he lives in a split-level house, occupational health workers have deemed it unsuitable for his mother. Mrs Parker’s ordeal began when she fell at her two-storey home in Milton Keynes, Bucks., in February this year and suffered a brain injury. Trapped: Mrs Parker suffered a brain injury after a fall and now requires a warden-patrolled flat. She was declared medically fit by doctors in June but has been trapped in the hospital for months because the council hasn't found suitable accommodation for her . Doctors cleared her as medically fit to leave hospital in June but she didn't leave because council housing officers failed to find her a suitable home to meet her needs. This led to Darren Leech, chief operating officer at Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, serving the OAP with a letter stating that she must leave by today. Mr Parker called the chain of events 'a living nightmare' and spoke of the 'deep irony' that his mother had worked in a sheltered home for the elderly for most of her life. 'In the last nine months I have made hundreds of phone calls and sent thousands of emails but we still can’t find poor old mum a home,' he said. 'Initially, the hospital should have done more to help but thereafter the council has been an absolute nightmare to deal with. Ironic: Mrs Parker's family have described the chain of events 'a living nightmare' and spoke of the 'deep irony' that she worked in a sheltered home for the elderly for most of her life . 'They are trying to drag it out to the bitter end; it’s just pathetic. Poor old mum is having to go through the stress and discomfort of all of this and at 82 years, she deserves better than this. 'The irony in all of this is that mum spent most of her working life as a warden in sheltered housing caring for the elderly and now she can’t get the help that she so desperately needs.' The notice, served on November 22, makes it clear that Mrs Parker has until today to leave the hospital. Mr Parker said this would leave her homeless after she sold her old house with the intention of using £40,000 pounds from the sale to fund her future nursing care. Mrs Parker herself said: 'I did offer to buy sleeping bags and sleep outside the hospital. It is makingme cross.' Mrs Parker said: 'I did offer to buy sleeping bags and sleep outside the hospital. It is making me cross' The typed letter from Mr Leech - featuring an NHS-backed 'We Care' logo at the bottom of the page - said: 'I understand that there is some dispute between you and the council as to your entitlement and the type of accommodation they can offer you. 'Whilst this is an unfortunate situation, you cannot remain in an acute hospital bed indefinitely as has been discussed with you and your family members on previous occasions.' The eviction notice on NHS headed paper reads: 'We are concerned about you remaining in hospital when there is no acute clinical need.  We believe that this will be detrimental to your health and wellbeing generally. 'You do not need to be in hospital and the hospital cannot afford to provide accommodation to persons who do not need to be in hospital.' Mrs Parker’s family said Milton Keynes Council had offered her three properties - a flat in Netherfield, a bedsit in Newport Pagnell and sheltered bedsit in Woburn Sands. Relatives said none was suitable for Mrs Parker - which was a view shared by psychologists and occupational therapists at the hospital. Mr Parker said: 'We are not being fussy. All we want is a little flat in a sheltered house scheme where mum can feel safe.' A spokesman for Milton Keynes . Hospital NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are planning to discharge Mrs . Parker because she is medically fit and no longer needs to be in . hospital.' A spokesman for Milton Keynes Council said: 'We know that Mrs Parker has been through a difficult time and and we have been working with the family to meet Mrs Parker’s housing need. 'We remain absolutely committed to ensuring that Mrs Parker has a new home to go to when she has to leave the hospital, and she will have a further similar selection of sheltered housing to choose from including a formal offer made this week for a flat in Woburn Sands. 'If Mrs Parker does not wish to live in any of the council sheltered properties from the selection offered, she will have independent financial means from the sale of her own home and we would be happy to assist her to find a suitable alternative in the private sector.'","Joan Parker suffered a brain injury during a fall at her home in February .

"Many consider it a joke although others are scared we might never live to see next year thanks to the Mayan calendar’s ‘apocalyptic’ prediction. But Mayan expert Leonzo Barreno, of Saskatchewan, Canada, says the ‘apocalypse’ concept is a false interpretation of the Long Count calendar. The University of Regina journalism professor said Mayan elders taught him that December 21 this year simply marks the start of a new calendar. Prediction: Mayan expert Leonzo Barreno, of Saskatchewan, Canada, says the 'apocalypse' concept is a false interpretation of the Long Count calendar . Mayan calendar: The University of Regina journalism professor said Mayan elders taught him December 21 this year simply marks the start of a new calendar . Mr Barreno, who immigrated to Canada from Guatemala 23 years ago, was trained by Mayan elders to read the calendars, reported CBC News. ‘There are two sides to the story,’ he told CBC. ‘The one that we know is this apocalyptic meaning that has been given to the Long Count. ‘The other side of the story is the Mayan side, which you rarely see on media articles, because they never interview my own people.’ He said Mayan people are featured for just five seconds of the film 2012, starring John Cusack, which is loosely based on their 'predictions'. Ancient: The Mayan Inscriptions' Palace in Chiapas, Mexico, is pictured. Many Mayans dismiss the apocalyptic predictions as largely a Western idea . ‘When I grew up during my training I never hear the word “end of the world” from the elders or spiritual leaders,’ Mr Barreno added. The inscription describes the return of mysterious god Bolon Yokte at the end of a 13th period of 400 years, known as Baktuns, on the equivalent of December 21 2012. It is believed to refer to the end of a cycle of 5,125 years since the beginning of the Mayan Long Count calendar in 3113 B.C. The fragment was a prophecy of ruler Bahlam Ajaw, who wanted to plan the passage of the god. ‘For them it’s a joyous event, not an apocalyptic event. What is coming is the end of a calendar and the beginning of a new one. ‘It’s cyclical,’ he told CBC. ‘This has happened before. According to the elders it’s the fifth time it’s happened.’ Inscriptions in Tortuguero, Mexico, refer to Bolon Yokte 'descending from the sky' in 2012 - a god associated with war and the underworld. Last month German expert Sven Gronemeyer said it may be a misreading and added he also believes it is simply a calendar change. Portrayal: Mayan people are featured for just seconds in the film 2012, starring John Cusack and Morgan Lily, which is loosely based on their 'predictions' Mr Gronemeyer said his decoding of a Mayan artefact with a reference to a 2012 date shows a transition to a new era in the 5,125-year calendar.

Many Mayans also dismiss the apocalyptic predictions as largely a Western idea. In November Mexican anthropologists said a second inscription with the 2012 date was found on a brick at the Comalcalco ruin, near the Tortuguero site. But experts doubt the second inscription was a definite reference to the date cited as the possible end of the world, as it has no future tense.","Leonzo Barreno trained as timekeeper by Mayan elders .

"A Vietnamese airline has been shamed for using bikini-clad models in what looks like a promotional PR stunt. The photographs, which feature models posing provocatively, wearing skimpy outfits in the airline's colours, were leaked on Facebook last week. The models are seen inside the cabin opening the overhead lockers, walking down the aircraft steps and waving sparklers in the images which roused an angry reaction on social networking sites. Be careful when opening the overhead lockers: The revealing snaps have sparked an outrage online . Criticism came after Ngoc Trinh, a lingerie model well-known in Vietnam, posted the images, which were allegedly shot to serve VietJet Air's next promotional campaign. Trinh captioned her photo album: 'Just finished shooting promo photos for VietJet Air for 12 hours nonstop from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm.' The photos went viral on Facebook and attracted negative reviews, with many criticising the airline objectifying women in using them to promote their brand. VietJet Air claimed that photos of models in airline colours were not part of an official advertising campaign . They were later removed from Trinh's Facebook page around Friday. An executive of the airline  denied that the photos were official photos of the carrier's next advertising campaign. Vu Pham Nguyen Tung, the carrier's development director, said the photos were taken during a trial photo shooting for VietJet Air. 'We have yet to decide if we will use these photos or not,' he told Thanh Nien News, denying that the leakage of the photos was just a 'PR ploy' employed by VietJet Air.

"A New York City teenager who admitted being high on marijuana and speeding when he slammed into a tree, splitting his new car in two on a suburban New York highway, was convicted Friday of four counts of vehicular manslaughter in the deaths of his friends. A Nassau County jury returned a partial verdict against Joseph Beer, deadlocking on the top count of aggravated vehicular homicide — a ruling that Beer's attorney interpreted as jurors' failure to agree that marijuana contributed to his client's inability to maneuver on a winding stretch of highway. 'We never denied that there was some responsibility, but the point is, we always maintained, always maintained, that Joseph Beer was not impaired and the impairment by marijuana did not cause this accident,' said attorney Todd Greenberg. Jurors declined to speak with reporters as they left the courthouse. Guilty: Joseph Beer, 19 (main), who was 17 and on a learners permit when he crashed his Subaru in Long Island, killing his four friends, has been convicted of four counts of vehicular manslaughter. He was under the influence of marijuana at the time . Horror crash: This is what Beer's car looked like after Beer lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree in Long Island . Tragedy: (Clockwise from top) Darian Ramnarine, Christopher Khan, Peter Kanhai and Neal Rajaba were all 18-years-old when they were killed in a horrific early-morning crash in Long Island in October 2012 . Beer was 17 when, prosecutors say, he drove in excess of 100 mph on the Southern State Parkway on Long Island, smashing into a tree in October 2012. The crash happened on a stretch of highway dubbed Dead Man's Curve because of a treacherous hill that leads to a sharp curve in the highway. The spectacular crash cut the high-performance Subaru in half. Beer was the lone survivor. The four 18-year-old passengers - Darian Ramnarine, Christopher Khan, Neal Rajaba and Peter Kanhai - were killed. Besides the conviction on manslaughter, Beer, now a 19-year-old Queens college student, was convicted of reckless driving and reckless endangerment. He faces five to 15 years in prison on the vehicular manslaughter conviction. He could have faced up to 25 years had he been convicted of vehicular homicide. Nassau County Judge David Sullivan declared a mistrial on the vehicular homicide charge as well as manslaughter, driving while ability impaired by drugs, and driving without a license. District Attorney Kathleen Rice said no decision has been made on whether to retry Beer on those charges but that a decision would be made ""in a short period of time."" Rice, who is running for Congress, insisted that 'common sense' indicated the teenager was impaired. 'I would make what I think is a reasonable statement by saying anyone who smoked marijuana, the natural intent of that action is to impair oneself,' Rice said at an impromptu news conference following the verdict. 'To what extent that impairs your ability to operate a car, I think common sense dictates that it does impair your ability to operate a motor vehicle at normal speeds, much less when you're driving 110 mph at night in a very fast car.' Greenberg said he would ask the court to deem Beer a youthful offender because the crash happened when he was 17. If granted, Beer would face only four years in prison. Rice said her office would oppose that request.","Joseph Beer was 17 when he smashed into a tree on the Southern State Parkway on Long Island about 3am in October 2012 .

"A developer who mistakenly built a $1.8 million waterfront house on parkland in Rhode Island has been ordered to remove it. The Rhode Island Supreme Court found that the Narragansett home was built entirely on land owned by the Rose Nulman Park Foundation, and therefore must be removed. The developer, Robert C Lamoureux and his company Four Twenty Corp., began building the home in 2009, but it didn't discover the error until 2011. It argued it should not be penalized for an innocent surveying mistake. Parkland: This Rhode Island house was built on lands dedicated to recreation and contemplation . Secluded: The house sits in a prime ocean-front position surrounded by uninhabited land on one side and the sea on the other . The court said the park's property rights outweighed that. The three-storey house on Point Judith has water views from Newport to Watch Hill and a rooftop cabana with a Jacuzzi and a wet bar and was completed in January 2011. The luxurious three-bedroom home looks to be the ideal seaside idyll, but has remained uninhabited after a potential buyer conducted a survery and found that the home sits squarely on public parkland. James E. Kelleher, Lamoureaux's lawyer, asked the court to allow his client to pay for the land or trade it for other waterfront property instead of removing the home, reports the Providence Journal. He told the court, 'The harm to my client is $1.7 million.' Luxurious: The home has a wet bar, wraparound balcony and rooftop Jacuzzi - but it's never been inhabited, after a potential buyer found that it had been built on a site dedicated to parklands . Demolish or remove: A court has ruled that the house must go - it's unclear whether it will be demolished or moved to another site . The judge asked why the Rose Nulman Park should give up six per cent of its land to Lamoureux when it had done nothing wrong. Kelleher argued that Lamoureux hadn't done anything wrong either, and was a victim of a surveying mistake. He said Lamoureux had paid an engineering firm thousands of dollars to survey the land and was 'utterly shocked' to discover that the actual site of the house had never been surveyed. Saul Nulman, a New York City businessman, bought land at Point Judith in 1993 and trasferred the land to the foundation in 2006 before he died. The land is dedicated to his mother, Rose Nulman, to be a place of recreation and contemplation. Foundation lawyer Mark Freel says it's not known whether the unoccupied house can be moved or will have to be torn down. He says the house has been there for a long time already, and it's time for it to go.","The Rhode Island Supreme Court ordered a developer to remove a luxurious three-story house from its site .

"Guilty: James McCormick (pictured leaving the Old Bailey today) made £50million from the sales of bogus bomb detectors to Itraq, Belgium and the United Nations . A businessman sold fake bomb detectors based on £13 novelty golf ball finders to security forces around the world, a court heard yesterday. James McCormick, 56, imported large shipments of ‘Golfinders’ from the US and then sold them as bomb detectors for up to £27,000 each, it was alleged. But the devices were ‘completely ineffectual as a piece of detection equipment’, jurors were told. McCormick had simply attached stickers bearing the words International Association of Bomb Technicians to them to give them an air of authenticity. He produced glossy brochures to trick potential investors into believing the devices could detect tiny amounts of explosive from three miles away, the Old Bailey heard. He claimed they could detect explosives, drugs and ivory through walls, up to 30ft underground and 100ft underwater, jurors were told. They could also detect fluids and human beings. But experts allegedly found that the bomb detectors were identical to cheap plastic handheld golf ball finders. The defendant sold a large shipment of fake bomb detectors to Iraq where they were used by police to search for explosives, it was said. Nigel Gallier, a former colonel in the Army, wrote a report to his superiors which said it was obvious to him they did not work. The detectors were also sold to Niger in Africa and to Georgia, the former Soviet state. Attempts were made to supply them to United Nations security forces in Lebanon, but the deal was never done. McCormick, who owns a farmhouse near Bristol and a Regency home on millionaires’ row in Bath, denies three counts of fraud. Prosecutor Richard Whittam, QC, said McCormick made ‘a handsome but unwarranted profit’. During one year alone, a company linked to McCormick was paid almost £850,000 for just under 6,000 cases to house the detector units. Model: Advanced Detection Equipment 651. Prosecutors said the devices were little more than golf ball finders . Exclusive: Number 7 the Circus in Bath, formerly owned by Hollywood actor Nicholas Cage, where Jim Mcormick owned a terraced house . Mr Whittam said the devices sold to security forces did not work ‘in accordance with the known laws of physics’. They were ‘completely ineffectual as a piece of detection equipment’ and were no better at identifying bombs than trying to detect them by random chance. ‘Rather than being designed and made as a result of an extensive research and development programme, the [device] was actually a golf ball finder that could be purchased in the USA for less than $20,’ he said. ‘The devices did not work and McCormick knew they did not work. But he had manufactured them so they could be sold despite the fact they did not work. When you learn of the claims made about what these devices were capable of you may think those claims incredible.’ Device: The Advanced Detection Equipment 651 was sold for tens of thousands of dollars . Contract: Iraqi soldiers use an ADE 651 bomb detector at a checks during a security checkpoint mission in Abu T'Shir, Iraq, in 2008 . The brochures produced by McCormick featured pictures of men in military outfits alongside claims the bomb detectors could ‘bypass all concealment methods’. McCormick allegedly wrote that they could be used at airports, border control points, military bases, prisons and nuclear plants. He offered three machines for sale through two firms – Broadcast and Telecom Ltd and ATSC – between 2007 and 2012. These were called ADE 650, ADE 651 and ADE 101. Inside: The reception room at number 7 Circus in Bath, the house formerly owned by Hollywood actor Nicholas Cage, where McCormick owned a terraced house . Luxury: The property in Bath also has an indoor swimming pool . When police raided McCormick’s properties in July 2010 they found invoices for hundreds of golf ball finders. A leaflet about the Golfinders discovered at his home said: ‘It’s a great novelty item that you should have fun with.’ Mr Whittam showed the jury pictures of a golf ball finder and one of the devices the defendant allegedly sold. He told jurors they were practically identical ‘in terms of shape, size, weight and construction’. He said: ‘In reality, save for the stickers, they were indistinguishable. What that means is that they came from the same mould. The golf ball finder had been rebadged as an ADE 101.’ Although created from the same mould as the Golfinder, some of McCormick’s devices had minor modifications, the jury heard. The trial continues.

"He is the British Prime Minister who liked his martinis as dry as dust and famously said the way to get it right was to simply look at the vermouth bottle while pouring the gin. And now, to honour Winston’s upcoming birthday, The Churchill Bar & Terrace has created a martini in his honour – with a very unusual ingredient. The cocktail includes moisture extracted from the walls of his War Rooms, the underground complex in which he lived during the Blitz. Vintage drink: Sir Winston Churchill loved a good martini and to celebrate his birthday, one bar has unveiled a cocktail in his honour - and they've used the moisture from the walls of the Churchill War Rooms to make it extra authentic . The signature ingredient of the War Rooms Martini is the Robin Collective's Churchill Historical Bitters, which is infused with essence sucked out of the walls using a device similar to a dehumidifier. The bitters are expertly blended with the Churchill Bar's own Churchill Craft Gin, which is heavy in juniper and citrus. The £15 drink has been created by . members of the Experimental Food Society and is being served next . month at the bar within the Hyatt Regency London to mark the great . British icon's birthday on November 30. The tipple is served in an antique martini glass and garnished with a gin-washed baby beetroot, which makers claim gives it an earthy flavour that deepens in taste and colour as the beetroot infuses the drink. The Churchill Bar & Terrace's Bar Manager, Alan B, hopes the cocktail will offer patrons the chance to raise their glass to the great British icon who led Britain to victory in World War II. Spartan: The wartime bunker sheltered the Prime Minister and his government during the Blitz (his bedroom is pictured) The Churchill Bar & Terrace was designed with a young Winston and his beloved wife Clementine in mind. It is home to an elegant library curated by local specialist booksellers - Daunt Books – and features a range of works Churchill and Clementine might have enjoyed. Newly launched, the Churchill Historical Bitters are the third in a series created by The Robin Collective that have seen them painstakingly extract essences from the residences of some of Britain's most loved personalities. Each is blended with a range of ingredients inspired by different aspects of the particular icon's life. The Churchill Historical Bitters feature cigar tobacco, British orchard fruits, berries and nuts and numerous other botanicals including liquorice root, black walnut leaf, mustard, gentian root, grains of paradise and rosehip to represent the roses that Churchill's beloved wife Clementine sent to him every day. Shaken or stirred? The tipple is served at The Churchill Bar and Terrace, created to pay tribute to the late Prime Minister . The team recently created a bitter to pay tribute to Scottish physician and writer, Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. They extracted moisture from his central London office in Barts Pathology Museum, where he reportedly wrote the fictional series. Next on the agenda is a Charles Dickens bitter, which they will obtain from the walls of his former home, now a museum. History - and alcohol - fans will be able to get their hands on The Churchill Historical Bitters at the Experimental Food Society Spectacular at the Old Truman Brewery on Friday 8 and Saturday 9 November.

"A stunning clifftop known as the Troll's Tongue has become a magnet for thrill-seeking hikers. Groups of tourists flock to the breathtaking Trolltunga landmark in southern Norway, which sits a dizzying 700 metres above the Ringedalsvatnet Lake. No safety railing has been constructed on the edge of the cliff, which is just several metres wide, as tourism bosses want to preserve the natural beauty of the landmark.

"Two-thirds of Britons cannot say anything in a foreign language – with one fifth even unsure of what ‘bonjour’ means, a study claims. The findings appear to confirm the cliche about Britons being notoriously bad at making an effort to speak the lingo when abroad. Overall, 64 per cent of those polled admitted they did not know a single word in any language other than English. Tongue-tied: Reasons for not trying to speak a local language included not being bothered, fear of making a mistake or expecting hosts to be able to speak English . And just one third – 34 per cent –  said they were willing to make an attempt at speaking a foreign language while on holiday. One fifth (19 per cent) did not know the meaning of the French word for hello, one of the most recognisable foreign greetings in the world. And 63 per cent had no idea what the Dutch word ‘goedemorgen’ meant, despite the obvious similarities to our own ‘good morning’. Young Britons were found to be worst at making the effort, with nearly half – 47 per cent – of those aged 16 to 24 admitting they have never spoken the foreign language they learned at school. 'Una cerveza por favor': Unsurprisingly is one of the few phrases British people seem to understand . But 45 per cent of the over-55s said they liked to try to speak the local language when abroad, the poll of 2,000 adults by travel website Hotels.com found. It is compulsory for all pupils to study a foreign language up to the age of 14 and French, German and Spanish are all on the national curriculum. Yet only one in ten of those polled considered themselves able to speak one of them. Of these, a quarter could ask only ‘everyday questions’, 21 per cent  said they were limited to ‘hello’ and ‘goodbye’, and one in 50 claimed they  could understand everything said to them in another language, but were unable to reply. The phrases they did take the trouble to learn were somewhat revealing of priorities. Almost half – 43 per cent – knew ‘una cerveza por favor’ meant ‘a beer please’ in Spanish. Reasons for not trying to speak a local language included not being  bothered, fear of making a mistake or expecting hosts to be able to speak English.

"Only one in 25 homes sold last month exceeded the asking price. The figure, released yesterday by the National Association of Estate Agents, adds to evidence that the property market is finally cooling. It found that just 4 per cent of buyers had to pay over the odds in July – compared with 20 per cent in both March and May. Two thirds of owners did not receive the advertised price. Just 4 per cent of buyers paid more than the asking price for a house in July, while website Rightmove has revealed house prices had their biggest ever August fall, dropping 2.9 per cent . The website Rightmove has already said asking prices have had their biggest ever August fall – dropping 2.9 per cent on July. More than 520 estate agents were interviewed by the NAEA, and nine out of ten said stamp duty was harming the market and needed reform. A third agreed with the statement that the tax, which is paid on homes sold for more than £125,000, ‘frequently deters house buyers from moving to their ideal house’. Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just 1 per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more. Today it is charged at that rate only on properties between £125,000 and £250,000. The rate is then 3 per cent up to £500,000, with rates continuing to rise to a maximum of 7 per cent on homes over £2million. Mark Hayward, managing director of the NAEA, said there was growing evidence that house prices are ‘on the decline’. He said: ‘A significant number of homes being sold are going for less than the asking price. ‘This not only signals an appetite for movement in the market, but is also positive news for current house buyers, especially when faced with the prospect of potentially having to pay higher rates of stamp duty for higher priced houses.’ Savills predicts house prices will continue to rise for the next five years across the UK, jumping by nearly 26 per cent by the end of 2018. But it says the rate of annual growth will slow down significantly. Prices will supposedly rise by 9.5 per cent this year, but by only 4 per cent in 2015, slowing down to 3.5 per cent in both 2016 and 2017 and finally to 3 per cent in 2018. Nine out of ten estate agents interviewed by the NAEA said stamp duty was hurting the property market and needed to be reformed . Lucian Cook, UK head of residential research at the estate agency, said: ‘These extraordinary rates of house price growth cannot continue in the current, more regulated mortgage environment, particularly in the face of likely interest rate rises.’ Around three million working parents in England are cutting back on buying food in order to be able to pay their rent or mortgage, according to the housing charity Shelter. Its report, published today, warns that the budgets of many ordinary working families are ‘stretched to breaking point by high housing costs’. They are at risk of losing their homes when the Bank of England raises the base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent. Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: ‘No parent should be forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying for the roof over their children’s heads. ‘These shocking figures show that millions of us are having to make these kind of agonising choices every day.'","House prices fell 2.9 per cent between July and August, biggest ever fall .

"How many sexual partners have you had? If the answer is five then the search for 'the one' could be over. MSN have developed a love formula that can work out the key ingredients for a successful long lasting relationship, and it has revealed that the number of sexual partners someone has can affect their relationship success. The formula has been devised for those . looking to give their love life a bit of a spring clean - be that by . taking their relationship to the next level or by completely . re-evaluating it. A new study reveals that we tend to settle down with our fifth sexual partner as that is when we are most sure of what we want from a relationship . According to the 2,000 men and women surveyed to create the formula, we are most likely to settle with lover number five. Exactly a quarter (25 per cent) of both men and women believe their partner should have had a fair amount of experience with four sexual partners before them - though one in five men (21 per cent) are holding onto tradition believing they should be their ideal woman’s FIRST partner. Being funny is a big turn on apparently as when it comes to personality, the . number one character trait both men and women search for in a partner is . wit. How you act between the sheets also matters. Some 26 per cent of men believe that a successful relationship . needs to involve good sex in order to succeed where as only 13 per cent of . women believe this to be true. The Love Formula is a slightly complicated mathematical puzzle, but psychologist Corrine Sweet believes it's not to be sniffed at and really could help us work out if we're with 'the one' 1) Firstly, multiply the amount of years you knew each . other before you became an item by .5 then add the number 8 to this number. Let's call this total number the 'special number' 2) Separately, add together the number of previous . partners for both people and multiply by .2. Minus this total from the special . number total . 3) Multiply 9 by the importance the male attaches to . honesty (importance is ranked at 1 to 5 where 1 is least and 5 is most important). Add this to the special number total . 4) Then add the value the woman places on money (scale of . 1 to 5 again) multiplied by 3 to the special number . 5) Add together the importance both place on humour . (using the scale of 1 to 5 again) and add this to the special number . 6) Multiply the value both place on good looks (added . together) by .3. Minus this number from the running special number . 7) Separately, minus the importance the female places on . sex from the amount the male places on sex. Multiple this result by .5 then . square the result (i.e multiply it by itself). Minus this result from the . special number . 8) Add the importance the couple attached to inlaws . (added together) to the special number . 9) Multiply the importance the couple places on children (added . together) by 1.5, then add this number to the special number . 9) The final 'special number' is the amount of years . you'll be together . MSN’s relationship expert and psychologist Corinne Sweet says that the reason we wait till partner number five to settle is because we are most sure of ourselves then. 'Most people enter a serious relationship, hoping it will last forever.  Few know that it’s only by the time they get to sexual partner number five that they really know what they want, and are confident to voice it. When it comes to personal traits both men and women search for good wit in a long term partner . 'Good looks might help sexual attraction, but they don’t last forever, so it’s important to look at your partner’s personality, wants and desires as well.' She goes on to say that the MSN love formula is not something to be sniffed at and can really help us work out what we want from a relationship. 'The MSN Spring love formula can help determine the traits we should be looking for.  It can even indicate how long a relationship might last based on compatibility and mutual goals.  Forewarned is forearmed, even in love.' Michael Walter from Winchester, Hants, has been with his girlfriend for two years and spent ten minutes working out the equation of the MSN love formula. The 30-year-old said: 'I spent a few minutes working out the formula and it revealed I will stay with my girlfriend for 33 years and 3 months.I'm delighted with the results, we've only been together for a year and a half and these results are promising.' Although Michael was pleased with his long lasting result he was a little concerned as to what might happen once the 33 years are up. Although we do not have plans to get married, 33 years is incredibly encouraging, though I do wonder what is going to happen at that point!'

"After the devastating loss of her husband, lonely millionairess Christine Ince thought she had found love again with a younger Gambian man. Aware of the potential pitfalls, the 59-year-old widow spent a year getting to know Mustapha Jabbai, 36, before agreeing to marry him. The mother of three believed his intentions were honourable because he had a permanent job in the UK and had never asked her about her wealth. Better days: Lonely millionairess Christine Ince, 59,  thought she had found love again with Mustapha Jabbai, 36, seen here in 2007 . However, shortly after their second anniversary, Mr Jabbai walked out of her £850,000 five-bedroom detached home in the picturesque village of Tilbrook, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire. Hours later, Mrs Ince discovered their wedding certificate and other documents Mr Jabbai would need to stay in the UK were missing. Worse was to follow. Mr Jabbai then filed for divorce and is demanding the millionairess pay him maintenance and a one-off separation payment and set him up with a pension. In a witness statement for the divorce hearing, Mrs Ince claims the marriage was a ‘sham’ so ‘he could get an indefinite leave to remain visa’. Assets: Christine stands outside her £850,000 five-bedroom detached home in the picturesque village of Tilbrook, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire . She goes on to accuse Mr Jabbai of bigamy and claims the woman he introduced to her as his sister is actually his Gambian wife Yama Jabbai. Mrs Ince believes he walked out on her just after their two-year anniversary because he had spent long enough married to her to be granted the right to stay in Britain. ‘At the time, I believed he cared for me,’ she said in her statement. ‘I have been made ill by Mustapha’s betrayal of my trust, by his lies and deceit. I feel violated as if I have been raped. ‘It is distressing for me to have lived with someone and to find out I actually know nothing about them. Smiles: Their wedding in December 2007. She met the Gambian, who had a permanent job in the UK, on a dating site . 'He has used me and my commitment to him to gain entry into the UK and [obtain] the legal right to stay here.’ Mrs Ince, a former management accountant, married Bill Ince in 1977 in Chertsey, Surrey. They went on to have three children – Elizabeth, now 31, Charlotte, 29, and Robert, 25. Her husband, a joint-owner of a major tyre company, collapsed at their home in 2003 and died six weeks later, at the age of 63. Mrs Ince went on to have breast cancer but has since recovered. After a tough three years, friends persuaded her to sign up to popular dating website Plenty of Fish. She met Mr Jabbai, who was working for PC World in Reading, on the site and the pair enjoyed a series of dates. Meeting the family: Christine Ince and Mustapha Jabbai at their engagement party in July 2007 . Family ties: Christine Ince with her new husband's family after her wedding to Mustapha on the 6th December 2007 in the Gambia . Mrs Ince told the Daily Mail: ‘Mustapha was different to all the other men I had met through the dating site. ‘He didn’t try to get me into bed straight away and he didn’t ask me about how much money I had, which some men did. 'He . wasn’t a stunning man by any means but he seemed kind and caring. I . know there are guys around who see me as a target because of my wealth. ‘So I checked Mustapha out in lots of ways and with lots of questions. But he never faltered and was so plausible.’ After a year the couple  travelled to the city of Brikama in Gambia where they married in front of Mr Jabbai’s family and friends. But when they returned to the UK, Mr Jabbai began to demand money from his new wife, she claims. Experiencing her husband's culture: Christine with Jabbai's family in the Gambia in 2007 . Mrs Ince says she travelled to the visa office in Croydon where she paid £1,000 for his permanent visa. During their two-year marriage, she spent £30,000 on him which he has not repaid, she alleges. ‘After he walked out, I realised what had happened and I felt so foolish and gullible,’ she said. ‘But now I am angry because he is trying to get money from me through the divorce courts. It feels like I am on trial even though I’m the one that has been duped.’ Mr Jabbai left Mrs Ince’s home in March 2010, saying he was going to the dentist. He never returned. Loss: Christine with her late husband Bill Ince in 2001 . First wedding: Christine with her first husband, Bill, on their wedding day in 1977 . The Mail has learned that two months before this, he won the right to permanently stay in the UK. Mr Jabbai, who now lives in Coventry, has denied the accusations in a letter sent by his legal firm Hammon Solicitors to Mrs Ince. When the Mail asked for a response from a man fitting his description at an address registered to Mr Jabbai, he claimed he was someone else. The most recent statistics show that in 2008, 115 Gambians were granted citizenship after marrying UK nationals. Immigration Minister Damian Green said last night: ‘We are considering requiring couples to complete a five-year probation to prove their marriage is genuine before they are eligible for settlement. ‘We will always seek to revoke the settlement rights of any foreign national who has used deception to obtain it.’","Widow, 59, married young Gambian a year after meeting him on dating website .

Scientists hope that by analysing the super mice in microgravity, they will be able to create drugs for use by humans to prevent muscle loss on Earth. Scroll down for video . A group of 'super moustronauts' was yesterday launched into space with remarkable abilities.These mice lack a gene that normal mice have, called Muscle Ring Finger 1 (MuRF-1), which causes muscles to deteriorate. Pictured is a mouse on a model of the ISS . The 10 mice are the first mammals, excluding humans, to spend a month in space. The typical stay for mice for previous missions has been around two weeks. MuRF-1 is responsible for marking proteins for destruction in both human and mouse muscles. It also plays a key role in accelerated muscle loss through ageing and other chronic diseases. For their mission, Nasa has created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station, which include systems to stop their food and water from floating around. 'By flying a mouse, whose typical lifespan is much shorter than humans', you can follow the course of bone and muscle loss over a much greater percentage of the mouse lifespan than you can in humans,' Michael Roberts, the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space's senior research manager, told Francie Diep at Popular Science. Nasa has created special homes for the mice to live in on the space station, which include systems to stop their food and water from floating around . Six national space programs have so far flown animals into space: the Soviet Union, the United States, France, China, Japan and Iran. They were used as surrogates to test the suitability of the space environment for human habitation. Fruit flies were the first animals to be sent into orbit when they were put on board a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on February 20, 1947. Two years later, Albert II, a Rhesus Monkey, became the first monkey to go into space. In November 1957 Russia sent Laika the dog into orbit aboard the Soviet Sputnik 2 spacecraft. Then, on January 31, 1961, Ham became the first chimpanzee launched into outer space as part of the Nasa space programme. This is of particular interest to space agencies who are racing to get the first humans on Mars. Any astronaut undertaking the journey will need to spend long stretches in space. However, microgravity in space means that astronauts no longer need to use certain muscles, causing them to slowly waste away. 'Muscles are the storage space for amino acids, the only reservoir for them,' said Sam Cadena, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research program manager. 'If you lose muscle, you lose health.' As well as the mice, Sunday's cargo shipment to the ISS included a 3D printer, a device for measuring Earth's ocean winds, 30 fruit flies and metal samples for a golf club manufacturer. Much-needed spacesuit batteries are on board as well, along with the usual supply of food, clothes and electronic gear. The mice are the first mammals, excluding humans, to spend a month in space.

"Michael Pell experienced a sudden, excruciating pain in his back . Tending to his much-loved garden one winter's morning, Michael Pell experienced a sudden, excruciating pain in his back, which left his legs feeling dead. The pain came on suddenly and, initially, Michael, from Dartmoor, Devon, thought one of the deer that roam the remote area had kicked him. 'It was like nothing I'd ever felt before,' says Michael, 69, a retired hairdresser. 'I noticed I had no sensation from my lower back to my knees. When I realised it wasn't an animal, I thought it might be severe cramp, as I'd been working outside for four hours, mostly on my knees. 'I crawled 100 yards to our back door. I then pulled myself half up, but still had no feeling in the top half of my legs. My wife, Penny, had to help me to sit down. 'Although my feet and ankles worked, I had no control over my lower legs. I also had a burning sensation around my buttocks and down most of my legs.' What Michael had suffered that day in January 2012 was a stroke, not to his brain, as usually happens, but his spine. Normally, a stroke is caused either by a blockage to the blood supply to the brain, or a bleed from a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain. With a spinal stroke, the same principles apply, but the blockage or bleed affects the spinal cord. Stretching from the base of the brain to the small of the back, the spinal cord is a key part of the body's central nervous system, which transmits instructions from the brain to the rest of the body. Like the brain, the cord needs a constant blood supply to provide oxygen and nutrients. if it is halted, the nerves quickly become damaged and some die. As a result, these stop sending messages from the brain to the muscles - which muscles this affects depends on where the stroke occurs. Scroll down for video . If a person has a stroke around the mid-section of their spinal cord, they may suffer paralysis in their legs, but everything above this will be unaffected. But a stroke around the neck section of the spinal cord could affect the muscles in the arms. The most common cause of spinal strokes, as with brain strokes, is a build-up of cholesterol plaque in an artery wall, which then blocks it. Alternatively, small vessels supplying the spine rupture, due to abnormalities of the vessel walls or malformations of the vessels, says Tony Rudd, professor of stroke medicine at London's King's College Hospital. Some patients have a spinal stroke during surgery, for example, while treating an aneurysm, a bulge in a blood vessel, especially if it's in the aorta in the abdomen. A stent, or hollow tube, is usually inserted into the aorta to strengthen its wall. This temporarily blocks blood flow to the spine, so the risk of a spinal stroke increases. What Michael had suffered that day in January 2012 was a stroke in his spine . 'Obesity or smoking are also causes, as fatty deposits make arteries narrow and raise blood pressure, putting strain on the body,' says Professor Rudd. 'Normally, there is no warning: only in rare cases do patients experience a slight weakness in their legs briefly beforehand.' Of the 152,000 strokes in the UK each year, spinal strokes make up about 1.25 per cent, says the Stroke Association. For some, 'a spinal stroke can prove fatal towards the neck, as it can have a devastating impact on nerves to muscles, which control breathing and the diaphragm', says Professor Rudd. most spinal stroke victims will survive, but are often left with life-long disabilities. 'Unfortunately, the prognosis for spinal stroke patients is not great,' says Professor Rudd. While other parts of the brain are able to take over other functions in brain stroke patients, once the wires are cut in the spinal cord, there's no route for sensory messages. Treatments include reducing the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid, a clear liquid found in the cavities around the brain and spinal cord. Following spinal stroke, this can build up around where it struck. Draining some, via a lumbar puncture in the lower back, can reduce pressure, improving blood flow. 'Otherwise, the only treatment is rehabilitation through physiotherapy and exercise,' says Professor Rudd. Alex Rankin, director of services at spinal injury charity Aspire, says spinal strokes bring different problems in different patients. 'Most people think of not being able to walk, but there can be loss of bladder and bowel function due to nerve damage, or skin issues including pressure sores, as they have lost their sense of touch. 'Most people cannot sweat below the level of their injury, so are more likely to overheat. they also face circulation issues and so are more likely to feel the cold. There can be pain issues, too.' It can lead to fatal complications if the patient is left paralysed. 'Being more immobile puts patients at risk of pneumonia, caused by an infection in the lungs, and bladder infections. if they're lying for long periods, bed sores that become infected and lead to septicaemia - potentially fatal blood poisoning - become a concern,' says Professor Rudd. Michael Pell had no idea of such risks when he suffered his spinal stroke: he thought he'd suffered a minor back injury, and even had lunch afterwards, although the 'deadness' in his legs and burning sensation remained. Michael still struggles to walk, as he is so unsteady . Later that afternoon, he called NHS Direct, who recommended going to A&E. He underwent various examinations, but, initially, the cause was unclear. Spinal stroke can be hard to detect, and common causes of numbness in the legs are often explored first. As the numbness in Michael's legs meant he'd lost control of his bowels and bladder, he stayed in hospital for further tests. A week later, possible causes such as a slipped disc, trapped nerve, severe inflammation, or a tumour had been ruled out. Because of continued weakness in his legs, he had an MRI scan of his spine, and spinal stroke was diagnosed. 'I'd never heard of it, but was relieved this stroke allowed me to function and talk,' says Michael, who, despite being a light social drinker and smoker, had been fit and active. He remained in hospital for two weeks, where full feeling to his left leg and his ability to control going to the toilet returned. He learned to walk again using a Zimmer frame, before using a walking stick for a few months, while undergoing rehabilitation and physiotherapy. Michael now takes daily medicines, including blood-thinning pills and cholesterol-lowering statins, to ward off stroke, and gabapentin, for long-term nerve damage, to dampen the burning sensation in his right leg. 'If I forget to take it, it's like I'm standing next to our Aga cooker,' he says. 'My right leg still feels dead above the knee. I can stick a pin in it and don't feel anything. But, if our cat's tail lightly touches my bare leg, it's like an electric shock. The nerves are so damaged, they act in an unusual way - the lighter the touch, the greater the sensation, it seems.' Michael still struggles to walk, as he is so unsteady. He can no longer carry anything when moving. He continues to be a keen gardener, but uses a ride-on mower. He can't bend down easily, so he lies on the ground for less arduous tasks. 'My consultant said if feeling didn't return within 18 months, it never would. So, I've accepted I'll always walk with my leg dragging behind me,' says Michael. 'But I haven't let it stop me, and it has made me appreciate more what I can achieve in the garden.' ngs.org.uk .","Michael Pell, 69, from Dartmoor, experienced excruciating pain in his back .

"High school students in Florida have caused concern among religious leaders after posting a picture online of a drinking game called 'Jews vs Nazis' beer pong. The picture, which features cups set out in the shape of a swastika and the Star of David, was apparently submitted to a Twitter feed by students from Cape Coral High School, in Florida. The @HSConfessional post, which has now been retweeted nearly 1,800 times, also makes the claim that: 'This is what we play at parties.' High school students in Florida allegedly posted this picture of 'Jews vs Nazis' beer pong online . Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz, of the Chabad Lubavitch, of Southwest Florida, told Fox4 said: 'As a rabbi, I like to look at the world as a beautiful place. 'So, my first assumption is let's assume it's just children that are immature with no ill intent, not trying to be malice.' He added: 'This is a wake up call. We are not doing enough of a job educating people to be nicer, kinder, more polite.' Beer pong is a drinking game which sees players throw a ping pong ball across a table towards cups of beer, which are traditionally arranged in the shape of a triangle. If the ball lands in a cup the opposition has to drink the contents and the cup is removed from the table. The winner is the first team to remove all of the opposition's cups from the table. Rabbi Yitzchok Minkowicz, of the Chabad Lubavitch, of Southwest Florida, said: 'This is a wake up call. We are not doing enough of  a job educating people to be nicer, kinder, more polite' Beer pong is traditionally played with cups arranged in triangles . This is not the first drinking game that has been brought to the public attention this year. The NekNominate craze, which is thought to have originated in Australia, has been heavily criticised by alcohol awareness charities for promoting dangerous levels of binge drinking. The drinking challenge has claimed at least five lives in the past year.","High school students in Florida post picture of drinking game online .

"The omens are good that 2012 will be an excellent year, a leading druid said today, after the sun shone on Stonehenge during a dawn ceremony to mark the winter solstice. Organisers of next year's London Olympics could perhaps take heart from the positive pronouncement by Rollo Maughfling, the arch druid of the standing stones in Wiltshire, after this morning's ceremony. He said that the sun rising over the horizon at the end of the ceremony, bathing more than 1,000 people who attended in pale light, meant good things for the next 12 months.

"Some predatory spiders pose as ladybirds and even tree stumps to look as unthreatening as possible. But this caterpillar takes the opposite approach by masquerading as a snake in an attempt to scare away predators. The vivid green 'snake caterpillar' creates the illusion of looking like a dangerous reptile by retracting its legs and expanding the end of its body, which have markings that look like eyes. Sssscary: Unlike spiders that pose as less predatory creatures, this caterpillar masquerades as a snake in an attempt to scare away predators . The snake-like caterpillar grows into the moth Hemeroplanes triptolemus. Its chest and wings are covered in scales and the moth feeds on nectar. The sizeable creatures only live for between 10 and 30 days and can be found in Costa Rica, Belize Mexico and Guatemala. In larval form, the species looks like a snake and even mimics its behaviour as it can harmlessly strike at potential predators. Professor Daniel Janzen captured the images as part of his work cataloguing caterpillars and says it is part of the hemeroplanes species. As well as looking like a snake, the cunning caterpillar even behaves like one. When in a larval state, before transforming into a moth, the creature can strike in defence if it is approached – even though it doesn't have a snake’s capability of administering a bite.

When it is a larvae before transforming into a moth, the creature can strike in defence if it is approached - even if it does not have the snake's capability of administering a bite . Professor Janzen, who is a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania, photographed the insect while working in the Area de Conservacion Guanacaste, Costa Rica. ‘To normal people this caterpillar might look weird and scary, but for me it's just a walk in the park,’ he said. ‘Every caterpillar in Costa Rica looks like something else - be it a leaf, twig or in this case, a slithering snake.

Great pretender: Professor Janzen, who is abiologist at the University of Pennsylvannia, said: 'Every caterpillar in Costa Rica looks like something else - be it a leaf, twig or in this case, a slithering snake' Just another strange insect: Professor Janzen said: 'To normal people this caterpillar might look weird and scary, but for me it's just a walk in the park' ‘Over the years I've seen and photographed so many different types of bugs I'm never surprised, but they always interest me.’ Professor Janzen has been tracking Costa Rica's species of caterpillar since 1978 and has been an insect expert for 50 years. He spends half a year at the university and the other half combing habitats in Central America for unusual creatures, such as this caterpillar. A very creepy crawly: 'Over the years I've seen and photographed so many different types of bugs I'm never surprised, but they always interest me,' Professor Janzen said.

"It may look like an unremarkable pile of rocks in the middle of an inhospitable Israeli desert. But archaeologists have discovered that this primitive structure is in fact a 5,000-year-old trap used to capture leopards. They had originally thought that the trap was much younger, and the revelation of its true age suggests that farmers in the area were much more advanced that originally thought. Ancient: The trap is designed to lure leopards in through the front with some bait, before slamming shut behind it . The trap was found in the Negev desert in the south of Israel by researchers from the Geological Survey of Israel, according to Live Science. It was not far from a similar example, which is little more than 1,600 years old. This led scientists to believe that the much more ancient trap was of a similar age. But a sophisticated test which can age materials based on how much residual radiation they have absorbed over thousands of years showed that these slabs had been in place some 2,000 years before the foundation of Rome. At least 50 similar traps have been . found in the Negev region, but this is the first one to suggest the . extreme age of this construction, which is as old as the world's . earliest farming civilisations. The enduring piece of technology is almost identical to traps used by the nomadic Bedouin peoples as recently as a century ago. Subtle: The trap, seen here from behind, was found in the Negev desert in Israel . Naomi Porta, who co-authored a study on the trap, said: 'The most exciting thing is the antiquity of these carnivore traps, which is totally unexpected. 'They look like a pile of stones, like a cairn, and you need a good eye and also some digging around to realize what it is. 'When the carnivore pulls at the bait the . rope is attached to a slab door [made of solid rock] and it just closes, so the animal is . trapped inside this carnivore box trap. Prey: Leopards were a major predator in the area when ancient peoples were laying the traps . 'This is part of their defense system against the elements, which in this case is leopards and other carnivores.' The tests which proved the age of the traps were carried out using a technique called 'optical dating'. The ancient trap uses simple but effective technology to capture its prey. Not unlike a classic mouse trap, the leopard snare uses tempting food - usually a chunk of raw meat - to lure in the animal. The food would be attached to a rope, and then the animal pulls on it to get at the prize attached, the force from the rope would cause the door - a heavy stone slab - to slam shut. The animal would then be stuck inside, left helpless while the ancient farmers who laid the trap figured out how to dispose of the dangerous predator. The traps would help deal with the problem of leopards attacking the flocks of sheep and goats which were so vital to the nomads' survival at the time. It can be used to determine how long it has been since a material was exposed to sunlight - in this case it would have shown how long the underside of the trap had been shielded since being built. A machine can be used to measure how much radioactive energy which materials absorb other thousands of years in the shade, but is released when touched by sunlight. By comparing this with background levels of radiation in the area, a date for the trap could be calculated. Although referred to as a leopard trap, the structure could also be used to capture other predators, such as foxes, hyenas and wolves. They would have been an essential method for ancient farmers to keep the hungry hunters away from the sheep and goats they raised for milk, clothing and good. Ms Porat and her team found the traps not far from an area known to have been used as farmland as long as 6,000 years ago. The traps would be of little use now, as leopards have been extinct in the Negev region for the past ten years. The findings were published in the September . issue of the journal Antiquity.","The trap was found in the Negev region of southern Israel .
It lured leopards inside with a chunk of meat before slamming shut .
Researchers originally thought it was only 1,600 years old .
But radiation tests showed it had been there for five millennia .
This means ancient farmers in the area were more sophisticated than previously thought ."
"Traditional Chinese medicine should be made available on the NHS where there is evidence it helps patients, Jeremy Hunt said yesterday. The Health Secretary told MPs that there should be no ideological bar to Chinese remedies in the NHS – despite warnings from critics that many are untested and their benefits are unproven. Some also encourage poaching endangered species. Advocate: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, pictured with his wife Lucia, said there should be no ideological bar to the remedies . Mr Hunt, whose wife Lucia is Chinese, was asked what he had learned about the integration of traditional therapies with Western medicine during his visits to China. He replied: ‘What I’ve learnt is that the most important thing is to follow the scientific evidence and where there is good evidence for the impact of Chinese medicine then we should look at that, but where there isn’t we shouldn’t spend NHS money on it.’ Chinese medicine can involve herbal remedies, acupuncture and massage therapy. Acupuncture is already available on the NHS in some circumstances. NHS Choices says the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) recommends acupuncture as a treatment only for lower back pain. It adds Nice’s recommendation is based on scientific evidence. An aide to Mr Hunt last night insisted he was not advocating the use of Chinese medicine, just stressing that NHS cash should be focused on treatments that are scientifically proven to work. Alternative: Chinese medicine can involve herbal remedies, acupuncture and massage therapy . Mr Hunt has come under fire in the past over his support for homeopathy, but insists that his decisions as health secretary would be ‘based on science’. Last year it emerged that Mr Hunt held private talks with Prince Charles on the potential role of homeopathy and alternative therapies. Traditional Chinese medicine is blamed for fuelling demand for the poaching of species like rhino and tiger. Critics also claim many remedies are unproven to work and some may even contain toxins. But supporters say they have proven their worth over thousands of years and should be considered for use alongside Western medicine. David Tredinnick, who raised the issue in the Commons yesterday, welcomed Mr Hunt’s stance. The Tory MP, chairman of the all-party group for integrated healthcare, said: ‘He has clearly looked at it and thinks that where it is safe it should be used in conjunction with Western medicine, which is what they do in China. Alternative: Chinese medicine can involve herbal remedies, acupuncture and massage therapy . ‘Herbal medicine is not quackery – it has been used for thousands of years in China. In my experience – and I have used it – it can be really effective and reduce the amount of conventional medicine needed.’ Researchers in the United States recently said a poppy plant used for centuries in Chinese medicine may offer a new remedy for chronic pain. They found Corydalis contains a powerful pain-relieving compound in its roots although added further toxicity testing was required.","Tory MP said there should be no ideological bar to alternative treatments .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger believes his rejuvenated squad could yet hunt down Chelsea and Manchester City in the Barclays Premier League title race to emulate the class of 1997/1998. The Gunners - who earlier this week completed the signing of Brazilian defender Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal - host out-of-form Aston Villa on Sunday looking to record a fifth win in the last six league matches which would see them move back within striking distance of the top four. With Chelsea and Manchester City drawing 1-1 at Stamford Bridge in Saturday's late kick-off, the Gunners are now 14 points off the pace. Mesut Ozil scored in Arsenal's last game against Aston Villa, a 3-0 win in September . Tomas Rosicky shone in Arsenal's 3-2 win against Brighton and will look repeat his display on Sunday . Aaron Ramsey inspired Arsenal to an important three points over Manchester City two weeks ago . It is a similar scenario to that faced in the 1997/98 campaign, Wenger's first full season in charge. Arsenal trailed United by some 12 points at the end of February before embarking on a nine-match winning streak which saw them go on to lift a first title in seven years and then complete the double with victory over Newcastle in the FA Cup final at Wembley. Given the likes of Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil, who both scored in the FA Cup fourth-round win at Brighton, are fighting fight, and with Jack Wilshere also around a month away, Wenger feels the ability is there to put together the needed run of results. He said: 'It (to challenge for the title) is our target, but we have to be realistic. What we want is to win every game we can, but at the moment we are 14 points behind Chelsea, they need to lose five games, and they have lost only two until now. 'What we want to do is focus on our performances and show that we can produce consistent results. After, where we will finish, it is difficult to say.'

Robert Pires (left) talks with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (right) during training . Wenger added: 'Yes, it is true that I have some real selection dilemmas. 'We have got three players out (on loan) - (Yaya) Sanogo, (Lukas) Podolski and (Joel) Campbell - so you imagine before the number of offensive players we have. 'Now we have a good squad, compact, but of quality and with the competition it will be very hard.' Gabriel is expected to go straight into the squad against Villa. Wenger is confident the 24-year-old can follow in the tradition of Brazilian's having a positive impact on the club. 'We were lucky as we also had Gilberto and Edu, who is from Sao Paulo, and so it Sylvinho. We were very lucky with the Brazilians, they are top-level class people,' he said. 'Football is a big meaning for them, they have the hunger and the love for football, it is in their country and it is a religion.' Theo Walcott (left) looks on as Rosicky (centre) tries to keep the ball away from Ozil (right) Per Metersacker (right) controls a pass from team-mate Serge Gnabry (left) as Gabriel closes them down . Jack Wilshere catches his breath as he continues his comeback from injury in Arsenal training . Wenger is now the longest-serving manager in the English Premier League. The 65-year-old is often a sounding board for issues within the game, and reflected on the recent developments in the FIFA presidential campaign. Whomever is eventually chosen, Wenger feels continuing to improve the game in emerging nations is paramount to progress. 'You would say to keep developing the game in Asia and to structure the game in Africa and as well to give better education to young people and young players,' Wenger said. 'I believe there is a great job to do at FIFA and you look at some continents with great potential and not enough players come out. In some continents football has become hugely popular to watch and the next target is to develop football in there. 'It is difficult to imagine that China has 1.4billion and they do not find 11 good players, or maybe there are too many and you don't find the right one.' Wenger, though, is not about to follow the likes of former Portugal midfielder Luis Figo into football politics. He said: 'I have great experience on the technical front, but after that, on the administration front, I am a bit limited in my experience and I am not really interested in a lot of hand shaking.'","Arsenal are fifth in the league and 14 points behind leaders Chelsea .

The figures reveal that Bratislava offers the best deal, with all essentials costing only £96. In Ibiza, however, these essentials added up to a whopping £302. For a slightly less pricey option, take a short boat ride to Magaluf, where the same party favours will cost you more than £100 less - though still far more than the Slovakian capital. Dublin also comes in as an affordable stag do getaway option thanks to cheap flights from London. However, the Irish city is home to the most expensive pint - at £3.45 a pop - so what you save in air travel, you will likely make up for in beverages. When it comes to a cheap drink, Prague comes out on top, with a pint of beer costing less than £1 - just 87p. Ibiza tops the list as most expensive stag do destination - costing a whopping £302 for all the 'essentials' In Bratislava, you can enjoy a pint of beer for as little as £1.04 and entry to a club is as low as £6 . Simon Phillips, Head of Retail for No.1 Currency said: 'Going abroad for a stag weekend is very popular amongst soon-to-be-wed Brits, and with considerable cost savings to be made, it's easy to understand why.' 'With budget airlines offering some great deals to European cities, you may find your flights are actually a lot cheaper than a lot of UK train fares.' 'Eastern Europe offers some of the best value for money, with cities such as Bratislava, Tallinn and Budapest boasting cheap accommodation, club entry, and perhaps most importantly, cheap pints.'","According to No.1 Currency, in Bratislava, 'stag do essentials' tally just £96 .

"A crazed stalker who tried to give a CBS journalist an apple has agreed to spend 90 days in a psychiatric facility in a bid to avoid a jail sentence. Richard Pagani, 30, pleaded guilty to the third degree stalking of CBS anchor Diane Macedo, consenting to a three-month stay in a Coney Island Hospital. The New Yorker posted photographs of Macedo on his Facebook and Twitter accounts. Richard Pagani, pictured repeatedly tried to contact CBS News anchor Diane Macedo in person and online . Pagani tried to meet Macedo while she was covering the funeral of a policeman in Queens, New York . Pagani even took photgraphs of Macedo while she was appearing on television before positing them online . He even took photographs of Macedo appearing on television and uploaded them onto the internet. In one bizarre Facebook post, Pagani claimed: 'I'm surprised my c*** didn't fall out of my pants when I saw you on television.' On one occasion, Pagani approached Macedo while she was covering the funeral of a police officer and tried to give her an apple. When she wouldn't accept the fruit, Pagani slammed it against the news van. He also tried to visit Macedo at the CBS office in Manhatten. Pagaini also posted some images on Twitter where he claimed not to be talking about an unnamed individual . In a later post, Pagani took a photograph of himself, posted it on the internet describing himself as 'stir crazy' Pagani also retweeted a selfie posted on the internet by Macedo's colleague Andrea Grymes, left . According to the NY Post, Judge Lisa Sokoloff asked Pagani at Manhattan Criminal Court: 'Do you admit when you saw her sitting inside the news van you approached the van, knocked on the window and offered her and her colleague an apple and when she refused to acknowledge your presence you slammed the apple into the hood?' He replied: 'Yes.' Judge Sokoloff warned Pagani that he would be sent to prison if he attempted to contact Macedo again. Judge Lisa Solkoff ordered Pagani to spend 90 days in a psychiatric institution . He was also ordered to avoid contacting Pagani either in person or over the internet or face prison .","Stalker Richard Pagani followed CBS journalist Diane Macedo online.

"A spreadsheet that a man emailed his wife detailing her reasons for turning him down for sex has been shared by thousands of people online. For a whole month, the 26-year-old sexually-frustrated husband jotted down every response from his other half when he asked her for intimacy. He then collated the information and put it into an Excel document before cruelly emailing her as she arrived at an airport ahead of a ten-day business trip. Scroll down for video . The spreadsheet was passed around by users of social media site Reddit after the wife made it public . Her replies included 'I'm exhausted', 'I need a shower (didn't shower)', 'I'm trying to watch the movie (fell asleep 15 mins later)' and 'I'm not feeling too well'. Shocked at the email, the anonymous woman, also aged 26, tried to get in touch with her husband but he failed to return her calls. In the end, she decided to share her husband's harsh behaviour with users of Reddit by uploading the spreadsheet. She explained the couple had been together for five years in total but been married for last two. Although they had no kids, they bought a house together five months ago. 'Our lives have been crazy busy,' she wrote. 'We spent all spring renovating our new house. At my job I was given nearly double my usual workload after some of my colleagues were laid off. I gained some weight in the winter and have been busting my a** at the gym to get rid of it.' A frustrated husband's list of reasons his wife refused him sex has been spread around the internet (picture posed by actors) She then wrote: 'Yesterday morning, while in a taxi on the way to the airport, husband sends a message to my work email which is connected to my phone. 'He's never done this, we always communicate in person or by text. I open it up, and it's a sarcastic diatribe basically saying he won't miss me for the 10 days I'm gone. 'Attached is a SPREADSHEET of all the times he has tried to initiate sex since June 1, with a column for my ""excuses"", using verbatim quotes of why I didn't feel like having sex at that very moment.' The spreadsheet, which has since been deleted, was quickly spread around the internet with web users taking both sides in the debate. Most people slammed the husband's 'immaturity' and said he should have made his point in a different way. One Reddit user wrote: 'There are so many ways this could have been communicated better, but instead he came up with some bizarre hit and run with a spreadsheet method which I'd say is actually going to be really hard to come back to a normal relationship from.' Another said: 'Your husband is expressing LEGITIMATE concerns in an extremely immature and passive aggressive way. 'Clearly, the communication style in your relationship is s**t. Fix it or don't, it's your marriage.' One added: 'Maybe her husband has got sick and tired of being totally and utterly ignored for months on end, has had enough and wants resolution to the issue. This time, after all attempts, he has got her attention.'","Man created Excel document of wife's reasons for refusing to have sex .

"It happens almost every time an airline employee announces that a plane is ready for boarding – anxious passengers queue at the gate, only to face a torturous wait while the plane is loaded from back to front. Making matters worse, some passengers try to jump the queue while those on board battle for space in the overhead storage locker. For those who are convinced there is a faster and more efficient method, a test by the popular American television series MythBusters appears to back up that theory. Scroll down for video . Hurry up and wait: American television series MythBusters investigated the fastest boarding methods . Doing it wrong: The episode revealed the best - and quickest - way to board a plane . The Discovery Channel series found that the boarding method used by most carriers – business class first and followed by zones from back to front – is the slowest and least efficient of six possible seating techniques. Using a custom-built replica of a 173-seat aircraft interior, it took 24 minutes and 29 seconds before all of the volunteer passengers were in their seats with the back-to-front method. It turns out the fastest method involved no assigned seating. With a time of 14 minutes and seven seconds, business class boarded first and then all other passengers chose their seats at random as they stepped onto the aircraft. Even though it was the fastest method, it had the worst passenger satisfaction rating. The traditional back-to-front boarding method used by most airlines was the slowest and least efficient . The reverse pyramid method had the highest customer satisfaction rating. Passengers in economy boarded the plane from back to front and outside in. It was the third fastest technique with a time of 15 minutes and 10 seconds. With a time of 14 minutes and 55 seconds, the Wilma method (window seats first, followed by middle seats and aisle seats) was the second fastest technique. A combination of the Wilma method and zones – the fourth fastest scenario – filled the plane in 15 minutes and seven seconds, while the fifth fastest was a free-for-all with assigned seating (17 minutes and 15 seconds). MythBusters hosts Jamie Hyneman (left) and Adam Savage tested six different plane boarding methods . Professional cabin crew directed passengers to their seats and assisted with hand luggage that had to be placed in overhead lockers or checked because it was too large. Five per cent of the volunteers were given tasks to slow down the process to simulate an actual boarding experience. The tasks included sitting in the wrong seat, taking an excruciatingly long time to fold a coat or carrying a small child.","Hosts of the popular American television series tested six methods .

"We hear between 10 and 200 lies every day, from ‘sorry, my phone’s died,’ to ‘I’m fine’. And just by listening to simple linguistic clues, we could easily weed them out, claims scientist and linguistics expert. Minimal self-references, negative language, simple explanations and convoluted phrasing are all hallmarks of a lie. Scroll down for video . We hear between 10 and 200 lies every day (examples are shown) and a technique called linguistic text analysis could help us spot them. People can spot liars because they use more convoluted language but refer to themselves less in a made-up story, according to the research . In a Ted talk, Noah Zandan a science communicator and chief executive of Quantified Communications based in Austin, Texas, explained how ‘linguistic text analysis’ - which is based on the difference between how we structure the truth, and lies – can help people spot untruths. Studies have shown that stories based on imagined experiences are qualitatively different from those based on real experiences, suggesting that coming up with a lie takes work and results in a different pattern of language use. Linguistic text analysis helps people spot four common patterns in the subconscious language of lying. Noah Zandan, a science communicator, explained that liars tend to refer to themselves less in a story. When Lance Armstrong (pictured) denied using performance-enhancing drugs, he used a hypothetical scenario to distance himself from his lie, while when he later admitted to using them, he used 75 per cent more pronouns . Liars tend to refer to themselves less in a story that isn't true, and sometimes use hypothetical situations or mention others more than usual. They often use negative terms, because they are subconsciously feeling guilty. Untrue stories tend to be overly-simplified because humans find it hard to construct and keep track of complex lies. While their story may be simple, liars tend to use longer, convoluted sentences, adding in irrelevant but factual-sounding details in a bid to make a story sound more convincing. Mr Zanden explained that liars typically mention themselves less and talk more about others in a lie. They sometimes use the third person to disassociate themselves from their lie, because they feel subconsciously guilty. ‘Liars tend to be more negative because on a subconscious level they feel guilty about lying. 'For example, a liar might say: “Sorry, my stupid phone battery died. I hate that thing,” Mr Zanden said. People can also spot a lie when someone explains events in very simple terms. Our brains struggle to build a complex false story, which means that explanations about events that didn’t happen, seem unrealistically straightforward. But while liars may keep their story simple, they tend to use longer and more convoluted sentences, inserting irrelevant but factual sounding details to pad out the lie, he said. People can spot a lie when someone explains events in very simple terms (illustrated left). Our brains struggle to build a complex false story, which means that explanations about events that didn’t happen, seem unrealistically straightforward, compared to a real-life story (illustrated lightheartedly right) Mr Zanden said that the devices can be seen in famous lies. For example, when seven times winner of the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong denied using performance-enhancing drugs in 2005, he described a hypothetical situation focused on someone else, to distance himself from his lie. Conversely, when he admitted to using them in 2013, his use of personal pronouns increased by nearly three quarters, indicating that he was telling the truth. He talked about his focus on personal emotions and motivations.","Minimal self-references and convoluted phrases are  hallmarks of a lie .

"A fly-in, fly-out (FIFO) employee spoke out about the impact of FIFO on mental health just days before he took his life. Rhys Connor, 25, died on July 25 last year in his room at the Hope Downs mine site in the Pilbara in Western Australia after suffering depression. The father-of-one had spoken about the cost of the FIFO lifestyle on his mental health and wellbeing just days earlier, urging those considering FIFO to 'rethink' their decision. Scroll down for video . Rhys Connor gave an interview about the effect of fly-in, fly-out life on mental health just days before he took his life . Mr Connor spoke about his experience in an interview for a government-funded project on miners released by his family on the anniversary of his death to raise awareness about the risks of isolation and depression faced by FIFO workers. 'People do struggle up there with depression and at the moment I'm going through it,' Mr Connor said in the interview. Rhys Connor was father to Blaize and said the fly-in, fly-out nature of his work made relationships very difficult . Mr Connor had a young son, Blaize, but had separated from the child's mother. Six weeks before he died he separated from his fiancée. Mr Connor suggested FIFO made long-term relationships difficult, saying that he would tell his son to work FIFO only 'if he was single'. He said that some workers 'drink every night' to cope with the lifestyle and named isolation as a key problem for FIFO-workers. 'You're in your room every night of the week. You just think about things. You think about your family and what they’re doing now... You miss your family,' he said. 'There are people out there what seem to be fine, and deep down they're not. People have got to realise that everyone's not OK.' Mr Connor's parents, Peter and Anita Miller said mining companies need to do more to look after their employees. 'Everything’s not going OK for people onsite, there’s a huge focus on safety, but there needs to be more focus on mental wellbeing,' Ms Miller told Daily Mail Australia. While she said that she does not blame FIFO for her son's death, she said the lifestyle does present particular mental health challenges. 'It's long sections away from family, missing out on major family events.' Rhys typically worked three or four weeks onsite followed by one week off. 'That's a long time away when you've got a child,' said Ms Miller. 'You're missing major developments. 'We’ve suffered hugely. Our son was just a great normal everyday guy... and bang he’s dead. It’s just too sad,' she said. After Rhys Connor (right) took his life, his family, including his stepfather Peter Miller (centre) have campaigned to raise awareness of themental health issues faced by fly-in, fly-out workers . Alan Woodward, Executive Directive of Lifeline Research Foundation, conducted a study of mental health among 900 FIFO workers last year. He found that while FIFO workers did not experience a higher rate of mental health issues compared to the rest of Western Australian citizens, they did experience specific hardships relating to mental health. 'A key concern for us out of that study was often the attitude among the workforce that it was somehow soft to say that you're having troubles,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was summed up in a phrase from one our interviews that ""if you were having troubles in your life, you just had to suck it up princess"". That was a very unhelpful attitude, that can prevent people from seeking help.' The Millers are now raising awareness of the mental health problems facing FIFO workers. Ms Miller and Rhys's sister Teagan are working with zero2hero, a suicide prevention charity, and Mr Miller recently visited Barrow Island workers to speak about mental health issues. '[Rhys] was just a normal larrikin young guy who loved life,' said Ms Miller. 'He was a water polo player, he had lots of friends. He was just a nice guy and he was a selfless person. 'We can't change what’s happened in our case, but maybe we can change what happens in someone else's case.'Readers seeking support can contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 and Beyond Blue: 1300 224 636 .

"My daughter and I went to the doctor the other day. She's had mega-hayfever for the past few weeks and her medication just wasn't working. He was very sympathetic. 'I think it's time we tried something new,' he said, reaching for his medicine book. 'Tell me, my dear, do you know how much you weigh?' I was just about to open my mouth when, quick as a flash, she told him herself, adding proudly, 'My best friend weighs much less, but I have big muscles, you see.' Skinny queen: A slender Keira Knightley . Razor-sharp: Alexa Chung and her collarbone . We left, armed with our prescription. But it's stuck with me. I had no idea she knew how much she weighed - or, for that matter, that she knew how much her best friend weighed. It brought back anxious, ancient memories. I'm not sure when, exactly, I became aware of my size and strength. But I remember a growing sense that there was a lot of me. Too much, in fact. Not so much fat, just big. Big face, big head (I've always had trouble finding hats), big hands, wide shoulders, muscly legs, size 8 feet. As to weight, I have always been too heavy. I've never managed to be my 'ideal' weight (75 kilos, since you ask). Not even when I was 15 and a size 10. Etiolated: Super-slim Cara Delevingne . Frail and interesting: Socialite Mary Charteris . Not even when I was starving myself to the point where my hair started falling out and my hands shook and I had ulcers inside my mouth. Not even when I had to go and stay with my granny, who fed me chicken broth and told me I was beautiful and that it didn't matter that I wasn't a long-limbed, doe-eyed ballerina and that she loved me anyway. Realising that my daughter, who's 11, was entering a new phase in her life - one during which she would become conscious of the views of the world around her, a world in which she and her classmates might discuss such things - filled me with a sense of dread. Entirely unfounded, I'm sure: she's a very different child to the one I was, so much more confident and articulate, and growing up in entirely other circumstances. Nevertheless, I cannot help but feel an anxious pang. Young girls are not stupid. They look around and what they see is this: a world full of glossy, glamorous, beautiful people, with charmed lives and successful careers. They look at what unites those people and increasingly they see one thing: they are all super-skinny. Take these pictures from the Serpentine Summer Party in London on Tuesday night, featuring some of the most talked about and celebrated young women of our age. To me they represent the ultimate triumph of our super-skinny culture. Cara Delevingne, etiolated in top-to-toe black, posed along with Alexa Chung, her bony feet bird-like in pointy shoes, her shoulder blades and collar bone sharp as razors. They were joined by the queen of the super-skinnies, Keira Knightley, the only woman alive, with the possible exception of Angelina Jolie, who can look svelte in a dress made out of old cushions. Beautiful, effortless social x-rays. Not that there's anything intrinsically wrong with being slim. It's laudable, in fact, especially in these days of junk food and sofa slobbing. It's not being slim that's wrong. It’s being super-skinny and being adored for it. Thin friends: Sarah worries that girls will associate the fame and fortune of the stars, from left, Alexa, Keira and Cara, with the fact they are all super slim . It's the equating of skinny with virtue: beauty, goodness, style, femininity. The thinner these actresses, models, whatevers get, the more the fashion and showbiz worlds lionise them. They get all the best invitations, all the VIP passes. Designers name handbags after them, magazines fawn over them. Not because they are great scientists, doctors, lawyers, politicians. But because they go to parties in ever-tinier dresses. Every time we see them the gospel of super-skinnyiness spreads, and not just through party pictures and glossy magazine shoots. Many of these girls - such as model Mary Charteris, another of the Serpentine party skinnies - post endless selfies on Instagram and Twitter, silently rubbing our noses in their protruding hips, their tiny upper arms, their flat stomachs. ""I like to joke that I am a failed anorexic; but it's not a joke really. I got lucky. Too many girls don't."" They make it all look so fabulous, so cool and glamorous - and so damn effortless. Perhaps for these girls - and for all their genetically blessed friends - being that thin really just does come naturally. But what if being skinny just isn't in your genes? What if, like me, you're more of a Welsh pit pony than an aristocratic gazelle? And what if, like all young girls without exception, you aren't quite sure who or what you are but you do know that you want to fit in, to be cool, to be liked? What then? You stop eating. You exercise. You obsess about every last morsel and calorie. And when you still can't feel your hipbones, you run the lovely, healthy body that God gave you into the ground, you starve it and torture it, you hollow it out from the inside until all that's left is skin and bone. When I was young, the celebrity influence wasn't even half as bad as it is now. Back then we had Christy Turlington and Sofia Loren and other Amazonian role models and besides, I grew up in Italy, where hips and thighs are part of the culture. Consequences: Sarah hopes the diets she undertook as a youngster haven't caused her to have brittle bones . And still I was infected. Still I longed to be a seven stone weed, with bony ankles and sparrow-like wrists. Being strong and clever didn't come into it. And so I set out to re-shape myself to that mould in the only way possible: dieting. What is it Kate Moss said? 'Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.' I loved this new absence of padding: it made me feel pious and strangely powerful, like I was in control. Lighter physically, but emotionally too. At a time when my body was doing all kinds of strange things that weren't necessarily welcome (periods, breasts, the whole messy, complicated transition from childhood to womanhood), I felt small again. And I had funny little OCD-ish tests I used to do to see how thin I was. I would lie in the bath on my stomach, and delight in the touch of my ribs against the enamel. I would stretch out on the bed and place a ruler between my hipbones, like a bridge. But at least the only person I was hurting was myself. Three decades on I am 48. I wear a weave because I have weak, thin hair that frightens small children. I have the teeth of an 84-year-old Elizabethan. I have an underactive thyroid, broken by years of bad dieting. Who knows, I probably have osteoporosis (I'm too scared to check, but I did suffer a severe Colles wrist fracture a few years ago, also known as an 'old lady fracture'). I struggle to keep my weight stable not because I'm a lazy layabout junk food junkie, but because my body clings to calories like a drowning man to a raft. This is what happens to normal girls who try to be like Cara and Keira. I like to joke that I am a failed anorexic; but it's not a joke really. I got lucky. Too many girls don't. And as long as we live in a world that fetishises female thinness and treats it as the most desirable of all virtues, we are condemning successive generations of girls to a lifetime of self-loathing.","Sarah's daughter already knows her weight and that she's heavier than her best friend .

"Florida and Nevada women wear higher heels than their New York counterparts, according to new research by Gilt. In fact, Puerto Rico had the most vertiginous footwear, with an average height of 2.87 inches, as seen in a map created by the shopping site to illustrate average heel heights throughout the country. Despite New York's fashion-forward reputation, its shoe purchases on Gilt featured heels that were merely 2.09 inches on average - while Florida's footwear was 2.46 inches. Scroll down for video . Head over heels: Shopping website Gilt created this colorful map to illustrate the average footwear height in each U.S. state . And while celebrities are regularly seen teetering around Hollywood in towering shoes, California's average heel was only 2.25 inches, far from the nation's highest. Nevada was second only to Puerto Rico - an evening out in Las Vegas requires a dazzling pair of pumps, after all - and Arkansas fell into the top range too. While those were the only states in the 2.36 - 2.9-inch range, Texas was close behind at 2.35 inches. Long and short of it: These 3-inch Manolo Blahnik heels (left) are slightly above the average shoe height in Puerto Rico, while 1.5-inch Salvatore Ferragamo pumps (right) are closer to the sensible height worn in Nebraska and Kansas . Surprising: Despite New Yorkers' reputation for wearing stilettos - perpetuated by Sarah Jessica Parker's shoe-obsessed character Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City - Gilt found that the state's average heel height was in one of the lower ranges . The states with the most conservative shoes were in the Midwest and New England: Nebraska, Kansas, Maine and Vermont all fell into the sensibly low range of 1.80-1.97 inches. The research was conducted by Gilt's Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert, who 'got a bit curious about whether certain fashion preferences might be regional or universal,' according to the Gilt Tech Blog. He and Gilt Data Analyst Debbie Chung began looking at regional style trends, also discovering that 'black is, um, still the “new black” in every corner of the country,' before commissioning the infograph from Gilt designer Rhianon Cha-os.

"Legal action: Nora Al-Daher, 50, is suing The Ritz casino after losing £2million at its card table . An Omani politician's wife and gambling addict is suing The Ritz casino after losing a staggering £2million at its card table. Nora Al-Daher, 50, who lives in Muscat, blew her millions at the exclusive London club's punto banco table in just a few hours in April 2012. But she claims she would not have lost the money if staff had not 'taken advantage' of her gambling addiction. She told London's High Court that employees had stood behind her at the table, encouraging her to keep playing the card game, despite having been made aware of her addiction. As her incredible losses mounted, they had even extended her cheque-cashing facility, she said. 'I needed someone that night to tell me to stop playing and bring me to my senses,' the multi-millionaire told the court. 'If I had been told to stop, of course I would stop immediately. No one ever told me to stop or think about my gambling.' Mrs Al-Daher, who is married to Omani Foreign Minister, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al-Busaidi, had already suffered substantial losses at other casinos when she arrived at The Ritz on the evening of April 3, the court heard. Despite allegedly telling staff she did not want to play, just a few hours later she had reached her £1.7m cheque-cashing limit and soon afterwards, she was £2million down. Barrister Robert Deacon told Judge Anthony Seys Llewellyn that Mrs Al-Daher had made it clear when she arrived that she was 'a gambling addict' and did not want to play punto banco. 'The staff paid no regard to her distraught demeanour or what she told them and did nothing to discourage her from gambling or to reflect on the wisdom of further gambling,' he said. 'She commenced gambling and, as her losses mounted, staff encouraged her to continue, saying she was going to win and that her facility would be increased to £2million. 'As her gambling continued, staff stood behind her with pre-written cheques which were provided to her until £2million was gambled and lost. Exclusive: Mrs Al-Daher, the wife of the Omani Foreign Minister, blew her millions at the London club's (above) punto banco table in just a few hours in April 2012. She claims staff 'took' advantage' of her gambling addiction . 'Staff positively encouraged her when she was losing, saying ""...anything for you, Princess Nora...we trust you...no problem...relax...don't worry...next time you will get your money back..."".' He added: 'The Ritz Hotel and Casino Ltd failed to take any or any reasonable measures to prevent or mitigate the consequences or aggravation of self-inflicted harm by the assumption of control over her.' Giving evidence, Mrs Al-Daher said encouragement had been the 'last thing she needed' that night. Mrs Al-Daher is married to Omani Foreign Minister, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad bin Hamood Al-Busaidi, pictured above . 'If they had not given me more facilities that night, I would have had to stop playing,' she told the court. 'When I began to run out of chips that night and asked for more money, they said I had finished my facility. 'I asked for more money and they said . ""yes"". I continued to play from the same book and with the same dealer. They should have discouraged me, but instead they took advantage of me. Arrival: The multi-millionaire (pictured arriving at court) says staff stood behind her at the table, encouraging her to keep playing the card game. This despite them allegedly having been made aware of her addiction . 'Had it not been for all of the above actions of The Ritz and its employees, I believe that there was a real chance I would not have gambled at The Ritz on the night in question when I lost the £2million, or I would have stopped gambling before I lost the £2million.' Punto Banco is the sister game of Chemin de Fer, the high-stakes card game favoured by James Bond. It is a game of chance that involves no skill or strategy, with each player's moves forced by the cards they are dealt. The aim is to hold cards with a count of nine or closest to nine. You bet that either the hand held by the player (punto) or banker (banco) will win and place bets on the appropriate area on the table. You . can also make a ‘tie’ bet. Tens and picture cards and multiples of ten . count as  zero: for example, 7 + 3 = 0;  10 + 4 = 4; king + 10 = 0. The game's appeal rests on how the advantage can switch with each new card, lending huge excitement to the action. The case reached the High Court after The Ritz sued Mrs Al-Daher for £1million, claiming that some of the cheques she had handed over that night were not honoured. But Mrs Al-Daher told the court the casino's claim should fail because . it had wrongly allowed her to gamble on credit, which is illegal. She said she had handed over cheques, which were only cashed if she lost, meaning she should be reimbursed with the £1million she eventually paid out. However, the casino denies Mrs Al-Daher's accusations and insists that she was not put under any pressure to place her bets. Clive Freedman QC, defending the club, pointed out that, nine months after she lost the money, Mrs Al-Daher had honoured £1million of the debt without complaint. Meanwhile, Ritz CEO, Roger Maris, told the court that it is not unusual for a high-stakes gambler to have their cheque-cashing facility increased. He added that it was not until months later that the casino had realised that the cheques had not been honoured. 'She was a very good customer for us,' he said. 'There had been a very good history of paying. There was no thought in our mind that the cheques were not going to get paid.' During her frequent trips to London, Mrs . Al-Daher has been a regular in the capital's casinos, often spending . hundreds of thousands, and even millions, of pounds in one evening, the . court heard. Court: Mrs Al-Daher first realised she was a gambling addict in 1999, London's High Court (pictured) heard . Between 1999 and April 2012, The Ritz alone had received more than £20million in buy-ins from Mrs Al-Daher, of which she had lost more than £7million. Mrs Al-Daher told the court that she had first realised she was a gambling addict in 1999. The hearing continues.","Nora Al-Daher, 50, blew £2million on punto banco table in just a few hours .

"The son of the first person diagnosed with the deadly Ebola virus on American soil  spoke for the first time about his father's condition on Tuesday evening. Karsiah Duncan, 19, arrived in Dallas to visit dad Thomas Duncan from San Angelo, Texas, where he is a student at Angelo State University. 'I hope and keep praying that my family is OK — and that my dad makes it out safely,' Karsiah said. The college student spoke briefly and softly to reporters at Wilshire Baptist Church in Dallas, which has a large Liberian community. 'Thank you church for all the good things you've been doing for my mom, the support given to my family,' Karsiah said. 'Thanks to the hospital for their work in trying to help my dad stay alive.' Karsiah's mother, Louise Troh, remains in quarantine after she had contact with Duncan. Troh left Liberia more than a decade ago after a falling out with Duncan — but the two renewed their relationship earlier this year. Scroll down for video .

Thomas Duncan passed away from the Ebola virus at Texas Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday morning . Duncan's mother, Nowai Korkoya, traveled some 15 hours to pray near the hospital in Texas . Mr Duncan passed away from the disease on Wednesday morning at Texas Presbyterian. Duncan's family had visited him at the hospital on Tuesday but declined to view him via video because the last time it had been too upsetting. The relatives glimpsed him using a video system at Dallas' Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital on Monday. But when they returned anew, this time with Reverend Jessie Jackson, they decided such images were too much. 'What we saw was very painful. It didn't look good,' said Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks. Weeks said he and Duncan's mother were unable to sleep after seeing Duncan's face. Authorities in the United States and the public are on alert following Duncan's diagnosis more than a week ago, which raised concerns that the worst epidemic of Ebola on record could spread from three hardest-hit impoverished countries — Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Duncan, who arrived in Texas in late September on a commercial flight from Liberia, had been in critical condition since Saturday. The first case of Ebola being contracted outside of West Africa was reported in Spain and the World Health Organization expects more cases in Europe. Freelance NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo is being treated at the Nebraska Medical Center, which cared for one other U.S. national flown out of West Africa after contracting Ebola and was later discharged.

The company said it has been tested in more than 1,000 patients without raising safety concerns. 'We decided this was currently our best option for treatment,' said Phil Smith, medical director of the Nebraska Medical Center's Biocontainment Unit, which consulted with U.S. health and drug officials before making its decision. Mukpo is experiencing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, the center said. U.S. health officials said on Tuesday they would unveil within days new screening procedures at the country's airports to address public concern over the possibility of an outbreak. Texas state health officials said they are monitoring 10 people who had close contact with Duncan and 38 others who came into contact with that group to see if anyone had developed signs of infection. So far, no one has shown any symptoms, health officials said. Officials have said this is a critical week to see if any of those exposed in Dallas develop signs of the virus that has killed more than 3,400 people since an outbreak in West Africa began in March, out of nearly 7,500 confirmed, probable and suspected cases. Dallas residents have mostly taken in news of Ebola within the city limits calmly, but many have kept a close eye on whether it might spread. Cars of Dallas County Sheriff's deputies who were at the scene of the apartment where Duncan stayed have been scrubbed as a precaution, the sheriff's office said. Prominent civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson met members of Duncan's family and held a prayer vigil on Tuesday in front of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Jackson said the hospital initially discharged Duncan because he was poor and did not have medical insurance. About two days after Duncan left the hospital, he was taken back by ambulance and put into isolation. The hospital and health officials have said mistakes were made in handling Duncan.

"A seven-months pregnant Nepalese woman was set on fire by her husband after her family failed to pay him a dowry, which included a buffalo and a motorbike. Rihana Shekh Dhafali, 25, lost her baby after her husband Farid Sheikh poured kerosene over her body and set her alight. She also says her husband burned her genitalia with cigarettes and would assault her on a regular basis over the undelivered dowry. Vile attack:  Rihana Shekh Dhafali, 25,  pictured at a Nepalese hospital, miscarried her baby at seven months after her husband poured kerosene over her body and set her alight in Miyapur, India . Ms Shekh Dhafali, who had been living with her husband in Miyapur, India, was taken to hospital by members of her husband’s family on the premise that she would tell doctors that she had set fire to herself, a local human rights group said. When her father Mohammad Samim Shekh Dhapali found out about her injuries, he travelled to the hospital in India and brought her back to Nepal where she revealed the truth about her horrific burns. She later miscarried her baby at seven months as a result of her injuries and the traumatic experience. Ms Shekh Dhafali told human rights organisation Informal Sector Service Centre (INSEC) that her husband’s family had tied her hands behind her back and poured kerosene over her body before setting her on fire. The attack took place in Miyapur, India, where the Nepalese couple lived with Farid Sheikh's family . ‘According to the victim, her husband assaulted her regularly saying that she did not bring motorbike, buffalo and other things as dowry,’ INSEC said. ‘She added that he burnt her private parts with cigarette, saying that they set fire on her by sprinkling kerosene over her after tying her hands behind.’ She has now been sent to Kathmandu for further treatment and local police are investigating the incident, INSEC said. ‘When the incident happened about a month ago, they took her to India for treatment, saying it was an accident,’ a police official told AFP. ‘We recorded her statement yesterday, but her husband and in-laws have vanished. We are searching for them.’","Rihana Shekh Dhafali, 25, was set on fire by her husband over her dowry .

"Patsy Coleman, 48, found out she had tumours in both of her breasts after being randomly called up to attend a breast cancer screening early . A mother-of-two was shocked to discover she had cancer in both of her breasts, after being randomly selected for a cancer screening programme. Patsy Coleman, 48, wasn't due for a breast screening until her 50th birthday under national guidelines, but was called up early as part of a pilot scheme into early screening. A mammogram revealed that Mrs Coleman, from Stoke Gifford in Brisol, had a cancerous tumour in her right breast. After undergoing a double mastectomy operation to remove both her breasts, surgeons discovered she had a second tumour in her left breast. Mrs Coleman, who works as a cashier and receptionist, has now recovered and is urging the government to lower the screening age for all women. She said: 'The shock of being told I had breast cancer was one thing - but that it was likely I had developed a bi-lateral cancer that can affect both breasts was devastating. 'I went through a whole journey of emotions, from anger to panic. 'I couldn't think straight and thankfully my sister Julie was with me through all these stages, helping me to come to terms with it all and giving me support and guidance through hospital and at home. 'My consultant could see I was upset and he turned to Julie and said: ""It's OK, I can fix her"". 'I tried to remain upbeat through it all and now I'm back to full health more or less. 'I think they should reduce the screening age - it made a huge difference to me. It wasn't my time to go. 'It is difficult to say what would have happened if I had waited to 50 and it makes me feel sad when I think that I was saved, but another woman elsewhere might not get the same chance.' Six breast screening units in England took part in the early testing pilot scheme, which invited a selection of women aged 47 to 49 to have early testing. Mrs Coleman, who is now divorced, was one of the women in her area to be randomly selected and sent an invite to a mammogram in July last year. During a follow-up appointment she was diagnosed with a tumour in her right breast and opted for a double mastectomy last September. It was only two weeks after the major operation that medics discovered a second completely separate cancer in her left breast. The NHS Breast Screening Programme screens around 1.6 million women a year. Women aged 50 to 70, who are registered with a GP, are automatically invited for screening every three years. You will first be invited for screening between your 50th and 53rd birthdays. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit. The NHS has extended the breast screening age range in England so that all women aged 47 to 73 will be invited. Screening takes place at a special clinic or mobile breast screening unit. A mammogram (X-ray of the breast) is taken by a female health professional. The mammogram is then studied to look for any abnormalities. The aim is to detect breast cancer at an early stage, when any changes in the breast would be too small to feel and when there is a good chance of successful treatment and full recovery. Not all cancers are found during breast screening. Breast cancer can develop between screening appointments. Even if you go to breast screening, it is important to get to know your breasts so you can spot any unusual changes early on and report them to your GP. Source: NHS Choices . She had 12 weeks of gruelling chemotherapy to catch any rogue cancer cells and  this month had a final reconstructive procedure. She said she has tried to stay upbeat despite suffering breast cancer. She said: 'I didn't let it get me down and now I feel healthier than before. 'Without knowing it, before the cancer I was quite ill - I didn't have much energy and I was feeling pretty lousy. 'Now I want something good to come out of it all - if other people my age and younger can be helped, that would be great.' Currently all women aged over 50 are offered a breast screening every three years. In December 2007, the Department of Health's Cancer Reform Strategy proposed extending the screenings to cover women between the ages of 47 and 73. An initial pilot scheme was carried out and now Public Health England is extending the trial to more than 70 units throughout the country. Mrs Coleman's lead clinician Mike Shere said her case proves early screening is the way forward. He said: 'When we look for benefits it is calculated quite crudely in terms of does it save peoples' lives? 'This means not just identifying the cancer earlier than we would have, but also does it make a difference, do we save their life?' Professor Julietta Patnick, director of the NHS Cancer Screening Programmes, managed by Public Health England, said: 'This trial has full ethics approval and will prove internationally important to show whether screening in the extended age ranges saves lives. 'It's being run as it is because a randomised control trial was considered the best way to gather the most robust evidence. 'Led by researchers at the University of Oxford's Cancer Epidemiology Unit, the trial extends the screening age to women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73. 'Women who are invited as part of the trial receive an ethics approved information leaflet in addition to the more general informed choice breast screening leaflet. 'Any woman in a trial area in the age extension age group who doesn't get an invitation, but hears about the trial, can be screened on request. Mother-of-two Mrs Coleman, pictured here with 13-month-old grandson Oscar Choi, is urging the government to lower the screening age for breast cancer all women . 'There is no upper limit on breast screening so any woman can ask to be screened once she comes out of the routine invitation age group at 70.' Mrs Coleman is also walking in the first ever March On Cancer - one of 15 simultaneous events around the UK on October 11 to raise money for Cancer Research UK. She said: 'Having gone through a double mastectomy, coping with hair loss and chemotherapy, I wanted to do something to mark the occasion. 'I've come through the treatment now and I'm determined to recruit others to fight against this devastating disease.'","Patsy Coleman wasn't due for a cancer screening until her 50th birthday .

"Students at the University of Nottingham are being investigated over a twisted 'rugby-style' chant about necrophilia. The students from the Cavendish Hall at the university sang a bawdy chant outside their accommodation as part of their Freshers' Week celebrations. However, several of the lines of the chant were very objectionable. Including one about disinterring a sexual partner for a reunion. Scroll down for video . Students wearing specially branded t-shirts at the University of Nottingham sang the twisted chant . Students at the University of Nottingham were filmed singing a bawdy 'rugby-style' chant, (file photograph) According to the Impact Nottingham student magazine, the chant was led by former residents of the accommodation block. The University hired students to act as 'Week One Reps', acting as guides to new students. One student told the magazine: 'I went out every other night for the rest of the week. Each night I heard the same chant, still being led by Week One Reps. 'As the week progressed, freshers started to lead the chants themselves. On the Sunday night, whilst on the bus and queueing for the Freshers’ Finale [hosted at Capital FM Arena], I heard the chant seven times in the space of an hour.' One student recorded the controversial chant on their mobile phone before uploading it to the internet. I wanna be a Cavendish ranger, living a life of sex and danger. High flying, 69-ing. These are the girls that I love best, many times I’ve s***** their breasts. F*** her standing, f*** her lying, if she had wings I’d f*** her flying. Now she’s dead, but not forgotten, dig her up and... Anagharad Smith, who was a co-ordinator for the Week One events said that Reps had signed a contract outlawing  'abusive, offensive, crude or intimidating chants or songs'. According to The Guardian, the Students' Union is conducting an investigation into the vile chanting which has been considered misogynistic. The University's Students' Union has received complaints from campus feminist organisations over the 'laddish' nature of the singing. As part of the chant, the leader sings a line which is immediately repeated by the group. Harry Copson, President of the University's Students' Union said: 'It is unfortunate that in this instance the guidance we provided has not been implemented in the way that we would hope for as a Students’ Union, to ensure enjoyment and comfort for all our members. 'I must however stress that the issue in question has come about as a result of negligence by a minority, and stress that the Students’ Union wishes not to undermine the brilliant hard work put in by all members of the Week One team, including both students and staff.' This follows an investigation at the London School of Economics after a leaflet was distributed to students looking to join the university's rugby club which was deemed racist, sexist and homophobic. The LSE's Students' Union disbanded the club for the rest of the academic year in response to the leaflet. Meanwhile at the University of Exeter, Freshers were forced to kiss a dead conger eel as well as drink beer from a shoe as part of an initiation ceremony.

"Plagued by  excruciating cystitis, Lauren Sutcliffe is too scared to leave the house, struggles to hold down a job and dreads having sex with her boyfriend. The 23-year-old says she feels as though she has 'paper cuts and acid inside' - and that the pain is 'unbearable'. She is one of 400,000 people in the country, the majority of them women, who suffer with a chronic form of the bladder condition, known by its medical name interstitial cystitis (IC). Scroll down for video . For 12 years ,Lauren Sutcliffe has suffered interstitial cystitis - a chronic form of the bladder condition - leaving her unable to leave the house or hold down a job because of painful flare ups . The symptoms - including pain, urgency, a need to pass water frequently and a burning sensation when passing urine - are similar to standard cystitis. Cystitis is linked to infection, but interstitial cystitis is triggered by inflammation of the bladder wall, which can follow childbirth, surgery or repeated bouts of bladder infections, though sometimes there is no known cause. While it’s more common in women over 40, it can affect younger women, too. Miss Sutcliffe, from Sunderland, has suffered the condition since she was 11 years old, having been plagued by kidney and bladder problems since birth. The chronic bladder infections have left her in severe pain, and facing a constant urge to go to the toilet. She struggles to hold down a job and her social life has been sacrificed because of her illness. She claims the side effects from her medication cause anxiety, hair loss and early menopause, which means she cannot have children. After 12 years of enduring regular painful bouts of cystitis, Miss Sutcliffe was finally diagnosed with the chronic form of the condition earlier this year. But she is yet to find an effective medication to ease her condition. Unfortunately, patients are frequently misdiagnosed as simply being prone to urinary infections. This means they are given antibiotics, which - because there is no infection - do not solve the problem. The former University of Sunderland student said: 'It feels like there are paper cuts and acid inside me and the pain is unbearable. 'During a flare leaving the house isn't even an option. After the 23-year-old's social life suffered, her sister bought her a dog, Claude, last year to help her through her illness. She said: 'I strongly believe in the benefits of animals being used as an aid in therapy for people who are depressed or suffer like I do' Interstitial cystitis causes recurring flare ups of discomfort in the bladder and pelvic area. Like regular cystitis, IC sufferers experience an urgency and frequent need to urinate. But the condition doesn't respond to treatment with antibiotics, because it is not caused by a bacterial infection. Around 400,000 people in the UK suffer the condition. More than 90 per cent of these cases are in women. The condition is commonly diagnosed around the age of 40. What causes IC? Researchers are not clear on the causes of the condition. There is a school of thought that believes the illness is inherited. It is also thought to be linked to other conditions including irritiable bowel syndrome and fibromyalgia. Another theory is that one of the protective layers of the bladder wall may 'leak' in people with IC, allowing chemicals in the urine to irritate the bladder. People with IC often have small areas of scarring, stiffness or bleeding on the wall of their bladder. Lifestyle changes can ease the symptoms . It is possible to reduce the symptoms by making some lifestyle changes. How is IC treated? There is no single treatment, with each sufferer finding different therapies helpful. Treatments include: . Source: NHS Choices . 'I rarely want or initiate sex with my boyfriend because it's so painful, I know I'll suffer afterwards. 'My illness definitely takes its toll on our relationship, but luckily he is extremely understanding. 'I've even found it extremely hard to hold a job down as employers are not often sympathetic with my illness. 'I wonder will I ever find a job that will accommodate my chronic agony and everything that comes with it.' As well as suffering with IC, Lauren also lives with endometriosis and vulvodynia - a persistent and unexplained pain in the vulva, the skin surrounding the vagina - which add to her agony. 'IC makes me feel completely useless so I suffer with severe depression and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder [clinical depression] in 2012,' said Miss Sutcliffe. 'I've received counselling from a psychologist to help me accept my conditions and to help me live with the chronic pain. 'But that along with the eight medications I take per day hasn't provided much comfort.' Bladder and kidney infections are a regular occurrence for the IC sufferer, but this year alone Miss Sutcliffe has had a flare up every month. As a result of her condition, her education has also been sacrificed as she was too afraid to make the journey to college in case she desperately needed to toilet. She said: 'There are so many girls who are too embarrassed to speak out about IC but it's so common and awareness needs to be raised. 'There's so many support groups and foundations that are there to give support.' A Cystitis and Overactive Bladder Foundation spokesperson said: 'IC is a chronic condition and there is no cure. 'Sufferers can need to urinate up to 40 times in a 24-hour period and the pain is excruciating. 'Many sufferers suffer exhaustion, anxiety and depression as a result of the disease - some are even suicidal. 'We provide sufferers with information on the various treatments available to alleviate symptoms and support. 'We also run local groups around the country so that sufferers can meet others with the disease and know that they are not alone.' Miss Sutcliffe is now hoping to raise awareness about her condition. She has found support at the Facebook group IC Sisters, where she talks to women all over the world who share their advice and stories with each other. The condition causes Miss Sutcliffe to suffer regular, painful bouts of cystitis - at least once a month. She said: 'I've even found it extremely hard to hold a job down as employers are not often sympathetic with my illness' 'It's nice to know you're not alone and that there are other people going through the same thing. It definitely brings some comfort and helps during a bad day,' Miss Sutcliffe said. After Miss Sutcliffe's condition destroyed her social life, her sister bought her a Bichon Frise puppy, Claude last year. She said: 'My illness takes its toll not only on me but on my whole family. 'I strongly believe in the benefits of animals being used as an aid in therapy for people who are depressed or suffer like I do. 'He's my best friend and he instantly makes me feel calmer when I'm struggling.' September is Interstitial Cystitis awareness month and support groups are encouraging sufferers to speak out.","Lauren Sutcliffe suffers the chronic illness interstitial cystitis .

"David Cameron today challenged the Emir of Qatar to stop the flow of cash to ISIS - following bombshell allegations in Parliament that the country is 'siphoning off' funds meant for the World Cup to fund Islamic terror. The Prime Minister held talks with the Qatari leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Than amid increasing concerns over the wealthy Arab state's links to Islamic extremism and the deadly conditions migrant labourers are forced to live in. Qatar is part of the military coalition against the militants, but elements within the wealthy state have been accused of bankrolling the militants. David Cameron greeted the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, at Downing Street today amid growing concerns over the wealthy country's links to extremism . Mr Cameron was challenged in the House of Commons today to raise the issue of ISIS funding with Qatar's leader . During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Cameron was asked whether he agreed with the US assessment that Qatar was 'a permissive jurisdiction for terrorist finance'. Mr Cameron said: 'I will be talking to the Emir very shortly, and of course we will discuss all these issues, particularly how we can work together to combat extremism.' He added: 'It really does matter that we work with all our allies to ensure that extremist and terrorist groups do not get the support that they seem to be. The exchange came after ministers were  called on to investigate reports that British companies were being short-changed on World Cup construction contracts - with funds being siphoned off to Syria for ISIS. Downing Street insisted 'no issues' would be 'off the table' during the meeting with the Qatari leader at Number 10 this afternoon . Asked earlier this week whether Mr Cameron would challenge the Emir on reports that elements in his country have channelled funds ISIS, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said: 'I'm sure the PM will talk about the work being done by both countries in terms of tackling terrorism. 'Qatar is part of the coalition of countries participating in airstrikes against Isil in Syria. All countries are taking forward anti-terror financing work consistent with the UN Security Council Resolution in August. 'I'm sure they will discuss a range of issues to do with combating terror in that region.' The Emir is in London for a three-day state visit to Britain, beginning today. The country has rejected accusations that it is funnelling cash to ISIS . Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani were welcomed to the UK by the Queen at Buckingham Palace . The spokesman added that Mr Cameron would also raise concerns about conditions for stadium construction workers. The spokesman said: 'He will be discussing that with the Emir. The Qatari authorities themselves have in recent months announced a series of changes and reforms. 'I'm sure there will be an opportunity for the Prime Minister to ask how that is going and to continue to make the offer of UK expertise and learning from our experience of construction of the various pieces of infrastructure associated with the London 2012 Olympics.' Allegations of corruption during the bidding process for the 2022 tournament have also dogged Qatar and the high death rate on match sites has sparked international condemnation. The spokesman said the question of whether Qatar should host the World Cup was 'a matter for Fifa', adding: 'The right thing to do is, where and if we can be of assistance to Qatar as it develops its infrastructure ahead of that tournament, to offer it.' Owned by Qatar: The Shard, Britain's tallest building, is just one of several London landmarks owned by the rulers of the oil-rich gulf state . During the talks in Downing Street, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond signed a cultural agreement with his counterpart Khalid Mohammed al-Attiyah, which officials said was in 'recognition of our long-standing friendship' with Qatar. Qatar last night refuted was claims that money for UK firms working on World Cup 2022 venues is being siphoned off to ISIS extremists. The country's Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani told MailOnline it is a 'serious allegation' which the government 'refutes completely'. Labour MP Steve Rotheram raised the cases in Parliament ahead of David Cameron holding talks with the Emir of Qatar tomorrow. Qatar controversially won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, despite widespread concern that soaring temperatures will make games impossible to play. Several British construction firms have won contracts to work for big Qatari firms on building venues in the country. However, Mr Rotherham claimed that companies have had money withheld which has been redirected to Islamic extremists in Syria. In a statement, the Qatari Prime Minister said: 'It is a serious allegation and it is one we refute completely. 'Let me be clear, for the avoidance of doubt, we will stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies in the Middle East and around the world to face down the terrorist threat.' Earlier in the Commons, Mr Rotherham, the MP for Liverpool Walton, called on ministers to examine the allegations. Speaking during Foreign Office question time, Mr Rotheram said: 'There are accusations that some UK companies are being short-changed on contracts associated with the construction of World Cup venues in Qatar and even claims that some monies unpaid are being siphoned off to Syria and into the hands of Isil.' He told Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood: 'Can you look urgently to these allegations and can you offer support to UK firms regarding their reimbursement by the Qatari royalty, government or businesses?' Mr Ellwood replied: 'I was in Doha last week and I raised this very issue. They do what is called a kafala system which has now been upgraded, which you may be aware of. 'It is being replaced to give greater rights to migrant workers - there's 1.3 million in Qatar - but also giving responsibilities to the employers as well to make sure they look after these.' In August Qatar denied supporting ISIS militants, insisting that 'determined, collective action' was needed to end sectarian violence in Iraq and Syria. And  officials including Qatar's director of intelligence told the BBC that the country only supported moderate rebel groups in Syria and 'had nothing to hide'. It is claimed British firms working on Qatar World Cup venues have been denied money which has been redirected to ISIS extremists . Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, the Emir of Qatar, is  visiting London this week to promote economic investment in Britain . But this week a US government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington believes Turkey is partnering with Qatar in providing support to Islamist factions and militias in Libya. At the weekend Tory MP Stephen Barclay told the Sunday Telegraph: 'It remains unclear whether money is still flowing from Qatari nationals. 'There is clear evidence that Qatari nationals have been instrumental in the financing of Sunni terror groups and the Prime Minister should not avoid tackling this issue head on with the Emir.'","Cameron today challenged the Emir of Qatar to stop the flow of cash to ISIS .

"Ministers are drawing up new rules to put courts under a legal duty to ensure divorced parents are guaranteed access to their children. Parents who refuse to accept the orders will be in contempt of court and risk serious penalties or even jail. The move will delight fathers’ rights campaigners who believe dads are penalised under the present system which usually grants mothers custody. Hope: Fathers rights' campaigners will be delighted at the news because they can currently be refused access when mothers are granted custody . The Coalition is hoping to succeed where Labour failed. In early 2005, it tried to force mothers to let partners see their children by threatening to impose penalties such as night curfews and electronic tagging. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Tory work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith have apparently agreed a different approach which they hope will be more successful. Around 3.8million children - one in three - live without their father. Last night children’s minister Tim Loughton said: ‘Our vision is to establish that, under normal circumstances, a child will have a relationship with both his or her parents, regardless of their relationship with each other. 'We must do everything we can to improve the system so that it gives children the best chance of growing up under the guidance of two loving parents. New families: Nick Clegg believes the Coalition's efforts will give more children the chance to grow up with two parents . 'All the evidence tells us that children genuinely benefit from a relationship with both parents, with the potential to make different contributions to their child’s development. 'The culture has shifted away from the traditional view that mothers are primarily responsible for the care of children. Increasingly society recognises the valuable and distinct role of both parents. 'We are looking closely at all the options for promoting shared parenting through possible legislative and non-legislative means.' Mr Loughton’s comments indicate that ministers have gone against a key finding of November’s family justice review, which rejected equal access for mothers and fathers, saying it would put too much pressure on judges. It is believed that the law could be changed by amending the 1989 Children’s Act to include presumption of shared parenting. Another option would be for the Government to support a backbench bill by Tory MP Charlie Elphicke, which will be debated later this month. The bill requires courts and councils which are enforcing contact orders for children ‘to operate under the presumption that the rights of a child include growing up knowing and having access to and contact with both parents involved’. Nadine O’Connor, campaign director for Fathers4Justice, said a Government move would be a ‘massive step forward’. 'It is saying that dads have as many rights as mums,' she said. 'I will believe it when I see it, but the reform has to apply across the family justice system.'","Those who refuse to accept ruling could risk jail .

"Dr Colin Ferrie is being investigated by the General Medical Council after The Mail on Sunday exposed him for using hard drugs . A senior NHS children’s brain doctor who was exposed by The Mail on Sunday for using hard drugs when he was on call for his young patients has been suspended by the doctors’ watchdog. The General Medical Council (GMC) took the action against Dr Colin Ferrie last week as it launched its own investigation into the consultant paediatric neurologist. It is the start of a process which could see him struck off. It follows our exposé of the doctor, based at Leeds General Infirmary, in which we revealed how he took cocaine and crystal meth as well as the date-rape drug GHB and mephedrone. The GMC called a meeting of its Interim Orders Panel (IOP), which convened at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) in Manchester and decided to withdraw Dr Ferrie’s registration while it investigated. The IOP, which consists of a three-member panel with a legal assistant, has the power to suspend a doctor for up to 18 months while their case is looked into, but has to review it every six months. A spokesman for the GMC said: ‘The IOP acts to protect the public, where it is in the public interest or where it is in the doctor’s own interests. It means he can’t practise as a doctor until the investigation is completed. ‘We would like to be able to call all relevant witnesses so we can fully investigate this matter. ‘This is something that we take very seriously.’ The General Medical Council has approached The Mail on Sunday and asked for our evidence. Earlier this month, we published photographs of the highly respected consultant snorting lines of cocaine and swigging the powerful party drug GHB just an hour before he was ‘on call’ for vulnerable young patients. We have since been contacted by other concerned friends of the 51-year-old medic with evidence that his drug-taking has been chronic for several years and includes the highly addictive Class A substance crystal meth. Footage showed Dr Ferrie snorting cocaine an hour before he was meant to be on call making life or death decisions . West Yorkshire Police have launched their own investigation into his actions and the GMC admitted that its inquiry would have to follow that. The investigation will feature two case examiners – one medical and one non-medical – who will review the evidence and decide whether to conclude the case with no further action, issue a warning, agree undertakings to address the problem, or refer the case to the MPTS for a fitness to practice hearing. The MPTS is part of the GMC and accountable directly to Parliament. Its panel will decide at a public hearing whether Dr Ferrie’s fitness to practice is impaired. If it rules that it is, the panel will decide whether to place conditions on the doctor’s registration, suspend him or strike him off the medical register for anything from five years to life. Dr Ferrie will be represented at the hearing by the Medical Defence Union (MDU) which helps its member doctors with legal representation when they face hearings. A spokeswoman for the MDU said: ‘I can confirm that Dr Ferrie is a member of the MDU but I understand that he doesn’t wish to make a comment at the moment.’ A spokeswoman for Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, which suspended Dr Ferrie from duties earlier this month, said he had been assigned a case manager to oversee the internal inquiry. Dr Ferrie could also turn for help to the British Medical Association’s ‘doctors for doctors’ scheme, which provides dedicated, confidential emotional support to any doctor involved in a fitness to practice case.

"A man who suffered a serious eye injury as a child has got a tattoo - on his eyeball. William Watson, 58, underwent the extremely rare cosmetic procedure - which is definitely not for the squeamish - while he was awake. Mr Watson, from New York, experienced damage to his eye when he was hit in the face by a ball when he was a child, leaving his left iris looking permanently white and cloudy. Scroll down for video .

Dr Chynn did the actual tattooing while Mr Pento mixed the colours and assisted him in his work. To make sure the hour-long procedure was done accurately, the pair practised pupil tattooing manoeuvres beforehand on a grape.

"A US deep-sea exploration company says it has recovered about 48 tons of silver from a British cargo ship that was sunk by a torpedo during World War II. The haul comes from the SS Gairsoppa, which was hit by a torpedo from a German U-boat about 300 miles off Ireland's coast in 1941. It now sits 15,420ft deep. Salvage firm Odyssey Marine Exploration said it is the heaviest and deepest recovery of precious metals from a shipwreck ever made. Scroll down for video . Booty: Salvage workers inspect silver bars as they are recovered from the wreck of the SS Gairsoppa torpedoed in a German U-boat attack 300 miles off the south-west coast of Ireland . Doomed: On February 17, 1941, a single torpedo sank the SS Gairsoppa. All but one of her 85 crewmen were lost . Haul: Forty-eight tons of silver bullion has been recovered from the SS Gairsoppa and returned to the British Government but salvage firm Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc will keep 80% after expenses . The company is under contract with the . British Government and will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after . expenses. The remaining 20 per cent will go to the Treasury . So far, workers have brought up more . than 1,200 silver bars, or about 1.8 million troy ounces, worth about £23.7 million (about $37 million). The company is under contract with the British Government and will get to keep 80 per cent of the haul after expenses. The remaining 20 per cent will go to the Treasury. SS Gairsoppa was steaming home from . India in 1941 while in the service of the Ministry of War Transport when . she was torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat. She sank in British waters about 300 miles off the south west coast of Ireland. Only one of her 84 crew members survived. The 412-ft steamship has remained sitting upright on the seabed with its holds open, nearly three miles under water. Raised from the depths: A sonar image of the SS Gairsoppa on the bottom of the sea . Eerie: A ladder leads down to the cargo hold on the SS Gairsoppa as it lies on the sea bed 300 miles south of Galway . Uncovered: An intact toilet sits on the bridge deck of the SS Gairsoppa . Treasure hunter: The RV Odyssey Explorer, bristling with high-tech equipment, which went looking for and found the wreck of the Gairsoppa . Pick-up: Odyssey crew used remotely operated vehicles to get to the wreck and unload its precious cargo . The ship, recognisable by the . red-and-black paintwork of the British-India Steam Navigation Company . and the torpedo hole in its side, was sailing in a convoy from Calcutta . in 1941. Buffeted by high winds and running . low on coal, the captain decided he would not make it to Liverpool and . broke from the convoy to head for Galway. A single torpedo from U-101 sank her . in 20 minutes, on February 17, 1941. Three lifeboats were launched, but . only Second Officer Richard Ayres made it to land, reaching the Cornish . coast after 13 days. Well preserved: A brass part of the Gairsoppa is in remarkably good condition . In an earlier statement Odyssey said the UK . government was ‘desperately looking for new sources of income’ and was . urging it to find more British wrecks. It was also investigating HMS . Sussex, lost off Gibraltar with 10 tons of gold in 1694, and HMS . Victory, a precursor to Nelson’s flagship. In 2008 a US judge ordered the firm . to hand back gold and silver coins worth £300million to Spain, which . said the treasure was taken from a frigate that sank in 1804. Odyssey said the wreck’s identity was unclear and had been found in international waters. VIDEO: See the silver as it's hauled up from the bottom of the ocean!... By . Annabel Venning . Heroic: Second Officer Richard Ayres, the only survivor of the SS Gairsoppa . During World War II, Britain, cut off from occupied Europe, was utterly dependent on supplies reaching her by sea. But Hitler was determined to force Britain to her knees by cutting off . these supplies. He ordered his U-boat captains to hunt down and destroy . Allied shipping. In February 1941 alone, 38 British ships were sunk. Many of the ships were old and heavily laden, so they could travel no . faster than eight knots, making them an easy target for U-boats. The Gairsoppa, with its heavy load of almost 7,000 tonnes which included . the silver, as well as iron and tea, was forced to burn more and more . fuel to maintain her speed in the stormy seas as they journeyed north. Fearing that he did not have enough fuel to make it to Liverpool, her . skipper, Captain Gerald Hyland, asked permission to break away from the . convoy and make instead for Galway on Ireland’s south-west coast, and on . February 14, 1941, the Gairsoppa left the convoy. The U-101, captained by Ernst Mengersen, headed towards the Gairsoppa, . hoping to make a ‘kill’, and at 2230 hours a massive explosion blew . apart the ship’s Number Two hold. Such was the impact of the single . torpedo that the foremast snapped and crashed to the deck, taking with . it the radio antennae, so the crew were unable even to send a distress . signal. They were alone and sinking fast. As fire and smoke ripped through the . Gairsoppa, Captain Hyland gave the order to abandon ship and the men . made for the lifeboats. Then bullets ripped through the darkness, forcing them to . throw themselves down. The U-boat surfaced and sprayed the deck with machine-gun fire. Some of . the bullets cut through the ropes of one lifeboat, sending it crashing . into the sea. Dozens of men leapt overboard and swam towards it, . including Second Officer Richard Ayres. They began pushing away from the stricken vessel to avoid being sucked . down as it sank, and had to paddle frantically to get clear of the . spinning propellers. Somehow they pulled away and watched as just a hundred yards from them, . the Gairsoppa disappeared under the waves, within 20 minutes of being . hit. Of the other two lifeboats there was no sign. They were alone in . icy seas, hundreds of miles from land. There were 31 men in the lifeboat: eight Europeans and 23 Indian seamen — . known as Lascars — who immediately began suffering badly from the cold, . so they were given all the blankets and some canvas for shelter. (File picture) Old and heavily laden ships like the Gairsoppa made easy targets for the deadly German U-boats . The only man skilled at sailing a small boat, was 31-year-old Richard . Ayres who immediately took command and set sail eastwards, steering with . an oar because the rudder had been lost. Their food supplies consisted of some tins of condensed milk and dry . biscuit, so hard it could barely be swallowed. Ayres resisted the crew’s . pleas for extra water rations to soften the biscuit, because they were . desperately short of water. Each man was limited to half a pint of water a day and half a pint a . night. But the Lascars began drinking salt water, which made them go mad . and fight each other. Soon, men began dying. Then, on the eighth day, water ran out. There was no sign of land and little chance of rescue: no one knew their fate or whereabouts. Men become delirious and ‘had barely enough hope and heart to carry on,’ according to Ayres. A couple of rain showers gave some relief from the . thirst that burned their throats, but in the cold air, their hands and . fingers became swollen with frostbite, making it impossible to grip the . oars. Over the next few days, their strength and spirit ebbed away. Gaping: The torpedo hole in the SS Gairsoppa, where the U-boat Captain's log reported the ship was struck . But Ayres, determined, fit and strong, was resolved to save the lives of the remaining men. He sailed the little boat through towering waves and fierce gales, . snatching little sleep as only he, the Gairsoppa’s radio officer, . 18-year-old Robert Hampshire, and a gunner named Norman Thomas, 20, from . Chatham, Kent, had the strength left to man the rudder. Then, 13 days after the sinking, with only seven men surviving, many . barely clinging to life, one man croaked out the word they all longed to . hear: ‘Land’. At first the others thought it was just a cloud, but then they made out a . lighthouse. It was the Lizard lighthouse on the southernmost tip of . Cornwall, 300 miles from where the Gairsoppa had sunk. Ayres began sailing towards a rocky cove. Just as they were nearing its . entrance, a huge wave smashed onto the small boat, capsizing it. In . their weakened state, all but three of the men drowned — so near yet so . far from safety. Another wave righted the boat and Ayres managed to drag himself, . Hampshire and Thomas on board, only for another breaker to capsize them . again. They clung to the keel, but as more waves crashed violently over them they lost their grip. Hampshire was washed to his death, but Ayres and Thomas made it onto . nearby rocks. Then another icy wave knocked Thomas backwards, drowning . him just yards from safety. Exhausted and alone, Ayres felt ‘the fight for life was not worthwhile’. Then, as he surrendered himself to his fate, he heard voices urging him . not to give up. Three young girls, Betty Driver, Olive Martin and her sister, evacuees . from Tottenham in London, had been walking along the cliffs when they . spotted the boat flip over in the stormy seas below. One ran across the fields to fetch help from a nearby farm. The other . two raced down to the beach and shouted to the men, begging them to keep . swimming. Eventually, the first girl returned with a coastguard named Brian Richards, who threw Ayres a rope and pulled him ashore. The bodies of Hampshire, Thomas and two Lascars were recovered and . buried in a nearby cemetery. It later transpired that the place where . Ayres had come ashore, at Caerthillian Cove, was just a few miles from . his home. He was awarded an MBE in recognition of his heroic efforts to keep . fellow survivors alive, as well as a War Medal for bravery at sea. Ayres returned to sea just nine months later, and spoke little about it . after the war, during his years in the Royal Naval Reserve. He died in 1992. But the citation on his MBE will forever celebrate the . extraordinary efforts of this brave man: ‘It was only the cruelty of the . sea that robbed him of the fruits of his labour.","SS Gairsoppa was hit by torpedo from a German U-boat in 1941 .

"Two Louisiana English teachers accused of having group sex with a 16-year-old student were released on bail Thursday as more details began to emerge about their alleged tryst. Shelley Dufrense, 32, and Rachel Respess, 24, each posted $7,000 bond two days after their arrest on charges of carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior with a juvenile and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. Kenner Police Chief Michael Glaser said on Wednesday Respess invited Shelley and the 16-year-old to her home in the 1300 block of West Esplanade Avenue for a group tryst after the Destrehan-Helen Cox High School football game September 12. Scroll down for video . Shelley Dufresne (left), 32, a Louisiana teacher and married mother of three, allegedly had sexual encounters with a 16-year-old boy, which also involved another female English teacher identified as Rachel Respess (right) Love nest: Police say Repess invited her friend Dufresne and their underage lover to her home (pictured) in the 1300 block of West Esplanade Avenue in Kenner for group sex . But according to the teachers' booking records made public Thursday, the post-game sexual encounter with the student was not Dufresne's first. The documents, cited by Nola.com, stated that the married mother of three had met the boy for sex more than once before the September 12 incident. Dufresne allegedly 'enticed and transported' the 16-year-old to Respess' apartment in Kenner and invited the 24-year-old to join in. The teenager told police that when they got to the teacher's home, all three got naked and he proceeded to have sex with Respess. Meanwhile, Dufresne 'began intimately kissing [Respess] in an attempt to arouse all parties involved,' the booking record stated. Detectives are now looking into rumors that the trio made a sex tape during their encounter. Former students also told police that the trio have been involved in a sexual relationship for some time now. After police learned of the allegations, they interviewed the student, who is now 17 years old, according to Nola.com. The teen insisted that the sexual escapade was consensual. The age of consent in Louisiana is 17, and the victim was 16 at the time of the encounter with the teachers. If convicted, the teachers could face up to 17-and-a-half years in prison. ‘No matter what sex the victim is, everyone should be outraged,' Glaser said. ‘You have an educator. Their responsibility is the safety and the education of children. 'They should have known better.’ According to the police chief, Dufresne and Respess have been friends and both had taught the victim. Dufrense was his teacher until this week, and he was in Respess' English class last year. During questioning, Glaser said Repsess 'almost' came clean about her affair with the boy but stopped short of a full confession. Busted: Shelley Dufresne, pictured left in her yearbook, 32, is a Louisiana teacher and married mother of three, while Rachel Respess, right, 24, is accused of taking part in sexual trysts at her home . Dufresne has taught English for 10 years at Destrehan High School, where met another teacher who now has been implicated in the sex abuse case . Shelley Dufresne was arrested at around 5.30pm Tuesday on a warrant listing one count of carnal knowledge of a juvenile. She declined to make a statement to police. According to deputies, school officials contacted the sheriff's office last Friday after the alleged victim reportedly bragged to other students that he was having sex with two teachers. Officials with the St. Charles Parish Public School District also revealed that an investigation has been launched into a second incident involving Dufresne’s co-worker that allegedly occurred in another jurisdiction. Shelley Dufresne, nee St Pierre, was released from the parish jail Tuesday evening on $200,000 bond and was placed under house arrest. The married mother of three has been ordered not to leave her home except for continued mental health treatment, doctor appointments and church services. Wednesday morning, Rachel Respess turned herself in to the Kenner Police Department and was charged with carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. Ms Respass has been described as a Destrehan graduate who has been teaching English at the school for more than a year . Both teachers at the center of the criminal case have now been suspended without pay. Newcomer: Respass (left and right) is a a Destrehan graduate who has been teaching English at the school for more than a year . In custody: The 24-year-old now faces charges of carnal knowledge of a juvenile, indecent behavior and contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile. Dufresne's profile on Destrehan High School's website, which has since been deleted, stated that she has taught English at the school, her alma mater, for nearly 10 years. On her now-defunct page Dufresne reportedly wrote: 'I take my job and my students' education seriously and try my best to help all of my students be successful. 'I hope that all of my students have a great experience in my classroom and leave with the tools they need to be successful throughout the rest of their high school careers and in life,' reported the station WWL-TV.

"President Barack Obama chided the Republican Party for catering to the 'interests of billionaires' in an email to supporters on Tuesday, then attended a series of high-dollar fundraisers, including one at real estate mogul Rich Richman's house. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee fundraiser at Richman's house in Greenwich, Connecticut, cost as much as $32,400 a person, according to the White House. The other two events, held in New York and sponsored by the Democratic National Committee, cost between $1,000 and $32,400 to attend. Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama returns to the White House on Tuesday night after an afternoon of fundraisers, including one held at the home of a supporter named Rich Richman that cost $34,000 a person to attend . As Obama was yucking it up with wealthy Democratic donors, he sent out a fundraising email slamming the GOP for being in the pocket of billionaires, the Washington Times reports. 'If the Republicans win, we know who they’ll be fighting for,' Obama allegedly wrote. 'Once again, the interests of billionaires will come before the needs of the middle class.' The president opined in the email that 'Republican groups are spending massive sums against us.' At the fundraisers Obama did not discuss Republican representatives' loyalties, but he did plead with donors to elect Democrats in November if they want to see changes to the immigration system, paid family leave, repairs to the country's infrastructure and an increase in the federal minimum wage. 'We have achieved so much but we still have so much to do,' Obama told attendees of the DNC event in New York. 'So far, we can't get Republicans to cooperate.' The president told his audience that despite Republican obstructionism in Congress, his administration has had a number of successes, as well. 'The reason you don't hear about them is they elicit hope,' he said. 'They're good news.' The cynical media doesn't like to promote good news, he argued. 'Cynicism is a choice. Hope is a better choice,' he told attendees. 'I've never been more hopeful.' The fundraisers on Tuesday brought the total number of money-raising events Obama has attended this year up to 56. While candidates have hesitated to be seen with the president, the Democratic Party has not been shy about trotting him out at private events hosted by the rich and famous. In addition to the event at Richman's house, Obama attended a roundtable with Democratic supporters on Tuesday that was closed to press and a fundraiser at the home of Bill White and Bryan Eure. White is the former head of the Intrepid Air and Space Museum in New York. White resigned in 2010 after coming under investigation by then-state attorney general, now governor, Andrew Cuomo, for his participation in a state pension fund scheme. The attorney general's office never brought charges against White, but the longtime Democratic donor was forced to pay $1 million in restitution to the government. That event at his home on Tuesday also cost $32,400 to attend. Asked about the fundraiser by the New York Daily News on Tuesday, a White House spokesman declined to comment.","Obama chided the Republican Party for catering to the 'interests of billionaires' in an email on Tuesday .

North London-based charity Wildlife SOS stepped in to save Raju from dying in his bonds after learning of his plight in India. Every . day, the majestic animal was forced to hold out his trunk and beg for a . few coins from passers-by – surviving only on plastic and paper for . food. However, last week, a . 10-strong team of vets and wildlife experts from the charity were joined . by 20 forestry department officers and six policemen to seize Raju from . his suffering in the Uttar Pradesh area of India. The . mission took place under the cover of darkness, as fewer people would . be around for the dangerous rescue and the animal could be protected . from the searing heat of the sun. Pooja Binepal, the charity’s UK spokesman, described the rescue as ‘incredibly emotional’ for the team. She said: ‘Raju has spent the past 50 years living a pitiful existence in chains 24 hours a day, an act of intolerable cruelty. Every day, the majestic animal was forced to hold out his trunk and beg for coins from passers-by - surviving only on plastic and paper for food . The elephant was left bleeding from spiked shackles and living on hand-outs from passing tourists after he was captured by his 'owner' Wildlife SOS vet Dr Yaduraj Khadpekar tries to free Raju from the chains which he was kept in for 50 years . Wildlife SOS founder Kartick Satyanarayan said: 'The chains around his legs had spikes which were cutting into his flesh - and each time he moved puss would ooze out of wounds. Pain and brutality were all he knew' ‘The team were astounded to see tears roll down his face during the rescue. It was so incredibly emotional for all of us. We knew in our hearts he realised he was being freed. ‘Elephants are not only majestic, but they are highly intelligent animals, who have been proven to have feelings of grief, so we can only imagine what torture half a century has been like for him. ‘Until we stepped in he'd never known what it is like to walk free of his shackles – it's a truly pitiful case. ‘But today he knows what freedom is and he will learn what kindness feels like and what it's like to not suffer any more.’ The daring rescue came exactly a year . to the day since the charity was alerted to Raju's plight by the Uttar . Pradesh Forest Department in India. A . confiscation process went through the courts as Raju's owner did . not have any legal documents for his possession meaning the charity . could rescue him from suffering. It is not known exactly how Raju came into his plight, as little is known about his early years, but the charity believes he was poached from his mother as a young calf. Once rescued, he was loaded into an open-top lorry, given additional sedation and escorted 350 miles to the charity's Elephant Conservation and Care Centre at Mathura . The daring rescue came exactly a year to the day since the charity was alerted to Raju's plight by the Uttar Pradesh Forest Department in India . The charity has now launched a campaign to raise £10,000 for Raju to help begin the start of his new life . Ms Binepal said: ‘The poachers either slaughter the mother, or they drive the herd into traps that are small enough only for the babies to fall into. The mother cries for her baby for days after he's been stolen – it is a sickening trade. ‘The calves are then tied and beaten until they submit to their owners – their spirits are effectively broken. ‘We discovered Raju's case was particularly tragic. ‘He'd been poached as a calf and then he has been sold on and sold on. Incredibly we believe he has had up to 27 owners – he's been treated as a commodity every two years of his life. ‘By the time we found him in July 2013 he was in a pathetic condition. He had no shelter at night, and was being used as a prop to beg from dawn until dusk from tourists visiting the sites of India. ‘He hasn't been fed properly and tourists started giving him sweet food items and because he was in a state of hunger and exhaustion he began eating plastic and paper. ‘His nails are severely overgrown, he has abscesses and wounds because of the shackles and continually walking on a tarmac road has led to his foot pad overgrowing.’ Once the court order was finally issued, a team led by Wildlife SOS founder Kartick Satyanarayan carried out two days of surveillance before launching the rescue. Pooja Binepal, the charity's UK spokesman, described the rescue as 'incredibly emotional' for the team . Raju, after his release, with reformed former mahout Sonu Ali who will care for him at the sanctuary . Over the weekend, Raju received emergency medical attention to his wounds as well as a bath and food . Mr Satyanarayan said: ‘As we watched we quickly realised we had to act as quickly as possible as his situation was so desperate and the cruelty so extreme so we decided to move the rescue forward by a day. ‘The chains around his legs had spikes which were cutting into his flesh – and each time he moved puss would ooze out of wounds. Pain and brutality were all he knew. ‘His cruel handler even tore out the hair from his tail to sell as good luck charms. The exploitation and abuse just had to stop.’ However, even on Thursday evening as the mercy mission began, Raju's owner tried to prevent his rescue. Mr Satyanarayan said: ‘He began to shout commands to terrify Raju – and try to provoke him. ‘It created an incredibly dangerous situation as a bull elephant could snap a human like a tooth pick if he becomes afraid or angry. ‘When that failed he then put a series of chains around his legs in an attempt to prevent us removing him – so viciously tight that were cutting into his legs. ‘But we stood our ground and refused to back down – and as we did so, tears began to roll down Raju's face. Some no doubt were due to the pain being inflicted by the chains, but he also seemed to sense that change was coming. It was as if he felt hope for the first time in a very long time. ‘We knew it was now or never so we made the drastic decision to move his transportation truck closer and then walk him 200 yards. ‘Every step would have been agony, but we had to take him, or he could have vanished forever. We decided we'd remove the shackles once we'd got him to safety.’ Incredibly, Raju calmly complied, despite every step causing searing agony. ‘It was as if he knew we wanted to help him,’ Mr Satyanarayan said. Once he was loaded, and given additional sedation, a convoy then escorted the five-and-a-half tonne elephant, 350 miles on the back of an open-top lorry to the charity's Elephant Conservation and Care Centre at Mathura. ‘Incredibly he stepped out of his truck and took his first step to freedom at one minute past midnight on July 4th, which felt so extraordinarily fitting,’ Mr Satyanarayan said. ‘The other elephants in the sanctuary awoke from their sleep as we pulled in and came to have a look – it was an extraordinary moment.’ Raju was then fed bananas, banana leaves, mango and bread and biscuits and given water before the charity's head wildlife vet Dr Yaduraj Khadpekar began the painstaking process of removing his shackles. Mr Satyanarayan said: ‘It took him and . two handlers 45 minutes to liberate him as they'd been wound round his . legs to prevent their removal and to cause pain if anyone tried to take . them off. ‘We all had tears in our eyes as the last rope which held the final spike was cut and Raju took his first steps of freedom. ‘The . entire team were exhausted, but incredibly elated as he has suffered . such unthinkable abuse and trauma for so, so long. He'd been beaten so . badly, his spirit is broken.' The rescue took place under the cover of darkness, as fewer people would be around for the dangerous rescue and the animal could be protected from the heat of the sun . A 10-strong team of vets and wildlife experts from the charity were joined by 20 forestry department officers and six policemen to seize Raju from his suffering in the Uttar Pradesh area . Over the weekend, Raju received emergency medical attention to his wounds as well as a proper bath and food. ‘It will be a long rehabilitation process, but we will teach him that humans don't mean pain and brutality, but it's going to take time,’ Mr Satyanarayan said. ‘When he is ready he will initially join two companion elephants called Rajesh and Bhola, who once also suffered unthinkable cruelty. ‘They've both been rehabilitated and once he settles he will learn how to live again by following their example, before he joins the rest of the elephants – including five flirtatious females to live out his days. ‘But for the moment he's tasting freedom for the first time in his life and he'll spend the rest of his life in a safe compound living out his days in dignity, free from suffering and pain.’ The charity has now launched a campaign to raise £10,000 to help Raju begin the start of his new life in a new enclosure which will allow him to roam with his adoptive family.","Raju was held in chains for more than 50 years after being poached in India .

"A Georgia man has been ordered to pay his former fiance $50,000 for 'breach of promise' and fraud after he left her for another woman. Melissa Cooper successfully sued her former lover Christopher Kelley after she gave up her job and moved in with him only to be thrown out when she discovered his relationship with another woman. Ms Cooper contended in her lawsuit that she . quit her job to become a housewife for her former beau, their child and . another child he had from a former relationship. She made that sacrifice . under the premise she would be his wife. She won the lawsuit: Melissa Cooper has been awarded $50,000 by a Georgia court . ‘Cooper testified that she was devastated by Kelley's fraud and breach of promise to marry and that she quit her job to raise the couple's children in reliance on the promise,’ the ruling cited by CNS said. Her promiscuous partner made his bed by cheating on her multiple times and carrying on a relationship with another woman despite handing her a $10,000 engagement ring, she argued. In 2011, she discovered the secret affair, the second she had found during their relationship, and he demanded she move out of their home – with both children. Pay up: Christopher Kelley unsuccessfully tried to argue his relationship with Ms Cooper was similar to prostitution . The scorned would-be spouse then sued the cheating Mr Cooper for fraud and breach of promise to marry. In the state's Appeals Court last month, . Mr Kelley unsuccessfully tried to use a legal techincality to argue that . the promise to marry was made in a relationship similar to . prostitution, according to CNS. The state court of appeals ruled that the relationship did not involve the exchange of money for cohabitation and sexual favors, making the defense inapplicable. Mr Kelley also tried to claim he merely gave Ms Cooper the ring without proposing, but the court not only shot that down, it held it up as proof he never intended to marry her. ‘I never initiated the concept of marriage with her, outside of giving her that ring,’ Mr Kelley testified, according to CNS. ‘I never said the words 'will you marry me' to her.’ ‘This testimony, when juxtaposed with Cooper's testimony about the proposal and her acceptance, can be construed as an admission that Kelley never intended to marry Cooper,’ said the court decision. The latest ruling upheld a previous ruling being appealed by Mr Kelley, it includes damages awarded and attorney’s fees.","The court ruled Christopher Kelley never intended to marry Melissa Cooper .

"Tired of getting a chilly reception on vacation?  Then how about a trip to Iceland? The tiny, glacier-covered nation perched in the freezing Norwegian Sea boasts the friendliest people in the world, according to a new report by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Meanwhile those wanting to go on holiday to cheer themselves up would be well-advised to stay away from Bolivia, whose inhabitants rank as the world's least-friendly towards foreign visitors. This map ranking countries from red (most welcoming) to pale blue (least) shows the top 20 friendly countries in the world.  The UK comes 55th and the US 102nd . The U.S., meanwhile, comes a pretty unfriendly 102nd (out of 140 nations) on the welcoming scale, while the UK does quite well, coming 55th in the list, despite its stiff upper lip reputation. The list of countries ranked for friendliness comes from the Forum's newly-released Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Report, which gave scores on a scale from one, where locals made foreign visitors feel 'very unwelcome', to seven, for 'very welcome'. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given its reputation for having chatty inhabitants who enjoy a bit of 'craic', Ireland made the top ten, coming in at ninth place with a score of 6.8.  Meanwhile Canada, which is also known for the friendliness of its people, came 12th, with a score of 6.6. But it is Iceland, with its tiny population of 319,000, where temperatures hover at around zero at this time of the year, where visitors will be assured of the warmest welcome. America's position so far down the list, when it is know for its people telling visitors to 'Have a nice day!' is a surprise.  But few would have expected France to come higher than its position of 80th on the list, particularly the Brits, who often encounter a certain froideur on holidays across the Channel. The top ten nations in order of their friendliness to visitors from elsewhere are: Iceland, New Zealand, Morocco, Macedonia, Austria, Senegal, Portugal, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland and Burkina Faso. The bottom ten, meanwhile, were . Mongolia, Bulgaria, Slovak Republic, Pakistan, Iran, Latvia, Kuwait, . Russian Federation, Venezuela and Bolivia.

"A young woman left paralysed after an accident at work  said a boob job gave her the confidence and motivation to learn to walk again. Nicola Woodman, 26, from Stafford in the West Midlands was distraught when she was left partially paralysed after a lifting injury at work. The lack of feeling in her lower body meant she was forced to wear a colostomy bag, which ruined her confidence. She decided to undergo a breast enhancement operation to improve her self-esteem. Nicola Woodman, 26, from Stafford, was left partially paralysed (left) and fitted with a colostomy bag after an accident at work. To improve her self-esteem and encourage her recovery she underwent breast enlargement surgery which gave her the confidence learn to walk again, and even go on holiday (right) Her breasts went up five cup sizes, from 32A to 32E and she credits the operation in helping her recover. She said: 'I feel amazing now I've got big boobs, I love them. 'They look fantastic and have helped my recovery as I'm full of confidence. 'I was going through rehab before my boob job, and was slowly taking a few steps, but my boob job has really helped me to walk properly again. 'I feel like a different person.' She added: 'My boob job has given me the lift I needed in order to continue with my recovery.' Miss Woodman, a healthcare support worker, became paralysed in March 2012 after lifting a patient at work damaged some of the discs in her spine. Doctors are still unsure how this led to paralysis, but it was later found that she had degenerative discs in her spine, meaning she might have had a weaker back than usual. It is thought the fluid between discs in her spine had become thinner than usual in a woman of her age, causing pain and paralysis. The condition caused her to lose all feeling from the waist to the knee caps, and she has no sensation in her toes. As the nerves that control the bowel and bladder are located at the base of the spine, Miss Woodman lost the ability to go to the toilet. She needed a colostomy, an operation where a section of the bowel is diverted and attached to an opening in the wall of the abdomen, where waste can be collected into a drainage bag. She said: 'It was a really difficult time, but my confidence really hit rock bottom when I had to be fitted with a colostomy bag. Before Miss Woodman's accident (right) she was  healthy, but after hurting her back at work doctors discovered she might have degenerative discs in her spine (left) 'I knew the colostomy bag was the best decision as I just couldn't feel anything, but it really affected my self-esteem.' Miss Woodman had been going to rehab in order to learn to walk again. But due to her slow progress she decided she needed something to lift her mood. So in July this year she decided a breast enlargement surgery would give her the motivation to keep working at her recovery. She said: 'I knew having a boob job would help boost my confidence, so I decided to go ahead. 'I'd always hated my 32A boobs anyway. 'I didn't want small boobs for any longer and after a friend recommended a great surgery clinic to me, I booked in for a free consultation. 'My new 32E boobs felt amazing, they've changed my life.' Before Miss Woodman's accident, she was an active and healthy woman who had never had any back problems. She said: 'Before my accident at work I had been a completely normal and healthy. 'I had no idea I had a weak back until lifting a patient damaged a few of my discs.' She added that her partner and family have supported her throughout her ordeal and she knows she couldn't have got through the past year without them. She said: 'They fully supported my decision to undergo a boob job and they can see how it's changed my life already. 'For seven months I relied on carers to help me at home but finally after regaining my strength I'm leading an independent life.' Miss Woodman underwent a breast enlargement operation increasing the size of her breasts from 32A to 32E . At first doctors feared Miss Woodman may have meningitis or multiple sclerosis but tests failed to reach any diagnosis. With no clear conclusion, and after months of being bed-bound, she didn't know if she would ever walk again. But her breast enlargement gave her the motivation to work hard during physiotherapy, and eventually she was able to take her first few steps. She has since gone on holiday to show off her new body. Miss Woodman said: 'I had a few people staring and pointing at my colostomy bag when I was in my bikini but I am proud of it. 'I no longer needed padding in my bikini tops and that filled me with such excitement.' She hopes one day the feeling in her lower body will return, but at the moment is focused on going to university. She said: 'I might need an operation in the future but I'm not focusing on that yet. 'I'm started university this week and I'm excited to get on with my life. 'I can finally start looking forward to the future.'","Nicola Woodman, 26, damaged her back when lifting a patient at work .

"Osama bin Laden's son-in-law was sentenced to life in prison today for acting as al-Qaeda's spokesman after the September 11 terror attacks. Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who said he saw 'no remorse whatsoever' from the 48-year-old imam. 'You continue to threaten,' the judge said. 'You sir, in my assessment, still want to do everything you can to carry out al-Qaeda's agenda of killing Americans.' Osama bin Laden's son-in-law Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was sentenced today to life in prison for acting as al-Qaida's spokesman (seen in this video) after the September 11 terror attacks . A March 2014 courtroom sketch of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith,  the highest-ranking al-Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the attacks . Abu Ghaith was the highest-ranking al-Qaeda figure to face trial on U.S. soil since the attacks. The Kuwaiti cleric became the voice of al-Qaeda recruitment videotapes after the 2001 attacks. He testified at trial that his role was strictly religious. Just before he was sentenced, Abu Ghaith said through an interpreter that he 'would not come here today and seek mercy from anyone but God.' Abu Ghaith was convicted in March on conspiracy charges that he answered Osama bin Laden's request in the hours after the attacks to speak on the widely circulated videos used to recruit new followers willing to go on suicide missions like the 19 who hijacked four commercial jets on September 11 (pictured) 'At the same moment you were shackling my hands and intending to bury me alive, you are at the same time unleashing the hands of hundreds of Muslim youths,' he said. 'They will join the ranks of the free men soon and very soon the world will see the end of these theater plays.' As he announced Abu Ghaith's sentence, Kaplan said that 'as recently as 15 minutes ago, you continued to threaten.' Defense attorney Stanley Cohen asked the judge to impose a 15-year sentence. Jurors also saw frames of a video made September 12, 2001, in which Abu Ghaith was seated next to bin Laden and two other top al-Qaeda leaders as they tried to justify the attacks.

Abu Ghaith was convicted in March on conspiracy charges that he answered Osama bin Laden's request in the hours after the attacks to speak on the widely circulated videos used to recruit new followers willing to go on suicide missions like the 19 who hijacked four commercial jets on September 11. 'The storm of airplanes will not stop,' the Kuwaiti imam warned in an October 2001 video that was played for the jury. Abu Ghaith  denied he was an al-Qaeda recruiter. He insisted he agreed to meet with bin Laden (pictured) in a cave on the night of September 11, 2001, out of respect for bin Laden's standing as a sheik . Jurors also saw frames of a video made September 12, 2001, in which Abu Ghaith was seated next to bin Laden and two other top al-Qaeda leaders as they tried to justify the attacks. Taking the witness stand in his own defense, Abu Ghaith calmly denied he was an al-Qaeda recruiter and claimed his role was a religious one aimed at encouraging all Muslims to rise up against their oppressors. He insisted he agreed to meet with bin Laden in a cave on the night of September 11, 2001, out of respect for bin Laden's standing as a sheik. 'I didn't go to meet with him to bless if he had killed hundreds of Americans or not. I went to meet with him to know what he wanted,' Abu Ghaith said. In asking for leniency, Cohen compared his client to an outrageous shock-radio host. The attorney wrote in court papers that Abu Gaith 'faces the harshest of penalties for talk — and only talk — which is at times zealous, pious and devout; at other times intemperate; at still others, offensive to core values of humanity.' In a submission seeking a life sentence, the government responded by calling the comparison to a radio host 'as absurd as it is offensive' and accused the defense of trying to minimize Abu Ghaith's role in promoting al-Qaida's deadly agenda. 'Abu Ghaith was a terrorist who sat alongside bin Laden on the morning of Sept. 12, 2001, celebrating the murder of nearly 3,000 innocent, men, women and children the day before,' prosecutors wrote.","Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, 48, was sentenced at a New York court today .

"Liam Strother, pictured, has been accused of bedding British women in Cambodia before stealing from them . The British expatriate community in Cambodia have been warned to be on the alert for a one-man crime wave being operated by a teenage Briton described as a ‘conning Cassonova’. He is said to have won the confidence of beautiful women before bedding them and then stealing credit cards, cameras, money and other valuable items. Other tourists are alleged to have been cheated by Liam Strother, who is described as being ‘something of a Cassonova’, aged about 19 from Grantown-on-Spey, in the Scottish Highlands. Britons living in Cambodia have been so alarmed by the alleged thieving activities of Strother that they have posted his photo on an expatriate forum and have urged businesses to be on the look out for him. According to the expatriate forum Khmer 440, Strother is reported to have left a trail of unpaid bills in expatriate-owned bars and guest houses the southern town of Sihanoukville, where he is alleged to have stolen personal items from tourists and Britons he’d befriend and who had allowed him into their homes or hotels. ‘Having worn out his welcome at the beach, been briefly jailed and had his passport confiscated by the Khmer police, Strother moved to (the capital) Phnom Penh, where his one-man crime spree has continued unabated,’ the forum states. ‘In the last two weeks we have received reports of him once again running up large debts at hostels and guesthouses and just as in Sihanoukville, befriending female travellers and then stealing their money and valuables.’ The Briton was arrested in the southern resort of Sihanoukville (pictured) on charges which include filming her naked against her will . Expatriate residents writing to the forum have added their warnings. One man said he had worked with Strother near Grantown-on-Spey where he allegedly stole money from a credit card machine, after which he was arrested and allegedly spent time in juvenile detention in Scotland. The former owner of a lodge in Scotland wrote that Strother had stolen from his credit card machine. ‘I had him arrested and he was charged. He will steal from anybody. Avoid him.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","British teenager accused of launching a one-man crime wave in Cambodia .

"It’s every girl’s dream to look beautiful on her wedding day. But a botched nose job left one woman feeling ‘more like a boxer than a bride’ - and considering cancelling her big day entirely. Clare Morgan, 34, from Liverpool, nicknamed 'Big Bird' by school bullies had her first nose job at the age of 25. But when the operation went wrong, she was left with a nose that she said looked 'worse than before'. After being bullied for her nose (left) Clare Morgan, 34, from Liverpool underwent four nose jobs to achieve the look she wanted for her wedding day (right) A non-surgical nose filler treatment she found online 16 weeks before her wedding day finally restored her confidence and allowed her to walk down the aisle to marry her partner, Ryan, with pride . Two correction surgeries  failed, leaving her nose too weak for further operations. But when her boyfriend Ryan proposed, and the couple set a date for their wedding, Mrs Morgan's anxieties took over. She contemplated banning cameras, or cancelling their big day altogether. After researching treatments on the internet, Mrs Morgan discovered a non-surgical nose job 16 weeks before her wedding day. It restored the shape she wanted and gave her the confidence to walk down the aisle. Mrs Morgan said: ‘There was no way I could have married with my nose the way it was. It looked awful and I was far too self-conscious about it. ‘I felt I looked like a boxer with an odd shaped nose after too many fights. ‘At one point I thought I would have to cancel the wedding but thank goodness the new surgery worked and my nose looked normal again just in time. ‘It’s taken four procedures but I’m finally happy with the way it looks.’ Mrs Morgan’s confidence was left left shattered after years of childhood bullying, her peers targeting her nose. Nicknamed ‘Big Bird’ after the character in Sesame Street, she avoided being pictured side on and longed for the day she could afford cosmetic surgery. Before her first nose job, a surgeon showed Mrs Morgan a photoshopped image of what her nose would look like after the operation (left) - but the reality was so different it left her wanting to cancel her wedding (right) A month after her first nose job, Mrs Morgan was not happy with the result and underwent a further two corrective surgeries and eventually a non-surgical filler treatment . When she was 25 she gained access to some inheritance held in trust since she was eight. At £3,500 it was just enough for a nose job. In March 2005, she met a surgeon who agreed to straighten the nose and remove the bump. She was shown a Photoshopped image of how she would look post-surgery and loved the result. She underwent the procedure in May 2005 but it was another two weeks before she got to see her new nose. Mrs Morgan said that after her first nose job and two failed corrective procedures her nose looked like a 'plastic comedy one' But when she finally looked in a mirror, it was a shock. Despite hating what she saw, her surgeon assured her it would settle in time. However, a month later Mrs Morgan noticed the bridge of her nose was getting wider. By March 2006, her surgeon confirmed that the bone down the centre of her nose hadn’t fused properly and was in fact separating. He offered to perform corrective surgery, but once again Mrs Morgan was left feeling disappointed with the results. Her nose looked worse than before, despite the corrective surgery. She said: ‘I couldn’t see any improvement to the bridge and the tip and nostrils looked strangely pointed. ‘I knew it looked worse than it had before and my confidence plummeted.’ To make herself feel better she agreed to a holiday with friends. It was there she met her future husband Ryan. She said: ‘I immediately told him I’d had surgery that had gone wrong and wanted to get it sorted. He told me I looked great but I knew I wouldn’t be happy unless it was fixed.’ After returning, her surgeon agreed to break and resent her nose for a second time. Two weeks later she was horrified to see the bridge now appeared too small for the tip. Furious, she parted ways with the surgeon and instead went to her GP, but after three failed operations he warned her it was unlikely she would find anyone willing to operate. Mrs Morgan then had no choice but to resort to using make up techniques to try and disguise her nose. She said: ‘I tried to focus on my future and forget about it but it still affected my confidence every day and I avoided cameras as much as I could.’ In 2010, her partner proposed and soon after the couple had their first baby, a son James. After James’ birth the couple decided to set a date for the wedding, and decided on the August 12, 2012. Initially Mrs Morgan was excited. But that excitement turned to dread when she started thinking about the photographs, and all the guests seeing the nose that she hated. She said: ‘It was only after I had booked a venue and paid the deposit that I started thinking about wedding photography. ‘I started to panic about my nose and trying to think of ways around the problem.’ She even considered banning cameras from the wedding. She said: ‘I thought if we could just have the professional photographer than then there was no risk of anyone taking a side profile picture of me. ‘I knew I’d sound awful and ridiculous though. I even considered photo-shopping all the wedding pictures or cancelling it all together.’ But while researching botched nose jobs online she stumbled across a new treatment that reshaped noses using fillers – without needing surgery. There was one problem, the clinic was in LA. So Mrs Morgan started searching for a clinic in the UK and found a company that offered the treatment. With just 16 weeks before her big day she contacted Transform, and saw a consultant. He agreed her nose job was the worst he had ever seen, but was confident that he could use an injectable solution to restore the shape before the wedding. Despite anxieties about her nose leading her to consider cancelling her big day,  Mrs Morgan said she felt 'amazing' in her dress and actually enjoyed being photographed on her wedding day .

"Students are spending more than £1,000 a year each on beauty products, according to new figures. Female students at Lancaster University were the vainest in the UK - spending £1,109 each on make-up, fragrances and skin products in the last year. They topped a league table of beauty spending at more than 200 colleges in the UK. The cost of studying means that debt is a fact of university life but some students refuse to give up on their beauty regime . The high spending comes despite new figures showing that undergraduates starting university this academic year will leave with debts of £53,000. The second-most beauty conscious students in the UK are at the University of York - with an average yearly spend on beauty products of £968. Durham University was third with spending of £895. Cambridge University - the UK’s number one ranked university  - was 16th in the table with students spending £278 a year. Oxford University was 25th with spending of £155. Online beauty retailer Escentual.com assessed spending patterns at all higher education institutions in the UK. Traditionally, students spend far more online than other shoppers, preferring the convenience of online retailing. The spending at Lancaster University equates to £370 per term, and roughly 20 per cent of their £5,500 yearly student loan. Made in Chelsea star Louise Thompson (left) studied geography at Edinburgh University while brainy British model Lily Cole got a Double First in History of Art at the University of Cambridge . A double room near the Lancaster University campus can be rented for £65 per week, or £3,380 per year, meaning Lancaster students are spending up to the equivalent of one-third of their yearly rent on luxury beauty and grooming. Students from The University of York and Durham University followed Lancaster in the spending stakes, with average beauty spends of £323 per term and £298 per term respectively. They favoured more high-end brands than Lancaster, splashing out on luxury products from Clarins and Dior. The most popular beauty product across all universities was the Avene Eau Thermale Spring Water Spray, with students spending a total of £14,382 on the French pharmacy product in the past year. Students at the University of Southampton (£741 per year), the University of Manchester (£691 per year) and the University of Bristol (£653 per year) were also in the top 10 of luxury beauty spenders. Popular products purchased include La Roche-Posay’s Effaclar Duo – renowned for targeting spots and blemishes – and the cult favourite Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micelle Solution. In Eighties sitcom The Young Ones, Rik, Vyvyan, Neil and Mike barely even washed but today's students are much more beauty conscious . The high levels of online beauty spending indicate a heightened interest in beauty and grooming amongst UK university students – particularly from students in the Russell Group of elite universities. All bar three of the top 10 spending universities are in the Russell Group, and five other Russell Group institutions made the top 20. UCL was the only London university to feature in the top 20 highest spenders, with students spending an average of £402 on beauty products per year – almost three times the amount of a 12-month gym membership at the university’s Bloomsbury Fitness centre. Beauty-conscious students at the University of Leeds – whose alumni include Prince Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas – spent a yearly total of £333 on online beauty products. Escentual chief executive Rakesh Aggarwal said: 'Gone are the days of student life meaning living on ready meals and lying-in until past midday. Despite their reputation for being cash-strapped and lazy, more and more students nowadays are taking the initiative to find part-time work alongside their studies, so they have more funds to spend on the little luxuries. 'Students are the businessmen and women of the future; we will one day be relying on them to keep our economy afloat, so it’s refreshing to see they’re taking an enterprising approach during their university years and aren’t solely relying on their student loans.' Aggarwal added: 'The number of students shopping online is on the rise, too. Students have busy lifestyles and don’t always have time to go out to department stores to purchase beauty products – for them, buying online is a quick and convenient alternative.' Students at Derby and Bath Spa universities were among the UK’s lowest beauty spenders.","Vainest university is Lancaster .

"A ‘British jobs for British workers’ row erupted yesterday as it emerged that a new £1billion wind farm off the Lincolnshire coast is being maintained by teams of workers flown in from Scandinavia. As he officially opened the offshore scheme yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg claimed 30,000 British jobs would be created by the end of the decade by investing in renewable energy. But local MPs and businessmen said this appeared a hollow promise. Because turbines for the Centrica scheme off Skegness are made in Denmark, Danish and Swedish workers are being drafted in daily to work on them. Scandinavian Airlines will even begin a six-days-a-week service between Copenhagen and Humberside Airport in October to keep up with demand. The whole construction of the wind farm was largely foreign, with a French company making the cabling in Germany and Norway and the foundations being manufactured  in Holland. Sam Pick, who runs a renewable energy consultancy, said Britain was in the ‘craziest possible situation’ where the Government was ‘subsidising development to a huge degree but doing absolutely nothing to either guarantee or support UK content’ in offshore wind farms. ‘There are turbines out there in the North Sea which have not touched UK mainland,’ he said. Labour MP Nic Dakin warned that if  the industry did not train British people to service and maintain the turbines, there  was little prospect of any domestic jobs premium from the so-called ‘Green revolution’. Announcing £66million of fresh Government funding for the offshore wind industry, Mr Clegg said the investment would help to make the UK a ‘world leader’ in the sector and create an employment boom, contributing £7billion to the economy. He compared climate change sceptics who oppose wind farms and other renewable energy developments to the Luddites who smashed machinery during the Industrial Revolution. ‘I think this industry will get bigger and bigger year in year out, which means more jobs in the local area. I know there are many local concerns that the focal work on these wind farms is performed by those flown from elsewhere, yet there are promising signs,’ said Mr Clegg. ‘As a Government we’ve announced an offshore wind strategy that should lead to 30,000 British jobs being created by the end of this decade and we are working with the industry to make sure that the British supply chain are given a fair crack of the whip in the future.’ Mr Clegg hopes the industry will more than quadruple in size by 2020 – at the highest end of government predictions – with half the production coming from domestic firms. But his claims were dismissed by industry experts, who said the targets and job creation predictions were hopelessly optimistic. They say unless major companies can be persuaded to manufacture wind turbines in the UK, wind farms will continue to be built, but few jobs will go to British workers. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg looks out of a helicopter window as he flies over the wind farm yesterday . Mr Pick said: ‘If the Government . doesn’t succeed in bringing wind farm manufacturing to the UK in the . near future then we will miss out on the tens of thousands of jobs that . have been promised and they will go to mainland Europe instead.’ Mr . Dakin, MP for Scunthorpe, said: ‘If we do not act now, we will be in . the same position by 2020 and will have to import skills and expertise . while our own school leavers and young adults continue to languish in . unemployment.’ Humberside has a history of industrial unrest over foreign workers ‘taking British jobs’. Workers at the Lindsey Oil Refinery at Immingham, North Lincolnshire, staged unofficial strikes and mass protests four years ago because 400 Italian and Portuguese workers were being brought in to work on a major construction project. Giant floating barges were being used to house the hundreds of foreign workers who were involved in building a de-sulphurisation unit at the Total refinery. The £300million contract was put out to tender and won by an Italian firm which angered unions by bringing in Europeans rather than hiring locals in an area of high unemployment. A mass walkout by workers at the Lindsey refinery led to copycat action across the UK. Employees at power stations  and refineries across the  country held ‘sympathy’ walkouts in protest at the use of  foreign workers. A deal was eventually struck to give some new jobs to British workers, although no foreign employees at the Total refinery lost their jobs. The Institute . for Public Policy Research, a leading think-tank, also found Mr Clegg’s . claims were optimistic and said greater certainty was needed to attract . investment. Generous . taxpayer-funded subsidies for wind farms are set to continue until the . end of the decade, but foreign energy firms want a longer-term . commitment. Proposals for a new Siemens wind turbine factory in Hull were given planning permission in May last year. But the German firm wants more concrete promises before it goes ahead with the £80million factory, which would create 700 direct jobs and thousands in the supply chain. Ministers have promised guaranteed prices – fixed at up to triple the market rate – for electricity from offshore wind until 2019. They say the financial incentive will make Britain an attractive place to invest and transform our energy supply, but the difference between the wholesale price and the agreed rate will have to be met by consumers. Dr John Constable, of the Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity publishing data on the energy sector, said: ‘Even if the Government’s optimistic assumptions are right, the fact is that wind jobs are soft jobs and dependent on subsidies that increase energy costs and destroy jobs in real businesses. ‘We can’t be sure that the wind jobs will be in the UK, but there is no doubt at all that the jobs lost through high energy costs really will be British.’ Energy Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘Local people can absolutely benefit from the workers who come from abroad. We want to have a lot more British jobs in the industry, that is why we are publishing the industrial strategy. We want to make sure we get the jobs in the supply chain. ‘At the moment because we are coming from a small base it hasn’t been, but we believe the potential here is huge.’ Councils across the UK have spent more than £7.2million on charging points for electric cars over the past three years yet many are not being used. One in six councils had at least one point not used at all over the past year, and less than a third of authorities had a charging point being used on average more than once a week, figures obtained by the BBC revealed.","Offshore scheme off Lincolnshire coast is being maintained by workers flown in from Scandinavia .

"A white lesbian mother is suing a Chicago sperm bank after she claims she was mistakenly sent a black man's sperm and gave birth to a mixed-race daughter. Jennifer Cramblett, 36, claims the mistake has caused her stress and anguish because her family is racist and she lives in a small, all-white Uniontown in northeast Ohio. In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County, Illinois, Ms Cramblett says Midwest Sperm Bank sent her several vials of a black man's sperm by mistake because the clinic keeps paper records and accidentally transposed numbers on her order. The couple had specifically chosen a white donor to be the father of their child. Jennifer Cramblett (right) and her partner Amanda Zinkon (left) picked out a white sperm donor from Midwest Sperm Bank, but were instead sent a black man's sperm, the allege . Midwest Sperm Bank charged $400 per vial of semen and Ms Cramblett and her partner received six vials of the wrong semen. The lawsuit says the clinic later sent Ms Cramblett an apology note and a refund for the six vials - though charged her for the vials of the correct semen she received. Ms Cramblett she has 'limited cultural competency relative to African-Americans' and worries that her daughter Payton will not be accepted in her hometown of Uniontown. 'Jennifer lives each day with fears, anxieties and uncertainty about her future and Payton's future,' according to the lawsuit. Ms Cramblett, the assistant manager of an AT&T store, said she and her partner Amanda Zinkon love their daughter, who is now two years old, but say they must now consider moving to a more diverse community. Amanda Zinkon is pictured here with daughter Payton, who is mixed-race . Ms Cramblett says in her lawsuit that much of her family is racist and that one uncle openly makes racist comments. Even simple tasks have become more complicated because Payton is mixed-race, the lawsuit says. 'Payton has hair typical of an African American girl. To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome,' according to the lawsuit. Ms Cramblett says she grew up in Scio, Ohio - population 762 - and didn't meet a black person until she attended college. She currently lives in Uniontown, population 2,802, and fears Payton will be the only non-white child in class when the time comes for her to attend school. Ms Cramblett says her family has difficulty accepting the fact that she is gay and encourage her to hide her sexual orientation when she is around them. She says no matter what she does, Payton cannot hide her race - nor should she have to. Ms Cramblett is alleging breach of warranty and wrongful birth. Midwest Sperm Bank would not comment on the case.","Jennifer Cramblett says she fears her daughter won't be accepted by her racist family and neighbors in small, all-white Uniontown, Ohio .

"There are more than 1.7 million words in the Game of Thrones book series, and the average reader takes a staggering 424 days to complete the set. But if you’re wondering whether it would take you that long, or you're sure you could read it much faster, there is now an online test to find out. As well as revealing how long it would take for you to read George R. R. Martin’s novels, the results tell you your reading speed, how it compares to the national average, and how long it would take to read 46 other bestsellers. Take the test below . The test was created for Tesco’s Blinkbox Books service. The new boy had kept in the background, in the corner behind the door, almost out of sight. He was a country lad of about fifteen, and taller than any of us. His hair was clipped straight across the forehead, like a village choirboy's. He seemed a decent enough fellow, but horribly nervous. Although he was not broad across the shoulders, his green cloth jacket, with its black buttons, looked as if it pinched him under the arms and revealed, protruding well beyond the cuffs, a pair of raw, bony wrists, obviously not unaccustomed to exposure. His legs, encased in blue stockings, issued from a pair of drab-coloured breeches, very tightly braced. He had on a pair of thick, clumsy shoes, not particularly well cleaned and plentifully fortified with nails. It begins by asking users to read a section of text, before clicking Done. The reader is then asked three questions to determine how much they have remembered and taken in from the portion of text. As the final part of the test, the reader is asked how long they could commit to reading each day before getting the results. Based on the speed at which the text was read, and how long the reader could commit to reading each day, a chart reveals how many books they could finish in a year. For example, following our test, we were told we read 339 words per minute, meaning we could read 56 books a year if we committed to reading 45 minutes a day. Adding 10 minutes a day increased this total to 68. Based on the speed at which the text was read, and how long the reader could commit to reading each day, a chart (pictured) reveals how many books they could finish in a year, based on the average length of a bestseller at 99,390 words. The chart also shows how the participant’s reading speed compares to the average reader . The test also calculates the number of words in 47 bestsellers, including Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, War and Peace and Pride and Prejudice, to reveal how long it would take the participant to complete each one . These results were based on the average length of a bestseller at 99,390 words. The chart also shows how the participant’s reading speed compares to the average reader. And a slider along the bottom of the graph reveals how the total number of books would change if the amount of time spent reading each day was decreased, or increased. On the next page, the test calculates the number of words in 47 bestsellers, including Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, War and Peace and Pride and Prejudice, and reveals how long it would take to complete each one. Based on our test results, it would take us 118 days to read the whole Game of Thrones book series by George R. R. Martin (pictured). This is 306 days faster than the average reader . Based on our test results, it would take us 118 days to read the whole Game of Thrones book series by George R. R. Martin, 71 days to read J.K Rowling’s Harry Potter series and 38 days to read Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace. In regards the Game of Thrones series, this is 306 days faster than the average reader. The key to the test isn’t to rush through the text and prove how fast a person can read, it is designed to identify a person’s natural reading pace.","It asks participants to read a sample text before asking questions about it .

"A Detroit factory worker whose has received over $350,000 in donations from strangers inspired by his story about walking a 21 mile round trip from home to work, has been forced to move house after telling police that he no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood. James Robertson's plight made national headlines earlier this month and he received a 2015 red Ford Taurus and more than $350,000 from an online campaign inspired by his dedication in walking to his suburban factory job five days a week. On Tuesday Robertson left the rooming house he has called home for 15 years after contacting police about no longer feeling safe. Crime-prevention specialists have offered him temporary living quarters. Scroll down for video . Detroit factory worker James Robertson, 56, received over $350,000 in donations from strangers inspired by his story about walking 21 miles to and from work per day for the past ten years . James Robertson also received a 2015 red Ford Taurus after people heard about his plight of walking 21 miles to work each day for the past ten years . 'People were actually asking him for money,' 2nd Deputy Chief June West told Detroit Free Press. Robertson decision was fueled by several recent examples of people in Detroit being victimized after coming into money. A man was charged last week in connection with the killing of an 86-year-old man who disappeared in December, three days after winning a $20,000 lottery game. 'He knew about that story, and I also know about an incident in the 1st Precinct where a gentleman was killed after he allegedly won some money,' said Capt. Aric Tosqui. Robertson told the DFP that he was relieved to be out of the rooming house and away from his landlady and so-called girlfriend Tanya Fox, 60. 'The issue was, she liked to control everyone and everything,' said Robertson. Although Fox told DFP that the pair remain an item - although she doesn't have his new address. Robertson has yet to receive any of the cash, raised in just a week of online donations to a GoFundMe.com page created by Evan Leedy. Robertson and Leedy, 19, are scheduled to meet within a week with financial advisers to discuss management of the funds. Robertson has told the Detroit Free Press that his car broke down a decade ago and, making $10.55 an hour, he has been unable to save for a new one . The newspaper said Robertson takes buses to work, but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route . Earlier this month Robertson had inspired the nation with his story of how his car had broken down a decade ago and, making $10.55 an hour, he'd been unable to save for a new one. On February 6 Robertson thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with Evan Leedy and Blake Pollock, who both helped coordinate the gift, worth an estimated $37,000. Instead Robertson was greeted by reporters and a team of supporters who first learned of his marathon commute this week in a story that ran in the Sunday Detroit Free Press. The story has since been widely shared on social media, and Robertson has been featured on national network news programs. The publicity has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming Metro Detroit's troubled public transportation system. The publicity surrounding the story has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming Metro Detroit's troubled public transportation system . 'I don't like it, I love it,' said Robertson, 56, who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red Ford Taurus. 'If only my parents could see me now.' An emotional Robertson is overcome by the gift of the car that he said was simple on the outside and strong on the inside, a description he also applied to himself . Leedy, 19, a student at Wayne State University, launched an online GoFundMe.com fundraiser after he read about Robertson's daily trek between his home in Detroit and the Schain Mold & Engineering factory in the suburb of Rochester Hills. He spent part of the week negotiating a reasonable insurance rate for Robertson, who has not driven in 10 years. Leedy told Reuters he was initially quoted a $15,000-a-year premium, a quote that illustrates Detroit's notoriously high insurance rates. 'I don't like it, I love it,' said Robertson, 56, who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red Ford Taurus. 'If only my parents could see me now.' The Free Press was tipped off by Pollock, a banker who had befriended Robertson two years ago when he spotted the factory worker walking by his office on his way to work. A finance expert has now assembled a group of advisers to manage the ever-growing fund, which is now 17,500 times larger than his annual wage - or equivalent to eight and a half years' work . The newspaper said Robertson takes buses to work, but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route. He starts his commute at 8 a.m. for his 2-10 p.m. shift, and does not get home until 4 a.m. Robertson claims he powers his marathon-like commutes by drinking two liters of Mountain Dew and countless cans of Coke each day. 'I sleep a lot on the weekend, yes I do,' he said, 'but I can't imagine not working,' Although the commute getting into work is grueling, things are worse on the way back as Robertson has to walk the streets alone, in the dark and freezing cold. None of his co-workers lives anywhere near him, so catching a ride almost never happens. He has perfect attendance at his job, the Free Press said. His colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that Robertson has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it. 'I keep a rhythm in my head,' he says. 'I'm not saying I'm a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, 'Lord, keep me safe.' About three-quarters of the way home, he has to catch the very last bus of the night at 1am into downtown Detroit - after that it's another five mile trek back to the home he shares with his girlfriend. Robertson thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with Blake Pollock and Evan Leedy, who both helped coordinate the gift, worth an estimated $37,000 . The walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including Highland Park and the infamous 8 Mile area. Robertson says he was mugged once but doesn't like to talk about the incident. Four hours later he is back home to catch some shut-eye before the long-distance commute begins all over again the following afternoon. 'The last five years been really tough because the buses cut back,' Robertson said. Once he gets to Troy and Detroit, Robertson can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car. He says that it's not just the $1,700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly co-workers whom he calls 'family'. The boss's wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him home-cooked meals each evening too. However, the punishing, all-weather hikes now look like a thing of the past for Robertson, . The car is perfect for the machine operator, who said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that American manufacturers are more his style, has said all he wants is a Ford Taurus, which will set him back some $27,000. The car is perfect for the machine operator, who said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that American manufacturers are more his style, has said all he wants is a Ford Taurus, which will set him back some $27,000 . He said: 'I'm a Ford fan. I remember the Taurus. They look comfortable, nothing fancy. They're simple on the outside, strong on the inside — like me'. 'I'm 6-foot and I think the Mustang's a little tight,... I mostly stay with Americans cars - Lincoln, Fords, GM, Dodge.' The fundraising campaign for Robertson was started by Evan Leedy, 19-year-old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $5,000 goal. As USA Today notes, Robertson lives in Rochester Hills, a community that has removed itself from the SMART bus program depriving him of any fixed-route large buses. The story has drawn focus on Detroit's lack of a cohesive transportation system and its effect on the the high number of residents struggling with unemployment and poverty. 'This is the kind of guy America needs,' wrote Edward Klkotka, who donated $20 to the fund to get Robertson a car. 'Hardworking and dedicated. He has the type of character that every employer dreams about.' Leedy and Robertson met at a bar in Rochester, Michigan, ahead of a round of national press interviews. At the encounter, Robertson said: 'I'm always going to be in your debt — I will never forget this.' The teen responded by showing him some comments left alongside the donations - many of which said that he deserved the money for his decades of hard work. The fundraising campaign for Robertson was started by Evan Leedy, 19-year-old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $5,000 goal. Although the fund was originally just meant to get Roberston - whose last ride was a decrepit Honda which gave up in 2005 - a new set of wheels, the fund could now do much more. The cash is likely to help with medical and dental expenses, as well as longer-term commuting expenses like gas, repairs and insurance. The interviews and meeting were orchestrated by Blake Pollock, a UBS banker who saw Robertson's commute, sometimes gave him lifts, and first told the press about him.

"Two Scrabble experts have lifted the lid on how to win at the popular board game - just in time for Christmas. The experts have revealed that if you fancy winning against your relatives, it's best to make sure at least one of your seven letters is an S. And words without vowels like brrr, grrl, pfft, and psst will also help you clinch you the title. According to UK Scrabble expert Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different ways players can win . Grrl, of course, is a female internet . user, and psst a bid to get someone's attention. Pfft is an expression . of discontent, and brrr a way to say you are cold. And euoi, a cry of Bacchic frenzy, is remembered by connosieurs using the phrase Excessive Units Of Intoxication. Jiao, a monetary unit in Japan, is given the mnemonic: John Is Always Out. Experts have also revealed that American words can . be used as the game was invented in the States back in 1938. UK Scrabble champion Barry Grossman even says there is a time and place for proper nouns - which are normally banned. His own first name, for example, is Australian slang for a blunder or mistake. Grossman suggests the more words in a person's vocabulary, the better, and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in Scrabble. For example: . Epopoeia - an epic poem . Psst - a word used to capture someone's attention inconspicuously . Brrr - used to signify being cold . Barry - another word for a blunder . Euoi - cry of Bacchic frenzy . Qat - a variant spelling of the word khat, which is an evergreen shrub . Jiao - a monetary unit in China . Equally 'danny' and plural 'dannies', is acceptable to describe a child's hand. In his book, 101 Ways To Win At Scrabble, Grossman explains that two-letter words may seem like a cheap way to bag a point, but they are in fact essential to move the game on. There are also 120 two letter words which serious Scrabble players learn off by heart. Words like ax, ex, xi, and xu - using the eight-point 'x' tile - are invaluable, he says. Many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two-letter words, described as the 'glue' of Scrabble including jo, es and ta. There are also a host of three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu that can be useful. Explaining the four-letter words without vowels - pfft, psst, grrl, and brrr - Grossman makes clear that only these spelling are accepted and no extra Fs, Ss or Rs can be added. To be the best, Grossman advises knowing many words - but not necessarily the entire dictionary. It helps, he says, to know obscure ones like epopoeia, an epic poem, pshcent, an ancient Egyptian crown, and ttchick, a clicking sound. Allan Simmons, a finalist in this year's National Scrabble Championships, says most amateur players ruin their chances by creating unnecessary tactics. 'Don't avoid playing your best move because you are worried about what your opponent might be able to score off of it,' Simmons said. Words like 'euoi', 'jiao', 'brrr', and 'grrl' are essential, alongside 'epopoeia' and proper nouns including 'Barry' 'If you are scoring well and paying attention to the balance of letters left on your rack then it will serve you well not to be too defensive.' Grossman said: 'There are all sorts of tricks that can help players impress their families when the Scrabble board comes out at Christmas. 'One of the best things is known as a Benjamin - a three-letter extension on the front of a five-letter word so BRICK becomes AIRBRICK and JUMPS becomes OUTJUMPS.' Ultimately, Grossman claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped, which means that player misses a go, but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result. Another key thing to remember is that the letter 'Q' doesn't always need to be followed by a 'U'. In the two-letter list the word QI is 'a variant of chi'. Nationals: Finalist Alan Simmons said most amateur players ruin their chances by tactically saving their words . While Qat (a variant spelling of the word khat; an evergreen shrub), Qaid (a Muslim chief) and sheqalim (the plural of sheqel, the currency of Israel) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used. Another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents, as listed in Grossman's book, is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes. These included 'ed', 'ing' and adding the letter S to the end of words, yet Grossman adds the suffix 'ish' is rare and equally effective, especially on words such as pixyish. Though the letter 'S' and the blank tile are the best tiles to select, they should be used sparingly as there are only four, according to Grossman's book. An S, for example, should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points, otherwise it's a 'waste'.","Pfft, Psst, Brrr, and Grrl are key to clinching the title, according to experts .

"A crackdown to prevent British jihadis fighting in Iraq and Syria from bringing bloodshed to Britain’s streets was in disarray last night. David Cameron yesterday said it ‘sticks in the craw’ that fanatics can go abroad, pledge allegiance to the Islamic State and still expect to be free to return to the UK. But, despite it being heavily trailed over the weekend, there was no firm commitment to new legislation to bar them from coming back. Scroll down for video . Clash: David Cameron's plans to hamper jihadis' free movement could be blocked by Nick Clegg . The Prime Minister said he was ‘clear in principle’ that a ‘targeted discretionary power’ was required – but cross-party talks were needed to see if it was workable and legal. Dominic Grieve, the ex-Tory attorney general, last night claimed such a move was ‘probably impossible’ and many Liberal Democrats are fiercely opposed. There was also confusion over an apparently firm commitment by Mr Cameron to reinstate powers that allow terror suspects living in the UK to be relocated away from other extremists, or placed in ‘internal exile’. Within hours of the move being announced to MPs, sources close to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that he had only agreed to ‘look at’ the idea of exiling terror suspects to other parts of the country – and may yet block them. A senior Lib Dem source said: ‘Frankly, we are going to take a lot of convincing before we sign up to any new legislation in this area. Obstacle: The Prime Minister will have to get his plans for a crackdown approved in cross-party talks . ‘It would be a huge step for the state to forcibly remove someone from their friends and family, and possibly job, and put them in another part of the country when they had not been tried or convicted of a crime.’ It was an intervention by Mr Clegg that forced relocation to be scrapped three years ago, as part of the axing of control orders. In a statement to the Commons yesterday, three days after the terror threat to the UK was raised from ‘substantial to severe’, Mr Cameron struck a determined tone. ‘Adhering to British values is not an option or a choice,’ he said. ‘It is a duty for all those who live in these islands so we will stand up for our values, we will in the end defeat this extremism and we will secure our way of life for generations to come.’ A British woman is among seven suspected UK jihadis caught by Turkish border guards trying to cross into Syria. The woman and two British men were stopped near Reyhanli, one of a network of Turkish frontier towns dubbed the ‘gateway to jihad’. They were questioned but were not arrested and are therefore free to try again, intelligence officials said last night. Four British men, aged 20 to 35, carrying 2,000 US dollars (around £1,200) were stopped recently near the town and were also released. Turkish authorities have struggled to stop foreign suspected jihadis, since many enter Turkey with a 90-day visa and are therefore not committing an offence. Intelligence officers warn there has been an alarming increase in the number of British ‘volunteers’ travelling to join IS. Up to 20 Britons are believed to be in safe houses waiting to cross over into Syria, including several women, who are playing an increasingly prominent role in IS. But it later emerged that he had not secured agreement with his junior Coalition partner on all the measures announced. Those that do have support include legislation to give the police statutory powers to confiscate the passports of suspect terrorists at UK borders as they try to leave the country. Airlines will also be forced to hand over advance passenger information to the security services or be banned from landing their planes in the UK. But, despite a weekend of intense talks between Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg, aides made it clear there were key areas where no deal had been reached. Action: Cameron told MPs he would look 'very favourably' on a request for arms from the Kurdish forces . These included the power to stop British-born citizens who have been fighting abroad from returning to the UK, potentially rendering them temporarily stateless. Mr Cameron told MPs it was ‘abhorrent’ that British-born jihadis who hated Britain should be allowed to come back. ‘It absolutely sticks in the craw that someone can go from this country to Syria, declare jihad, make all sorts of plans to start doing us damage and then contemplate returning to Britain having declared their allegiance to another state,’ he said. But what will emerge from the ‘cross-party talks’ is far from clear. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘The Prime Minister’s proposals on British citizens returning are very unclear and confusing. It isn’t clear what they want to do, how it would work in practice, what it means for citizenship or how it would comply with international law.’ Prevent British jihadis from returning to the UK . Having been heavily-trailed over the weekend as a firm proposal to strip British nationals of their passport, potentially rendering them stateless, it was yesterday downgraded to an idea the Government supports in ‘principle’. Government lawyers, Lib Dems and ex-Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve warn that it will breach the UK’s international obligations and possibly common law. Details yesterday were worryingly vague, and it will now be subject to ‘cross-party talks’ – which many suspect is the equivalent of kicking it into the long grass. Failure to take decisive action will infuriate the public – and many Tory MPs – who say anybody who has declared allegiance to the Islamic State should lose their rights to return. Extend Tpims so terror suspects can be relocated away from their home . The power, part of the old control order regime, was widely used by security officials to split up groups of fanatics living in the UK and make them easier to monitor. To appease Nick Clegg, it was axed when Tpims (terrorism prevention investigation measures) were introduced three years ago. Since then, two terror suspects subject to Tpims have absconded – including Al-Shabaab extremist Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who escaped from a London mosque dressed in a burka. MI5 will welcome the return of this disruption tactic, but last night it was mired in confusion with the Lib Dems insisting they have not yet ‘signed-off’ on the idea. Force returning jihadis to undergo a de-radicalisation programme . This is intended to answer critics who claim the Government’s anti-extremist Prevent programme is an expensive failure. However, the new law will apply only to suspects who are placed under a Tpim rather than every returning fighter. Currently, there is not a single person under a Tpim. They have proved less popular with police and security services than control orders. At least 250 fanatics are already suspected of having returned to the UK from Syria and Iraq. Give police new powers to confiscate the passports of terror suspects . The Home Secretary can already use the royal prerogative to remove the passports of people suspected of travelling overseas to engage in terrorism. The new measure extends the power to police, who will be given temporary permission to withhold a travel document at UK borders while further checks are carried out. It is intended to close a loophole where police think suspects are acting suspiciously at the borders, but do not have enough evidence to prevent them boarding a flight. Significantly, Mr Cameron also promised to overturn any court ruling that declares the use of the royal prerogative illegal – suggesting a damaging human rights judgment is imminent. Ban airlines from landing in the UK unless they give passenger details . This addresses a problem under which six European airlines in countries with strict privacy laws refuse to give advance passenger details to the Government’s controversial eBorders scheme so a passenger can be checked against terror watchlists. A new piece of stand-alone legislation is expected shortly. It would allow non-UK citizens to be banned from boarding a flight and allow British nationals to be put under close surveillance when they return.","David Cameron vowed to implement law to ground British jihadis .

"They say that music heals the heart and soothes the soul, but for one young couple, their ballad is one of breaking up. A young couple in Brooklyn has posted a video to YouTube detailing why they can no longer be together, singing their grievances against each other. The answer for the split is as simple as 4/4 time: Jonathan Mann, 30, wanted kids, and his former girlfriend, Ivory King, 31, did not. Scroll down for video . Last song: Former Brooklyn couple Jonathan Mann, left, and Ivory King, right, decided to call it quits via song . Love is reason: Mann said he wanted kids, but King did not; so they ended their relationship after five years together . The couple, who live in the ultra-hip Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, said that posting a music video was the easiest, most pain-free way of breaking the news to their friends. ‘I didn’t want to make a post on Facebook and have that be it,’ Mr Mann told the New York Daily News. ‘And I didn’t want to have to explain it over and over to people, because that could be really painful.’ And so the two former lovebirds took to song to express their feelings. ‘I wanna have kids,’ Mr Mann begins cheerily in a major key. But when Ms King chimes in: ‘And I really don’t,’ the song switches to minor. ‘We still love each other, but this train has stopped. We just wanted you to know, we’ve gotta break up,’ they sing, adding, ‘G**, this really sucks.’ The couple was together for five years in all. Despite their long history, the newly-single singers had sage advice for their friends: ‘Just invite us to your parties and we’ll work it out, no don’t feel weird, we love all of you,’ they sing. They add that breaking up ‘is a mess.’ Hard to do: The video is part of his 'Song a Day' project, which has been running for more than 1,400 days now . Musical prowess: Mann played harmonica while King rocked out on the bass clarinet . The song was part of Mr Mann’s ‘Song a Day’ project, which has been running for more than 1,400 days consecutively. Ms King, a writer, has often helped her former beau by singing and offering her talents on the bass clarinet. The video has already become an internet sensation, garnering more than 34,400 views as of Thursday night. Hundreds of people have posted their reactions to the video. One user wrote: ‘Ivory is beautiful and her eye makeup is always extremely fabulous. 'She is not selfish for not wanting to have kids; that is not a woman’s job in life.’ Another commenter sided with Mr Mann, writing: ‘Wow, it took five years for the subject to come up? Well, she seems like a really cool person anyway. Good for you to leave her.’ Bowing out: The former couple encouraged their friends to continue inviting both of them to parties and not to worry about the awkwardness .","Brooklyn-based couple post a breakup song on YouTube to let friends - and the internet - know they've split .

"A new universal vaccine which could provide lifetime protection against every type of flu has shown successful results for the first time in small trials . A new 'Holy Grail' flu vaccine which gives lifelong protection against all strains of the virus could be available within five years. Scientists from Britain and Europe are getting ready to start large-scale trials of a universal vaccine after early tests on humans proved successful. If all goes to plan the new injection would stop the need for annual flu jabs and could save thousands of lives every year. It could also be effective against highly dangerous forms of the disease, such as Spanish flu, even if they mutate, preventing global pandemics like the one which killed 100million people in 1918. Despite carrying out human trials on almost 100 patients over many years, this is the first positive news. Professor John Oxford, British flu expert and a key researcher of the study, said that his team are 'wildly enthusiastic' about the vaccine's prospects. The programme has recently received a multi-million pound EU grant to fund its research. At the moment vaccines work by identifying viruses by their 'coats', however as viruses mutate these change, making old vaccines ineffective. The universal vaccine works by attacking proteins hidden within the virus which are common throughout harmful strains. If it works, the 'Holy Grail' vaccine would eliminate the need for annual flu jabs and could save thousands of lives every year and prevent global flu pandemics . The news comes at the end of a week which has seen a new strain of bird flu re-emerge in China and after it was reported to have passed between humans in August. A 32-year-old woman was said to have died after caring for her father who was infected by the H7N9 strain of bird flu. A new strain of bird flu, H7N9, has begun spreading in China after killing 45 people earlier in the year . Reports of human infection began in March this year but have trailed off in the last few months having killed at least 45 people out of 136 cases. However as poultry stocks swell ahead of Chinese new year a 35-year-old man in the eastern province of Zhejiang has been hospitalised and the World Health Organisation confirms two more people are in hospital with another 88 being sent home. A nasal flu spray has also been made available for all children aged between two and three years old, and will eventually be extended into a national programme for all under-16s. While children are less likely to die from flu compared with the elderly, they are key spreaders of flu, and can become very ill if they have asthma, heart or lung conditions. While specialists agree that the vaccine could help protect elderly relatives of younger children, Dr Richard Halvorsen disagrees. Speaking to the Sunday Express, he said: 'It is rare for children to die from flu and giving extra vaccines a year is a lot of extra vaccinations.' If trials of the new flu super-jab are successful it could be available for use by 2018. Traditional vaccines work by training an immune system to identify a disease and increasing the body's defences, usually by injecting weak or dead parts of a disease into the patient. Flu vaccines work by attacking the 'coat' of a virus, the H and N protein shell which surrounds the disease. However this is problematic as this coat changes every time the virus mutates, meaning flu vaccines are only truly effective for a year as the virus will change rapidly, meaning vulnerable patients, such as elderly people, have to have injections every year. But, hidden within every dangerous strain of influenza, are two proteins known as M and NP proteins which do not change with mutations. Researches have tried for years to develop a vaccine which could target and attack these parts of the virus, and now think they may have found the solution. In small human trials they have shown the first successful results ever for a universal vaccine and are now rolling out wider trials of the new medicine. If these are successful then the new jab could be on the market by 2018, saving thousands of lives each year.","New universal vaccine being developed by British and European scientists .

"She's convinced that hamburgers were invented by Kim Jong Il, thinks Lady Gaga is a man and refuses to ride a bicycle on the grounds that it's dangerous and would ruin the shape of her legs. Meet 20-year-old Miss Kim, a student studying English at Pyongyang's University of Foreign Studies. As a reward for good behaviour, she was given the task of escorting French photographer Eric Lafforgue as he toured North Korea earlier this year. 'She had never previously left Pyongyang,' explains Lafforgue. 'It was a unique opportunity for her to visit her own country and to get to meet and speak to a foreigner. Welcome to North Korea! English student and tour guide Miss Kim stands in front of the Grand National Theatre in Hamhung, capital of South Hamgyŏng province . Hitting the shops: Miss Kim, who says hamburgers were invented by Kim Jong Il, in front of a grocery shop in South Hamgyŏng's capital, Hamhung . Essential sight: During his tour of North Korea, the patriotic Miss Kim took photographer Eric Lafforgue to see Hamhung's Hungnam Fertiliser Complex . Proud: Miss Kim with her collection of stamps showing North Korean leaders both living and dead, and right, a poster of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un . 'She was shy at first, but became quite talkative as the days went on and told me what life in North Korea is like for younger people, albeit without ever deviating from the party line.' Miss Kim, who says her favourite place in Pyongyang is the dolphinarium and her favourite animals the dolphins, told Lafforgue of her penchant for Mozart, Bach and Beethoven and was baffled when he asked if she liked Lady Gaga. 'I don’t know who he is, no,' she told him. Perhaps her American nationality might have had something to do with it, with Miss Kim insisting she only speaks 'English English' and telling the photographer that she 'hates Americans'. Unsurprisingly, she's also convinced that the hamburger was invented by Kim Jong Il in 2009, while Mickey Mouse is the creation of China. 'They talk nonsense Mr Eric,' she said of the inhabitants of the US. 'I hate Americans!' She also declares herself to be less than enthusiastic about South Koreans, saying that while those crossing the border from the south would be welcomed, travellers going the other way 'would be shot'. Troubling: . Miss Kim said she was unable to smile for this photo taken in the . demilitarised zone because, she says, the sight makes her heart bleed . Divided: Miss Kim tries her hand at using Lafforgue's iPad (left) and (right) stares out across the demilitarised zone at South Korea . Technology: Although Lafforgue's iPad left her baffled (and horrified when she heard about Google Earth), Miss Kim was happy to show him her polaroid camera . Favourite place: Miss Kim's top tip for anyone planning a trip to North Korean capital Pyongyang is a visit to the dolphinarium - her favourite attraction . Unimpressed: Miss Kim was annoyed to hear of an American website that claimed people on the metro are actors. 'I hate Americans!' she responded . Miss Kim is, however, a fan of films, according to Lafforgue. 'My favourite film is Sea of Blood,' she told him. Asked what it's about, she added: 'It’s about . the mass killings perpetrated by the Japanese against our people.' Gladiator is another favourite, although she did reveal that some scenes proved to make for uncomfortable viewing. 'Some scenes were . embarrassing,' she said. 'The scenes where you see a couple together.' North Koreans take a relatively old-fashioned approach to dating, with girls reluctant to even dance with a boy they've only just met, while according to Miss Kim, pregnancy outside of marriage and HIV are both unheard of. 'That [pregnancy] never happens,' she insists. 'It never happens!' What about AIDS? 'We don't have AIDS here. Zero.' While Miss Kim is happy to talk about her feelings for the late Kim Il Sung ('he was a pillar of my heart'), she reacts with outrage when asked whether current leader Kim Jong Un is attractive to women. 'That's an outrageous question!' she remonstrates. Trying something new: Miss Kim tries her hand at using Lafforgue's camera and says she loves playing computer games when she's at home . Burgers . explained: Miss Kim deciphers the menu for photographer Lafforgue . during a visit to a Pyongyang restaurant. She says they were invented by . Kim Jong Il . Tasty: Miss Kim tucks in during a barbecue lunch in a Pyongyang park. The English student says she would like to visit the UK one day . Family: Although Miss Kim doesn't cycle, many in the countryside do as this photo (left) reveals. Right: North Koreans still venerate leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il . Honour: Miss Kim says she is proud to have played the trumpet in an Arirang celebration such as this one (pictured) when she was seven years old . Colourful: Taking part in the Arirang Mass Games which are held each year at the May Day Stadium in Pyongyang is considered an honour by young North Koreans . Beautiful: According to Miss Kim, North Koreans consider women with big eyes, a high nose, a small mouth and very pale skin to be especially beautiful . Other parts of North Korean life are strikingly similar to Western lifestyles, with Miss Kim revealing a penchant for computer games and ambitions to travel abroad. 'Would you like to visit a foreign . country?' Lafforgue asks her. 'Yes Mr Eric, I would like to visit England,' she replies. Despite her English skills, however, she says she won't be travelling to the US any time soon. 'No,' she insists. 'I only speak England’s English!' Bizarre though much of what she says is, Lafforgue isn't surprised. 'The thing to remember is that almost everything she says is official propaganda, even the silly things,' he explains. 'People like Miss Kim are taught this sort of thing from kindergarten, so in that sense, she's a perfect citizen. North Koreans don't see the disparity between what they think is good to tell us and what we can see for ourselves.' Rules: People tucking into a burger are given gloves to eat them with according to Miss Kim. Right: A group of pilgrims look up at a portrait of Kim Il Sung . Treat: Icecream is a popular treat in North Korea with vendors often spotted selling them in the street, as in this photo which was taken in Kaesong . Treat: A caterer poses with a model burger in his restaurant at Kaeson Youth Park - the most modern funfair in Pyongyang which was renovated in 2010 . Fun: The Kaeson Youth Park in Pyongyang is a popular place for teenagers and twenty-somethings who live in the North Korean capital . Officials: A group of North Korean People's Party officials show off their identical blue and grey uniforms, matching hair cuts and scarlet armbands . Servant: According to Miss Kim, soldiers such as this one photographed manning the demilitarised zone, are servants of the people . During his travels in North Korea, Eric Lafforgue had plenty of time to chat with Miss Kim, who, he adds won't face censure from her government thanks to her strict adherence to the party line. Here's what she said: . Why doesn’t British or American pop music . reach your country? 'Because it is not what we like to listen . to. But we know Mozart, Bach and Beethoven!' What is the criteria for beauty in North Korea? 'A . woman should have big eyes, a high nose, a small mouth and white . skin, and she should not be skinny. Women in North Korea are truly . beautiful flowers.' Do women find Kim Jong Un handsome? 'Mr Eric, that’s . an outrageous question!' Why does nobody dye their hair in North Korea? 'We . need to respect the haircut regulation - we have a lot of choice. Having a different haircut is the last thing . we’re concerned about.' Do you have any idea of the latest European . fashions? 'No, Mr. Eric.' Young people buy jeans in which there are holes... 'I don't . believe you Mr.Eric - you are joking.' Would you like to have a car one day? 'No, it makes people lazy.' Who is the richest person in North Korea? 'We are . all equal.' What happens if a South Korean crosses the . border and comes to the North? 'We welcome him.' And if a North Korean . goes to the South? 'They shoot him.' Why don’t women cycle in Pyongyang? 'Because it is . dangerous and it doesn’t give you nice legs.' Then why do women in the . countryside all cycle? 'They don’t have much of a choice in the . countryside.' Who was Kim Il Sung for you? 'Mr Eric, I can tell you that he was . the pillar of my heart.' Why do they give plastic gloves to the people . eating hamburgers in the fast food places? 'It’s because we . haven't gotten used to getting dirty when we eat yet.' Is it true that . Kim Jong Il created the hamburger? 'Yes, it is! In 2009!' Were you there . during the famine? 'We don’t call it a famine, we call it the Arduous March.' I want to offer you a gift, what would you like? 'Great Leader Kim Jong Un would be a great gift.' Do you remember the . day Kim Jong Il died? 'Yes, Dear Leader Kim Jong Il died on a Saturday, . but his death was only announced on Monday. Why? 'Because he said in . his last wishes that he didn’t want to ruin Sunday, the people’s day . off.' Do you know what Kim Jong Il was doing just before he died? 'Our Dear . Leader had just signed documents to distribute 1kg of fish to every person in Pyongyang.' And did you receive it? 'Of course we did Mr . Eric!' Hairstyles: Until recently, male students at the Agriculture University in Hamhung had to have this haircut. Now they must copy Kim Jong Un's unusual look . Essential: While women living in Pyongyang don't think much of cycling, for their country compatriots, the bicycle is an essential means of getting around . Normal life: Two women share some lunch while sitting under a parasol as they look out over a city vista in North Korean capital, Pyongyang . No . fly zone: The departure board at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport . shows just one flight - to Beijing. The airfield is the HQ of North .

"There's one thing on everyone's lips here on the FEMAIL desk, and it's Emma Watson's game-changing speech on feminism. The actress, 24, has been busy at work in her role as UN Goodwill Ambassador, and on Saturday launched a new campaign for gender equality. HeForShe follows feminism's principles of striving for equal rights and opportunities for men and women, including the political, economic and social equality of the sexes. But it aims to repackage the concept without emphasis on oppression by the male sex. In fact Emma formally invited men - who may have previously felt alienated from the movement - to play a greater role in ending gender inequality. Emma's simple but eloquent speech has shaken feminism, prompting global applause as well as vile threats from trolls. Emma Watson delivered a game revealed her girlfriends dropped out of sports teams at 15 because they didn't want to appear 'muscly' Male celebrities including comedian Simon Pegg, author Neil Gaiman and actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt  immediately tweeted support for Emma's plight and for HeForShe. Joseph is even working on a film project asking people to define what feminism means to them. Here on FEMAIL we couldn't agree more that feminism in its fourth wave should be as inclusive and open as possible, and we join Emma in saluting all men coming who come out as feminists in support of HeForShe - simply announcing their belief in gender equality. The UN Women campaign aims to get 100,000 men and boys involved in the fight to achieve gender equality. The Vagenda's Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett said Emma's speech 'was a real watershed moment for me', while the Telegraph called it 'incredible'. Transgender activist and model Geena Rocero said she 'couldn't agree more' with the actress. Everyday Sexism's Laura Bates told MailOnline: 'It's fantastic to see feminism being talked about on the world stage, especially as we are seeing a huge resurgence in the movement in the UK and globally. 'The cowards who have tried to silence Emma with threats of leaked photographs have only proved her point a thousand times over. 'As Emma rightly pointed out, this is not about men against women, it's about people standing up to prejudice. Gender inequality isn't a ""women's issue"", it's a human rights issue, and it's in everybody's interest to stand up to it together.' Everyday Sexism and the End Violence Against Women Coalition today launched a campaign calling for young people to be taught about vital issues such as sexual consent and healthy relationships. Femimnist Joseph is even working on a film project asking people to define what feminism means to them . Male celebrities such as comedian Simon Pegg have tweeted support for Emma's plight and for HeForShe . At the United Nations headquarters, Emma revealed the sexism she has experienced throughout her life, saying it started at the age of eight when she was branded 'bossy' for wanting to direct school plays. She continued: 'At 15 my girlfriends started dropping out of their sports teams because they didn't want to appear 'muscly'...at 18 my male friends were unable to express their feelings.' Mlambo Ngcuka, who announced the 'HeForShe' campaign in March, called on the world's fathers, sons, husbands and brothers to stand up and support equality for women in all areas of life. The Inter-Parliamentary Union says less that 22 percent of parliamentarians are women. There are also still 100 countries with laws that prevent women's meaningful involvement in the economy, Mlambo Ngcuka said. She said projections indicate that if things don't change it will take 95 years to achieve gender equality, and by 2020 and some 140,000 girls will be forced into child marriage. UN Women said supporters of the HeForShe campaign include actors Matt Damon, Patrick Stewart, Antonio Banderas and Kiefer Sutherland, and South African Nobel peace laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu. She invited the boys: Emma said the view feminism is 'man hating' has to stop. She encouraged men to take up this mantle for their sisters, mothers and daughters so that they can be free from prejudice - but also so their sons have permission to be vulnerable and human, too. She made the movement relevant to a new generation: 'Why this Harry Potter girl? What is she doing at the U.N.?', joked Emma. 'All I know is that I care about this problem and I want to make this better.' UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said Emma 'has been waving a magic wand'. She received a standing ovation: A packed hall of UN delegates stood to give Emma a standing ovation for her powerful speech. Many consequently individually praised her for it. She sent the internet wild: Unprecedented positive reaction from famous male and female feminists online and on Twitter in particular. She showed vulnerability: 'In my nervousness for this speech and in my moments of doubt I've told myself firmly - if not me, who, if not now, when,' said the hubmle star. 'If you have similar doubts when opportunities are presented to you I hope those words might be helpful.' Emma Watson attended the launch of the UN Women HeForShe campaign in New York on Saturday .

"New figures have revealed that poultry accounts for more than half of all the meat bought in Britain . If you’re sitting down with the family for a roast chicken with all the trimmings today, you are not alone. Poultry now accounts for nearly half of all the meat bought in Britain, new figures reveal. It means an end to our reputation as a red meat-eating nation that led the French to nicknaming us  ‘les rosbifs’ (the roast beefs). Instead, a steady rise in sales of chicken coupled with a fall for beef, pork and lamb has led to a change in this country’s daily diet – and we now eat 2.2 million chickens a day. Industry figures for shop-bought meat show that in March last year chicken accounted for 46 per cent of the total. Ten years ago it made up just a third of meat bought. If the trend continues, this year chicken will pass the 50 per cent benchmark for the first time, according to the trade body, the British Poultry Council (BPC). The figures relate to meat bought in shops to be eaten at home rather than restaurant meals, ready meals and takeaways. Poultry is considered by some experts to be healthier than red meat and it has emerged unscathed from public health scares such as BSE, foot and mouth and horsemeat contamination. And with 70 per cent of all chicken in the UK being home-reared, it also satisfies those who prefer to  buy British. But increasingly, the biggest factor could be the the meat’s relatively low price, according to retail industry analysts Kantar. Lamb prices, for instance, have doubled over the same period and beef has gone up by 50 per cent. The BPC has even warned that home-reared chicken is becoming so popular that the UK could run out of space to produce enough birds. A BPC spokesman said: ‘Poultry prices have only risen very slowly in the last 20 years, way behind other food commodities.’","New figures reveal poultry accounts for nearly half of all meat bought in Britain .

"Scientists have discovered a simulated version of the elusive 'God particle' using superconductors. The God Particle, which is believed to be responsible for all the mass in the universe, was discovered in 2012 using a Cern's supercollider. The superconductor experiment suggests that the Higgs particle could be detected without the huge amounts of energy used at by the Large Hadron Collider. The God Particle, which is believed to be responsible for all the mass in the universe, was discovered in 2012 using a Cern's supercollider. In this image two high-energy photons collide. The yellow lines are the measured tracks of other particles produced in the collision, which helped lead to the discovery of the God particle . The results could help scientists better understand how this mysterious particle – also known as the Higgs boson – behaves in different conditions. 'Just as the Cern experiments revealed the existence of the Higgs boson in a high-energy accelerator environment, we have now revealed a Higgs boson analogue in superconductors,' said researcher Aviad Frydman from Bar-Ilan University. Superconductors are a type of metal that, when cooled to low temperatures, allow electrons to pass through freely. 'The Higgs mode was never actually observed in superconductors because of technical difficulties - difficulties that we've managed to overcome,' Professor Frydman said. The superconductor experiment suggests that the Higgs particle could be detected without the huge amounts of energy used at by the Large Hadron Collider (pictured) The 'God Particle', also known as the Higgs boson, was a missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works. Scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the Big Bang that gave birth to the universe, an invisible energy field, called the Higgs field, formed. This has been described as a kind of 'cosmic treacle' across the universe. As particles passed through it, they picked up mass, giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you, everything around you and everything in the universe. This was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy Professor Higgs that has now been confirmed. Without the Higgs field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does. A boson is a type of sub-atomic particle. Every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what's around it. To try to pin it down, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva smashed together beams of protons – the 'hearts of atoms' – at close to the speed of light, recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Although they would rapidly decay, they should have left a recognisable footprint. This footprint was found in 2012. The main difficulty was that the superconducting material would decay into something known as particle-hole pairs. Large amounts of energy – which are usually needed to excite the Higgs mode - tend to break apart the electron pairs that act as the material's charge. Professor Frydman and his colleagues solved this problem by using ultra-thin superconducting films of Niobium Nitrite (NbN) and Indium Oxide (InO) as something known as the 'superconductor-insulator critical point.' This is a state in which recent theory predicted the decay of the Higgs would no longer occur. In this way, they could still excite a Higgs mode even at relatively low energies. 'The parallel phenomenon in superconductors occurs on a different energy scale entirely - just one-thousandth of a single electronvolt,' Professor Frydman added. 'What's exciting is to see how, even in these highly disparate systems, the same fundamental physics is at work.' The different approach help solve one of the longstanding mysteries of fundamental physics. The discovery of the Higgs boson verified the Standard Model, which predicted that particles gain mass by passing through a field that slows down their movement through the vacuum of space. To try to pin it down, scientists at the Large Hadron Collider near Geneva smashed together beams of protons – the 'hearts of atoms' – at close to the speed of light, recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Although they would rapidly decay, the also left a recognisable footprint. Professor Higgs, 83, has been waiting since 1964 for science to catch up with his ideas about the Higgs boson . According to Professor Frydman, observation of the Higgs mechanism in superconductors is significant because it reveals how a single type of physical process behaves under different energy conditions. 'Exciting the Higgs mode in a particle accelerator requires enormous energy levels - measured in giga-electronvolts, or 109 eV,' Professor Frydman says. 'The parallel phenomenon in superconductors occurs on a different energy scale entirely - just one-thousandth of a single electronvolt. 'What's exciting is to see how, even in these highly disparate systems, the same fundamental physics is at work.' The LHC is due to come back online in March after an upgrade that has given it a big boost in energy. 'With this new energy level, the (collider) will open new horizons for physics and for future discoveries,' CERN Director General Rolf Heuer said in a statement. 'I'm looking forward to seeing what nature has in store for us.' Cern's collider is buried in a 27-km (17-mile) tunnel straddling the Franco-Swiss border at the foot of the Jura mountains.

"Many STD's are curable and all of them are treatable - but most people don't even know realize they are infected or, more commonly, are afraid to have it checked. And that's what First Derm is hoping to capitalize on. Eliminating the arduous process of booking an appointment, going to the doctors, dropping your pants and anxiously awaiting results, the new app allows users to anonymously send a photo of their problem parts and receive a diagnosis within 24 hours from a certified dermatologist. According to TechCrunch, the startup has had 10,000 downloads since launching in January and has delivered 4,000 diagnoses. Too shy to show the doctor? A new dermatological app allows users to anonymously send photos of a skin condition - from potential STD's to warts - to a doctor and receive a response within 24 hours. The service costs $40 each time . Users submit an online form that includes some details of the affected area, as well as two pictures . The form is sent off without any personal information, such as email or Facebook log-in . First Derm guarantees a reply from a certified dermatologist within 24 hours, with most responses reportedly coming within a few hours . Users fill out an online form via their smartphone or android and then upload two pictures - one close up and one from far away - of the affected area. One form costs $40. While the app is not restricted to STDs - with warts, moles and other skin conditions one might typically seek help for all welcome - they are among the bulk of submissions. Founder Alexander Borve told the website that 70 percent of their queries are 'below the waist'. The First Derm homepage claims over 70 percent of conditions can be treated with over-the-counter medications and 30 percent recommend someone gets professional treatment. They guarantee a response within 24 hours, with most coming in a matter of hours. The app does not ask for any personal information. It was first launched in Sweden in 2009 specifically to service STDs. The app started in Sweden specifically to treat STDs, but has since relaunched as a broader dermatological service so as not to isolate their market . The company that owns it, iDoc24 - which lists its owners as Sebastian Suchanowski, Nick Hu and Alexander Borve - then decided to rebrand it, believing a 'STD app' was isolating them from certain consumers. They brought on more dermatologists specializing in other areas and relaunched as First Derm. News of the app coincides with a BBC report of a Los Angeles study, which found gonorrhea and chlamydia were more common in gay men using apps such as Tinder and Grindr than in those meeting in clubs or online.","First Derm launched in January and allows users to send photos of a skin condition, such as a potential STD, and receive a response from a dermatologist within 24 hours .

"Amateur footballers once traditionally confined to the trappings of a local park or small stadium can now play the beautiful game amid the skyscrapers of a bustling Chinese city. These spectacular pictures show a game of five-a-side being played on a football pitch which is built on the roof of a shopping mall. The artificial pitch was constructed in the heart of Jinhua, in China's Zhejiang province, after widespread development left the city centre with no green space.

Two players contest for possession of the ball during a friendly game amid the skyscrapers and office towers . Instead of creating another pitch located outside the grasp of inner-city commuters, developers decided to build it on the roof of a downtown shopping centre. The pitch is surrounded by high wire fencing, inside which players can enjoy the game without fear of losing the ball down in the streets below. But only a short barrier is in place to separate spectators from a terrifying fall should they wander too close to the edge. The construction of the pitch has proved popular with downtown office workers, who previously had no nearby pitch to play on. Five-a-side games are now regularly played on the pitch and a tournament was held on New Year's Day.","Chinese authorities construct artificial football pitch on shopping mall roof .

"It may look like a peaceful, English country home, but Milhanger, in the village of Thursley in Surrey, has rock ’n’ roll history running through it. For 24 years it was the home of Queen drummer Roger Taylor, and it also has links to Pink Floyd and the Boomtown Rats. The property, which comes with over 74 acres and includes a tennis court, stables, a six-car garage, a ‘party barn’ and a Grade II-listed mill house that is a four-bedroom home in its own right, is now on the market for £7.95 million. When he owned the property, Taylor had a recording studio in the mill house and mixing desks in what is now a study, and he held concerts in the barn. Scroll down for video . The property comes with more than 74 acres and includes a tennis court, stables, a six-car garage, a ‘party barn’ and a Grade II-listed mill house that is a four-bedroom home in its own right . Queen in their heyday with Roger Taylor front centre during a photo shoot in 1973 . Queen Roger Taylor (second left), pictured with Brian May and David Bowie owned the house for 24 years . Current owners Anne and David Feld bought the house from Taylor in 2003 and are still in touch with him. ‘We told Roger we were selling the house and he wrote Anne a letter,’ David says, explaining that Taylor has now taken the idea of having your workplace on your doorstep one step further. ‘In his letter to Anne he made the joke that in his new house, Putnam Priory, he didn’t even have to leave the main house to do his work!’ Before Taylor, the house was owned by a family called the Rutters. The Rutters’ daughter, Lindy, dated and later married another rock star drummer – Pink Floyd’s Nick Mason. ‘So it wasn’t just Roger who used to rock around here!’ David says. Showing me around his study, David, an emerging markets investor, adds: ‘Roger had pine walls in here to hold all his gold discs. ‘He was incredibly respectful of this house. He had different taste for sure but he didn’t mess with the bones at all. He really loved this place. When he moved here, there were only six acres. He gradually added bits of land.’ One of the most remarkable rooms is a bedroom with dark blue Chinese wallpaper. ‘This is called the Bob Geldof suite,’ David says. ‘Bob was a great pal of Roger’s and would often stay here, so there was a sign with The Bob Geldof suite written on it. We couldn’t change it, it’s just too quirky.’ Taylor lived at Milhanger from 1979 to 2003 and during that time he wrote the band’s hits Radio Ga Ga and A Kind Of Magic. The property also has an indoor leisure complex, which includes a heated swimming pool, Jacuzzi, gym, steam room and changing room with showers and WCs. A staff cottage attached to the property has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a WC, a living room, study, dining room and kitchen. One of the Chinese bedrooms in the £8million mansion that is up for sale - there are six bedrooms in the main building and four in the Grade II-listed mill house . Milhanger, which was built in 1907, was designed by Arts & Craft architect Harold Falkner who also created about 50 houses around the nearby town of Farnham. ‘A lot of Farnham High Street looks very Georgian but it’s Georgian-style rather than Georgian-era,’ David says. Anne and David, both 59, bought the property when their eldest two children were at university and their youngest son was 17. Anne says: ‘We’ve never used this house with little children but we’ve had so many house guests and friends of our children to stay. You don’t ever feel like you’re in some empty cavernous space. Some big houses are not warm and friendly but this one really is. ‘When I first saw this house I just felt like it hugged me. It was the most wonderful feeling. You see the brochure and you think, “Gosh, it’s an enormous house,” but you walk in and actually it’s really cosy. ‘We live in the whole house. It’s just me and David – the children come and go because they’re all grown up – but we use every bit of the property.’ One of the bathrooms in the mansion - it also has a tennis court, stables, a six-car garage and 'party barn' Explaining why they are now selling, Anne says: ‘We’re both about to turn 60 and it would be good to think, that if anything happens to either of us, we wouldn’t have so much responsibility.’ This ‘responsibility’ extends not only to looking after the land surrounding the house, but also the animals they keep on it, including pigs called Clive and Vanessa. James Mackenzie, of selling agents Strutt & Parker, says: ‘Milhanger is the perfect estate within reach of everything an international or London-centric buyer might need. Yet it’s hidden away in its own little world, with a house grand enough to entertain royalty. ‘The beautifully converted mill set on an idyllic lake is the perfect place to hide away. It has something for everybody. ‘What you are buying is a piece of rock ’n’ roll history. You can just imagine all the wild nights in the party barn.’","Milhanger, in the village of Thursley, Surrey, has a rock 'n' roll history .

"Brothers-in-law Liang Enmei and Wang Chuwei were jailed for six years and two years after being found guilty of buying and selling foreign currency . Two Chinese men have been jailed after buying imported coins that were due to be recycled, cleaning them up, and selling them back to the country of origin. Liang Enmei, an antique dealer, was sentenced to six years in jail, along with brother-in-law Wang Chuwei, 57, who was given a two year jail term. The pair were found guilty of buying and selling ten tons of foreign currency, valued at more than £700,000. Damaged coins are routinely taken out of circulation and are supposed to be shredded before being handed over to scrap metal dealers. But these coins were sold whole to China where, instead of being melted down, they were cleaned up and sold back to the country of origin for a vast profit. Liang, an antique dealer from Shanghai, employed brother-in-law Wang, a scrap metal dealer, to clean the coins over a ten month period in his workshop. Wang, from Wenling in China's eastern Zhejiang province, claimed he didn't know what he was doing was illegal. Chinese officials have refused to say which countries the coins were taken from. Police spokesman Guo Kao said: 'In total . he purchased 10 tons of old foreign coins but instead of melting down he . simply cleaned them up and sold them on. Laing, an antiques dealer from Shanghai, employed Wang, a scrap metal dealer, to clean scrap coins before selling them back to their country of origin . Over the course of ten months Wang cleaned ten tons of imported coins worth more than £700,000 . 'Business for him was so good that even took on other members of his family including his brother-in-law Liang Enmei, an antique dealer in Shanghai, to help recycle the coins and send them back to the coins' original countries. 'Liang, who was well aware that what he was doing was illegal, was sentenced to six years in jail.' The problem of recycling coins destined for the scrapheap is well known in China. Coins taken out of circulation are supposed to be shredded before being handed over to scrap metal dealers, but these were sold on whole (pictured, Wang's workshop where the coins were cleaned) Wang, 57, received two years after claiming he didn't know what he was doing was illegal. Laing, who knew the activity was illegal, got six years (pictured, coins are taken out of Wang's workshop) In another case in Zhejiang province, a group of three people involved in a similar business were earlier sentenced between seven years and nine months in jail for recycling and selling foreign coins worth 130million yuan (£12million). And in another case, a Chinese gang were sold one and two Euro coins - which appear similar to £2 coins -  with the centre disc removed from the outer ring and asked to scrap them. Instead the group simply reattached the middle and outer pieces, then sold them back to a German bank at face value.","Laing Enmei and Wang Chuwei jailed for buying and selling foreign currency .

"Google has warned changes being proposed to the issue of search warrants in the US could lead to devices being tracked around the world . Google has condemned proposals that will allow the US government to remotely search computers anywhere in the world. An advisory committee plans to change the way search warrants are issued by federal and state judges. The amendment would let the US government obtain a warrant to conduct ‘remote access’ searches of electronic storage media if its location is ‘concealed by technological means.’ But in a blog post strongly opposing these plans, Google has warned this amendment could lead to devices being tracked globally and is calling on the debate to be taken to Congress. The amendment was proposed last year by the Advisory Committee on the Rules of Criminal Procedure, at the request of the Department of Justice. It specifically relates to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 41 that governs the issue of search warrants. As it stands, Rule 41 largely prohibits a federal judge from issuing a search warrant outside of the judge’s district. Under the proposals, exceptions to this rule would be added to include computers and networks. In particular, the change would let authorities apply for a warrant and remotely search storage if the media has been hidden. The location of such media can be concealed using private networks, for example, or by rerouting traffic across multiple servers. The committee explained the searches would be useful when investigating botnets, for example, but Google is concerned. Botnets are network of computers that are controlled by hackers to send spam or spread malware. Criminals use malicious software to turn a victim's computer into a bot, also known as a zombie. The computer can then be used to spread files without the owner's knowledge. The California firm’s legal director Richard Salgado said: ‘The implications of this expansion of warrant power are significant, and are better addressed by Congress. ‘First, the proposed amendment would likely end up being used by authorities to directly search computers and devices around the world.’ He continued that even if the committee intends to apply the changes to devices in the US, ‘there is nothing in the proposed change to Rule 41 that would prevent access to computers and devices worldwide.’ Google is concerned the proposal is open to interpretation and said the amendment would 'likely end up being used to search devices around the world’. It said the proposal equally doesn't define what is, or would warrant, a remote search and is therefore calling for the changes to be debated by Congress (filing pictured) Secondly, he believes the proposal threatens to undermine the privacy rights and computer security of internet users. For example, the change would ignore territorial limits on the use of warrants to conduct ‘remote access’, and the proposal does not define under what circumstances a remote search could be undertaken.

The committee explained that the searches would be useful when investigating botnets, for example. ‘It merely assumes such searches, whatever they may be, are constitutional and otherwise legal’ continued Mr Salgado. And this ‘carries with it the spectre of government hacking without any Congressional debate or democratic policymaking process.‘ . Mr Salgado also raises concerns that ‘concealed by technological means’ could be applied to the kinds of virtual private networks (VPNs) used by banks and online retailers to keep their networks secure. Google’s specific argument for wanting the issue to be debated in Congress is the risk the proposals could cause to international treaties. For example, the US has diplomatic agreements with other countries to cooperate in investigations, known as Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs). ‘Google supports ongoing efforts to improve cooperation among governments, and we are concerned that the proposed change to Rule 41 could undermine those efforts,’ said Mr Salgado. ‘The significant foreign relations issues associated with the proposed change to Rule 41 should be addressed by Congress and the President, not the Advisory Committee. ‘The Advisory Committee is entertaining a dramatic change to electronic surveillance rules. ‘Congress is the proper body to determine whether such changes are warranted, and we urge the Committee to respect Congress’ traditional role in prescribing the substantive rules governing electronic surveillance.’ In addition to voicing its concerns, Google has officially filed its opposition to the changes to the advisory committee.","Proposal was made by a committee on the Rules of Criminal Procedure .

"Toronto's controversial Mayor Rob Ford has been released from a hospital after undergoing his first round of chemotherapy to treat  a rare form of cancer in his abdomen. Last week Ford, 45, began aggressive chemotherapy at Mount Sinai Hospital for what has been described as a particularly 'difficult' type of cancer. He has a malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen that has spread to his buttock and is expected receive another cycle of chemotherapy in an effort to shrink the tumor after an 18-day break. Doctors will then reassess his situation. Scroll down for video . Last week Ford, 45, began aggressive chemotherapy at Mount Sinai Hospital for what has been described as a particularly 'difficult' and rare type of cancer . Ford's office said yesterday that he is 'resting with his family at this time'. He has been hospitalized for nearly two weeks. Liposarcoma is an extremely rare form of cancer that affects the body's connective tissues,  like fat, blood vessels and muscles. It comprises approximately one per cent of all cancers. In a statement, the mayor thanked staff at both Humber River Hospital and Mount Sinai for the 'exceptional level of care' he received. He also expressed gratitude to media for respecting his privacy as well as his family's. 'Most of all, Mayor Ford would like to express his gratitude for the overwhelming outpouring of support from the people of Toronto,' the statement said. 'He wishes other families who are suffering from similar circumstances all the best in their ongoing battles.' The tumor forced Ford to do what months of scandals over drug and alcohol abuse could not - drop his bid for re-election. Ford, who was elected mayor in 2010, has been engulfed in controversy since the Toronto Star and the U.S. website Gawker last year reported the existence of a video apparently showing the mayor inhaling from a crack pipe. Ruth Ford (centre) and Randy Ford (left), mother and brother of the Toronto Mayor, leave Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto after visiting Rob Ford during his treatment . After months of denials, he finally admitted to using crack but adamantly refused to resign, even after Toronto's City Council stripped him of most of his powers. A stream of revelations of erratic behavior, public drunkenness - and a report of another crack video - finally prompted him to enter rehab earlier this year. He returned to work and campaigning in June. The severity of his prognosis following his sudden admission to hospital on September 10 forced Ford to withdraw from Toronto's mayoral race. He asked his brother, Doug, to run in his place. Before he began treatment, the mayor released an audio statement from his hospital room urging his supporters to vote for his brother. ‘I'm encouraging my brother to jump into this race, wholeheartedly, right now,’ said Ford in the three-minute statement from the hospital. ‘You, the people of Toronto, have been with me since Day One. Now I ask you to throw your support behind Doug.’ The tumor forced Ford to do what months of scandals over drug abuse could not - drop his bid for re-election . 'In a few hours, I will begin my chemotherapy,' he continued. 'Then I will spend the next little while with my family, focused on getting better,' he said, adding that he would return strong for his family and his city. ‘With the love and support of my family, my friends, and the people of Toronto - I know I will beat this terrible disease,’ he said. Ford then turned his attention to the mayoral race, touting his brother as a man who loves Toronto, who has been fighting for its citizens and who is now prepared to 'carry the torch' for him. 'When the people get to know Doug as I do they will see a man who cares, a man with vision, a man with integrity and determination,' Ford said. He concluded the message by thanking his wife for being by his side and encouraging other people battling cancer to 'never, ever give up'. The severity of Rob Ford's prognosis following his sudden admission to hospital on September 10 forced him to withdraw from Toronto's mayoral race. He asked his brother, Doug (pictured), to run in his place . Doug Ford, who has been his brother's most aggressive defender, is expected to face an uphill battle against two other major candidates in the mayoral election. He hasn't started campaigning since he announced he was entering the race. Ford's doctor, Dr Zane Cohen, has said his cancer makes up only about one per cent of all cancers but said he was optimistic about Ford's treatment because they have many experts in sarcoma at the hospital. He revealed that Ford will get two cycles of chemotherapy over the next 40 days in an effort to shrink the tumor, and then they'll assess. He said surgery may or may not be necessary. The tumor is about five by five inches and is about two or three years old. It has not spread to organs, he said.","Ford, 45, is being treated for a malignant liposarcoma in his abdomen .
