British Gas revealed today it made £23 every second from its customers in the first six months of 2013 and hinted at more price rises. After raising its prices just before last year's record-breaking cold winter, the energy giant raked in a £356million profit from households during the first half of this year - up 3.2 per cent on 2012. As people cranked up the heating to deal with plunging temperatures, residential gas consumption alone soared by 18 per cent during the first four months of 2013. The news has led to consumer groups demanding they freeze the price of gas and electricity to ensure households can afford to keep warm this winter. Parent company Centrica also enjoyed bumper profits of £1.58billion for the past six months - up nine per cent - causing its shares to rise sharply this morning. Profits hike: British Gas's residential arm made £356million in the first half of this year, up 3.2 per cent . Facts: A huge rise in revenue from households driven by a price increase and freezing conditions helped British Gas increase residential profits to £356million . Its profits would have been higher but were held back by a new duty to pay for energy efficiency measures in customers' homes, which helped push environmental costs up 37 per cent for the period. Centrica warned that the scheme, which has landed it with a £1.4 billion bill, would 'inevitably impact on customer bills ultimately' and that it was facing 'upward pressure on costs'. Finance director Nick Luff said: 'We will keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can. If prices do have to go up, we will delay it for as long as possible.' Today consumer group uSwitch said British Gas should not raise its prices again this year. 'The . fact that British Gas has absorbed increasing costs so far this year . will be of cold comfort to consumers who may be fearing the worst – . especially with rumours of price rises. Profits are up from last year, . so we would urge British Gas to help quell customer's fears and go one . step further from its May pledge and commit to a price freeze for the . rest of the year,' spokesman Tom Lyon said. 'People are already starting to worry . about next winter and the cost of their energy bills and high energy . prices have a big impact on consumers. Last winter, almost seven in ten . households went without heating at some point to keep their energy costs . down.' But Centrica maintain they are giving consumers a good deal. Chief executive Sam Laidlaw said: . 'With our customers using more gas to stay warm during the unusually . cold winter, we're doing everything we can to help them keep their . energy costs under control and make bills simpler and clearer.' Cashflow increase: A drop in average temperatures in Britain helped British Gas increase its profits . Today's announcement of its half-year . financial results are likely to spark anger as it is revealed how . British Gas boosted its bottom line via the steep bills landing on . customers' doorsteps in the wake of the freeze. The earnings announcement comes a day after French-owned energy firm EDF said its profits had risen to a record £903million in the wake of the cold spell. British Gas's rise in profits does not entirely reflect gains from heavy winter gas usage, which are likely to have been offset by the cost of a new obligation to deliver energy efficiency measures in customers' homes, analysts said. Boss: Centrica's chief executive Sam Laidlaw pledged to 'keep energy costs under control' The company has been the subject of sustained hostility as it awarded multimillion-pound pay packets to executives while customers have struggled to pay rising energy bills amid the economic downturn. Its results announcement also comes as new rules on simpler energy tariffs provoke an industry backlash. Rival provider SSE said the changes would 'add cost and complexity to energy suppliers' relationships with customers'. In June, Centrica muscled in on the UK's potential shale gas boom by buying a 25 per cent stake in the Lancashire Bowland exploration area, paying £40million cash and pledging tens of millions in further funds for the venture, which is operated by Cuadrilla Resources.","Firm raised energy prices by 6% shortly before onset of freezing winter .

Daniela Henderson, who was imprisoned for 15 months for child cruelty, has been allowed to stay in Britain . A mother who was jailed for locking up her three children without food and water while she went out for the day has avoided deportation because she is not deemed a 'direct threat'. German Daniela Henderson, who was imprisoned for 15 months for child cruelty, can stay in Britain after a judge ruled that her crime was not serious enough to warrant her deportation under European Union rules. In May 2010 the 30-year-old, who was in Gateshead, locked her seven, four and two-year-old in a room while she went out for the day, with no food or water, her trial heard. Neighbours called the police after spotting the youngsters, who were discovered naked apart from the eldest who wore underwear, leaning out of a window. The Home Office attempted to deport the mother, who no longer has any contact with her children, when she was released from prison in 2011, the Daily Telegraph reported. But the EU's policy of free movement amongst member countries means that Henderson has to be deemed a 'genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat' to be expelled. Upper Tribunal Judge Jane Coker rejected the Home Office's argument that the mother would present a risk if she became pregnant or met a partner with children, according to the Daily Telegraph. The free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed to European Union (EU) citizens by the Treaties. To deport someone is a very considerable interference in a person's life and must be proportionate to the seriousness of the breach of public policy or public security, the EU guidance states. The free movement of persons is a fundamental right guaranteed to European Union citizens by the Treaties . The decision to expel someone must be based 'on the personal conduct of the individual concerned which must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society'. EU citizens and their family members who have the right of permanent residence enjoy increased protection against expulsion as they can be expelled only on serious grounds of public policy or public security. A Home Office spokesman was unavailable for comment when the MailOnline contacted them. The decision over Henderson comes after a flurry of changes the Government plans to make in relation to Britain's membership of the EU. At the start of July it was announced that the Government plans to claw back 100 powers from the EU. The move represents the start of David Cameron's attempt to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of the proposed in-out referendum on the EU. But it is also a coup for Home Secretary Theresa May, who will announce the plans this week and is likely to receive a boost to her profile after successfully deporting hate preacher Abu Qatada. There are currently 133 EU regulations governing home affairs, justice and the police, including measures to set up a European DNA database and impose driving bans which are valid across the continent. The process of opting out is governed by the controversial Lisbon Treaty, which states that member nations can exempt themselves from whole areas of EU policy. The British Government is set to examine each measure in turn to determine whether or not it is in the national interest to sign up. It is expected that roughly two thirds of the 133 rules will be ditched by ministers next year. In May the Queen's speech included a crackdown on immigration and an end to the farce of criminals and terrorists abusing human rights laws. Tthe Government announced plans to stop foreign prisoners using the right to ‘family life’ to avoid deportation. The legislation will add legal weight to guidance for judges introduced last July by Theresa May that foreign criminals should be able to use Article 8 of the Human Rights Act in exceptional circumstances only. Judges have continued to ignore the Home Secretary’s guidance because it was not backed up by primary legislation.

A British mother accused of smuggling heroin has spoken of her torment at having to bring up her baby daughter in a Pakistani prison cell. Khadija Shah says nine-month-old Malaika is the only thing keeping her sane as she waits to find out if she will face the death penalty for her alleged crimes. The 25-year-old from Birmingham has not had a date set for her trial, 14 months after she was arrested on suspicion of trying to smuggle £3.2million of heroin into the UK. In prison: Khadija Shah, pictured with her daughter Malaika shortly after her birth, is in jail in Pakistan . She gave birth to Malaika in October, but was then forced to return with her to the Rawalpindi Central Jail, where she fears the baby will be struck down with one of the infectious diseases such as tuberculosis which are rife in the prison. 'If Malaika was not here, I would be crazy because things are very hard,' Mrs Shah told Vice. 'She keeps me strong.' Human rights charity Reprieve has been helping the British citizen, but she and the baby continue to face an uncertain future thanks to the slow pace of Pakistan's legal system. Plight: Mrs Shah, from Birmingham, could face execution after being accused of smuggling heroin . 'I am still breastfeeding,' Mrs Shah said. 'Every three months Prisoners Abroad give me some money for basic food items and Pampers for the baby, who I keep clean. 'She likes to play with empty wrappers of food items. I usually try to keep our surroundings clean, too.' Last year the prisoner complained that her newborn daughter was being bitten repeatedly by mosquitos, had developed severe diarrhoea and had not recieved vital inoculations. Her older children Ibraham, six, and Aleesha, five, were originally in jail with their mother, but were flown back to the West Midlands over a year ago and she has not seen them since. 'They miss me, but never ask me where I am,' Mrs Shah said. 'I ignore things. I ignore what's happening to me.' Maya Foa of Reprieve said: 'We are extremely worried about Khadija and the health of her baby. 'What is still more troubling is that the British Government is complicit in her plight - by giving aid to Pakistan’s counter-narcotics programme, the UK is in effect helping to send people to death row for drugs offences, including its own citizens.' The young mother has denied any wrongdoing ever since she was arrested at Islamabad Airport in May last year. She claims she agreed to transport some suitcases as a favour for men she had recently met, and had no idea that the luggage contained heroin.","Khadija Shah, 25, is in prison in Rawalpindi with baby daughter Malaika .

"By . Suzannah Hills . PUBLISHED: . 03:22 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:07 EST, 31 July 2013 . 'Tragic accident': Olivia-Leigh Picton, eight months, accidentally hanged herself when she became trapped between the ladder and mattress of her bunk bed . An eight-month-old baby accidentally 'hanged' herself when she became wedged between a mattress and ladder while wriggling in her bunk bed. Olivia-Leigh Picton had been sleeping in the bottom bunk for two months after a health visitor said she should be given her own room. Her parents fitted a bed brace to ensure Olivia-Leigh didn’t fall out of the bottom bunk, but the little girl somehow managed to wriggle between the bars of the ladder leading to the top bunk and got stuck against the mattress. The freak incident just days before Christmas last year left Olivia-Leigh suspended from the bed by her neck. She was found by her father as he was getting his other daughter ready for nursery. Olivia-Leigh was rushed to hospital by ambulance but was pronounced dead despite attempts to revive her. At an inquest in Burnley, Lancashire, Olivia-Leigh’s devastated parents Katie Ross, 23, and David Picton, 24, warned other parents not to put young children in their own beds - especially bunk beds because of the dangers. The hearing was told Olivia-Leigh had been given her own room as the couple’s eldest daughter Ella-Mae, aged three, had difficulty sleeping properly when she was not in the same bedroom as her parents. The couple did not want Olivia-Leigh to have the same habits as her sister so they decided to put her in her own room in the bottom bunk. Safety precautions: Olivia-Leigh Picton's mother Katie Ross and father David Picton had secured a bed brace to prevent the eight-month-old from falling out . Miss Ross told the inquest: 'I didn’t . put Ella-Mae in her own bed and she got too attached to us. I wanted . Olivia to be different and she was. She was in bed every night for 7pm . and woke up a happy child.' Sound sleeper: Olivia-Leigh Picton had been sleeping in the bed for two months without a problem ahead of the incident . She added that the intention was to have both girls sleeping together once they were in a routine. She . added: 'I spoke to my health visitor about it and she had a rule about . putting them in their own room at six months. 'I asked her advice and . that’s when we came up with the bed brace so she couldn’t fall out. 'One of them attaches underneath the . mattress and fastens at the other side of the frame and sticks up at the . end to stop her from falling. 'She . had slept in the bunk for about two months. She had been doing really . well and went down easily and found it better to fall asleep in that bed . than the travel cot.' The inquest was told that the pillow was always put at the opposite end to the ladders and the bed was pushed up to the wall. The . night before her death on December 17, Olivia-Leigh was put to bed as . usual at 7pm and 'went down fine'. She was found trapped in the bed at . 8am the following morning. The Lullaby Trust recommends babies sleep in a crib, a carry cot or a Moses basket in the same room as the parents for the first six months. It also urges parents not to sleep in the same bed as their baby if they smoke, drink or take drugs or are extremely tired, if their baby was born prematurely or was of low birth-weight. NHS guidelines suggest a firm mattress that fits the cot snugly without leaving spaces around the edges, so babies cannot trap their head and suffocate. The NHS also recommends light blankets, ruling out pillows and duvets as unsafe for babies younger than a year old due to the risk of suffocation. Guidelines also say cots must be sturdy with gaps in the bars no wider than 2.5 inches. Mumsnet warns bedding to be avoided includes memory foam mattresses, water beds, feather beds, soft mattresses, bean-bags or bead-filled pillows and, according to the Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths, sheepskin rugs are a risk factor as soon as babies starts trying to roll on to their front. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) says that when a child begins to climb out of its cot, this is usually a sign that he or she is ready to sleep in a bed. Anything from 18 months onwards is about the right age to consider the transition. RoSPA also warns that bunk beds can pose a hazard to children under six years of age where entrapment (becoming wedged or trapped in the bed) can lead to strangulation, suffocation and injury to the neck or spine. Miss . Ross added: 'She was a very good child and she hardly cried. She could . feed herself and we would give her her bottle and she used to fall back . to sleep and have a nap.' She added: 'She obviously never ended . up waking up. 'I want something that may change the age of putting kids . in their own beds and spread the word about bed braces because they can . be dangerous.' Mr Picton added: 'Just don’t put a child in a bed when young.' Pathologist . Dr Naomi Carter said the cause of death was from suspension of the neck . and that there hadn’t been any underlying natural disease owing to her . death. She said: 'There was a number of . external minor marks to the neck and shoulder, but very mild and were . entirely consistent to where Olivia was found to be in a collapsed . state. 'My opinion is that death was due to suspension by the neck. 'Olivia was previously well, she was . essentially found wedged between the mattress with her body hanging . over, essentially she was suspended by the neck.' Dr Carter added that there was nothing to suggest the child was being neglected. 'In my opinion, with the history I was given, the appropriate cause of death was suspension by the neck.' East Lancashire Coroner Richard Taylor recorded a verdict of accidental death and told Olivia-Leigh’s parents said: 'There’s nothing I can say that can make this any better at all. 'You were doing what you thought at the time was right, in hindsight that wasn’t necessarily, but you can’t apportion any blame. That was a judgement that you made. 'The appropriate verdict is one of accidental death. This was nothing more, nothing less than a tragic accident.'","Olivia-Leigh Picton had been sleeping in the bottom bunk for two months .

The altercation happened in the community centre’s car park, next to Reddings Lane children’s play area, although the building manager said there had been no activities on the day. Manager Ellen Foche, who has worked at the community centre for more than 20 years, said the man’s death was 'a tragedy'. She said the car park, which is covered by at least two CCTV cameras, was used 'by a lot of the community' because of its location next to the park, the local mosque, a school and the centre. Amjad Ahmed, principal of Al-Furqan Community College opposite the car park, said he heard an elderly Asian man had been involved in a row. He added that evening prayers were said for the man at the nearby Mahmudsabir Masjid mosque, where Mr Ahmed is also a trustee, on Sunday. 'I heard that an elderly gentleman was in an argument with a taxi driver and he fell and the next thing, police were called and an ambulance was sent,' he said.

It’s tragic, and I also understand his grandchildren were playing in the park at the time as well.' 'It’s tragic, and I also understand his grandchildren were playing in the park at the time as well.' The 44-year-old man arrested in connection with the death has been released on bail, West Midlands Police said.

A Cabinet minister’s proposal to allow shoppers to park for 15 minutes on double yellow lines has been dismissed by a Coalition junior minister as ‘dangerous and unworkable’.

But transport minister Norman Baker, whose Liberal Democrat colleagues actually want to increase parking charges, claimed the plan would increase congestion and drive people away. Free for all: Motorists would not be hit with fines if they leave their car on double yellow lines for up to quarter of an hour . He said: ‘The idea of actually having . cars parked for a very long period of time on a double yellow line . undermines the purposes of the yellow line and I’m advised it’s . unworkable. They are there for a reason, often for safety reasons.’ He added: ‘I’m not in favour of motorists who park illegally, blocking parking spaces for those who want to use them properly.’ But sources close to Mr Pickles argue . that parking fines are doled out too eagerly, and are partly responsible . for killing off the high street.

His family are suing the Ministry of Defence for negligence . The family of one of six Red Caps murdered by a mob in Iraq is suing the Ministry of Defence for up to £250,000. It follows a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last month that UK soldiers in war zones are covered by human rights laws. Corporal Russell Aston was one of the Royal Military Policemen cornered and slaughtered by hundreds of locals at a police station in Majar al Kabir, near Basra, in June 2003. The killers have never been brought to justice. Legal papers lodged on behalf of Cpl Aston’s family allege commanders failed to take ‘reasonable’ measures to keep the Red Caps safe when they were deployed to the hostile town. The families of all six soldiers have long maintained the soldiers’ deaths were preventable. They claim commanders failed to give the Red Caps sufficient ammunition to defend themselves as well as roadworthy vehicles and effective communications to call in support. An inquest into their deaths in 2006 recorded a verdict of  unlawful killing and heard evidence the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and  no satellite phone when they were ambushed. If the Aston family claim is successful, it could lead to yet more legal action against the MoD. John Miller, father of Corporal Simon Miller who was also killed in the attack, said he too will sue. ‘It could be classed as a blunt . sword, but all I’ve wanted is to get these people into court and for the . MoD to accept the failings that were identified by the board of . enquiry. ‘Nothing else would give me greater . satisfaction, and I know nothing will bring my amazing son back, but if . we could get that justice and admission . Russel Aston (back row, second from left) and his comrades were killed when an angry mob of 500 stormed a police station where they were training local police in Iraq . of guilt, my wife and I could . turn the chapter and pick up the threads of the life we once had.’ ‘If we could get that justice and admission of guilt, my wife and I could turn the chapter and pick up the threads of the life we once had,’ he added. An MoD spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives. However, it would be inappropriate to comment on any forthcoming legal proceedings. The five men who died alongside Cpl Aston, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, were Lance Corporal Thomas Keys, Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, Corporal Simon Miller, Lance Corporal Ben Hyde and Corporal Paul Long. An inquest into their deaths in 2006 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and heard evidence the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and no satellite phone when they were ambushed. John Miller, whose son Simon was killed in the attack, said he too will sue the Ministry of Defence.He said: ‘Simon’s patrol should have had a satellite phone and 150 rounds of ammunition; they were denied both, they couldn’t call for help, they couldn’t initiate a firefight because they didn’t have enough ammunition against a mob of 500 firing rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s assault rifles. ‘Can anyone imagine that situation and be totally useless under it? All we want is an admission of guilt from the MoD. I’m so angry and very, very hurt.","Supreme court made landmark ruling, opening way for court case .

"By . Steve Doughty . PUBLISHED: . 18:34 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:41 EST, 31 July 2013 . The plight of a middle-aged stroke victim who wants a nurse to help him die threw the controversial laws on suicide into fresh turmoil yesterday. Appeal judges decided that the 48-year-old victim, known only as Martin, should be given new guidelines on whether a nurse who helps him end his life will be prosecuted for assisted suicide. The decision means that for the second time in four years the Director of Public Prosecutions has been instructed by judges to draw up rules on who will and who will not be charged with helping a suicide, a crime that can bring a jail sentence of 14 years. Ruling: The case of the 48-year-old, known only as Martin, was one of three right-to-die hearings at the Court of Appeal in central London (pictured) The Court of Appeal ruling was immediately challenged by the DPP, Keir Starmer. Mr Starmer, who is to step down as head of the Crown Prosecution Service in the autumn, called for a final ruling from the higher Supreme Court before he produces new guidelines. And it was also condemned in a ringing dissenting opinion by the most senior of the three judges who heard Martin's case. Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales, broke with his two colleagues and said the DPP should not be given powers to reform the law on his own. The Martin ruling was one of three cases of desperately disabled individuals who hope to die decided by the Court of Appeal yesterday. In a second case, 57-year-old road accident victim Paul Lamb was told that no doctor will be allowed to help him take his own life at home. Decision: Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, the head of the judiciary in England and Wales, broke with his two colleagues and said the DPP should not be given powers to reform the law on his own . Lord Judge, sitting with Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Elias, also denied the pleas of the family of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson that human rights law means he should have been entitled to help to die. 'I think it would be sensible for the CPS, if possible, to have the benefit of the views of the Supreme Court before any amendments are made to the DPP's guidelines in this important and sensitive area of the law' Keir Starmer, Director of Public Prosecutions . Mr Nicklinson died last summer at the age of 58 before his request came to the Appeal Court. His death came after he refused to take food and drink shortly after losing a first High Court case last summer, and his wife Jane has been allowed to pursue his claim. The judges said that it is for Parliament to make the law on assisted suicide. But in the Martin case two of the . judges overruled Lord Judge and said he was right to ask for 'clearer . guidance' from the DPP on whether a nurse or doctor brought in to help . him will face prosecution. Martin . suffered a brainstem stroke five years ago which left him almost . entirely unable to move and without the ability to speak. Died last summer: Lord Judge also denied the pleas of the family of locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson (pictured) that human rights law means he should have been entitled to help to die . He communicates by moving his head and . eyes, and by staring at a computer which can detect when he looks at a . letter or number, a process described by the judges as 'painfully slow'. Instructed to draw up rules: The Court of Appeal ruling was immediately challenged by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer . Lord Dyson and Lord Justice Elias said: 'He finds his life and his condition to be undignified, distressing and intolerable.' They said Martin had tried to dehydrate and starve himself to death, but 'his attempt failed in the most distressing circumstances.' His alternative, the judges said, was to travel to the Dignitas suicide clinic in Zurich. But, they said, Martin's wife, who is a nurse, does not want to help him die and will not help him travel to Switzerland. He therefore needs to find someone else to help him, and the DPP should give clearer guidance on whether that person will be prosecuted. Mr Starmer drew up guidelines in 2010 on the instructions of the courts. These say that an assisted suicide prosecution is more likely if a medical professional helps in the death. The DPP said yesterday: 'While I respect the carefully considered judgment of the Court of Appeal, I think it would be sensible for the CPS, if possible, to have the benefit of the views of the Supreme Court before any amendments are made to the DPP's guidelines in this important and sensitive area of the law.' Lord Judge said in his dissenting opinion: 'Prosecutorial guidance is in danger of expanding into a method of law reform which is outside the proper ambit of the DPP's responsibilities.' He said that prosecution guidelines could be applied so that people who should in law be prosecuted escape without criminal charges.","Case of 'Martin' was one of three right-to-die hearings at Court of Appeal .

Abs: New York middle school teacher Stefan Serie claims he was forced to resign after he appeared shirtless, above, at a raucous pool party on reality TV show 'Princesses: Long Island' But just a week after the June 2 episode aired, Serie, an eight-year teaching veteran who was rated 'highly effective' during the last school year, said he was hauled into the school district office by angry officials. He said administrators told him his tenure offer would be rescinded and pressured him to resign, even though there was nothing illegal going on in the scene. He told the New York Daily News. 'I didn't do anything that I would tell my students not to do.' Serie reluctantly agreed to quit, giving up his $75,000-a-year job. 'It was a coerced resignation,' he said. According to the Daily News, the . teacher, who has degrees in health and physical education from Hofstra . University, is now fighting to be reinstated and said he would sue the . TV show if the school refused. Bikinis: In his brief cameo, the 30-year-old, pictured right, laughs as the beauties drink alcohol from red plastic cups and bounce around in teeny bikinis by the pool . Chaos: Serie, pictured in the green shirt, said he realized as the pool party descended into chaos that he didn't want to be associated with the show . 'I want my job and tenure back. I think I deserve it,' Serie said. Parents are equally outraged at Serie's dismissal, believing the school over-reacted. Some are planning to attend a protest tonight ahead of a school district meeting, demanding the toned teacher be allowed to return to classes. Rosemary Garofolo, whose two 12-year-old boys took Serie's seventh-grade health class, said there wasn't a kid in school who didn't love the teacher, adding that her sons learned a great deal about nutrition from the clearly health-conscious educator. 'Honestly, I think as long as he . wasn’t doing anything illegal on the show, I don't see why it should . matter what he does in his time,' she told the Daily News.

'I was an ancillary character in the background,' he told the Daily News. 'The behavior of the cast members was not something I wanted to be a part of moving forward.'

A former pro-football Hall of Famer who developed dementia in his twilight years died a painful and senseless death while in the care of an Atlanta, Georgia assisted-living facility. George McAfee, a former running back for the Chicago Bears, drank industrial-strength detergent after wandering unsupervised into a cleaning room at the home run by the Emeritus Corporation. The chemical burned his lips, esophagus and lungs before he died in terrible pain in hospital in 2009, he was aged 90. Cheryl Morgan holds a photo of her late father George McAfee, who suffered from dementia and died after drinking toxic dishwashing liquid at an assisted-living facility in Atlanta, Georgia . George McAfee, a star running back for the Chicago Bears in the 1940s, died aged 90 after drinking industrial-strength detergent after wandering unsupervised at an assisted-living facility in Atlanta . When caregivers found McAfee, his lips were black and his face looked like a ‘horror show death mask,’ his daughter, Cheryl Morgan, 66, told ABCNews. ‘It was horrible, horrible,’ she said. ‘I cannot begin to tell you how horrific it was. We just hope he wasn't conscious.’ McAfee’s family sued Emeritus, one of the largest operators in the assisted living business, who accepted responsibility and the parties settled out of court. The circumstances surrounding McAfee’s demise and other tragic deaths at assisted-living facilities are featured in a PBS Frontline documentary - ‘Life and Death in Assisted Living’ - which premiered on Tuesday night at 10 p.m. ET. The program takes a critical look at the growing market for so-called ‘memory units’, which appeal to families looking for a home-like environment for their loved ones who are suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's disease. McAfee's family sued Emeritus, one of the largest operators in the assisted living business, who accepted responsibility and the parties settled out of court . The documentary focuses on Seattle-based Emeritus, whose advertising slogan is, ‘Our family is committed to yours.’ In the tragic case of McAfee, facility records reveal that no one was on duty for 30 minutes in the wing where he found the cleaning fluid. His family said that when he moved to the care home initially he had regular caregivers who knew about his tendency to wander when he couldn’t sleep. But they claim care at the facility went downhill after Emeritus took it over and began to rotate staff. On the night that McAfee drank the bleach, he had opened a cabinet that was supposed to be locked. A caregiver found McAfee ‘sitting on the bed coughing and spitting up on a Kleenex and on the floor,’ said Morgan. When she arrived, his lips were ‘black and blue’ and he could hardly speak. He died 10 days later at age 90. Granger Cobb, president and CEO of Emeritus, told ABCNews that the fact the cabinet wasn’t locked was ‘a failure on our part.’ ‘George McAfee was an absolute tragic accident that was horrific and the community was devastated,’ he said. ‘We sincerely regret the pain and trauma they experienced. … There has never been a similar accident in 20 years since we were founded.’ McAfee’s career as a running back for the Chicago Bears during the 1940s was interrupted both by injury and World War II.","George McAfee had been a star running back for the Chicago Bears back in the 1940s .

Reports claim a man in Beijing was put into a coma after a faulty phone charger gave him an electric shock when he plugged in his iPhone 4. Another woman in Xinjian died when she answered her iPhone 5 while it was charging. Both have been linked with faulty, counterfeit chargers . An Apple spokesman said: 'It was with great sadness we learned through press reports that a Beijing customer was injured while using a ""knock off"" or counterfeit charger and we are looking into this further. 'Our customers' safety is very important to us and we have carefully designed all Apple products to meet government safety standards. We recommend our customers only purchase Apple products from Apple or authorized Apple resellers.' The incident in Beijing occurred a week after a Chinese air stewardess was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was recharging. News of the death of Ma Ailun, 23, was posted on the internet by her sister, prompting criticism of Apple among the country’s millions of iPhone users. Further health warnings were issued in Australia after after a Sydney woman was taken to hospital when she allegedly received an electric shock from her phone. However, this incident did not explicitly state that the phone was an iPhone and further investigation by New South Wales Ambulance found the incident was related to a 'mental health issue.'","Instructions on the Chinese Apple site explain how to identify chargers .

Lying peacefully in her father’s arms, six-week-old Teresita Medina is the youngest survivor of the horrific Spanish train crash and the only one who will have no clear memory of the devastating ordeal. The Medina family were travelling from Madrid in the direction of El Ferrol in North Western Spain on the train that derailed last Wednesday, killing 78. The young family miraculously survived the crash despite their carriage running off the tracks as the train sped around a bend allegedly at 120mph - twice the recommended speed. Scroll down for videos . Unscathed: Daniel Castro cradles his six-week-old Teresita in his arms as her relieved mother watch on. The family survived the devastating train crash near Santiago de Compostela that killed 78 . Yesica Medina told the Sunday Telegraph that her family are alive thanks to some fortuitous timing. Ms Medina had been pacing the carriage with her crying baby in her arms, trying to soothe her while her husband Daniel Castro and their seven-year-old son Carlos sat in their seats. When she finally rocked Teresita to sleep, Ms Medina returned to her seat to put the baby down in the cot that the couple had set up beside them. Just as she sat down, the train crashed. Ms Medina said that had she remained standing, she would have been knocked down by the force of the crash and her baby would have been thrown from her arms. She insists had she sat down a moment sooner, she would have laid her baby down beside her and she would have been crushed by the force of the crash. Instead, she remained cradled in her mothers arms in a lucky twist of fate. She told a Sunday Telegraph reporter: ‘It was as if a guardian angel was watching over us. ‘At the exact moment I sat down, that exact moment, the train lurched on a bend and flew off the tracks.’ Baby Teresita was cushioned by her mother’s arms as their carriage sped off the track, crashed into a concrete wall and fell on its side. She is left with just a small scratch mark on her thigh to mark what is the country’s worst rail disaster in almost 70 years. The family were travelling in first class back from a two-day trip in Madrid, after buying tickets that were on offer. Horror: Francisco Jose Garzon was behind the controls when the Madrid to Ferrol high-speed rail link hurtled into a wall at 120mph near the city of Santiago de Compostela on Wednesday night .

Italy’s first black minister has condemned a spectator who threw bananas towards her while she was making a speech at a party rally. Integration minister Cecile Kyenge, who was born in Democratic Republic of Congo, has angered far-right groups with her campaign to make it easier for immigrants to gain Italian citizenship. She has been a target of racist slurs since her appointment in April. Integration minister Cecile Kyenge has angered far-right groups with her campaign to make it easier for immigrants to gain Italian citizenship . Shortly before the incident on Friday, . members of the right-wing Forza Nuova group left mannequins covered in . fake blood at the site of the rally in Cervia, central Italy. This was in protest against Kyenge’s proposal to make anyone born on Italian soil a citizen. 'Immigration kills,' was written on leaflets accompanying the dummies - a slogan Forza Nuova has previously used when referring to murders committed by immigrants in Italy. Although the bananas missed the stage where Kyenge was speaking, she responded to the gesture on Twitter, calling it 'sad' and a waste of food, considering the economic crisis. Shortly before the incident on Friday, members of the right-wing Forza Nuova group left mannequins covered in fake blood at the site of the rally in Cervia, central Italy (pictured) 'The courage and optimism to change things has to come above all from the bottom up to reach the institutions,' she added. Kyenge has faced regular insults since becoming minister, often from other politicians. Earlier this month a senior parliamentarian in the anti-immigration Northern League party likened her to an orangutan and only apologised after a storm of criticism. Roberto Calderoli, vice-president of . the Senate – Italy’s upper house – and a leader of the anti-immigrant . Northern League party, made the remarks about immigration minister . Cecile Kyenge at a party rally. Roberto Calderoli said Congolese-born minister resembled an orangutan . ‘When . I see images of Kyenge I cannot help think, even if I don’t say that . she is one, of a resemblance to an orangutan,’ he said. For most of the day, Calderoli said he had no intention of resigning and offered only a qualified apology. ‘I did not mean to offend and if . minister Kyenge was offended I am sorry, but my comment was made within a . much broader political speech that criticised the minister and her . policies,’ he said. But after hours of nearly universal . condemnation and extensive coverage by the international media, . Calderoli called Kyenge in the evening to apologise directly. She had done well to become a minister, he said, but ‘perhaps she should do it in her own country’. Prime . Minister Enrico  Letta has denounced the comments as ‘unacceptable’ and . ‘beyond every limit’. And several ministers said Mr Calderoli should . step down from his Senate position. Politicians, . including some from his own party, lambasted Calderoli, with some . calling for him to resign as Senate vice president. In an official . statement and on Twitter, Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the comments . were unacceptable. ‘They go beyond all limits. Full solidarity and support to Cecile.

Last month, . a Northern League member in the European parliament was expelled from . the eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group for making racist . remarks about her.

"By . Chris Greenwood, Jack Doyle and Keith Gladdis . PUBLISHED: . 19:11 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:49 EST, 1 August 2013 . Top lawyers last night greeted demands to explain their links to controversial private detectives with a wall of silence. Dozens of Britain’s biggest law firms refused to say if they employ snoopers or what steps they take to ensure that the private eyes obey the law. Industry insiders claim the use of detective agencies is commonplace in complex fraud, insurance and divorce cases. But the Daily Mail found a reluctance by more than 30 legal firms to discuss the issue or account for their actions. Private eyes: Mystery surrounds the use of snoopers by legal firms, and few are answering questions . Among those who failed to comment were some of the most profitable  companies, including Clifford Chance, Linklaters and Freshfields. Other high-profile international firms such as Schillings, Carter-Ruck and Irwin Mitchell also failed to respond. Of the handful of firms that did reply, most confirmed that they used private investigators when ‘it is in our clients’ interests to do so’. One insisted ‘we expect that they operate fully within the parameters of the law’, with no evidence of how this would work in practice. The wall of silence came as police were urged to name those on a secret list of 102 firms and individuals who employed rogue detective agencies that broke the law by hacking, blagging and stealing sensitive personal information to order, in what has become known as the ‘blue chip’ hacking scandal. Nothing but weasel words . The largest group of clients is made up of law firms, and MPs are angry that they and others have escaped scrutiny. Critics called for an end to ‘double standards’ and for ‘arms-length involvement’ in criminal acts to be investigated rigorously. They pointed out that law firms and others escaped police investigation while those accused of phone hacking were the subject of an open-ended multi-million pound inquiry. As the Government finally announced that it will regulate private investigators, the Home Affairs Committee said it would haul back officials to explain the continued secrecy. Keith Vaz: Wants to name names . Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he remained determined to publish the names of those involved and will confront the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) again in September. The agency, which will be replaced by the National Crime Agency in October, has been accused of protecting those named in its intelligence report on private eyes. Mr Vaz said he could name names using Parliamentary privilege, but did not want to prejudice potential criminal inquiries. He said MPs should not be part of a ‘secret squirrel club’ in which information in the public interest cannot be published. Asked if Soca could keep ‘stringing along’ the committee, he added: ‘That is the balance. This list has been around for a number of years and nobody has done anything about it. This can be cleared up quite quickly. You should ask the firms involved – did they know that the rogue investigators were getting illegal information, were they acting illegally?’ ‘If yes, then you have to consider criminal liability. If no, then you cross them off. These companies, individuals and firms don’t even know they are on this list.’ The committee is writing to the top 100 legal firms and every FTSE 100 company to ask if they used private investigators. Private investigators will need a licence to operate or face jail, Home Secretary Theresa May announced yesterday. Before receiving a licence, they will have to pass a qualification and undergo background checks under rules being brought in from September 2014. Operating without a licence will be a criminal offence carrying a six-month jail term and a £5,000 fine. Crucially, legitimate journalist investigations will not be covered. Tory MP James Clappison, a senior member of the committee, said: ‘Now we’ve been told that the Government is going to regulate, it looks as if this will require an Act of Parliament. ‘If Parliament is going to debate this issue we need the maximum possible information.’ The Daily Mail contacted the top 20 UK law firms by gross earnings, as well as more than a dozen other high-profile companies to ask if they used private investigators. The vast majority did not respond at all to inquiries by telephone and email, despite being given more than 48 hours to do so. Linklaters, a sprawling global firm, said it was ‘not able to say anything’, while Freshfields said it did not want to prejudice any response to MPs. A spokesman for major firm Allen & Overy defended its use of private investigators. DLA Piper, which employs more than 4,000 lawyers in 30 countries, said it employed private eyes ‘when it is in our clients’ interests’. Other firms said they could not reply because they employed so many staff in different offices that it was impossible to know what they are all doing. Crackdown: Home Secretary Theresa May unveiled plans to force private investigators to obtain licences to operate, or face fines or even jail . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he had a ‘lot of sympathy’ with MPs who believed those who used snoopers should be named. He added that if ‘big companies and organisations’ were using investigators they ‘should be open about it’. Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘These rogue investigators should be investigated fully – and arms-length involvement by companies in their crimes should be uncovered.’","Mail reveals reluctance of law firms to discuss use of private eyes .

If your name is Susan Smith and you have a husband named David, a semi-detached house and drive a Ford Ka the chances are you are not alone. You are in fact the UK’s Mr and Mrs Average and like a significant proportion of the country, the pair of you share a mortgage on your 1970s three bedroom home and look forward to holidays in the US. New data from insurers Aviva have pin-pointed the most typical British households and even narrowed it down by generation. Mr & Mrs Average: A study has shed new light on what life is like for most people who live in modern Britain. Pictured, the fairly typical Brockman family from BBC1 show Outnumbered . So if you are aged between 45 and 54 you’re most likely to be called either Gary or Deborah. You will probably live in a detached or semi-detached house and drive a Citroen Picasso and go on holidays in Jamaica. Your children, if they are aged 18-25, will most likely be called Daniel, Emma, Matthew or Rachel and  drive Peugeots, live in flats and go on mini breaks to Amsterdam or Ibiza. And at the other end of the scale your parents are most likely to be called Ronald and Joan and they live in a bungalow and cruise around in a Honda Jazz. The UK’s largest insurer studied a . million of their customers in an effort to work out the most common . names, cars, homes and holidays based on age certain brackets. Ford Ka: If you drive one of these, the chances are you are called Susan Smith and are married to a chap called David . What they found appears to be proof of some astonishing generational trends. For example half of all people called Gary, Deborah, Nigel or Alison are aged 45-54 and three quarters of people called Ronald, Joan, Joyce and Jean are over 65. But it’s not just names that define the generations, changing priorities and social trends appear to impact many people the same way, leading them to make very similar life choices. Mini-breaks: Amsterdam (pictured) and Ibiza are a favourite with the 18-25s . The rise in popularity of cruises among older generations means it is by far the most popular holiday choice for those with grown-up children, with some 58 per cent of visitors to the Norwegian fjords over the age of 55. The data also reflects a pattern of life starting with young adults preferring cheaper flats, sporty cars and party holidays, to those in their 30s prioritising larger more comfortable houses and family beach holidays, and finally pensioners downsizing their properties and enjoying holidays closer to home. Those under 34 are most likely to live in either a flat or a maisonette, with a third of all basement flats being occupied by someone between the age of 25 and 34. As young people settle down and earn better salaries they become more likely to drive a faster car and take more exotic holidays – four in 10 Brits who visit Japan are 25-34 – before becoming parents changes the emphasis to more space at home and sensible utility vehicles. But there were also some unifying factors across the generations. Most people said the age when they are most content was 32 and that changed very little regardless of the age of the individual at the time. Heather Smith, marketing director at Aviva said: ‘The past decades have been a time of great change and it’s fascinating to see these differences between the generations. ‘As trends have come and gone, we have whole age groups identifiable by their name, where they live, what they drive and where they holiday. ‘It shows a remarkable progression through life as we change from wanting lively holidays and nippy city cars to going on child-friendly beach breaks and driving family run-a-rounds, to preferring the quiet life with a cruise and a hatchback.' Aviva provides insurance, savings and investment products to 14 million Brits and carried out their research in June 2013.

It could be the most sumptuous meal  you have ever been served – but polish it off in front of the TV and you probably won’t notice. Even the finest dish can taste bland  when the telly is switched on, because it causes distractions that ruin our taste perception, say scientists. And it’s bad news for slimmers as well as gastronomes. The telly causes distractions that ruin our taste perception when eating, say scientists . Ditching the dining table for the sofa can also lead us to eat more by removing the sense of how much we are scoffing, the researchers found. Six out of ten meals in British homes are now eaten while watching TV, but simply switching it off could help reduce calorie intake and improve the enjoyment of a meal, according to the report. In a series of experiments, Dutch researchers made diners carry out complicated memory tests while eating food that was either salty, sweet, or sour. The study, published in the journal Psychological Science, found that those who were distracted by the mental task were more likely to perceive the food as bland. Another experiment found they consumed more food in order to obtain  the same taste level and were less aware of how much they ate. Distracted individuals were more likely to eat crackers that were saltier or add extra sugar to their lemonade. The report, by Dr Lotte van Dillen of  Leiden University and Reine van der Wal of Raboud University, concluded: ‘These results are highly relevant  in today’s society, in which multi-tasking  is common. Six out of ten meals in British homes are now eaten while watching TV . ‘When cognitively engaged, such as while watching TV or driving a car, people’s taste perception is likely attenuated, which may contribute to unhealthy eating behaviours, such as increasing the intake of certain foods or adding more of certain flavourings.’ Previous British research has found that eating while distracted can boost consumption by 10 per cent – and at later meals by more than 25 per cent. The average Briton now eats 13 meals at home each week – eight of them while watching television, a study earlier this year found. More than a third of adults told the poll it was normal to eat a meal on the sofa, to not appreciate the food on their plate or notice the flavour.",Dutch scientists say multi-tasking can lead to unhealthy behaviour .

Scientists looking at charged particles in space have discovered particle hurricanes surrounding Earth. These highly-charged particles are part of something known as the Van Allen belts, which are two concentric rings encircling the Earth and held in place by a magnetic field. Since the Van Allen belts were first . discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to trace the source of . the super-acceleration. The acceleration is so high that satellites have to protect their sensitive components with shielding if their orbit spends significant time in the belts. Since the Van Allen radiation belts, pictured in this artist's impression, were discovered in 1958, astronomers have been trying to identify how the high-speed particles make their way into the belts. Two Nasa probes have now proved that electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge them at super speeds . The Van Allen radiation belts are two layers of charged particles orbiting around Earth. They are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field. The belts range from an altitude of 1,000 up to 60,000 kilometres above the Earth's surface. The radiation levels across the belts differ depending on where in the belt they are. The belts were discovered in 1958 by . scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the . first U.S space mission. One theory suggested the particles . were accelerated as they entered the belt and were trapped inside. The second suggested that particles . were created inside the belt and accelerated by a force from within. Nasa sent probes up to track the . behaviour of the belts and these satellites have finally proved that . electric fields inside the belts tear electrons from atoms and charge . them at super speeds. Data from NASA's twin space probes . suggests that these the particles may be supercharged by local . acceleration, similar to how hurricanes are driven by the evaporation of . warm ocean water on Earth. This theory explains why the belts change shape - because the particles numbers swell and drop in different conditions. Space scientists believe these findings are significant because they could also be used to explain the high-energy radiation belts that circle Saturn and Jupiter, as well as around Sun-like stars. The belts were discovered in 1958 by scientist James Van Allen from the University of Iowa while aboard the first U.S space mission. Researchers believe that the electrons contained within the rings of radiation had travelled from the Earth's magnetosphere - an area of space around the planet in which charged particles are kept in place by the planet's magnetic field. They thought that as the particles drifted closer to Earth and the magnetic fields became stronger, they would travel faster and settle into a ring-shaped orbit. However, this type of acceleration process would take weeks and only applies to belts that change and grow gradually. In the 1990s, satellites discovered . that the energy and shape of the Van Allen belts was changing much . faster than first thought. This . led to a second theory which suggested that charged particles don't come . from the magnetosphere, but instead are caused when electric fields . within the belts tear electrons from nearby atoms and accelerate them in . the process of tearing them from their source. In 2012, Nasa launched two Van Allen Probes, pictured, that could simultaneously study the belts from different angles. Following a solar storm which blew most of the belt's electrons away, the two probes recorded a 1,000 times more electrons developed over a 12-hour period. Scientists believe that this proves that the electrons must develop from within the belt . in August 2012, Nasa launched two Van Allen Probes that could simultaneously study the belts from different angles. Following a solar storm which blew most of the belt's electrons away, the two probes recorded a jump of 1,000 times more electrons over a 12-hour period. Scientists believe that this proves the electrons must develop from within the belt, and are not collected over time. Harlan Spence from the University of New Hampshire in Durhamco-authored the study. He told Nature journal: 'We have in this one event been able to really distinguish between the different ways that particles can be accelerated. The radiation belts were the first discovery of the space age and it’s just really exciting with the Van Allen probes to have seen right to the heart of the process.' Physicist David McComas of the Southwest Research Institute in Texas added: 'If [local acceleration of energetic particles] occurs in the heart of the Earth's Van Allen belts, it also probably does so in the more intense radiation belts around Jupiter and Saturn and even in planets around magnetized stars beyond the Solar System.'","The Van Allen radiation belts were discovered around Earth in 1958 .

Schools are entering weaker GCSE pupils into more than one exam in the same subject to try and boost league table positions, the exams regulator revealed yesterday. Teenagers are also being pushed into taking exams early so they can resit them to try and get a better grade. Ofqual said the strategy was mainly used with children expected to get a C or a D in a subject. A grade C or higher is classed as a good pass. Strategy: Teenagers are also being pushed into taking exams early so they can resit them to try and get a better grade (file picture) It claimed the tactics were designed to allow schools to cherry pick the best results to skew the league tables. The most startling example is in English language, where the number taking the predominantly exam-based International GCSE (IGCSE) has soared from 18,000 last year to 78,000 this year – more than a fourfold increase. However, this rise is not mirrored by a comparable drop in the number taking the standard GCSE, which includes more coursework. This suggests pupils are sitting both the GCSE and the IGCSE in an attempt to get a decent grade in one of them. As pupils await their results this month, it also emerged that 45,000 sat IGCSE maths this year, up from 34,000 last year. Ofqual said 15 per cent of students entered for GCSE maths last summer – around 90,000 – had ‘also sat one or more units from another maths GCSE or taken another whole maths GCSE’. Warning: Ofqual chief executive Glenys Stacey said that where students are at risk of not getting a C grade, 'the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end' In addition to this tactic, there has also been a significant increase in children taking exams before 16. Last year, 18 per cent took maths GCSE a year early. This year it was 23 per cent. 'Where students are at risk of not getting that precious C grade then the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end' Glenys Stacey, Ofqual chief executive . In English language it has leapt from 7 to 10 per cent, while the numbers taking English literature and language early have increased from 8 to 11 per cent. Ofqual chief executive Glenys Stacey said: ‘This is more common for students at the C/D boundary. We are not suggesting this is happening with students of all abilities. ‘But where students are at risk of not getting that precious C grade then the tactic is to enter the student for more than one qualification and ride both horses to the end. 'In some cases we’re seeing, in maths, that students are riding two horses and moving to a third horse – a completely different one – halfway through. ‘There are questions being asked about the educational value of that and the cost. But the reasons are quite clear.’ Focus: Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, warned in June that teachers were putting too much emphasis on pupils at the C/D boundary at the expense of gifted students . Schools are able to ‘bank’ better results with the Department for Education when students sit more than one exam in the same subject, which lets them improve their standing in league tables. Miss Stacey warned that pupils might be demotivated by the extra pressure and said having younger students sit exams might lower overall results. 'We will be critical of schools using early entry where we are not confident that this is allowing youngsters to achieve their full potential' Ofsted spokesman . She also hinted that results could dip in science subjects after they were toughened up. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, warned in June that teachers were putting too much emphasis on pupils at the C/D boundary at the expense of gifted students.

Cleared: Oil and banking heir Matthew Mellon was accused of hacking ex-wife Tamara Mellon, the Jimmy Choo tycoon . Law firms were revealed last night to be the single biggest user of corrupt private detectives who hacked, blagged and stole private information. They made up a fifth of 102 companies and groups uncovered as clients of a network of investigators jailed last year. MPs released a detailed break-down of the secret list outlining how 22 law firms paid for their shady services. The disclosure will fuel the growing clamour for companies and individuals linked to the so-called blue-chip hacking scandal to be named publicly. Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) have been accused of protecting  corporate clients and celebrities uncovered in their inquiries. Members of the Home Affairs Committee are concerned that those who paid others to steal and blag information have escaped the same scrutiny as the media. They are also angry that the Government has failed to regulate and license the thriving, but little known, private detective industry. Speaking last night, Keith Vaz, who chairs the committee, said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible. The senior Labour MP met Soca director-general Trevor Pearce yesterday and told him he is ‘concerned’ that the list is classified. He said releasing the number of firms in each category is an ‘important step towards establishing the facts’. 'Important step': Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Committee, said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible . He added: ‘It is in the public interest . for the information to be available at the appropriate time, not for . this saga to drag on.’ The breakdown revealed that a huge range of firms and individuals paid for the services of the group of private investigators. Following law firms, the next largest group was fellow private investigators (16), followed by insurers (ten) and financial service companies (eight). A string of other white collar professions linked to them include accountants, auditors, debt collectors and even an oil and medical supply company. Two celebrities are among the names, as well as seven other individuals seeking sensitive information about others. Scotland Yard holds the names of five further companies and individuals that it has been investigating since late 2011. Calls: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has also been asked to release suppressed information from four investigations into rogue private detective agencies . The suspects are under scrutiny as part of Operation Tuleta, an offshoot of inquiries into phone hacking and the bribing of public officials for information. The BBC’s flagship radio news programme finally turned its attention to the secret hacking scandal yesterday – at 6.36am when not many would be listening. The four-minute item was the first mention by the Today programme despite weeks of newspaper reports of how shady private eyes hacked, blagged and stole information. The Daily Mail and other newspapers have raised serious concerns that little has been done about the criminal activities of private eyes commissioned by major companies. Despite revelations in recent days that 102 companies featured on a list given to MPs by the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the story has merited barely a mention on BBC radio and TV programmes or online. It contrasts with the blanket coverage given by the BBC to revelations of phone hacking in the media. Yesterday, the London force confirmed those in the spotlight are ‘outside of the media industry’ as it defended its refusal to identify them. A spokesman said the ‘live investigation’ could be endangered if the names were released. Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has also been asked to release suppressed information from four investigations into rogue private detective agencies. Tory MP James Clappison, who made the request, is particularly interested in a 2007 inquiry known as Operation Barbatus. It found private eyes of one firm dubbed ‘Hackers Are Us’ were hacking computers and corrupting police officers but no clients were successfully prosecuted. The only one to be charged was oil and banking heir Matthew Mellon who hired the company during divorce proceedings against his ex-wife Tamara Mellon, the Jimmy Choo tycoon. Mr Mellon was later cleared by a jury who accepted he had no idea the investigators to whom he paid £12,000 were breaking the law. In a separate development, the Mail can reveal that ministers will shortly unveil the first ever statutory licensing regime for private detectives. At present, there is nothing in law to distinguish companies that pursue legitimate business activities from ‘corrupt operatives’.","Disclosure fuels clamour for companies linked to scandal to be named .

Yet there’s still something eerily familiar about the five stone steps leading up to the elegant, Mediterranean-style mansion, bathed in Miami Beach sunshine and flanked by palm trees blowing in an ocean breeze. This is the spot where celebrated fashion designer Gianni Versace was gunned down by a serial killer, made famous by countless newspaper photographs and worldwide TV broadcasts. And now the house could be yours for a snip. Scroll down for video . Spectacular setting: The view of the South Beach skyline from the tiled rooftop includes a glimpse of the pool and courtyard below . Central courtyard: The richly tiled floor and airy arches have featured in dozens of glossy magazine spreads over the years. From the roof the blue of the Atlantic and a fringe of palm trees can once again be glimpsed in the distance . Private dip: The mosaic pool is lined with 24-carat gold tiles . Soaking up the sun: Loungers await buyers who want to top up their tan by the pool . After initially being offered for sale . last year at $125million (around £80million) it is being put up for . auction with a starting price of just $25million (£16million). But . if you get past the former murder scene to the majestic arch of the . huge front door, a peep through the keyhole – depending on your taste – . might reveal even greater horrors in store. Infamous: Versace was shot dead on the steps of the South Beach mansion by Andrew Cunanan who then killed himself before police closed in . Taste free: The Empire Suite features spectacularly clashing styles and a myriad of colours which are incompatible with a restful night's sleep . Lavish detail: The walls of the Empire Suite features handpainted murals of musicians in an exotic setting. The suite itself is opposite Versace's old bedroom . Who could possibly live here, in a house where the master bedroom resembles a cross between the Sistine Chapel and a tart’s boudoir? Surely a man with such genius for helping women to look beautiful wouldn’t have furnished his home thus? And who might want to lash out a fortune on a place where the neighbours include a constant stream of Versace worshippers and celebrity-hunting ghouls posing for pictures at the gates? Naturally, those involved in the sale are quick to point out that Versace was slain outside the mansion, not in, when crazed attacker Andrew Cunanan struck in July 1997 before killing himself as a police search closed in. Room with a view: A porthole in the observatory, left, and one of the mansion's many foyers . Gleaming: A bath in the Mosaic Suite, left, and a shower in the Moroccan wash room . Plush: Living quarters include the the Moroccan Suite which is crammed full of the familiar features of North African design translated to a Miami beach setting . Grandiose: The Villa Suite was once Versace's bedroom. Sprawling accommodation includes feature pillars and a boldly tiled floor. There are also a number of balconies . The Fisher Auction Company still hopes the Italian designer’s legacy will be enough to attract a legion of bidders when the house goes up for auction on September 17. Versace spent $33million on renovations after buying the run-down 1930s mansion and a dilapidated hotel next door in 1992. The 23,000 sq ft property now boasts ten bedrooms, 11 bathrooms, a 54ft mosaic pool lined with 24-carat gold tiles, and an open-air courtyard. It has gold-plated bathroom fixtures, of course; plus mosaic floors and frescos he had custom made. Although high walls block traffic sounds from the busy road outside, 1116 Ocean Drive  has panoramic views of the sea from a rooftop observatory. The Versace family sold the house in 2000. It became a private club, then operated as a boutique hotel until earlier this year before a bankruptcy court appointed Fisher to put the property up for auction. New owners kept many of the more elegant Versace features but furnished the rooms ‘uniquely’. That furniture – including beds so large they need custom-made sheets – will be part of the sale. The mansion’s provenance comes free of charge. Wild style: Estate agent Lamar Fisher conducts a tour of the Versace Mansion including this room full of animal print decor .

Italian police launched a brutal crackdown on the Mafia this morning, arresting 70 suspects in a dawn raid including doctors and lawyers. A mafia clan in southern Italy staged hundreds of fake car crashes every year to get millions of euros in insurance payouts to buy drugs and weapons, according to police.

Fraud: The mob had local insurers, doctors, lawyers and auto body repairers on the payroll to pull off the fraud . Claims: 'The insurance scam permitted the boss to manage his clan, to buy guns and drugs, and to pay his men,' said a policeman . 'The insurance scam permitted the boss to manage his clan, to buy guns and drugs, and to pay his men,' said Rodolfo Ruperti, head of the police squad that carried out the investigation. The mob had local insurers, doctors, lawyers and auto body repairers on the payroll to pull off the fraud which earned the gang well over a million euros (£844,430) a year, Mr Ruperti said. Police seized assets worth 1.2 million euros. The defrauded insurer was a local branch of Zurich Insurance Group, which operated independently, under licence from the head office in Switzerland. 'Zurich does not comment on ongoing investigations and legal proceedings,' the Swiss group said in an email. Swoop: Many of the people kept their head down in a bid to avoid being photographed . Suspected: The insurance hoax was just one of the crimes the mafia gang is suspected of . Location: The people were arrested in Calabria early this morning . The insurance hoax was just one of the crimes the mafia gang is suspected of. Boss Giuseppe Giampa, 32, extorted protection money from local businesses and sold the clan's votes to the highest bidder in a 2010 mayoral vote, police said. The investigation has a breakthrough when Giampa turned informant, much more unusual in the brutal and closed Calabrian mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, than in Sicily or Naples. Investigators would not say why he chose to give evidence. In Rome, a Calabrian senator in Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right People of Freedom (PDL) party is being investigated for suspected vote buying as part of the investigation, police said. Another PDL politician, who is deputy chairman of the local airport management company, has been arrested, along with prison guards suspected of being on the boss's payroll. Finance police arrested several local businessmen, including a fireworks manufacturer suspected of providing explosives to the gang. Giampa is suspected of ordering about 20 murders in a mob war for control of the city between 2005 and 2011. Among those arrested on Friday were hitmen thought to be behind 11 killings, Ruperti said. 'It was a mafia system that not only stained Lamezia Terme with blood and murder, but it also bled dry the already fragile local economy,'provincial police chief Guido Marino said.","Insurance fraud was just one of the charges against the people sought .

The image makes the clouds look as if they are rippling, an occurrence known as gravity waves, which shows the effect of gravity on the earth's weather system. These particular gravity waves were over Lake Superior, one of the great lakes of Northern America, Southern Ontario, Canada and to the southwest of Pukaskwa National Park. Astronauts aboard the the International Space Station have taken a photograph of gravity waves - an atmospheric phenomenon that cannot be seen from Earth. The clouds look as if they are rippling. The image was taken with a Nikon D3S digital camera by members of the Expedition 36 crew . Several distinct sets of parallel cloud bands are visible in the photograph. Gravity waves are produced when . moisture-laden air encounters imbalances in air density, such as when cool air flows over warmer air. This can make the flowing air oscillate up and down as it moves, which in turn causes clouds to condense as the air rises. They then cool and evaporate away as the air sinks and warms, which produces the distinctive parallel bands of clouds. Nasa said the orientation of the cloud bands in this image suggests that air flowing off of the land surfaces to the north is interacting with moist, stable air over the lake surface, creating gravity waves.

The photograph was taken on 24 June with a Nikon D3S digital camera by members of the Expedition 36 crew, and was then enhanced by experts on Earth to improve the contrast and remove lens artifacts. It is also possible to see another phenomenon in the image, known as sunglint. Sunglint is caused by light reflection off a water surface. Some of the reflected light travels directly back towards the observer, resulting in a bright mirror-like appearance over large expanses of water. Water currents and changes in surface tension, typically caused by presence of oils or surfactants, alter the reflective properties of the water and can be highlighted by sunglint. In this image, surface water currents are visible to the east of Isle Royale that are oriented similarly to the gravity waves, suggesting that they too are the product of winds moving off of the land surface.","The photograph was taken from the International Space Station and shows gravity waves over Lake Superior and Ontario .

British soldiers have taken part in a secret offensive against the Taliban in a deadly Afghan warzone they had pulled out from three years ago. About 80 members of the 4th Battalion The Rifles provided ‘assistance’ to an Afghan National Army purge of insurgents in the hotspot of Sangin, in which 12  fanatics were killed and 30 improvised explosive devices seized. There were no British casualties during the eight-day operation earlier this month, but two Afghan soldiers died. Battle: Afghan National Army joined the British troops in the fighting in Sangin earlier this week . The mission to prevent Sangin,  northern Helmand, again becoming a Taliban stronghold was considered so risky it had to be approved personally by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. From 2006 to 2010 when UK troops were based in the town, dubbed one of the world’s most dangerous places, 106 soldiers were killed. News of the operation will fuel concerns about Afghan troops’ ability to defeat the Taliban when UK, US and Nato forces pull out in December 2014. The Afghan army took over security in Sangin in the spring but military commanders requested assistance following weeks of attacks by insurgents. Mr Hammond gave permission for troops from 4 Rifles, serving as the Brigade Advisory Group, to travel from Camp Bastion and help as troops from the UK-mentored 3/215 Brigade moved in. The UK troops have since left Sangin. A senior Army officer said: ‘The negative publicity would have been worse if the situation around Sangin had got out of hand. This was the lesser of many evils.’ Fierce: Sangin (pictured) has seen some of the worst fighting of the war in Afghanistan . The Ministry of Defence said: ‘These . out-of-area operations are completely in line with our current role of . providing training, advice and assistance to the Afghan National . Security Forces.’ In recent months the British Armed . Forces have instead been focusing on mentoring the Afghan National Army . in preparation for their withdrawal from the country next year. 'In support of the Afghan forces who . now have the security lead across the country, UK personnel do on . occasion operate outside the usual UK area of operations in central . Helmand in an advisory capacity, ' the Ministry of Defence said in a . statement. The statement added that Sangin 'remains a challenging area' and it is now for the Afghan forces to deal with insurgents. During the operation, a number of insurgents were detained and killed, more than 30 improvised explosive devices were found and destroyed and two vehicles were seized along with ammunition and weapons. There were no British casualities but a number of ANA soldiers were killed, The Sunday Times added.

Through the summer they have just got better and better as ISAF have stepped back further. 'However, operating in Sangin over the past week, they have moved to another level of performance and independence. 'Everyone who witnessed them has been in awe of the manner in which they cleared the insurgents from well defended positions with integrated fire support, manoeuvre, reserves and strong tactics. 'They have operated virtually independently, requiring the Task Force Helmand advisors from 4 RIFLES for little more than casualty evacuation. 'It has been a very impressive demonstration of what the Afghan National Army can be capable of.'

Nearly four years after a daylong firefight that killed eight of his fellow soldiers in Afghanistan, the emotion of that day remains just below the surface for Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter, who will receive a Medal of Honor next month for his actions during that attack by Taliban fighters. Carter, a former Marine who later enlisted in the Army and is currently assigned to the 7th Infantry Division at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, spoke to reporters Monday about the Oct. 3, 2009, battle at a mountain outpost where U.S. troops were outnumbered by about 400 Afghan fighters. In addition to those killed, 25 were injured, including Carter, who suffered hearing loss, shrapnel injuries and a concussion. 'This award is not mine alone,' he said. 'I am grateful for the service of all the soldiers I fought with that day.' Scroll down for video . Hero: U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter talks to reporters, Monday, July 29, 2013, at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington . Carter, 33, will be recognized at the White House on Aug. 26 for his actions, which included killing enemy troops, resupplying ammunition to American fighters, rendering first aid and risking his own life to save an injured soldier pinned down by a barrage of enemy fire. 'We are proud to have a soldier like him representing our Army and our nation,' said Lt. Col. Joe Sowers, a spokesman for the division. Carter, who grew up in Spokane, Wash., also has received a Purple Heart. At the time of the battle, he was a specialist assigned to the Black Knight Troop of the 3rd Squadron, 61st Cavalry Regiment out of Fort Carson, Colo. He said he was still in his bunk when the 2009 battle started at about 6 a.m. Battle tested: Staff Sgt. Ty Carter poses for a photo in Afghanistan, Carter will be awarded the Medal of Honor in August . 'That position was attacked so often that you get used to waking up to machine gun fire,' he said. Carter said he realized it was a serious attack as soon as he stepped through the door of his barracks. ""Concrete, sand, everything was spitting back at me because of the rounds coming in,"" he said. 'I stepped back and got a running start.' He calmly detailed joining the other soldiers and resupplying them with ammunition under heavy fire. Together again: U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Ty Carter and his wife, Shannon Carter, talk to reporters . With his wife, Shannon, holding his hand, Carter paused to regain his composure while recounting seeing two fellow soldiers, Staff Sgt. Justin Gallegos and Sgt. Vernon Martin get hit by machine gun fire. Both were killed. He described seeing another, Spc. Stephan Mace, injured by shrapnel, crawling on his elbows. Carter said Sgt. Bradley Larson wouldn't let him immediately go to Mace because of the heavy firefighting, a decision that Carter is now certain saved his life, even though it was difficult at the time. 'It's very painful to see a good man suffer and then not be able to go to him when you know you can save him,' he said, emotion choking his voice. Later, with Larson providing cover fire, Carter was ultimately able to reach Mace, provide him first aid and get him to safety. Carter said that when they later learned that Mace had died from his wounds, 'there was a sorrow that went through the troop.' A struggle: Carter's wife Shannon told reporters that she has to remain strong 'to help him be strong' He said that if not for the actions of the other soldiers in his troop, and the reinforcements that later arrived during the 12-hour battle, 'I might not be here today to speak to you.' 'That day we were fighting as one team in one fight,' he said. In February, President Barack Obama bestowed the Medal of Honor on another survivor of that firefight, former Staff Sgt. Clinton Romesha. Carter, who served a second tour in Afghanistan last year, didn't attend, he said, because he was working through issues from the battle. 'I'm uncomfortable about being around the families of the fallen because I feel that I owe them so much,"" he said. 'I feel embarrassed to be in their presence because they have lost so much.' Hard fought: Carter suffered hearing damage, a concussion and absorbed shrapnel during the firefight . Carter said he's been in counseling for post-traumatic stress disorder since the battle, and he hopes to help other soldiers who have the same diagnosis from their military experiences. Shannon Carter told reporters that it's overwhelming to hear what her husband and fellow soldiers experienced. 'It's heart wrenching. It makes me cry,' she said, but she has to remain strong 'to help him be strong.' Ty Carter said he doesn't have any bitterness, instead choosing to focus on the fact that they were able to fend off the Afghan fighters in a situation 'where an impossible situation became possible.' 'That, I can't forget and I don't think anybody else can,' he said.","Staff Sergeant Ty Carter will receive the Medal of Honor on August 26 .

Our taste for grander and grander designs means we are being enticed through sellers' doors by granite kitchen surfaces, elaborate home entertainment systems, walk-in wardrobes and Smeg fridges - and savvy estate agents are focusing on these buzzwords to prick up our ears. Property listings are increasingly mentioning 'high-spec interiors', and of those which do the most common feature is underfloor . heating (63 per cent), while . over a quarter (27 per cent) boast of quality finishes such as granite work . surfaces and marble flooring. High-spec interiors such as Smeg fridges, marble floors, granite work tops and elaborate entertainment systems are enticing home buyers more and more . Other high-spec features noted include ceiling speakers (two per cent) and luxury fittings such as walk-in wardrobes and built-in entertainment centres (one per cent). The kudos of premium brands is also important, with two per cent of high spec homes listing either Smeg or Miele appliances as part of their marketed qualities. The research was compiled by insurance firm Aviva, who found that of the five million plus . properties for sale in the UK, some 257,000 are now . described as having a 'high-spec interior'. The analysis also showed that while 'ambience' remains an important factor for selling properties (mentioned in nearly two per cent of the five million listings analysed), estate agents are advocating the serene locations of flats and houses for sale, above their proximity to lively bars, cafes and restaurants. Would you buy a home for its proximity to good local schools, or for its ability to properly catalogue your clothes in a walk-in wardrobe? In nearly two-fifths (61 per cent) of homes described as having 'ambient features', the peaceful and tranquil location is highlighted, compared to only one in ten that mention local or country pubs (13 per cent). And despite the rise of local independent coffee chains, only 300 ambient properties list café culture as a selling point, and two thirds (72 per cent) of those mentions are located in Greater London. Interestingly, where schools are mentioned as a key feature, homes in the South East are most likely to use proximity as a selling point, while in the North East schools are only referenced as a selling point for two per cent of homes.

Over a quarter (28 per cent) offer a large garden, and seven per cent offer a 'beautiful or attractive garden'. The most favoured was a south-facing garden, featuring in over half (55 per cent) of property descriptions in the capital. Transportation is one of the less important features (mentioned in less than one per cent of the five million analysed listings), almost three quarters (72 per cent) of homes that reference transportation state that they are ideally located for an easy commute. Within this feature category, homes in the West Midlands (five per cent), Wales (five per cent) and the North East (four per cent) are least likely to list transport links. In nearly two-fifths of homes described as having 'ambient features', the peaceful and tranquil location is highlighted, compared to only one in ten that mention local or country pubs . Commenting on the research, Heather Smith, director of home insurance at Aviva said: 'We all fall in love with properties for different reasons, and while the character and charm of a home is a matter of personal taste, it seems that assets such as smart flooring and on-trend kitchen brands are as important to some buyers as transport links and schools. 'And with the pace of life so fast for many of us, it’s not surprising that home buyers are looking for a little refuge from their busy working lives and would prefer tranquillity to buzzing bars and local pubs. 'But whether you plump for marble flooring or laminate, walk-in wardrobe or flat-packed furniture make sure you can also afford to maintain the perfect home once you find it. 'And if you’re lucky enough to get some swanky fixtures and fittings as part of the purchase, ensure you tell your home insurer so you can be certain you have the right cover to protect everything in your new home.'

Court Battle: Helen Nicholas, 45, is fighting for the right to stay in the forces home she shared with her husband after he left her . The ex-wife of an RAF squadron leader has launched a legal battle against the Ministry of Defence - claiming its bid to remove her from her forces home after her husband left her breaches her human rights. Helen Nicholas, 45, lived at the three-bedroom Government-owned property in Bushey Heath, Watford, for eight years with her husband, Squadron Leader Andrew Nicholas. But after the couple separated and Mr Nicholas moved out of their home in 2007, Mrs Nicholas was told she no longer had a right to live in the property. The MoD then obtained a court possession . order in 2010, but Mrs Nicholas refused to leave and has . been effectively squatting in the property since. Mrs Nicholas is now contesting the order in the High Court in the first case of its kind. Her lawyers argue that removing Mrs Nicholas from the property would amount to discrimination and . breach her right to respect for her home and private life. The court heard the property was purchased by the government in 1996 to house an overspill of RAF personnel and their families. But Mrs Nicholas's counsel, Toby Vanhegan, insisted the . MoD does not need the house for another services family to live in and just wants to 'sell it without a sitting . tenant'. He added that she potentially faces life . on the street if evicted, because Hertfordshire County Council do not . class her as a local resident, and will not give her housing priority . due to her semi-itinerant status as a forces wife. 'Mrs Nicholas has lived at the property . for over eight years, has gone through difficult divorce proceedings, . has no other accommodation and risks being street homeless if evicted . from the property. She is unlikely to obtain assistance as a homeless . person,' the barrister said. Jonathan Davey, for the MoD, told the judge that Mrs Nicholas only ever had a right to live in the house under a 'licence' granted to her husband alone, and that was lawfully revoked after he moved out. For RAF personnel only: Helen Nicholas and her husband Andrew Nicholas lived in the property in Bushey Heath, Watford, pictured for eight years but the MoD said she no longer has the right to live there after he moved out . 'In April 2007, Mr Nicholas moved out of the property following a breakdown in his marital relationship with his wife. The licence is stated to be entered into between the Defence Estates, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence, and Squadron Leader Nicholas. 'In the events that have occurred, including Mr Nicholas permanently leaving the property and the MoD serving notice, the licence has been terminated,' the barrister insisted. He said that the MoD’s stance is backed by legislation and denied that its aim is to get Mrs Nicholas out merely to ease the sale of the house or get a better price for it. 'Our aim is to recover possession of the property in order to fulfil a key aspect of the MoD’s statutory functions, namely providing accommodation to servicemen and servicewomen,' he added. Recognising the wide importance of the case, Mr Justice Burton reserved his decision until an unspecified later date. Mrs Nicholas, who was has been married to her husband for 15 years, said outside court: 'The council don’t see me as a local resident because I come from a services family, so they won’t give me any priority for housing even if I become homeless.'","Helen Nicholas, 45, lived at the property for RAF personal with her husband .

Working in dark, cramped conditions in barren deserts often attacked by fierce sandstorms, these pictures show the brutal and uncompromising work of Sudan's gold miners. Supported by weak-looking pulleys, workers lower themselves into the deep, dark mines, which appear like huge crevasses in the middle of the desert. As those on the surface battle brutal storms and temperatures reaching 44C to hunt for gold with detectors, others lower themselves into the dangerous underground pits. Tough conditions: A gold mine worker searches for gold inside a local mine in Al-Ibedia locality at River Nile State in Sudan . Cramped: The man works in tough, cramped conditions in unremitting heat. He uses basic tools to dig for gold, barely able to turn his body . Difficult: This picture shows just how dark and claustrophobic the conditions are below ground . Using flimsy-looking pulleys, gold mine workers lower themselves into the deep  mines, left. Once inside, and wearing just basic headlamps, they search for the precious commodity. This man, right, displays a gold rock . The miners are part of a 60,000 strong workforce in South Sudan who take part in the back-breaking work, often because of widespread hunger. These images show miners working in the Al-Ibedia area at River Nile State. Miners are lowered into the pits on flimsy-looking pulleys held together by wood. The holes are so narrow, they can barely turn around. Wearing no safety jackets or helmets, the miners have just a headlamp to guide them in the bleak darkness. Once at the bottom of the mines, they use a variety of basic-looking tools to dig for the valuable commodity, in hot, and unremitting conditions. As the miners dig and search for long hours, above ground,  makeshift camps are created in which other workers prepare to deal with the findings from below. Fierce: Above ground, workers prepare for their day's work in shelters, which are often battered by brutal sandstorms . Basic: The mines appear as long, slim crevasses in the ground . The pulleys which the workers use to lower themselves down into are supported by planks of wood . Dangerous: The conditions are brutal, with the miners not wearing helmets or protective clothing . Valuable: The mines are dark and claustrophobic but the rewards for those who find gold are huge . Hard work: A gold mine worker lifts a bag down into one of the pits . Workers sift the earth, looking for any sign of gold. Others operate large gold crushing machines and weigh their findings to check on their value. Gold mining is big business in Sudan, particularly in the south. The land is endowed with many resources, many of which are undiscovered.  As well as gold, there is also believed to be copper, uranium and marble. But with this comes numerous problems, including smuggling. It was estimated recently that South Sudan loses $200m a year through gold smuggling. Temporary: The gold rocks which are discovered below ground are crushed by teams of workers in these makeshift camps . Hunt: Above ground, workers search for other areas to mine using detectors . Process: This man uses a gold crusher at the mine in Al-Ibedia to prepare the precious goods for sale . Search: The gold which is discovered below ground is sent to the top where it is sifted by another team of workers . This worker displays some of the findings . Windswept: Workers take shelter from a sandstorm in the tents, which are filled with various tools and instruments to help search for gold . Speaking to the Sudan . Tribune, the director general for mineral development, Arkangelo Okwang . Olerr revealed that about 17 kilograms of gold could leave the borders . of Eastern Equatoria state on a daily basis. 'In fact we did a rough calculation that if this was to have been . organised, I am sure we would have got in total say every year like $600 . million from this additional just local miners and applying taxation . rate of about 33% internationally we would have gotten about $200 . million on average,' he said. The authorities are now having to battle with illegal mining operations across many areas of the country. Officials . have warned they will soon deploy inspectors along with police to . areas suspected of illegal mining. Happy: Despite the work being tough, the rewards can be huge. These workers display large gold nuggets as they weigh them at the mine . Heavy: Large chunks of gold are weighed so workers can assess they value . Battle: Gold mining is fast turning into big business in Sudan. But the authorities are increasingly having to struggle to fight against smugglers . Preparations: Gold mine workers at the back of a truck take cover from the rain as they make their way to a local mine in River Nile State . Boost: The miners work long and brutal hours, so taking time out to eat food is important . Sandstorm: The conditions below ground are tough, but as this picture shows, it is often even worse on the surface . The government needs the money which . it generates as it looks for an alternative to oil, which currently . provides more than 90 per cent of the government's revenue. It is believed that about 60,000 people mine for gold in South Sudan. Many use their . bare hands which they once used to harvest crops.

The world is facing an 'economic time bomb' because of methane gases being produced by shrinking sea levels in the Arctic, researchers claim. There is a large amount of methane stored in the region around the East Siberian Sea and if it was suddenly released into the atmosphere it could change the Earth's climate causing extreme weather, flooding and drought. By using economic modelling, scientists from Cambridge and Rotterdam discovered . that if the Arctic ice levels continue to shrink at their current rate it could produce . enough methane to cause global climate change damage of £40 trillion - . the same size of the world economy in 2012. Scientists from Cambridge and Rotterdam have discovered that shrinking Arctic ice levels could produce enough methane to cause global climate change damage of £40 trillion. Methane released into the atmosphere could change the Earth's climate causing extreme weather, flooding and drought . The groundbreaking claims were made by Gail Whiteman from Erasmus University, Chris Hope, . Reader in Policy Modelling at Cambridge Judge Business School, . University of Cambridge, and Peter Wadhams, Professor of Ocean physics . at the University of Cambridge. They calculated - using an economic computer program called PAGE09 - that the thaw would release 50 . gigatonnes of methane into the air. If other factors, such . as ocean acidification are included, the cost would be much higher. Around 80 per cent of these costs caused by the damage will directly affect developing countries as they . experience more extreme weather, flooding, droughts and poorer health as . Arctic warming affects climate. It is said to be the first time researchers have calculated the potential economic impact of methane from the East Siberian Sea being released into the air as a result of the thaw. The researchers used an economic computer program called PAGE09 to calculate that the thaw of Arctic ice, pictured, would release 50 gigatonnes of methane into the air . Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Some gases remain in the atmosphere and don't react physically or chemically to changes in temperature. These gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, are described as 'forcing' climate change and contribute to the greenhouse effect and include: . Carbon dioxide is a small but important part of the atmosphere. It is released through natural processes including volcanic eruptions as well human actions such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels. Methane is a hydrocarbon gas produced through natural sources, such as the shrinking ice levels in the Arctic, as well as human actions including waste in landfills, agriculture and rice cultivation. Methane is considered a more active greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. If a large amount of methane was suddenly released into the air, it could bring the date at which the global average temperature rise exceeds 2 degrees Celsius by between 15 and 35 years. Although this constitutes just a fraction of the vast reservoirs of methane in . the Arctic, scientists believe that the release of even a small . proportion of these reserves could trigger possibly catastrophic climate . change. 'The global impact of a warming Arctic is an economic time-bomb,' said Whiteman. Wadhams added: 'The imminent disappearance of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will have enormous implications for both the acceleration of climate change, and the release of methane from off-shore waters which are now able to warm up in the summer. 'This massive methane boost will have major implications for global economies and societies.' Most discussions about a warming Arctic focus on increased oil-and-gas drilling and the opening up of new shipping routes that attract investments of hundreds of billions of dollars. The researchers added these economic discussions are missing the big picture on Arctic change and call for the World Economic Forum to invest in the further modelling needed to assess the true costs. They also want to encourage world leaders to 'consider the economic time-bomb beyond short-term gains from shipping and extraction.' The claims also suggest that the methane released by the shrinking levels would bring forward the date at which the global average temperature rise exceeds two degrees Celsius by between 15 and 35 years. Dr Chris Hope, of Cambridge University, added: 'In the absence of climate-change mitigation measures the model calculates it would increase mean global climate impacts by $60 trillion.'","Shrinking ice in the East Siberian Sea releases methane gas into the air .

George Osborne's controversial measure to boost the mortgage market could lead to another housing bubble, Vince Cable warned yesterday. The Government’s £130billion Help to Buy scheme could ‘inflate the market’ and push property prices even further out of reach of young families, said the Business Secretary. It launches next year and is designed to help more people get on the housing ladder by providing lower deposits and loans guaranteed by the taxpayer. Clash: Chancellor George Osborne (left) claims the scheme will help more people on to the property ladder and encourage a wave of new housebuilding but Vince Cable (right) voiced concerns of a house price boom . But Liberal Democrat Mr Cable said he shared the concerns of experts who warn that it could artificially raise house prices by making it easier to get a large mortgage. He told BBC1’s Andrew Marr programme: ‘Well I did warn about it and I am worried of the danger of getting into another housing bubble.’ Mr Cable said the scheme could be a ‘useful addition’ if it was ‘properly designed’ but added: ‘It could be a problem - it could inflate the market. ‘We mustn’t risk returning to the problems of the last decade when housing got out of control.’ The Business Secretary said the real problem was a lack of housing and claimed the current building rate of about 100,000 homes a year was ‘hopelessly inadequate’. Pros and cons: Critics have warned that the Help to Buy scheme risks creating a housing bubble by pushing up prices . Under Help to Buy, the state will underwrite mortgages to help people buy properties worth up to £600,000. Purchasers would need only a 5 per cent deposit, while the taxpayer guarantees up to 15 per cent of the loan. Chancellor Mr Osborne, who announced . the project in the budget, last week said it was ‘about getting behind . those who aspire to own a home’. The number of first-time buyers has soared to a six-year high after a revival in the property market, a report reveals. There . were 120,000 new homeowners in the first half of the year – a rise of a . fifth in 12 months and the biggest number since a peak of 181,500 in . 2007. But . a surge in house prices means 51 per cent of first-time buyers are . buying properties within the £125,000 stamp duty threshold – up from 44 . per cent in a year, says the Halifax. But warnings have been issued by experts, including former Bank of England Governor Lord King. The . Institute of Directors has also described the initiative as ‘very . dangerous’. Its chief economist Graeme Leach said: ‘The world must have . gone mad for us to now be discussing endless taxpayer guarantees for . mortgages. ‘They will . drive up prices when it seems likely that house prices are already . over-valued.’ There have also been concerns that the scheme could be . exploited by migrants from the EU. In . a wide-ranging interview, Mr Cable responded to concerns over the . viability of a high speed rail link between London, Birmingham and the . North following news that its projected cost has soared by £10billion to . more than £40billion. He . insisted that ministers were not considering cancelling the project and . said its design could change to bring more benefits to the country. Mr . Cable, who has been notoriously uncomfortable in coalition with the . Tories, also insisted the Lib Dems would compete ‘independently’ at the . next election. ‘We are equidistant between the other two parties,’ he said.","Business Secretary said it ‘could be a problem’ if not properly designed .

Shortly after moving into their stunning Suffolk barn conversion, Bob and Nora Hutchinson were enjoying a rerun of the BBC TV show Lovejoy when their own living room suddenly appeared on the screen. Roguish antique dealer Lovejoy, played by the actor Ian McShane, was kissing his girlfriend beneath  the distinctive vaulted ceiling of their six-bedroom home. ‘It was unmistakably our drawing room because of the beams,’ says Nora, 63. ‘Later we saw the camera pan out as Lovejoy drove off down our gravel drive and there was a shot of the house itself.’ Dramatic setting: The timber-clad converted Hall Barn, pictured, is set in idyllic 1.6-acre grounds, which include a pond, in Preston St Mary, Suffolk . This was the moment when the Hutchinsons discovered that their home had a starring role in a show that had always been one of their favourites. They had bought the house for £735,000 in 2006, several years after the television crews moved on. The Sunday night staple, which ran for eight years from the late 1980s and regularly drew 15 million viewers at its peak, was set in East Anglia, and was mostly filmed around Suffolk and Essex. The picture it painted of English country life was as much a part of its charm as Lovejoy himself sniffing out a valuable heirloom. Hall Barn was the fictional home of auctioneer Charlotte, played by Caroline Langrishe, Lovejoy’s girlfriend in series five and six, which aired in 1993 and 1994. Spacious: Bob and Nora Hutchinson have decided to put Hall Barn on the market as they are downsizing . It’s easy to see why the property appealed to the producers. Located in the sleepy village of Preston St Mary, two miles from the medieval town of Lavenham, it is full of interesting features, with red-brick fireplaces, stone floors and beamed doorways. ‘We later found out that the television crew virtually camped out in the village pub for two years because so much of the series was filmed in and around here,’ says Nora. The barn itself dates from 1520 but a previous owner converted it into a home in 1989. With a red-brick and weather-boarded facade, it is set in idyllic 1.6-acre grounds, which include a pond, summerhouse and stables. ‘It was converted before building regulations were brought in restricting the number of windows, so it’s very light and bright, and has great height, which must have been perfect for filming,’ says Bob, 62, who sold his successful chain of opticians in 1999 and is now  a business consultant for firms including Specsavers. Hall Barn was the fictional home of Lovejoy's onscreen girlfriend Charlotte, played by Caroline Langrishe pictured with star of the show Ian McShane, for series five and six which aired between 1993 and 1994 . The couple, who have both been married before and have six daughters and nine grandchildren between them, have spent about £100,000 on the property. They converted the former coach-house into a luxurious master bedroom suite, with floor-to-ceiling glass doors leading on to the garden, and a roomy en suite bath and shower room. They also installed a Sonos sound system with built-in speakers in the drawing room, dining room, bedroom, bathroom and garden. Bob and Nora have put the property on the market for £975,000 as they are downsizing. Estate agent Alex Davies, of David Burr, says prices in this region of Suffolk have steadily increased over the past couple of years but haven’t quite recovered to 2007/08 levels. ‘Property is moving and usually selling for the asking price,’ he adds. He points out that the area is popular with retirees moving further out from London and Essex, although some younger buyers are prepared to brave the 90-minute commute to the capital from Stowmarket station. The Hutchinsons spend almost half the year at their three-bedroom home in Florida, and have decided to look for a smaller house closer to Lavenham.","Hall Barn was the fictional home of .

But the erotic fiction by E L James may never have become so acceptably mainstream if it wasn't for sales first taking off via eBooks. Launching on this platform gave the novels a massive sales boost with readers who wanted to indulge in the saucy content - but didn't want anyone else to know what they were reading. Discreet: With an eBook reader, people can download porn and erotic fiction without fear of anyone else knowing . Surge in popularity: The 'Fifty Shades effect' has made erotic fiction more acceptable to read . And now the same effect has led to a boost in popularity in other sexually explicit novels on Amazon - where it seems anything goes from incest to 'monster sex'. No sneers or leers: EBooks allow readers to buy porn without being embarrassed . And it's not just downloading of the books that has increased, more are being written and shared - many by women using a pseudonym - via Amazon's self-publishing service. One such writer is 'Venus Santiago' whose titles include 'From Assassin to Sex Slave' and 'Accidental Milkmaid'. She told The Atlantic that she had to stop buying pornographic books from shops in the Nineties because of the sneers - and leers - of shop assistants. But now she, and other women like her, can read what they please without anyone being any the wiser. She said: 'The beautiful thing about buying porn on Kindle is that nobody sneers at you. It's just you, Amazon, and your personal mobile device. 'You can read it on the train or subway, at home, wherever, and no one has any idea what you're ogling. Which removes most of the outside negative social pressure that prevents a lot of women who are interested in porn from buying it in the mainstream places.' While books like Venus's are becoming more popular thanks to the discretion of eBooks, she, and other writers like her, believe their sales would be even higher if Amazon would promote them more. However, in line with them being seen as a family-friendly, accessible-to-all retailer, the brand are not keen to promote novels of a pornographic nature. As a result, titles like those written by Venus cannot be found on their homepage or in their 'items to consider' suggestions. They also filter their search function so these books will never appear unless purposefully sought out. In fact, their rules on self-publishing state that the do not accept any pornographic content at all. They state on the website: '(We) do not accept pornography or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts... what we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect.' This has left writers such as Venus and another under the pseudonym 'Kinukitty' frustrated that their sales could be even higher if promoted more on Amazon. Self-published porn: Amazon state they do not accept pornography but these are some of the explicit books currently on sale via their website . Kinukitty told The Altlantic: 'Erotica, as a genre, has been Amazon's dirty little secret from the beginning, driving sales of the Kindle to astronomical numbers. Does Amazon really believe that it was all the free copies of 'Huckleberry Finn' and 'Moby Dick' ... that drove readers to buy Kindle devices? Nope, sorry. It was erotica. It was 'porn'.' However, while the writers may not be happy, The Atlantic argue that it is Amazon's reluctance to embrace and promote the genre that is appealling to porn consumers. They write: 'Women (and men, too) who want to read porn on the Kindle don't want to be buying their porn from some place that screams porn! Amazon's advantage as a seller of porn is precisely that it sells lots of things that aren't porn, and that it is known primarily for selling things that aren't porn.'","Readers enjoy discretion of downloading sexually explicit eBooks .

Major League Baseball . is threatening to kick Alex Rodriguez out of the game for life unless . the New York Yankees star agrees not to fight a lengthy suspension for . his role in the sport's latest drug scandal, according to a person . familiar with the discussions. The person spoke to The Associated Press on Wednesday on condition of anonymity because no statements were authorized. Whether . Commissioner Bud Selig would actually issue a lifetime suspension was . unclear and a permanent ban could be shortened by arbitrator Fredric . Horowitz to about 200 games, the person said. Ban: Alex Rodriguez faces the possibility of a lifetime ban from baseball as he continues to fight doping allegations . The number of players likely to be disciplined stood at 14 Wednesday. Front . and center is Rodriguez, baseball's highest-paid player and the most . prominent one linked in media reports over the past seven months to . Biogenesis of America, a closed Florida anti-aging clinic that allegedly . distributed banned performance-enhancing drugs. The . Yankees expected Rodriguez to be accused of recruiting other athletes . for the clinic, attempting to obstruct MLB's investigation, and not . being truthful with MLB in the past. Baseball has considered suspending . him for violations of its labor contract and drug agreement. Even . if he is banned from baseball, there is precedent for a shortened . penalty: When pitcher Steve Howe was given a lifetime ban in 1992 in . his seventh suspension for drug or alcohol use, an arbitrator reduced . the penalty to 119 days. Stain on the Game: Major League Baseball says the players above are all tied to a Florida-based PED clinic . A three-time MVP, . Rodriguez acknowledged four years ago that he used performance-enhancing . substances while with Texas from 2001-03 but repeatedly has denied . using them since. He's been sidelined all . season since hip surgery in January and then a quadriceps strain during a . minor league rehabilitation assignment in July. The Yankees say he'll . start another rehab Friday - Double-A Trenton appeared to be the likely . destination. 'Hopefully Alex will be back shortly thereafter,' Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said. Rodriguez didn't stop to talk with reporters after his workout Wednesday at the team's minor league complex in Tampa, Fla. At . first, MLB and the union thought talks on the Biogenesis probe could be . completed by Friday, but negotiations to avoid grievances are likely to . push back announcements until at least Saturday or Sunday. The Commish: MLB Commissioner Bud Selig says he will seek a lifetime ban against A-Rod if he continues to fight his suspension . Others . accused in media reports of receiving performance-enhancing drugs from . Biogenesis include a trio of 2013 All-Stars: Texas outfielder Nelson . Cruz, San Diego shortstop Everth Cabrera and Detroit shortstop Jhonny . Peralta. Most of the players face 50-game bans . as first offenders. Both sides felt urgency to complete the process . because by the middle of next week, teams will have fewer than 50 games . left. And that would force players to complete suspensions during the . playoffs or at the start of next season. Detroit . general manager Dave Dombrowski protected against a possible suspension . of Peralta by acquiring slick-fielding infielder Jose Iglesias from . Boston in a three-team trade Tuesday night. 'If . it were a 15-day thing, like a typical injury, I think we could have . comfortably dealt with it with the players we already have,' Dombrowski . said Wednesday. 'But when you start to talk about 50 days and a possible . playoff run, we feel better going ahead with Jose.' Circus: The doping allegations have created a media circus around A-Rod that might be distracting - if he were actually playing . While . MLB told the union which players it intends to suspend, it hasn't . issued formal notices of discipline. Because of that, the countdown . hasn't started under baseball's Joint Drug Agreement, which says the . suspensions are effective on the third business day after the notice is . issued. The sides also haven't decided whether . suspensions for first-time offenders who challenge the penalty can be . announced before an arbitration decision. If some stars knew their seasons were about to be cut short, they weren't letting on Wednesday, at least publicly. 'I can't talk about nothing right now. Just wait for the news,' Cabrera said Wednesday before playing against Cincinnati. Peralta thinks he shouldn't be on the list of players linked to Biogenesis. 'It's wrong,' he said. 'But whatever happens, I need to fight and try to move on.' Charlie Hustle: Pete Rose was banned from baseball for life after it was revealed he gambled on games while manager of the Cincinnati Reds . Toronto . outfielder Melky Cabrera, Oakland pitcher Bartolo Colon and San Diego . catcher Yasmani Grandal were all suspended for 50 games last year for . positive tests for elevated testosterone. MLB informed the union they . won't receive additional discipline for that violation, two people . familiar with the probe said. They also spoke on condition of anonymity . because no statements were authorized. 'Nothing's . been told to me,' Melky Cabrera said. 'I served my suspension last . year, but MLB has never told me that it's OK now. I'm seeing it in the . press, but I don't know.' Texas was unable to find a replacement bat to fill a void a suspension of Cruz would create. 'I . don't think anybody's comfortable losing a significant part of your . club, but it's out of our control,' Rangers general manager Jon Daniels . said. 'We explored some deal like that. They just didn't come to a head. It wasn't for lack of interest or lack of effort. It was more lack of . supply and lack of fit, really.'","A-Rod is one of nine players Major League Baseball has linked to Florida-based PED distribution ring called Biogenesis of America .

White House spokesman Jay Carney doubled-down on President Obama's assertion that the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, Libya, was 'phony scandal' - just days after the mother of one of the victims of the brutal attack appeared on Fox News to express how outraged she was that the president would refer to the attack as 'phony.' For the last few weeks, 'phony scandals' has been one of the president's talking points when talking about the Benghazi attack as he criss-crosses the country giving speeches in support of his new economic plan. 'What we've seen, as time has passed and more facts have become . known, whether it's about the attacks in Benghazi and the talking points . or revelations about conduct at the IRS, that attempts to turn this . into a scandal have failed,' Carney said during a press briefing on Wednesday. Phony: President Barack Obama has begun referring to the Benghazi terrorist attack as a 'phony scandal' No Regrets: White House spokesman Jay Carney says the president stands by his statement that any scandal about the attack is 'phony' New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said in an interview with Fox News that the administration's latest comments are unacceptable. 'His recently calling these phony scandals, that, to me, is . incredibly wrong. It's misleading to the American people,' she said. Frustrated by the glacial pace of the investigation into the September 11, 2012, attack that killed four Americans - including Ambassador Chris Stevens - eight Republican lawmakers sent a letter to new FBI Director James Comey demanding he make the Benghazi probe a top priority. 'Rumors continue to swirl about the whereabouts of suspects involved . in the attack. The FBI continues to add pictures of potential assailants . to its website and asks the Libyan people to assist with identifying . the alleged perpetrators. We struggle to understand why we don't know . more about those who attacked two U.S. compounds and murdered four brave . Americans,' they wrote.

This is simply unacceptable. We encourage . you to be aggressive in your investigation to properly hold accountable . those who attacked our compounds in Benghazi.' Last week, the mother of one of the men killed in the attack blasted the president for describing her son's death as 'phony.' 'I don’t believe him anymore. He’s wrong. My son is dead.

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:45 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 23:45 EST, 31 July 2013 . Microsoft is bringing a pared-down version of its Office software to Android phones. But don’t expect a version for your tablet, unless you use Microsoft’s Surface—the software giant won’t be releasing it for the iPad and Android tablet users out there . The company made the software available Wednesday through Google's online Play store. It requires a $100-a-year subscription to Office and won't be sold separately. New platform: Microsoft now offers its Office Mobile app for users of Android phones . The new offering follows the release of an iPhone version in June and brings an Office app to phones running the most widely used operating system on new smartphones. Like the other mobile versions, the new Android software is designed for lightweight use. For example, you can use it to view and edit an attachment sent by email. But it's not meant to create a complex spreadsheet from scratch. Microsoft Corp. is trying to make its Office 365 subscription more compelling, without removing an advantage that tablet computers running Microsoft's Windows system have — the ability to run popular Office programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint. 'The release of this app shows that we're committed to keep providing additional value for Office 365 subscribers,' the company wrote in a blog post. 'Office 365 subscribers will now be able to access, view, and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint documents with Windows Phone, iPhone and Android phones.' Just phones: Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer speaks at a Microsoft event in San Francisco, Monday July 16. Though the Office app is now available on Android phones, iPad users and Android tablat users still can't use the program . Microsoft is pushing subscriptions as a way to get customers to keep paying for a product that was historically sold in a single purchase. The company touts such benefits as the ability to run the package on multiple computers and get updates for free on a regular basis. However, a subscription can be more expensive than buying the package outright for just one or two computers. Microsoft said it designed Office Mobile for Android phones specifically for the phone's smaller screen, even though many people will prefer editing documents on a tablet's larger screen. The company has a version for iPads and Android tablets, called Office Web Apps, but that runs on a Web browser and requires a constant online connection. The new Android software is an app that gets installed on the phone and can work offline. With a subscription, customers typically get to use Office on up to 10 devices. Five of them can be Windows or Mac computers or Windows tablets. The other five can be iPhones or Android phones. Windows phones come with Office installed and do not count toward the limit. In failing to make a version for the iPad, the top-selling tablet computer, Forrester Research analyst J.P. Gownder has estimated that Microsoft is potentially ceding $1.4 billion a year in revenue, based on 10 percent of the 140 million iPad owners paying for a $100 subscription. Gownder said failure to provide it on the iPad or Android tablets gives incentives for users to explore competing offerings such as QuickOffice from Google and iWork from Apple. Technically, iPad users can download the iPhone version, but it doesn't take advantage of the larger screen, so images and text are fuzzy when blown up. Android tablet owners won't be able to download it at all through the Play store. The new software requires Android 4.0 or later — the Ice Cream Sandwich or Jelly Bean flavors of Google's operating system. At first, it's available only in the U.S., though Microsoft plans to expand to 117 markets with versions in more than 30 languages. Microsoft did not announce any plans for BlackBerry phones.","Google's Play store now offers Microsoft office for Android phones .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:33 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:33 EST, 1 August 2013 . Casey Anthony has agreed to pay $25,000 to her bankruptcy estate to avoid having to write her life story. A judge in her bankruptcy case approved the agreement between Anthony and her bankruptcy trustee in papers made public Wednesday. The trustee had considered the possibility of selling Anthony's life story to help pay off her debts to creditors. Anthony had opposed the idea. Casey Anthony, pictured in March, has agreed to pay $25,000 to her bankruptcy estate to avoid having to write her life story . Anthony was acquitted two years ago of murdering her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. A jury believed Anthony’s version of . events that Caylee had accidentally drowned and she had panicked and . buried the girl. Papers . filed in bankruptcy court say the compromise was reached to avoid . protracted litigation over whether the trustee could legally force . Anthony to write her memoirs. News of the compromise comes a month after Anthony claimed a small victory in which a bankruptcy judge granted in part her request to dismiss a lawsuit against. The lawsuit was filed by a volunteer group that spent thousands of dollars looking for her . daughter. In documents . provided by the court, Texas EquuSearch stated that the 27-year-old . enlisted the organization’s help in the search for Caylee even . though she knew at the time the two-year-old girl was dead. EquuSearch founder Tim Miller said . his search and rescue organisation racked up bills of $119,000 to send . volunteers to Orlando, Florida, to help in the search for Anthony's . missing daughter Caylee. A total of 4,200 volunteers descended on Orlando in the summer of 2008 to help scour woodland and swamp areas for the missing two-year-old after Anthony finally reported her missing. The toddler's badly decomposed body was eventually found in December 2008 leading to a first degree murder charge. Claim: Texas EquuSearch stated that the 27-year-old enlisted the organization’s help in the search for Caylee in 2008 even though she knew at the time the two-year-old girl was dead . EquuSearch was in the process of suing Anthony when she filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. Judge K. Rodney May partially granted Anthony’s motion to dismiss, giving Texas EquuSearch 21 days to amend its complaint against Anthony, reported NBC News. In June her lawyers said she could be at risk of 'disappearing' if the defamation cases against her continue. The 27-year-old from Florida has been accused of slandering two people by implicating them in the death of her daughter. But she is seeking to have their lawsuits dropped, claiming she does not have enough money to pay damages. Lifestyle: Since Anthony's release from the Orange County Jail in July of 2011, seen here, she says she's been living with friends and with the help of gifts from strangers . Anthony is being sued by Roy Kronk, the workman who found Caylee's body after the two-year-old had been missing for six months, who says he has been accused of wrongdoing over the toddler's death. She also faces a suit from Zenaida Gonzalez, a woman with the same name as a fictional nanny who Anthony originally claimed had kidnapped Caylee. However, both cases were paused in January when Anthony filed for bankruptcy. Her lawyers are now seeking to have the suits dismissed, filing papers in Orange County Circuit Court claiming that Anthony could go into hiding as a result of her legal struggles, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 'She will either defend the cases or be forced to default because she has no money,' they wrote. 'She will be lampooned in the press. The death threats will again increase. 'She will be forced to find new accommodations, or just simply disappear and say it is not worth the fight anymore.' Anthony, who was widely vilified at the time of her trial for murder, has barely been seen in public since being acquitted of killing her daughter. She claims to be nearly $800,000 in debt thanks to heavy legal fees, and a bankruptcy trustee has sought to sell off the rights to her life story in order to pay her bills. Although Anthony was found not guilty of murder in 2011, she was convicted of lying to police after it emerged that she had made up her explanation of why Caylee was missing.","Anthony's bankruptcy trustee had considered the possibility of selling her life story .

A former financial analyst declared proudly that he 'personally carried out (the) executions' of two truckers in Dallas 15 years ago just minutes before he died snoring on Wednesday evening following a lethal injection. Douglas Feldman, 55, was executed for the road-rage shooting deaths of Robert Everett, 36, of Marshfield, Montana, and Nicholas Valesquez, 62, of Irving. Feldman mimicked a judge or jury announcing a verdict, using the names of his victims and declaring he had found them guilty of crimes against him. 'I have sentenced them both to death. I personally carried out their executions,' he said in a loud voice minutes before his death, adding that he carried out their executions in August 1998. 'As of that time, the state of Texas has been holding me illegally in confinement and by force for 15 years,' Feldman said. 'I hereby protest my pending execution and demand immediate relief.' He appeared very nervous, breathing quickly and his feet twitching under a sheet. As the drug began taking effect, he grimaced twice, took a few deep breaths and began snoring. Then all movement stopped. Still fuming: Fifteen years after a pair of North Texas road-rage killings put Douglas Feldman onto death row, the rage still appears to exist. Feldman was pronounced dead 13 minutes after the lethal drug was injected at 6:28 p.m. CDT. Feldman's . attorney, Robin Norris, filed a clemency petition with the Texas Board . of Pardons and Paroles that was turned down Monday. Multiple courts, . including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected his appeals on . Feldman's behalf. Multiple courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected his appeals on Feldman's behalf. Feldman, . from Richardson, was riding his motorcycle the night of Aug. 24, 1998, . and said Everett, driving an 18-wheeler, cut him off on a Dallas County . freeway so he took out his 9 mm pistol, pulled up alongside the truck . cab and shot him. Feldman testified at his capital murder trial that he . was still angry about 45 minutes later when he spotted Valesquez, a . gasoline tanker driver filling a Dallas service station, and shot him. 'A . security camera catches him shooting the man in cold blood,' Jason . January, the former Dallas County assistant district attorney who . prosecuted him, said. 'Several counties were frightened as this . unidentified motorcyclist was out acting like ""The Terminator.""' Death chamber: Feldman was pronounced dead 13 minutes after the lethal drug was injected at 6:28 p.m. CDT. at a Texas death chamber, like that pictured . Feldman . was arrested more than a week later, after shooting and wounding a man . at a fast-food restaurant and driving off. A bystander saw the shooting . and reported his license plate number to police, who tracked him down . and found Feldman with two pistols and nearly 300 rounds of ammunition. Ballistics tests confirmed one of the guns was used in all three . shootings. 'It feels . wonderful to cause their death and to watch their pain,' he said in one . of 81 letters he wrote to a former girlfriend while awaiting his trial. The writings from the magna cum laude Southern Methodist University . graduate were introduced into evidence. 'God . forbid I ever had my finger on the button to launch a nuclear explosive . device because I guarantee that I would wipe as many of these bastards . off the face of the planet as I am able!' he said in another letter. Without remorse, he also acknowledged the killings while testifying at his capital murder trial. Evidence . showed he got into trouble as a juvenile, had drug possession and . selling issues and wound up in state custody. He also had robbery and . drug convictions. First victim: This is the scene of the first murder committed by Mr. Feldman . While in . prison, records show Feldman racked up 136 disciplinary cases, including . one for ripping out the phone in a visiting cage where death row . inmates are interviewed by reporters. Texas prison officials . subsequently refused him media access. The day before the fatal shootings, evidence showed he shot up a Volkswagen dealership where he once had some work done. 'His . statement just showed more of the heart of the man,' John Everett said . after witnessing the execution of his brother's killer. 'Very dark and . very evil and very unremorseful.' 'I . was 12 when it happened,' Robert Everett's daughter, Emily, said. 'Now . I'm grown, married, with kids, and my dad didn't get to see any of that. I feel my dad finally has justice after 15 years.' Feldman . became the 11th prisoner executed this year in Texas and third this . month. At least seven other inmates are scheduled to die in the coming . months in the nation's busiest capital punishment state. Texas . Department of Criminal Justice officials declined to make Feldman, 55, . available to reporters ahead of his scheduled Wednesday evening execution, because of his continued rage. Psychotic: Mr. Feldman said he would kill the journalist interviewing him, his cameraman and another man off camera if he had a gun . One media . session several weeks ago never even began, because he ripped the . telephone from the visiting cage outside death row and became . disruptive. It was among the 136 disciplinary cases Feldman's . accumulated in prison. 'He's . a memorable character, a dangerous person in any setting,' Jason . January, the former Dallas County district attorney who in 1999 . prosecuted Feldman for capital murder, said earlier this week. 'He threatened to kill me . personally.' The dead man's two truck . driver victims were killed about 45 minutes apart on August 24, 1998. Prosecutors said Feldman became enraged after Everett cut him off, so he . shot him and then later, simply because he was still angry, shot . Velasquez. Feldman was the 503rd inmate to be put to death in Texas since reinstatement. Feldman's . attorney, Robin Norris, filed a clemency petition with the Texas Board . of Pardons and Paroles that was turned down Monday. Multiple courts, . including the U.S. Supreme Court, earlier rejected Norris' appeals on . Feldman's behalf. At . Feldman's murder trial, prosecutors produced evidence of numerous . confrontations initiated by Feldman, including one where he jumped on . the hood of another driver's car, smashed it with hammer, and then used . the hammer to beat the windshield, a door and the driver. 'I have come to hate every single . person on this planet with all my heart and soul,' he told a former . girlfriend in one of 81 letters to her while awaiting trial. 'If I had a . button which would kill every single person on this planet, I would . push it with no hesitation whatsoever!' Evidence . showed Feldman was riding his Harley-Davidson bike on U.S. Highway 75 . just north of Dallas when the 18-wheeler driven by Everett passed and . then pulled into Feldman's lane. Feldman was enraged, pulled out his . pistol and fired several shots at the back of the truck trailer. Then he . reloaded and pulled up alongside the truck cab. 'I chased Mr Everett down and I shot him to death,' Feldman testified at his trial. 'I felt like I needed to stop that man.' Eleven miles later, and after circling back to make sure Everett was dead, Feldman spotted Velasquez, driver of an Exxon fuel tanker, replenishing tanks at a Dallas gas station. 'I exploded again in anger,' he testified. 'I drove by and shot him. It was just acting out. I felt emotionally compelled and consumed by anger.' 'I have found it quite pleasurable to kill those two men,' he said in another letter to his ex-girlfriend. The day before the fatal shootings, evidence showed he shot up a Volkswagen dealership where he once had some work done. Feldman was arrested about a week later after shooting a man outside a fast-food restaurant.","Douglas Feldman killed two truck drivers 45 minutes apart from each other in 1998 .

San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has launched an extraordinary defence against allegations he sexually harassed a former employee - by claiming he never received sexual harassment training. The 70-year-old has been accused by his former communications director  Irene McCormack Jackson of sexually harassing her multiple times. She is one of eight women who have come forward recently with allegations of unwanted sexual advances. Accused: San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has launched an extraordinary defence against allegations he sexually harassed a former employee - by claiming he never received sexual harassment training . Jackson sued the mayor and the city on July . 22, alleging the mayor asked her to work without panties, demanded . kisses, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her in a . headlock while whispering in her ear. But it has now emerged that lawyers representing Filner have claimed that if San Diego had provided mandatory sexual harassment training, then Jackson may never have filed the case. The claims suggest that if Filner is found liable in the claim, he could blame his own city council. As reported by NBC 7, in a letter, Filner’s lawyer Harvey Berger, said: 'The City has a legal obligation to provide sexual harassment training to all management level employees. The City failed to provide such training to Mayor Filner. 'This is not an excuse for any inappropriate behavior which may have occurred, but I have learned that many – if not most – people do not know what is and what is not illegal sexual harassment under California law.' On Tuesday, San Diego City Council twice voted unanimously to make Filner responsible for all the expenses in his sexual harassment suit. Action: Irene McCormack Jackson, the mayor's former director of communications Jackson sued the mayor and the city on July 22 . The council is attempting to distance itself from the leader of the nation's eighth-largest city amid mounting calls for his resignation. At its Tuesday night meeting, the City Council voted 9-0 to deny funds for Filner's legal expenses in the lawsuit filed by Jackson. City councilman Kevin Faulconer said: 'His employers, San Diego taxpayers, did not have to bail him out for the mess he created.' Earlier in the day in a closed session, the Council voted 9-0 to have the city sue Filner to require that he pay all costs incurred by the lawsuit, which names the city as a defendant in addition to Filner. 'If Bob Filner engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable, he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees,' City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said. Seven of nine City Council members have urged Filner, the city's first Democratic leader in 20 years, to resign. Since Jackson filed her lawsuit, seven other women have . offered detailed accounts of Filner's alleged advances, including . touching and forcible kisses. Veronica 'Ronne' Froman (front left), Sharon Bernie-Cloward (front right), Joyce Gattas (back left), and Patti Roscoe (back right) all told their stories of harassment . Lisa Curtin, director of government and military education at San Diego City College, said on KPBS-TV Tuesday that the then-congressman asked her in 2011 to remove her wedding band after questioning whether it was real, asked her on a date and moved to kiss her. She said she felt his tongue on her cheek after she turned her head. 'The City of San Diego maintains a zero tolerance policy as to sexual harassment and sexual harassment is not within the course and scope of employment,' according to the city's lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court. The mayor's office and his attorney, Harvey Berger, didn't immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Ann Ravel, chairwoman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, said an official cannot accept more than $440 a year in donated services. Campaign money can be used only to defend against alleged violations of the state's campaign finance law. An official can, however, create a legal defense fund under state law, Ravel said. Filner, . who is divorced, said Friday he would enter two weeks of 'intensive' therapy on August 5, defying calls from his own party leaders to resign. Promises: Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego speaks at a press conference on Friday announcing his intention to seek professional help for sexual harassment issues . The former 10-term congressman is less than eight months into a four-year term as mayor. Land-use surveyor Michael Pallamary published a newspaper notice Sunday to begin a recall bid, two days after gay rights activist and newspaper publisher Stampp Corbin did so. Pallamary accused Corbin of being a stealth supporter of the mayor and threatened to file a complaint with the San Diego County district attorney's office alleging election law violations. Pallamary said Corbin would make little effort to collect the more than 100,000 signatures needed to get a recall measure on the ballot, setting it up to fail and preventing another recall drive for six months. Corbin denied the accusation Tuesday, saying Pallamary or anyone else was welcome to join the recall drive. He . said he wouldn't pay anyone to collect signatures - a common practice . in California - but that anyone could visit his office to sign the . petition or pick up blank forms to circulate. Corbin, . who was appointed chairman of a city commission under Filner, declined . to say if he voted for Filner or how he would cast his ballot in a . recall. He said his motive was to bring swift resolution to the controversy. 'There's nothing going on in the city, in City Hall. Everyone is focused on this scandal. That is not good for this city,' he said. Confusion over whether recall petitions can circulate concurrently isn't the only procedural flaw uncovered since the mayor came under pressure to resign. The city attorney's office says a rule that voters must cast a ballot on a recall to be eligible to pick a replacement should be repealed because a federal judge struck down a nearly identical law during the successful 2003 recall of California Gov. Gray Davis. Tony Krvaric, chairman of the San Diego County Republican Party, said Friday that he didn't expect big GOP donors or business leaders to make significant donations to a recall.

"By . Associated Press and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:21 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:54 EST, 1 August 2013 . A Catholic priest admitted to a psychiatrist he had molested more than 100 boys, including his 5-year-old brother, had sex with male prostitutes and visited gay strip clubs while serving in a Californian parish for years, according to explosive documents released overnight. Ruben Martinez's vile confessions are among nearly 2,000 pages of secret church documents on a dozen religious order priests, brothers and nuns accused of sexually . abusing children while working in the Los Angeles archdiocese over several decades. The papers, released under the terms of a $660 million settlement agreement reached in 2007, are the first glimpse at what religious orders knew about the men and women they posted in Roman Catholic schools and parishes around LA. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, which takes in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (pictured), has agreed to pay $660 million to 500 victims of sexual abuse dating back as far as the 1940s . The archdiocese itself released thousands of pages under court order this year for its own priests who were accused of sexual abuse, but the full picture of the problem remained elusive without the orders' records. Several dozen more files are expected to be released by the fall. The documents cover five different . religious orders that employed 10 priests or religious brothers and two . nuns who were all accused in civil lawsuits of molesting children. Among . them, the accused had 21 alleged victims between the 1950s and the . 1980s. Some of the files released . yesterday, including those of the nuns, don't mention sexual abuse at . all, and others appear to have large gaps in time and missing documents. Lead attorney for some abuse victims, Ray Boucher, said the files don't detail all the abuse which happened . The release included documents from the Oblates, the Marianists, the Benedictines and two orders for religious sisters. That the files don't reflect some of the alleged abuse doesn't mean it didn't happen, said Ray Boucher, lead attorney for some abuse victims. 'Much of this went unreported. You're talking about kids that were terrorized and frightened in so many different ways, with no place and no one to turn to,' he said. At more than 500 pages, 72-year-old Martinez's file is among the most complete, and it paints a devastating picture of a troubled and repressed child who later joined the priesthood to satisfy a domineering and devout father. The LA archdiocese settled eight lawsuits over Martinez's actions in 2007, but had little documentation on him in its own files even though the priest worked in its parishes for years in the 1970s and 1980s. However, his order file includes . graphic details described in therapy notes and psychiatric evaluations. It also reveals the years of effort — and tens of thousands of dollars — . the Oblates spent trying to cure him of his self-admitted pedophilia as . it shuttled him between programs, including inpatient treatment. In 1965, Martinez took his final vows . for a religious order called the U.S. Province of the Missionary Oblates . of Mary Immaculate, a nearly 200-year-old Catholic organization with . roots in France. In 1969, he was ordained as a priest and assigned by . his order to a small parish in Brawley, Caliornia. In . a 1993 psychiatric report — one of several such evaluations done . between 1991 and 2005 by various treatment programs — the priest . admitted to molesting children beginning in 1970, when he began playing . 'giddy up' games with young boys on his lap. In the documents, Martinez says he . stopped 'direct sexual contact' with boys after a mother complained to a . pastor in 1982 and that he stopped touching boys altogether after . another complaint in 1986. It's . unclear whether his religious order or the archdiocese was aware of . those complaints, but around the same time as the first complaint, . Martinez began weekly therapy sessions. He entered a counseling program . for people with sexual compulsions after the second complaint in 1986. Archbishop of Los Angeles Archdiocese Cardinal Mahony (left), pictured outside California's Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, has defended his handling of sexual abuse complaints . In 1991, he received five months of inpatient psychological treatment from a center in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, that specialized in treating troubled priests. Upon his release, Martinez was assigned to a tiny parish in the remote town of Westmorland, California, in the far southeastern corner of the state. While there, he would drive miles to San Diego to pick up male prostitutes, according to his file. He was removed from parish ministry in 1993, enrolled in a sex offender program and sent to live and work at the order's California headquarters in Oakland after another complaint surfaced from his past. For the rest of his career, he filled administrative roles. Calls to the U.S. Province of the Oblates and emails to two attorneys representing Martinez and the three other Oblate priests whose files were released were not returned. Attorneys for the Benedictines and Marianists and a representative from the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus also did not return calls. Carolina Guevara, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles archdiocese, did not address the current file release specifically but said religious orders are expected to make sure the priests they present for ministry in the archdiocese don't have any history of sex abuse. One man who sued over Martinez's abuse said the priest molested children after he was assigned to his hometown parish in Wilmington, a working-class city south of LA, in 1972. The man, now 50, requested anonymity because he is well-known in his professional life and has not spoken publicly about his case before. AP does not publish the names of victims of sexual abuse without their consent. 'He would have us wrestle each other and then wrestle with him, which means we'd get down into our skivvies and he'd take pictures of us. He was always taking pictures,' the man said. 'I just remember the smell of the old Polaroid flash cubes. He would go through them like crazy.' The man received a settlement in 2007 from the archdiocese. Martinez was never charged criminally; most of his alleged abuses weren't reported until years later. Abuse victims Jim Robertson, right, and Rita Milla, left, hold a quilt bearing the portraits of abused children outside the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, California, in February . The man said Martinez always had a group of young boys around him and would take them to see R-rated movies and on group trips. One summer day, he recalled, the priest took six boys to a local amusement park, but stopped on the way at an apartment where another man lived. Martinez and the man went inside with one of the boys and left the other five in the car for several hours. When the trio came back, the boy was sobbing and didn't stop for hours. Martinez has a most recent address at the Oblate Mission House in Oakland, California. No one answered the door there and a call was not returned yesterday. A receptionist at a Missouri retreat home for troubled priests — another possible place where Martinez could be living — would not say if he was there. In 2003, after a decade in at the order's California headquarters, Martinez was moved to the Oblates' offices in Washington, D.C., where he worked answering phones and in the archives. There, his files show, he was reprimanded for making off-color, sexual jokes that offended several women and, later, for looking at sexually suggestive pictures of young boys on the Internet and downloading a floppy disk filled with 'references to topics dealing with the gay lifestyle'. 'I don't know who else has time to monitor him, or to what 'safe' place we could assign him,' the Reverend Charles Banks, the vicar provincial and director of personnel for the Oblates wrote in an exasperated memo in 2003. The file shows that Martinez was sent to the Missouri retreat home for troubled priests in 2005. In a psychiatric assessment dated that same year, Martinez said he hadn't had sexual contact with a child in 23 years and had learned to control his impulses. The same report notes that at age 13, Martinez sexually molested his little brother and went on to molest 'about 100 male minors' — a detail also included in several others therapy evaluations in the file. 'It has not been easy to face what I did, to admit it and to talk about it with others,' Martinez wrote to the order's provincial in 2006. 'I have had to deal with depression, self-hatred, the inability and unwillingness to forgive myself, and the desire and tendency to isolate.'","Secret Catholic church files exposing decades of child sexual abuse were released overnight .

More than 2,000 gravestones in Hawaii's Punchbowl Cemetery are marked 'Unknown' - signifying unidentified soldiers who perished in World War II. When historian Rick Stone was hired by the agency tasked with identifying these soldiers in 2011, he was eager to provide peace for the families with a grave marker of their own to visit. Stone spoke with NBC News about his one year at the Joint Prisoner of War/Missing in Action Command (JPAC) in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, where he was only met with resistance as he tried to do his job. The departed: Over 2,000 grave sites in Hawaii's Punchbowl cemetery remain unmarked despite the advances of DNA testing to identify the lost WWII soldiers . Now the organization is facing . criticism from congress after a Government Accountability Office report . found that the effort to identify the 83,000 unknown World War II . soldiers worldwide is 'acutely dysfunctional.' Commander of JPAC Major General Kelly McKeague will testify before congress today in a hearing on agency mismanagement. In one case, Stone is '100 per cent' sure who the man is below the unknown grave marker. Stone . was reviewing a 70-year-old case on 'Seaman Elm' a man who was killed . in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The . sailor had gone down with the USS Arizona, and authorities believes his . last name was Elm since he had a lighter in his pocket with an engraving of that name. That's when Stone realized that the engraving wasn't a name, but initials - E.L.M. Day of infamy: Many of the unknown soldiers were lost in the December 7, 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Stone turned his attention to the missing who had those exact initials. Only two servicemen met that description, and one of them was already identified. That left Earl Leroy Morrison, a first-class seaman from Montana who was on the Arizona. Stone reported his find to the JPAC Central Identification Lab in April 2012 to disinter the body for DNA testing, but the lab still hasn't responded to the request. They told him to try and get DNA from the family. 'It's a Catch-22. You can't talk to the families until you're sure, but how do you become sure until you talk with the families and get the DNA?' Stone said. Waiting for IDs: Stone believes he can identify the bodies of First-Class Seaman Morrison, left, and Second Lt. Aleneir, right, but the lab in Hawaii has not been helpful . He was met with even more outright hostility when he tried to identify soldiers lost on the island of Tarawa. Of the 513 presumed dead from that island, 103 are unknown. So he organized the unknowns by physical description: race, age, height, weight, hair color. Manila 3,744Punchbowl, Hawaii 2,079Ardennes 792Sicily-Rome 490Normandy 307North Africa 240Florence 217Lorraine 151Netherlands 107Luxembourg 101Brittany 97Henri-Chapelle 94Epinal 70Rhone 62Cambridge 24Suresnes 24 . One of the bodies stuck out to Stone because he was short. Anthropologists estimated the soldier was 5 feet 1.4 inches tall, between 23 and 24, Caucasian and 115 pounds with medium ash-brown hair. His pants also showed that he was a second lieutenant. Only two men could possibly match that height description, and one of them was only a private first class. The other, Second Lt Stanley Aleneir of New York was strikingly similar in physical description: 5 foot 3 and a half, Caucasian, 23, medium brown hair. There was no way to be as sure as he was with Seaman Morrison, but it was close enough to confirm with DNA evidence. Again the lab rejected his proposal. The first time he submitted his request it was denied for petty mistakes like a comma in the wrong place or because he used footnotes instead of end notes. The second time, lab officials said he was 'out of lane' by using biometrics to narrow down results. 'We're in no hurry to identify these individuals. They're not going anywhere,' was one response Stone received. An interesting comment considering JPAC made a goal to crank up identifications to 200 a year by 2015. The agency has been averaging 80 or fewer IDs in recent years. A Pentagon spokesman would not speak about the specific cases of Seaman Morrison or 2nd Lt Alenier with NBC News, but they did say that the agency has identified seven servicemen in 2013 and has approved all requests by staff this year.","There are over 83,000 unidentified World War II soldiers buried world wide .

On Wednesday Weiner along with several other candidates, including Bill Thompson and John Liu, attended a New York City Mayoral Candidates Forum at La Marina Restaurant, 348 Dyckman Street. But Weiner’s attention appeared to be elsewhere as he remained glued to his phone while his rivals spoke. He does of course have a lot on his mind, with Sydney Leathers basking in the spotlight following her sexting revelations and his spokeswoman Barbara Morgan launching an expletive-laden rant at an ex-intern who wrote an unflattering expose of his faltering campaign. Morgan remains adamant she won’t quit her job despite her behavior, but the sexting business just won’t go away. Even when Anthony Weiner puts his phone down he appears to remain preoccupied with it until he finally gets his turn to talk . Weiner finally gives his phone a break and addresses the audience and his rival candidates . Weiner was quizzed about his now notorious alias, Carlos Danger, on the campaign trail on Thursday. In his first live, on-air interview since news of his latest sexting scandal broke, Weiner told Univision’s Satcha Pretto that the bizarre alias was 'a joke between [him] and one person' (Leathers) and that he would 'not comment on it' further. Mayoral rival Rev. Erick Salgado has taken umbrage with Weiner over his choice name. Salgado said it was an insult to the Latino community and has demanded that Weiner apologize, reports Fox News. The underfire NYC mayoral hopeful also said he was happy for his critics to continue to look into his shady past, reports ABC. 'If people want to continue to look at my background and make fun of things in my personal life, they are welcome to,' he told the Spanish-language television station. It is an offer that few can resist, including Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who shared his medical opinion this week that Weiner is 'psychologically unfit' to be the mayor of New York City. 'Congressman King never wanted me to become mayor. I fight with him every single step of the way [on immigration overhaul] just like I will when I’m mayor. I’m not looking for Peter King’s vote. In fact, I’d be a little ashamed if I had it,' was Weiner's response to Pretto. Humiliation: New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner and his wife Huma Abedin attend a news conference in New York last month . Family and friends of Huma Abedin, 38, . Weiner's humiliated wife, have told People magazine that she began to . beat herself up because her husband returned to phone sex after they . stopped going to couple's therapy and their new baby began to take up . more of her time. However, after returning to counseling, . she now feels she and Weiner are closer than ever despite revelations he . continued to send lewd pictures of himself to women, including . 22-year-old Sydney Leathers, who has heaped embarrassment on Abedin by . making claims about her husbands sexual fetishes in her numerous media . appearances. While Abedin's decision to stand by her shamed husband in the wake of last month's latest episode has disappointed many of her would-be supporters, her friends claim in People that she stayed with her cheating husband for the sake of their child and to 'help' her husband. 'She was seriously thinking, 'Maybe I can't do this.' There was the possibility of leaving on the table,' one family member told the magazine. 'It would have been perfectly logical if she had said, 'I'm out of here,' said family friend, Rory Tahari to the magazine. 'Any woman could have understood that.' For Better: Huma Abedin (left - with her husband on their wedding day in 2010) decided to stay in her marriage to help Weiner and for their child Jordan (right) Fresh Revelations: New York City mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner admitted to sexting 22-year-old Sydney Leather's (right) Indeed, Abedin and New York mayoral candidate Weiner let their friends know that their marriage might end. Their friends let People magazine know that former Hilary Clinton political aide Abedin's suffered huge doubt about their marriage during a Hamptons vacation one year ago. 'All the parties they had once been invited to, Huma was now invited to but Anthony wasn't,' a family member said. 'It was a difficult time.' However, the worst was yet to come. Just one month later after the Hampton's debacle, Weiner confessed that as their marriage deteriorated he had returned to sexting women lewd pictures of himself. He also confessed to frequent phone sex with 22-year-old Sydney Leathers and sending pictures of himself to two other women under the pseudonym Carlos Danger. Loyal: Huma Abedin, alongside her husband, New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, speaks during a news conference at the Gay Men's Health Crisis headquarters, Tuesday, July 23, 2013, in New York . However, instead of leaving her husband, Abedin resolved to stay for the sake of their 19-month-old son. 'Huma has a very strong moral character, and she made a commitment for better or worse,' said Tahari. 'She never wanted Jordan to say to her, 'Why didn't you do everything you could to help Dad?' Despite her moral conviction to stay, friends and family have said that since the news broke of Weiner's continued sexting habit, Abedin has been trying to hide her tears from her son. 'He is the light in her life, and that's what she was focused on. She needed to pull herself together,' said one friend to People magazine.","Anthony Weiner found it difficult to resist the temptation of his cell phone during a mayoral event on Wednesday .

The U.S. government made three-quarters of requests to Twitter to reveal users' identities over the past six months, the microblogging site revealed in its latest transparency report. The San Francisco-based company is under greater pressure from governments to release its users' personal details, with requests rising 40 per cent compared to the previous six months. But with U.S. companies banned from revealing information requests made by the U.S. under the Patriot Act, the true total is likely to be much, much higher. Welcome to Twitter... The U.S. government made three-quarters of requests to Twitter to reveal users' identities over the past six months, the microblogging site revealed in its latest transparency report . Today the Guardian revealed details of another top secret U.S. National Security Agency programme which allows its spies to search through the online activities of millions of people with no prior authorisation. Twitter is not named in the report, which is based on leaked documents, but it is claimed the XKeyscore programme allows NSA staff to scour the emails, online chats and browsing histories of those targeted. Governments usually want the email or IP addresses tied to a Twitter account. The breakdown of the kinds of legal action used to compel Twitter to release users' personal information to the U.S. in the past six months . In one well-known case, a French court ordered Twitter in February to turn over information about an anonymous account that posted anti-Semitic tweets. Twitter, which had initially resisted by arguing that the data was stored beyond French jurisdiction in its California servers, ultimately complied in June. Explaining the numbers, the transparency report says: 'The United States leads the way, comprising 78 per cent of all requests received. 'Japan remains the second largest requester with a total of 8 per cent of overall requests, up from 6 per cent in July - December 2012. 'Brazil dropped from third overall in the last report to the number four spot with the United Kingdom moving up to number three, comprising 3 per cent of total requests received during the first half of 2013.' Efforts to censor Twitter content have also risen sharply, the company said. 'Over the last six months, we have gone from withholding content in two countries to withholding content (ranging from hate speech to defamation) in seven countries,' said Jeremy Kessel, Twitter's legal policy manager. Twitter was censored the most in Brazil, where courts issued orders on nine occasions to remove a total of 39 defamatory tweets. Increasing pressure: How the . number of information requests has increased over the . three transparency reports published since January 2012 - not including requests made under the U.S. Patriot Act, which the firm is . banned from revealing. Governments usually want the email or IP address linked to a particular account . Source: Twitter transparency report . Transparency reports such as the one published semi-annually by Twitter have been a particularly contentious issue in Silicon Valley in the wake of a series of leaks by former security contractor Edward Snowden. He alleged that major service providers including Google, Facebook and Microsoft systematically pass along huge troves of user data to the U.S. National Security Agency. The companies all deny the scope of Mr Snowden's allegations. They have asked the U.S. government for permission to reveal the precise number of national security requests they receive in order to publicly argue that their cooperation with the government has been relatively limited. In the first half of the year, authorities in Japan, another large Twitter user base, made 87 requests while U.K. agencies filed 26. The majority of the requests come in the form of court-issued subpoenas, Twitter said.","U.S. government made 902 requests for Twitter users' personal information between January and June .

Suspicious: Michele Catalano believes her family's Google searches caused a 'Joint Terrorism Task Force' to visit her house . A Long Island woman believes her family's recent Google searches caused a Wednesday morning visit by federal agents. Michele Catalano, a writer for Forbes, published an account of what happened on Medium today, saying six plain-clothes cops showed up at her home, and proceeded to interview her husband about pressure cookers and search her house. She believes her 'news junkie' son reading articles on the Boston Bombings, coupled with her hunt for a pressure cooker and her husband's online shopping for a backpack created the 'perfect storm of terrorism profiling.' But so far the FBI, Nassau County and Suffolk County Police Departments have denied their part in the call. While she wasn't at home at the time, her husband was when three black SUVs drove up to their house and the cops exited and started to approach their property, flashing badges with handguns in their holsters. Her husband went outside to meet the men and complied with their request to look around the house and backyard. They walked around the living room, looked at books and pictures, and petted their dogs. When they asked to go into the son's room, her husband said he was sleeping and they left him alone. They also interviewed him, asking about where he was from, where his wife was, and if they had any bombs. They also asked about whether they owned a pressure cooker. Her husband said no, but that they had a rice cooker. 'Can you make a bomb with that?' they asked. He told them his wife used it to make quinoa. 'What the hell is quinoa?' they asked. What the hell is quinoa? After asking whether the family had a pressure cooker, Catalano's husband said they only have a rice cooker to cook quinoa. The officers were mystified by the ancient grain . Catalano said that 'by this point they realized they were not dealing with terrorists and the men wrapped their search up. Her husband called her immediately after, laughing about the incident, but Catalano didn't see the humor. She said she felt a 'great sense of anxiety' when she realized that 'this is where we are at.' 'Where you have no expectation of privacy. Where trying to learn how to cook some lentils could possibly land you on a terrorism watch list,' she wrote. The FBI confirmed the visit to The Guardian, but said their officers weren't involved. A spokesman said it was Nassau County Police officers working in conjunction with the Suffolk County Police Department. But a Nassau County police spokesman told MailOnline they weren't involved. 'We did not, did not, go out to this woman's home,' police spokesman James Imperiale said. 'What agency went I couldn't tell you. I don't know.' A Suffolk County Police spokesman referred media back to the FBI. If the search were truly carried out due to suspicious Google searches, it would have required a warrant. In a company report on transparency, Google detailed how they deal with law enforcement officials looking for evidence online. 'The . government needs legal process—such as a subpoena, court order or . search warrant—to force Google to disclose user information. Exceptions . can be made in certain emergency cases, though even then the government . can’t force Google to disclose.' Which has led some to question the validity of Ms Catalano's story. Today, she took to Twitter, writing that she wasn't giving interviews to the media. 'I'll say it once: I didn't make it up,' she wrote. 'Thanks to those defending my integrity.'","Michele Catalano, a writer for Forbes, published an account of the raid today .

'Because it’s such a symbol, it would allow you to talk about race in the age of Obama.' Symbolic: Trayvon Martin¿s death has sparked debate about popular perceptions of hoodies and the people who wear them . Bunch said the dark gray sweatshirt would enhance the museum's collection, enabling curators to 'ask the bigger questions' prompted by the case. 'Are . we in a post-racial age?' Bunch asked. 'This trial . says, ‘No.’' He said he'd like to chase up the murder trial artifact after the Justice Department finishes its civil rights investigation.

In bankrupt Detroit, all sources of revenue to pay back creditors are on the table - even selling off the city's beloved art collection at the Detroit Institute of Arts. The world-famous 60,000-piece collection includes works by Rembrandt, Matisse, Cézanne, Degas, van Gogh and Gauguin - as well as the original Howdy Doody TV show puppet. Collectors estimate that the entire collections could be worth up to $2.5billion - a sizable payment toward the city's $18 billion long-term debt. Doomed? The Detroit Institute of Arts and its $2.5billion collection has moved into the cross hairs after the city declared bankruptcy . Some are beginning to question whether the city can afford an estimated $2.5billion art collection when it faces dire financial straights from its $18billion bankruptcy . Prized: Two of the museum's most prized possessions include 'Self Portrait with Straw Hat,' estimated to be worth $60 million, and another Vincent van Gogh titled 'Portrait of the Postman Joseph Roulin' Unlike most other major art museums, which are owned by trusts and operated separately from the cities where they reside, the Detroit Institute of Arts is a city-owned facility. A spokesman for Kevyn Orr, the state-appointed emergency manager of the troubled city, said the art museum collection could become a bargaining chip in negotiations with creditors. 'We haven't proposed selling any asset. But we haven't taken any asset off the table. We can't. We cannot negotiate in good faith with our creditors by taking assets off the table,' spokesman Bill Nowling told the New York Times. 'And all of our creditors have asked about the worth of the DIA. And we've told them that they're welcome to find out.' The art collection, housed in a grand Beaux-Arts museum built in 1927, has been one of the cultural bright points in the beleaguered city. Expensive: According to art dealers, the most expensive piece in the gallery is Henri Matisse's 'The Window,' pictured, with an estimated value of $150 million . Wow: Frederic Church's 'Cotopaxi' from 1862, pictured, was purchased by the Founders Society with funds from several sources in 1976. the awe-inspiring 7-foot panorama has an estimated worth of $70 million . Spectacular: This 17th-Century French artist Nicolas Poussin's masterpiece 'Selene and Endymion' hangs on the DIA's walls after the Founders Society bought it in 1936. It has an estimated value of $30 million . Rothko: The Founders Society also purchased an impressive 1963 Mark Rothko, pictured, titled 'Orange Brown,' which is now estimated to be worth $70 million . Famed: Rembrandt's 'The Visitation' from 1640, which depicts Mary, pregnant with Jesus, in a meeting with her cousin Elizabeth, who is pregnant at the time with john the Baptist, hangs on the DIA wall . According to The Detroit Free Press, which consulted respected art dealers, the most expensive piece in the gallery is Henri Matisse's 'The Window' with an estimated value of $150 million. The City of Detroit purchased the 1916 oil on canvas masterpiece in 1992. The piece is a subtle abstract interior work showcasing the French-born painter's reknown style. Two impressive paintings in the DIA's collection are worth an estimated $100 million each - Pieter Bruegel the Elder, 'The Wedding Dance,' bought by the City of Detroit in 1930, and Tintoretto, 'The Dreams of Men,' purchased by the now bankrupt city in 1923. Bruegel's circa 1566 oil on oak panel was snapped up by DIA director William Valentiner for $38,000 70 years ago and since then its value has increased some 2600 times. The enormous 7-by-12 feet Tintoretto masterpiece, was installed on the ceiling of the DIA. The next most valuable piece, according to art dealers, is Andy Warhol's 'Double Self Portrait,' which is estimated to be worth $80 million. The Founders Society purchased the 1967 work a year after it was completed. The Founders Society also purchased an impressive 1963 Mark Rothko titled 'Orange Brown,' which is now estimated to be worth $70 million while Rembrandt's 'The Visitation' from 1640 has an estimated value of $60 million. One of the one-of-a-kind pieces housed at the DIA is the first ever doll used on the Howdy Doody TV show . Bright spot: More than 600,000 people visited the museum last year. Seen here is 'The Wedding Dance' by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, which is estimated to cost $100 million . Work: Jan van Eyck's circa 1440 work 'Saint Jerome in his Study' was bought by the city in 1925 and today is worth some $50 million . A famed Diego Rivera mural is another of the nearly priceless works of art at the DIA . Plagued by some of the highest crime and unemployment rates in the country, the once-thriving Motor City has become a shadow of itself. Hundreds of thousands of residents have fled to the suburbs. Entire blocks are blighted by abandoned streets. But, the Detroit Institute of Arts continues to draw people downtown. The museum had some 600,000 visitors last year. Three neighboring counties - home to Detroit's wealthy suburbs - agreed to raise a tax to support the museum. Any attempts to liquidate the museum's collection could face resistance from arts patrons, who still donate tens of millions of dollars a year to the DIA. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette weighed in last month and attempted to bar any future creditors from seeking the sale of the city's works of art. He wrote a legal opinion arguing that the collection is 'held by a charitable trust for the people of Michigan' and that the city doesn't actually own the art - so the city can't sell the art. Patrons are also upset. They say the city would be irreversibly losing a part of itself. 'We're talking about selling history,' patron Rod Spencer told CBS News. 'How can you sell family history?' 1. Henri Matisse's 'The Window,' with an estimated value of $150 million, is the gallery's most expensive work of art, according to art dealers consulted by The Detroit Free Press.

Chase: The pursuit continues with the pair ducking under the net . Issara can be seen knocking Jongit over and punching him repeatedly on a video taken from the stands and posted on YouTube. Issara then stands and appears to kick Jongit while he writhes on the ground. Officials can be seen quickly rushing over and hold Issara to the ground. Jongit manages to wriggle free from the scrum - losing his jersey in the process. He does not appear to be badly injured and walks away. Issara, meanwhile, is pinned to the ground by a badminton official. The pair had been warned by the referee following a verbal exchange earlier in the match. Issara and his partner Vilailak Pakkawat were promptly disqualified, with Jongjit and Nipitphon Puangpuapech awarded victory. A . statement from the world governing body read: 'The Badminton World . Federation is aware of an incident which occurred during the finals of . the Yonex Canada Grand Prix tournament on Sunday. 'The . men's doubles final ended in unusual circumstances, with a black card . being issued to Thailand pair, Bodin Issara and Pakkawat Vilailak, who . were disqualified. 'Their opponents were another Thai duo, Maneepong Jongjit and Nipitphon Puangpuapech. 'The events surrounding the conclusion of this match will be thoroughly investigated by the BWF.

'The world governing body has procedures in place to deal with such situations and this matter will be referred to the disciplinary committee. 'Until this process is concluded there will be no further comment by the BWF.' Jongjit and Issara reached the quarter-finals at London 2012 but split up in January when the latter announced his retirement, citing injury and a need to care for his mother. But the 22-year-old resumed competition with a new partner soon after. This latest incident brings the BWF further unwanted negative publicity just a fortnight before their showpiece World Championships in China. A year ago the Olympic badminton tournament was marred by a match-fixing scandal involving four women's doubles pairs.","Video shows Bodin .

The trend for celebrity-loved vitamin IV drips is being blamed for a critical shortage of medical supplies. Many private clinics offering the trendy treatment use the same manufacturer of IV ingredients as hospitals, and now it is struggling to keep up with demand, the Washingtonian reports. As a result, with no centralized database to direct the nutrients to people who need them most, the health system is said to be in jeopardy. Not enough to go around: The health craze for receiving 'beautifying' vitamins via intravenous drip is being blamed for a critical shortage of medical supplies . Clinical pharmacist, Steve Plogsted said premature infants will be most affected as they need vitamin supplements to keep them alive and healthy. 'It's appalling that we are sacrificing the health of our babies for beauty, energy, and hangover relief,'  he said. Hollywood stars, models, athletes and high-powered professionals often pay up to $1,000 for tube-fed concoctions which they believe will boost their energy levels and give them a youthful glow. 'We've got peoples' lives hanging in the balance while we're worried about getting through a hangover' In Las Vegas, a company called Hangover Heaven apparently has buses equipped with as many as 14 IVs to help people get over alcohol-fueled nights. Some of the bags contain calcium - which is also in 'absolute shortage,' according to the American Society of Health System Pharmacists. Mr Plogsted added: 'We’ve got [peoples’] lives hanging in the balance while we’re worried about getting through a hangover.' However, Dr. Sue Decotiis who runs a medical practice in New York told MailOnline that blaming depleting stocks 'designer therapies does not seem plausible.' In pursuit of perfection: Rihanna and Simon Cowell are said to get regular vitamin IV treatments . She said that there are a myriad of reasons why supplies could be down including distribution problems, local increased demand and decreased production. She said that if demand for vitamins and supplements remains consistent suppliers should think about increasing production to meet public need. Originally a craze among the A-list crowd, vitamin IV shots have become increasingly available. Most patients tend to check in for quick hits on lunch breaks or post work, though some spend up to three hours in the chair. MailOnline spoke to cardiologist Dr Kevin Campbell who discredited the use of vitamin drips saying: . 'There has never been any randomized controlled clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit to these IV infusions whatsoever. 'As a cardiologist I would not recommend . these types of treatments. Our time can be better spent on preventative . activities such as diet and exercise and modification of risk factors.' Though they are not FDA-approved as . medical treatments IVs, which are typically inserted for 30 to 60 . minutes, are on offer at the offices of even prominent physicians. Indeed, Dr Marcia Harris, a gynecologist, gives IVs at Patients Medical in New York. This year alone she has seen a 33per cent increase in requests for the treatment. She said celebrities such as Simon Cowell, who apparently enjoys weekly IV drips of B12, magnesium and vitamin C to keep his liver in check, are fueling the craze. Though doctors in a large range of specialties are now offering the IVs, critics say there's little evidence the practice has any health benefits. Dr Kevin Campbell told MailOnline: 'There has never been any randomized controlled clinical trials to demonstrate any benefit to these IV infusions whatsoever. 'Although I think that certain groups of people may benefit (those with documented deficiencies of a particular vitamin or mineral) widespread use of this technique is unfounded and expensive. Dr Campbell also believes that the benefits people feel from the infusion may simply be due to the placebo effect. He added: 'As a cardiologist I would not recommend these types of treatments. Our time can be better spent on preventative activities such as diet and exercise and modification of risk factors.'","Hollywood stars, models, athletes and .

"By . David Martosko In Washington . PUBLISHED: . 14:26 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:38 EST, 23 April 2013 . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that another ricin attack had been has targeted a US government facility. 'We've had another incident today, I'm told, at Bolling Air Force Base,' Reid told reporters during a media availability at the Capitol. Ricin is a powerful organic toxin. Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can cause death. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that a ricin-poisoning atack targeted Bolling Air Force Base, but that base was combined with another in 2010 and its current spokesman said he knew nothing about any toxic letters . The facility that was known as Bolling Air Force Base is now called the Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. It is a naval facility created by the military's Base Realignment and Closure Commission as part of a series of recommendations in 2005. Joseph Cirone, a public information officer at that installation told MailOnline that the report is likely untrue. 'I don't know where he got that from,' the naval spokesman said, 'because I don't have that information. We're sitting here nice and quiet.' 'We have not been notified' of anything related to a ricin attack, he added. Federal agents wearing hazardous material suits inspected the trash outside the Mississippi home of Paul Kevin Curtis, who was suspected of sending ricin-poisoned letters to President Barack Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker, and a state judge. He was released Tuesday without facing charges . It's possible that Sen. Reid, a Nevada Democrat, was referring to information about a different air force base, but he specifically named the facility in the Anacostia region of Washington, DC. The Daily Caller reported that a base spokesman said the facility was dealing with 'a hazardous material incident' which 'could be anything from an oil spill [to] a gasoline spill.' The Senate leadership office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Reid told reporters at the Capitol that 'when I left the room here, I had a [message which] said there’s been an alleged ricin incident at Bolling Air Force Base.' 'That’s all I know. I just read it,' he added. A Mississippi man was briefly charged with sending ricin-poisoned letters to President Barack Obama, a state judge and Mississippi Sen. Roger last week, but authorities released him Tuesday. Paul Kevin Curtis, an Elvis impersonator who once performed at a party Wicker hosted, left custody shortly after the cancellation of a detention hearing in Oxford, Mississippi. The reason for his release wasn't immediately clear, but his attorney confirmed that 'he is with his family.' Federal law enforcement has not said if any other suspects have been identified. The FBI in Washington, D.C. had no comment. Reid's disclosure came in response to a reporter's question about Curtis's release. Paul Kevin Curtis, released from custody on Tuesday, is an Elvis Presley impersonator who once performed at a party given by Sen. Roger Wicker. He was briefly accused of trying to poison Wicker with a ricin-tainted letter . J. Everett Dutschke (foreground), shown on his Facebook page, has been accused of sending the ricin letters, by a politician whose mother, a judge, received one of the poisoned envelopes. He has not been charged . The latest suspect named, J. Everett Dutschke, is reportedly an aspiring politician in Mississippi whom investigators believe may have framed Curtis. Dutschke ran against state Rep. Steve Holland for his legislative seat in 2007. Holland's mother, Lee County Justice Court Judge Sadie Holland, was targeted by one of the letters. Rep. Holland told the Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Mississippi that Dutschke, hates his family 'with a passion.'","Senate Majority Leader named 'Bolling Air Force Base,' which merged with another facility in 2010 .

Kidnapping victim Michelle Knight has expressed her gratitude to Cleveland police following her harrowing ordeal in a handwritten note, which cops posted on Facebook on Wednesday evening. Knight, held captive for more than 10 years, was the first woman captured by Ariel Castro before he went on to kidnap Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus. In her note, Knight thanked the cops for their 'time and work' and expressed her resilience and determination to overcome everything she has gone through. 'Life is tough, but I'm tougher,' she wrote. Michelle Knight has written to Cleveland police to offer her thanks for their help but also expressed her determination to overcome what she has been put through . She also included the quote: 'Just when the caterpillar thought the world was over, she became a butterfly.' Over . the course of her imprisonment, Castro allegedly impregnated Knight . five times and caused her to miscarry each time by starving and beating . her. Prosecutors revealed on Wednesday that all three women had kept diaries documenting the physical and sexual abuse they suffered on a daily basis. Castro lured one of them into his Cleveland home with the promise of a puppy for her son and later locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage for three days when someone visited him, prosecutors said. Cleveland police posted Knight's touching handwritten note on their Facebook page on Wednesday evening . Former school bus driver Castro . claimed he didn't have an exit strategy from his complicated double life . and finally gave the women a chance to escape by leaving a door . unlocked, they said in court documents. Amanda Berry broke free in May and called for help, frantically telling . an emergency dispatcher, ‘I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing . for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here. I'm free now.’ Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder. He's being sentenced Thursday. Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty says in a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday that Castro ‘remains remorseless for his actions.’ The memorandum says many of the charges in Castro's indictment reflect conduct documented by one of the women in her diary. Ariel Castro has pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including kidnapping, rape, assault and aggravated murder and is due to be sentenced on Thursday . In the sentencing memorandum, prosecutors describe the horrific conditions the women endured. The women's diaries, they say, ‘document abuse and life as a captive.’ ‘The entries speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of being held like a prisoner of war,’ the memorandum says. When Castro was arrested, his attorneys said evidence would show he wasn't a monster. The county prosecutor says the facts he'll present Thursday at Castro's sentencing, at which Castro faces life in prison plus 1,000 years, will prove the lawyers wrong. ‘You'll make the same logical judgment when you see the facts,’ McGinty said last week after Castro pleaded guilty. ‘You have not seen the evidence yet.’ McGinty hasn't said whether the three women will testify in person. The legal team representing the women's interests declined to comment on whether they would testify or send statements to the court. All three victims - Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight and Gina DeJesus - appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support . The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. There was no immediate comment Wednesday from Castro's defense team. Many horrific details of the women's ordeal had already emerged, with one woman forced to wear a motorcycle helmet while chained in the basement and, after she tried to escape, having a vacuum cord wrapped around her neck. He forced Knight on threat of death to safely deliver the child he fathered with Amanda Berry on Christmas Day 2006. That day, prosecutors say, Castro raped the woman who helped deliver his daughter. Prosecutors will ask the judge to prohibit Castro from ever seeing his daughter, now 6. McGinty says experts also will discuss the Stockholm syndrome to explain how Castro was able to keep the women captive for so long. The indictment alleges he repeatedly restrained the women, sometimes chaining them to a pole in a basement, to a bedroom heater or inside a van and assaulting them with a vacuum cord if they tried to escape . The syndrome describes situations in which hostages and victims of abduction begin to sympathize with their captors and even defend them. It was named for a 1973 bank hostage situation in Stockholm, Sweden. Castro so terrified the women that the day they were rescued, two of them were initially afraid to emerge even with five police officers in the house, McGinty said. When they did, they clung to police so tightly the officers couldn't use their flashlights, he said. ‘That told me what fear this man put into these women and how much courage it took to survive this ordeal,’ McGinty said. He also referred to the ‘mental and physical bond and barrier’ that the first woman who escaped, Amanda Berry, had the courage to break. All three victims appeared in a video in early July thanking the local community for its support.","The kidnapping victim who spent the longest in captivity wrote to local police to thank them for all their 'time and work'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:13 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:53 EST, 1 August 2013 . Disturbing new details have emerged about the physical and emotional abuse brutally dished out by Ariel Castro to the three victims he held captive for ten years. On the eve of Castro’s sentencing on Thursday, prosecutors filed a sentencing memorandum with the court outlining the seriousness of his treatment of Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry. The report was compiled from a wealth of evidence including diaries kept by the three young women which paint a horrifying picture of the physical and psychological torture they were forced to endure. On the eve of Ariel Castro's sentencing on Thursday, prosecutors filed a sentencing memorandum with the court outlining the seriousness of his treatment of Michelle Knight, Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry . Cuyahoga County prosecutor Tim McGinty . said in a sentencing memorandum filed Wednesday that Castro 'serially abused them physically, emotionally, and sexually on a daily basis' but nonetheless ‘remains . remorseless for his actions.’ The memorandum says many of the charges in Castro's indictment were originally recorded by one of the women in her diary. In the sentencing memorandum, . prosecutors describe the horrific conditions the women endured. The . women's diaries, they say, ‘document abuse and life as a captive.’ ‘The . entries speak of forced sexual conduct, of being locked in a dark room, . of anticipating the next session of abuse, of the dreams of someday . escaping and being reunited with family, of being chained to a wall, of . being held like a prisoner of war,’ the memorandum says. Diaries kept by Amanda Berry, Michelle Knight, and Gina de Jesus while held captive for a decade in an Ohio home have helped US prosecutors describe their suffering . Michelle Knight was forced to abort an apparent pregnancy by consuming only tea and doing strenuous exercise. She then had to deliver Amanda Berry's child herself and resuscitate the baby after her birth, while Castro threatened to kill her if she failed. The three women were not allowed out of their bedroom to use the bathroom, and had to resort to plastic toilets which were rarely emptied. Castro deliberately made the attic unbearably hot and the basement freezing cold so he could punish his prisoners if he thought they were misbehaving. At one point, he locked the girls in a vehicle in his garage to hide them from a friend who was visiting for three days. In a bid to frighten the women into obeying him, he told them he was 'hunting for replacements' and claimed he had previously captured other victims. It also includes an evaluation by a clinical professor of psychiatry at Michigan State University who describes the emotional toll that the ten years of captivity had on the women. ‘He . appeared to be evolving in an ever more dangerous direction, capturing . younger and younger women, telling his captives he was hunting for . replacements,’ wrote Frank Ochberg. According . to Dr Ochberg's evaluation, Castro made his victims believe that their . physical survival depended on him, and he threatened to end their lives . if they did not comply with their every demand. He told the women he had had other victims, that some of whom had made it home and others who had not. 'These and other threats had the effect of terrifying the victims into subservience,’ Dr Ochberg explained. He added: 'Castro hurt each of the three young women that he captured and confined in ways that create lasting wounds. He terrified them. 'The body responds to terror long afterward with uncontrollable visions, smells, sounds and sensations. These are called trauma memories and they are unlike ordinary memory. They come at night in the form of nightmares.' Castro has admitted forcing Michelle Knight to terminate a pregnancy by putting her on a tea-only diet for several days and making her perform strenuous exercises . In his evaluation, Dr Ochberg wrote that Knight - who was kidnapped first after Castro promised to give her a puppy for her son - suffered 'the longest and most severely.' Castro has admitted that on one occasion Knight told him she may be pregnant and he forced a termination by putting her on a tea-only diet for several days, made her perform 'knee bends' and jumping jacks. However, when Berry fell pregnant, Knight helped save the baby's life as Castro threatened to kill her if the child did not survive. 'It was Michelle who served as doctor, nurse, midwife and pediatrician during the birth. She breathed life into that infant when she wasn't breathing,' wrote Dr Ochberg. 'At other times, she interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina, interposing herself and absorbing physical and sexual trauma. But each survivor had a will to prevail and used that will to live through the ordeal.' The memorandum also describes how Castro controlled the movements of the women, keeping them in locked rooms and using physical restraints. 'There is only one bathroom in the . house, on the first floor. The Defendant would not allow the victims . downstairs to use the bathroom. They only had access to plastic toilets . in the bedrooms. They were emptied infrequently.' The document adds: 'He controlled the temperature and the inflow of food and drink. He used the cold of the basement and the heat of the attic as punishment techniques.' In the memorandum Michelle Knight - who was kidnapped first - is described as suffering 'the longest and most severely' Amanda Berry, left, made a surprise onstage appearance at a rap concert last weekend, and Gina DeJesus, right, made a few televised comments as a privacy fence was erected around her house . At one point during 2005 the three women were kept physically restrained in a vehicle in a garage for three days while the defendant had a visitor staying. Berry's diary was addressed to her mother, and then after her mom died, she 'wrote to her mother in heaven, seeking to soothe her mother' and praying for deliverance and the health of her daughter who Castro fathered. The diaries show how 'the victims had to watch the rest of the world turn as they were held in captivity,' according to the memorandum. 'Holidays, world events, and even the passing of Ms Berry's mother were observed by them, removed from the outside world.' The purpose of the memorandum is to help establish a record that will serve as justification for Castro's sentence should it come under review in the future. Castro pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in a deal that dropped a possible death penalty in exchange for life in prison plus 1,000 years. In early July his victims released a video thanking the local community for its support - since then Amanda Berry, 27, has made a surprise onstage appearance at a rap concert last weekend, and Gina DeJesus, 23, made a few televised comments as a privacy fence was erected around her house. The third victim, Michelle Knight, 32, has had a letter a letter send to local police posted on their Facebook page. Castro is expected to be sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus a minimum of 1,000 years .","On the eve of Castro's sentencing, prosecutors submitted report detailing the seriousness of his crimes .

Anthony Weiner made yet another attempt to get his struggling campaign back on track last night - but his attempt to connect with voters was dominated by questions about his controversial spokeswoman Barbara Morgan. The embattled candidate for mayor of New York City held a campaign event in his former constituency in Queens, where he answered questions from the audience but refused to talk to reporters. The event was not attended by Ms Morgan - the first time she has not been seen by Weiner's side in days - prompting speculation that she may have even lost her job after describing a former campaign intern as a 'fame-hungry b****' and a 'sl**bag'. Silent: Anthony Weiner yesterday refused to comment on his controversial spokeswoman Barbara Morgan . Hasty retreat: The mayoral candidate climbed into a waiting SUV without answering reporters' questions . Her absence attracted calls of 'Where's Barbara?', but Mr Weiner shunned the press and did not answer the question, according to Buzzfeed. The candidate's mayoral campaign ran into trouble last week when it was revealed that he had been sexting women for a year after the Twitter scandal which forced him to resign from Congress. It took a turn for the worse on Tuesday when Ms Morgan responded to criticisms of the campaign made by former intern Olivia Nuzzi, calling her a 't***' and a 'c***'. Mr Weiner attended an event organised by the Friends of Rockaway Beach with three other mayoral candidates on Wednesday night as he attempted to get past the controversy. He answered three audience questions before saying, 'God bless you' and walking out of a side door. Outspoken: Communications director Barbara Morgan this week denounced former intern Olivia Nuzzi . Rant: Ms Morgan, pictured with Mr Weiner last week, described Ms Nuzzi as a 'fame-hungry b****' Troubled: Mr Weiner at a campaign event in Queens last night, where he attempted to boost his chances of being elected mayor of New York City . The candidate was chased by 15 reporters - ignoring the event's other speakers - and ran into a waiting SUV. Members of the press shouted out, 'Where's Barbara?', but did not get a response. Some audience members at the event criticised the media circus surrounding Mr Weiner and expressed support for him, saying that he had proved his dedication to the city. The 48-year-old was a popular congressman for Queens for more than 12 years, and had been tipped for higher office before he accidentally tweeted a photograph of his crotch which he had intended to send to a woman who was not his wife. Initial polls in the Democratic primary election for mayor of New York showed Mr Weiner in a strong position against frontrunner Christine Quinn, but his support has collapsed since the revelation that he carried on sexting under the pseudonym 'Carlos Danger'. Apology: Ms Morgan posted this picture on Twitter after she hit the headlines this week . Criticism: Ms Nuzzi, pictured, claimed that Mr Weiner's campaign was badly run and ineffective . Ms Morgan, the campaign's communications director, has not been seen in public since her expletive-laden tirade against Ms Nuzzi was published by Talking Points Memo on Tuesday. Yesterday she took to Twitter to apologise, posting a photograph of a swear jar filled with bills and credit cards. 'Not my best day yesterday,' she wrote. 'Should've known better, been better. Gotta pay up.' In a statement, she said: 'In a moment of frustration, I used inappropriate language in what I thought was an off-the-record conversation. It was wrong and I am very sorry, which is what I said tonight when I called and emailed Olivia to apologise.' Ms Morgan was angry with Ms Nuzzi for posting an article in the New York Daily News suggesting that many of Mr Weiner's staff had only joined his campaign to get close to his wife, Hillary Clinton's adie Huma Abedin. She also claimed that one employee had left because he had only been paid a third of what he was promised, and that the candidate incorrectly referred to her and other interns as 'Monica'.","Mayoral candidate attempts to launch campaign at event in Queens .

A mother who chose to give birth to her baby despite being advised to abort him every fortnight throughout her pregnancy, sat beside his body for three days after he died just 19 minutes old. The baby, who was named Charlie, suffered with Potter's Syndrome, a rare condition that affects the growth of the kidneys. Doctors spotted the syndrome when expectant mother Carrie was 18-weeks pregnant, but she chose not to terminate her son’s life as he was otherwise developing normally and had a very strong . heartbeat. Carrie Curtis, from West Yorkshire, gave birth to a son, Charlie, who died 19 minutes after birth. Doctors repeatedly urged her to terminate because he suffered with Potter's Syndrome, a condition that causes the kidneys to develop abnormally . Miss Curtis, 20, said: 'I wanted to give Charlie the best chance I life that I could. 'I knew the chances of him surviving were almost nil but as long as he had a heartbeat, I wasn’t going to change my mind - no matter how many times doctors asked me if I was sure. 'I went for fortnightly checks and each time they asked if I wanted to terminate my pregnancy. They wouldn’t listen [to me].' Potter's Syndrome affects around one in 30,000 babies. It stunts the growth of the baby's kidneys during the first few weeks of development in the womb. The baby's kidneys are essential for the production of amniotic fluid in the womb. If there are no kidneys, there is little or no amniotic fluid which causes a condition called  oligohydramnios. Potter's Syndrome affects around one in 30,000 babies.

December 29 last year, in her 32nd week of pregnancy, she said he . looked like any other newborn baby, despite weighing just 4lb. Miss Curtis, from Leeds, said: 'It was a normal birth and I had a big team of people looking after me. 'As . soon as he came out, he was taken over to an incubator where they tried . to work. But his lungs were nearly non-existent and there was nothing . they could do. He passed away at 19 minutes. 'They wrapped him in a towel and let me hold him while he slipped away. 'Charlie opened his eyes and looked at me, which will forever be a lasting moment for me,'Miss Curtis added. Sadly, Miss Curtis never heard her . son cry, but she was allowed to spend three precious days with her son . at the Leeds General Infirmary. She said: 'Charlie was so perfect and didn’t look any different to how he should have done. 'He was the right size and everything else had developed normally.

'I knew his chances were slim but I was never going to give up on him and when I got to hold him in my arms, I was so pleased that I hadn’t. 'The hospital let me stay in a specially-adapted suite where parents who have lost children can go. 'I was allowed to hold him and be with him for as long as I wanted. At first it was hard because I expected him to open his eyes and be alright but as I was there longer, having the time with him was comforting.' Miss Curtis now wishes to set up a charity to offer support to bereaved parents and raise awareness of Potter's Syndrome. Miss Curtis and her family (from L-R: stepmother Ruth Curtis, father Gary Curtis, mother Sam Key and her partner Clive Key) are hoping to raise £100,000 to set up a charity to raise awareness of Potter's Syndrome .

'I was getting all the after-effects of giving birth but I didn’t have the baby,' she said. 'I didn’t get any visits and there was no one to talk to about it. It was very overwhelming and scary. 'Charlie was my first child and I didn’t imagine it how it turned out. I didn’t know how long he would last and I didn’t know if I would miscarry. 'The fact that I knew he wasn’t going to live for very long when he was born meant I just had to get myself ready for that.' Carrie and her family are hoping to raise £100,000 in order to set up the centre and offer support and help. Carrie added: 'We want somewhere that people can call at 2am in the morning or just call in for a coffee and speak to someone, because you do feel like you’re going crazy.

A baby bottle that heats milk as it is being drunk has sparked a huge amount of interest on parenting forums – but not everyone is convinced. The British-designed Yoomi features a warmer in the top of the bottle, containing the same gel found in hand-warmers. Milk flows through a network of grooves on the outside of the warmer. New invention: Yoomi only warms milk as it is being consumed - meaning the rest stays fresh . When it reaches the teat, it has been heated to 32C  – the same temperature as breast milk. Only milk being consumed is warmed, meaning the rest stays fresh. Designer Jim Shaihk came up with the idea after his wife became exasperated that milk she had previously expressed into a bottle had to be thrown away if had been warmed up but was then left unused. The warmer stays at the optimum temperature for up to an hour, after which it must be ‘recharged’, usually by  being placed in a steam steriliser for 25 minutes. However, one blogger, The Booby Whisperer, points out that convenience doesn’t come cheap. The warmer can be recharged only 150 times, and the blogger estimates that parents would need to spend £32 a month on the product. Other parents say their children don’t seem to care whether milk is warm or not. Still, with UK sales of Yoomi in excess of 15,000 a year and rising, the product has legions of fans: ‘Perfect temperature straight from the fridge – what more could a busy mum want?’ wrote one online reviewer.

Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students . A high school teacher whose baby is fathered by one of her 16-year-old students pleaded guilty to six sex charges in court today. Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, had been . charged with 41 counts of sex and oral copulation with a minor in . alleged crimes that took place in Redlands, Los Angeles. Whitehurst admitted having sex with three of her students despite initially pleading not guilty to all charges. She pleaded guilty to four counts of unlawful sex with a minor and two counts of oral copulation with a minor. The remaining charges were dismissed during a hearing at San Bernardino Superior Court on Wednesday morning, NBC reports. She agreed to a sentence of one year in jail, five years of probation and a lifetime registration as a sex offender and sex offender counseling. Whitehurst was arrested earlier this month after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police. The Citrus Valley High student  is believed to have been present at the birth. She met him while acting as his adviser at the school. Her attorney, James Gass, told news media outside the courtroom yesterday that Whitehurst wanted to retain custody of her baby girl, whom he confirmed had been fathered by the victim. When she was first arrested he told reporters she was just a 'clean-cut American girl' and was having a hard time being in jail - which is evident from her recent court pictures. After that, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst. Scroll down for video .

The answer is no,  if the latest slimy trend in Japan is anything to go by. Earlier this month it was reported that people there are forking out £165 for a facial treatment where live snails are applied to the skin. Medical experts claim the sticky gel snails produce contains antioxidants that help the skin retain moisture, and remove dead cells. In fact, this freaky facial is far from the most bizarre – but do any of them work? We spoke to the experts to find out. Freaky facials: A woman undergoing a new beauty treatment in Tokyo where live snails slither across the face to deliver antioxidants to the skin . THE SNAIL TRAIL . FACIAL: Live snails slither across the face, delivering antioxidants to the skin. The garden variety are not recommended due to contaminants. This facial is available only in Japan but you can buy snail gel in the  UK (Dr Organic Snail Gel, 50ml, £19.99, hollandandbarrett.com). CELEB DEVOTEES: Actress Katie Holmes is said to use the gel. FARCE OR FACT: Chilean snail farmers noticed they had very smooth hands, and this sparked a skincare revolution. A study released this year showed that daily application of products containing snail slime improved fine lines. A 2007 clinical trial using snail gel on rats showed it was excellent for wound-healing. EXPERT: Cosmetic doctor Dr Mervyn Patterson at Woodford Medical says: ‘The slimy mucus will have a moisturising effect.’ Simon Cowell is said to be a fan of VIP Stem Cell Facials which use stem cells extracted from the placentas and umbilical cords of sheep to be made into serums and applied to the face . COWELL’S CURE . FACIAL: VIP Stem Cell Facial,  £180, jillzander.co.uk. Stem cells are extracted from the placentas and umbilical cords of herds of sheep in New Zealand. The cells are flash-frozen and made into serums, which are applied as a face mask in combination with microdermabrasion, a glycolic peel and red-light therapy. CELEB DEVOTEES: Simon Cowell and Kim Kardashian. FARCE OR FACT: Clinical trials are under way – initial results apparently show ‘remarkable improvement in wrinkles and age spots’. EXPERT: ‘When the placenta emerges from the sheep, it is full of stem cells,’ says Darren McKeown, a cosmetic doctor. ‘But by the time the cells have been processed, they are dead.’ Dr Patterson adds: ‘The glycolic peel will benefit skin tone.’ SOUND SCIENCE . FACIAL: Harmony Clear Lift, from £125, courthouseclinics.com. Light – using a Pixel Q-Switch laser – is transformed into acoustic soundwaves as it hits the dermis (the lower layer of skin) to stimulate firmness. CELEB DEVOTEES: It’s too new even for A-listers. FARCE OR FACT: Photoacoustics is the formation of sound-waves following pulsed light absorption in a solid object. In trials the laser has proved its efficacy in skin rejuvenation, and has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. EXPERT: ‘This is a take on the  well-known method of wounding an area in order to stimulate healing and, as such, it may be effective,’ says Dr Patterson. THE BOTOX ALTERNATIVE .

It encourages circulation, lifts the face, works on muscle tone and temporarily reduces fine lines and wrinkles. CELEB DEVOTEES: Keira Knightley and Kate Moss. FARCE OR FACT: Studies show that sports massages increase blood flow in muscle capillaries, therefore aiding muscle repair. The International Journal Of Neuroscience showed that massages increased serotonin, the ‘feel-good’ hormone.

In an expletive-laden interview about her online exchanges with the married father and already scandal-hit Democrat politician, the 23-year-old student revealed how an innocent communication on the web led to a sordid relationship. Anthony Weiner (pictured with his wife Huma Abedin) has pledged to keep fighting in the mayoral race . She related how Weiner — sometimes using the pseudonym Carlos Danger — detailed his sexual fantasies, including sex in the shower. He also sent her naked pictures of himself during their six-month relationship, which began in July 2012. ‘He could have 12 girls talking to him [on the net] . . . and that wouldn’t be enough,’ she observed. His conversations, either by phone or via the web, would start with small talk which suddenly ended as he told her to take off her clothes. A few minutes of torrid sex talk later, he’d awkwardly thank her and hang up. When Miss Leathers started to cool over their unpleasant trysts last year, he would pester her with phone calls, insisting — though they had never met — he was madly in love with her. Making Boris look like a monk: Weiner could teach London¿s mayor a lesson or two about debauched behaviour and utter shamelessness . ‘There were times he’d talk to me multiple times a day. He was like this needy girlfriend or something,’ she laughed, before revealing to Howard Stern that, yes, the rumours were true that she is considering milking her new-found fame further with a career in pornography. Her manager — naturally, she already has one — has promised to get her some ‘new big boobs’. Yesterday, a scandal that has enthralled America for days after Leathers went public showed no signs of abating as Weiner pledged to keep fighting in the mayoral race. At the same time, it emerged that his communications director had delivered a foul-mouthed diatribe — including the words ‘slutbag’, ‘t***’ and ‘c***’ — at an intern who had dared to criticise the Weiner campaign. Classy it ain’t, but then Americans have come to expect nothing less from the implausibly named Weiner (which is by an appalling coincidence U.S. slang for the male organ), a man who makes Boris Johnson look like a monk. For the priapic Weiner — at 48 just a year younger than Boris — could teach London’s mayor a lesson or two about debauched behaviour and utter shamelessness. New York politicians have never let infamy get in the way of a comeback, but Weiner is testing voters to the very limit. As for the rest of America, it doesn’t know whether to cry at the sheer awfulness of it all, or simply laugh at Weiner’s bare-faced cheek in refusing to give up his campaign. Through his high-powered wife Huma Abedin’s status as a top aide and confidante to Hillary Clinton, the scandal is now threatening the course of the next presidential election. According to reports, the Clinton camp believes a continuing Weiner scandal could well damage Mrs Clinton’s election hopes if she runs for President in 2016. To describe Anthony Weiner as a . repeat offender is putting it mildly. Two years ago, he was forced to . resign as a U.S. congressman after admitting that he had been exchanging . lewd photos and messages with at least six young women who followed him . on Twitter. After days . of feeble half-denials, the workaholic, brash and hugely ambitious . Weiner was forced to own up: he had indeed sent a picture of his private . parts to a 21-year-old woman in Seattle. Sydney Leathers, left, has said Anthony Weiner was too distracted enjoying the company of girls like herself on the internet to do anything for New York.  The women Weiner communicated with online turned out to included a 28-year-old porn star calling herself Ginger Lee (pictured right) Unfortunately, he also mistakenly sent it to all 45,000 of his Twitter followers. (Worse, his confession came only after he had spent £30,000 hiring a private security firm to investigate if his Twitter account had been hacked, when he knew it hadn’t.) The women he communicated with online turned out to include a 40-year-old blackjack dealer from Las Vegas, a 35-year-old cheerleading coach, and a 28-year-old porn star calling herself Ginger Lee. Although he had never met any of them, Weiner said he was ‘deeply ashamed’ of his ‘terrible judgment and actions’, which he called ‘very dumb’. Others instead wondered about the judgment of his glamorous wife, after Weiner revealed she was standing by him as they prepared to have their first child, (now 17 months old). Ms Abedin — a 37-year-old Muslim American of Indian and Pakistani parents — was Mrs Clinton’s deputy chief of staff when she was U.S. Secretary of State and is one of her longest-serving aides. Weiner’s wife, who earns a £165,000 salary, first met her future husband at a party convention in 2001, and they started going out together in 2008. Numerous sordid jokes — and worse, pictures — of ‘Weiner’s weiner’ would have caused less ambitious politicians to retreat under a stone and never emerge again, but Weiner’s ego, to say nothing of his sexual urges, were not to be kept in check for long. In May this year, he announced via a YouTube video that he would be standing for New York mayor, seeking to replace the billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg. By then, he and his wife had had their son, a ‘sparkling wonder’ they named Jordan Zain Weiner. Announcing the birth to friends by . email, he gushed: ‘Did I mention his mom is amazing?’ That’s one way of . describing her. She has so far stuck by his side with a limpet-like . doggedness that has split opinion among women. In . a magazine profile, the couple portrayed themselves as the perfect . happily married proud parents — he, a dutiful father who had sought . counselling for his sexual proclivities, and generally learnt the error . of his ways. But is . Weiner’s wife guilty only of love and loyalty — perhaps of gullibility, . too — or is she indulging in Machiavellian scheming aimed at fostering . her own political ambitions by making herself look positively saintly? Numerous sordid jokes - and worse, pictures - of 'Weiner's weiner' would have caused less ambitious politicians to retreat under a stone and never emerge again . Some commentators have already suggested she should be the one running for mayor, not Weiner. Last week, after the latest scandal broke, Ms Abedin told a New York press conference: ‘I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him. Anthony’s made some horrible mistakes, both before he resigned from Congress and after. But I do believe that is between us, and our marriage.’ And in an article for the latest edition . of Harper’s Bazaar, written before the latest scandal, she enthused: . ‘Anthony has always been a smart, caring, and dedicated person, and . while he’s the same public servant who wants what’s best for the people . he represents, he is now something else — a better man. New Yorkers will . have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second . chance.’ In May this year, Weiner announced via a YouTube video that he would be standing for New York mayor, seeking to replace the billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg . So far it looks as if those voters have decided — and the omens are not good. Weiner has slipped from front runner to fourth place in the polls among Democratic candidates in the race. Ominously, he says he doesn’t know how many more compromising emails and pictures are out there. Certainly, as one of the women he has been communicating with so graphically on the internet, Sydney Leathers couldn’t have done more damage this week. Voicing sentiments even the most pro-Weiner voter must share, she told Howard Stern: ‘What p****d me off was him on the campaign trail saying “Oh, I’ve changed”, and trying to act like he has this perfect marriage now and everything’s just peachy . . . I’m proof [he] has not changed.’ She says Weiner ‘lured’ her into their online affair after she wrote to him — as a Democratic supporter — on Facebook to express her disappointment in his previous sexual shenanigans. A year later, she said, he responded on Facebook and apologised for letting her down. Almost at once, however, he began pursuing her. ‘That’s what really got me,’ she told Stern. ‘That he’s supposedly getting help, but in reality he’s flirting with me. He talked to me more about his two cats than he did about his child or his wife.’ Although TV cameras caught Weiner off-guard this week looking hollow-eyed, he is struggling on. In a new advert yesterday on his campaign website — in which his wife didn’t appear — Weiner vowed to keep running for mayor, because quitting ‘isn’t the way we roll in New York’. With jaw-dropping nerve, he added: ‘This isn’t about me. This is about helping New Yorkers.’ It’s difficult to see those voters taking him up on his generous offer.","Student Sydney Leathers revealed online exchanges with Anthony Weiner .

Darren Clews took no action when staff told him they were worried Daniel Pelka had been beaten by his mother . The headteacher who failed to act on worries about Daniel Pelka said it had ‘not been a pleasant time for anyone concerned’. Darren Clews, who at 34 is one of the youngest heads in the country, took no action when staff told him they were worried that the four-year-old had been beaten by his mother. But he quietly left the primary school soon after the four-year-old was murdered and has now taken up a new headship. Yesterday, pressure on the professionals involved in the case intensified after it was revealed that not one person has been disciplined. Deputy PM Nick Clegg questioned how authorities had missed warning signs and said he thought Daniel’s death ‘should be on all of our consciences’. The little boy resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’ following the cruelty inflicted on him by Magdalena Luczak, 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek, 34. Staff at Little Heath primary school, Coventry, noticed Daniel was stealing food, attempting to eat playdough and scavenging in playground bins. At one point, he was so ravenous he ate a pancake covered in mud and grit left after a Shrove Tuesday race. By the time he died, his emaciated body weighed less than a toddler and he was six inches shorter than average. Teachers claimed they were hoodwinked by his ‘evil’ mother who told them he had an eating disorder. But it was clear there was some distrust of Luczak. In January, Daniel’s class teacher Lisa Godfrey wrote in a school concerns book that he had bruises around his neck which she feared Luczak had caused while trying to ‘strangle him’.

Staff at Little Heath primary school noticed Daniel was stealing food, attempting to eat playdough and scavenging in playground bins . The following month, she alerted Mr Clews when Daniel had black eyes. But, in court, Mr Clews claimed it was not serious enough to go in the concerns book. It is believed that child protection officials were not made aware of Daniel’s desperate attempts to steal food, his rapid weight loss or his injuries. Parents told the Mail that at least three members of staff, including the headteacher, had left as a result of the tragedy. One parent, whose child was in the same class as Daniel said: ‘The headteacher felt incredibly guilty that the school didn’t spot anything. I’d seen Daniel myself in class and he seemed perfectly happy. I certainly didn’t see any cause for concern. ‘The head left at the end of term after Daniel died. He sent a letter to all the parents that he was leaving due to the circumstances. Deputy PM Nick Clegg (left) questioned how authorities had missed warning signs and said he thought the death of Daniel (right) 'should be on all of our consciences' ‘Daniel’s class teacher left soon after he died too, I don’t think she wanted to carry on working in the same school where she would be reminded of what happened.’ Yesterday, Mr Clews was enjoying the sunshine at his home in Wellesbourne, Warwickshire. He refused to comment on the case, but added: ‘An awful lot has been said. It’s not been a pleasant time for anyone concerned, in all honesty.’ Mr Clews went straight from his old job to being appointed head of nearby Grangehurst primary school. Mr Clegg said: ‘Clearly people must have seen something was wrong with this boy. I think his death should be on all of our consciences. We all ask the same questions: how did this happen? What happened when teachers saw this boy scavenging in bins, when they saw him lose all that weight? ‘They apparently did pass information on – why did no-one act on it? When he went to hospital and the mum and stepfather spun a web of lies, what happened to the concerns people had?’ A Coventry city council spokesman said Mr Clews had left of his own volition and not as a result of Daniel’s death.","Head Darren Clews left the school soon after Daniel Pelka was murdered .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:59 EST, 27 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:59 EST, 27 July 2013 . For the six million Britons who  are carers to an adult – and the 6,000 people who take on this huge responsibility every day – finding the right support can be daunting. The British Medical Association has released a Carer’s Manual to help. In the second of three extracts, we look at how to make the necessary changes to the home .  .  . Providing a helping hand: Six million Britons are carers to an adult, often a family member who suffers from a long-term health problem . WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE . When you think about how to adapt a home to suit a person’s particular needs, it is important to consider costs, aesthetics, the impact of the changes on the home, and how they may affect other household members. Hasty decisions can be costly, so it can pay to seek professional advice. The changes made will depend on the circumstances of the person you are caring for. Someone who is convalescing for a short period after illness won’t need expensive changes – look for low-cost, practical solutions. If specialist equipment is needed for a short period, you might be able to borrow it. For example, the British Red Cross lends medical equipment such as wheelchairs (redcross.co.uk,  0844 871 1111). SEEK ADVICE . Before making any adaptations, it is  a good idea to seek advice from an occupational therapist – health professionals who specialise in enabling people with limited mobility, illness or other special needs to maintain their independence in the home. They also give advice on equipment and can make arrangements for home adaptations to be carried out. They can be accessed through your doctor or social services. Before you meet the therapist, it’s worth listing all the areas where you feel that help is needed. For example, does a person have difficulty accessing the bathroom because it involves climbing stairs? Helping hand: As thousands daily take on the job as a carer for an ill family member or relative, a manual by the British Medical Association has been released to help them get of the ground . TRY BEFORE YOU BUY . There is a vast array of equipment and gadgets designed to help people with particular needs carry out everyday tasks. Items are advertised in newspapers, magazines and on TV, and even sold in supermarkets. Of course, some modifications are expensive, so remember: . PAYING FOR ADAPTATIONS . Whether or not you receive financial support for modifications is dependent on whether a home is privately owned or rented, council-owned or rented through a housing association. Disability Rights UK (disablityrightsuk.org, 08450 264748) and Disabled Living Foundation  (dlf.org.uk, 08451 309177) may be able to provide further information. If you are eligible, some assessments can be fast-tracked, especially if an individual’s needs are not complex. For instance, all that may be required is the fitting of a rail for them to hold on to.","Six million Britons work as a carer for an ill family member - with a further 6,000 taking on the responsibility every day .

The mother of a bride-to-be killed in a suburban New York boat crash urged the grieving groom and other mourners Thursday to turn the accident into a ‘source of strength.’ ‘Tragedy is a word that will forever be linked with Lindsey and Mark,’ said Carol Stewart-Kosik, speaking to an overflow crowd at the stucco and stone church where Lindsey Stewart would have married Brian Bond on Aug. 10. Their best man, Mark Lennon, was also killed. Lindsey Stewart's mother Carol Stewart-Kosik, second from right, and stepfather Walter Kosik, third from right, stand with other mourners as a casket containing Lindsey Stewart's body is brought into church for her funeral on Thursday . Fiance Brian Bond attended the funeral for his intended bride Lindsey Stewart, right, with a bruised eye and his arm in a sling following the accident which killed her . ‘I was supposed to be out there (in the congregation) and Lindsey was supposed to be up here’ at the altar for the wedding, said Stewart-Kosik. But the boat they were riding in smashed into a barge Friday night on the Hudson River. The powerboat's operator, another friend of the couple, faces a charge of vehicular manslaughter. ‘I can't remove the word “tragedy” from her legacy any more than I can push a barge out of the way,’ said Stewart-Kosik. But, she added, ‘tragedy should be utilized as a source of strength.’ She repeated that urging as she turned to her daughter's fiance, who attended the funeral with a bruised eye and an arm in a sling. A casket containing Lindsey Stewart's body is brought inside the Good Shepard Lutheran Church in Pearl River, N.Y. The service for Lindsey Stewart was held at the church in Pearl River where she would have been married Aug. 10 . ‘Lindsey loved you with every fiber of her being,’ she told him. ‘Use this tragedy as a source of strength.’ When she finished, she went to his pew and hugged him. Stewart's sister, Allyson Ruzicka, said she wants Stewart to be remembered for her love of life, her honesty and ‘for the way she loved the incredible man she was about to marry.’ ‘Rest peacefully, beautiful angel,’ she bade her sister. The Rev. John Havrilla, pastor of the Church of the Good Shepherd, remembered Stewart as a ‘loving, fun spirit.’ The accident, he said, has touched the hearts of strangers as well as loved ones.

The stationary barge was carrying construction materials for the $3.9 billion project to build a new Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson. Investigators have said they are looking into whether the barge was properly lighted. The Coast Guard and the state Thruway Authority, which is building the bridge, have said it was.

A model was stabbed to death in front of her three-year-old daughter in a sustained attack. Linah Keza, 29, a former Miss Africa contestant, was found dead in a pool of blood by neighbours who heard her screams. Her daughter Holly was discovered crying beside her body as the attacker rushed out of her home. Miss Keza’s former boyfriend, named locally as club promoter David Kikawa, 38, was later arrested on suspicion of murder after handing himself in to police and remains in custody. Murder probe: Miss Africa model Linah Keza was found stabbed to death at an address in Leyton . Friends said the killing came after months of rows between the on-off couple, who were well known on London’s African party scene. A police panic alarm was installed at Miss Keza’s rented first-floor flat in Leyton, East London. Relatives said her ex-boyfriend, who is Holly’s father, was ‘jealous and possessive’. Last night, the Metropolitan Police alerted the Independent Police Complaints Commission over fears it could have done more to protect the victim. Officers were called to Miss Keza’s home at 4.30am on Wednesday by neighbours who heard screaming and thumping. They discovered the pastor’s daughter had been viciously attacked. One neighbour described how he was confronted by the killer when he broke down the front door of the Rwanda-born model’s flat. Model: It is understood Linah's daughter was at the address at the time of the attack, according to a family friend . He said: ‘I was outside and I heard . some shouting and screaming and I ran to the door.

The popular park was closed for less than two hours due to 'safety procedures' A spokeswoman for Leicestershire Police said: 'A call came in at 9.35 this morning from the zoo to let us know that some chimpanzees, that were in the process of being moved from one building to another, had escaped and in the process of this they have perhaps gone into an area of that building that they shouldn’t have been in. 'They don’t appear to have actually physically escaped. As a precaution, we’ve been called by the zoo.' This is the second time in the space of a month that the chimps at Twycross Zoo have found themselves in the news. A Twycross Zoo chimp who starred as 007 in TV adverts for PG Tips tea died on July 8 aged 37 following a very short illness. Louis the chimpanzee parodied James Bond in adverts for the brand during the 1970s and 1980s. Curator Dr Charlotte Macdonald said: 'Louis was a very gentle and laid-back chimp - a favourite with everyone. 'Born at Twycross, he was one of the original PG Tips chimps. 'Although gone, Louis will never be forgotten - he will always be a member of our Twycross Zoo chimp family.' The chimp’s 42-year-old partner Choppers, who also starred in the ads, remains at the zoo. Dr MacDonald added: 'She is doing well and will be monitored closely over the next couple of weeks by the animal team. 'She will be introduced to some of the other chimps in the near future.' The zoo is 'renowned as a specialist primate zoo and has a wide variety of monkeys and apes', according to its website. It is set in more than 80 acres and is home to around 900 animals. The website says the zookeepers present regular talks and feeds where 'people can learn a bit more about some of our animals such as the chimpanzees'.","Group of chimps from Twycross Zoo made their way into secure service area .

Hospital bosses have hired a police sniffer dog to stop patients using illegal drugs on the wards. Coco the cocker spaniel was brought in to Northumberland, Tyne and Wear Foundation trust following concerns that drug dealers were preying on vulnerable patients. The 15-month-old dog is on duty at a base in Newcastle but can quickly be dispatched to any wards within the six hospitals run by the trust whenever staff raise the alarm. Smelling a rat: Sniffer dog Coco the Cocker Spaniel has been recruited by Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust to root out drug dealers targeting hospitals . Managers decided to hire a sniffer dog following reports drug dealers were hanging around in hospitals hoping to selling drugs to vulnerable patients. The trust treats 40,000 patients with mental health problems every year - some are addicts whose illnesses were caused by years of drug abuse. A dog’s sense of smell is more than 1,000 times as powerful than ours and the moisture on their noses helps trap tiny scent particles. Wide remit: Coco will be policing six of the trust's hospitals, including St Nicholas Hospital in Newcastle, pictured above . Coco underwent about eight week’s training with former police officer John McCarroll who is now also employed by the trust as her handler. Suresh Joseph, the medical director of the trust, which has hospitals in Newcastle, Sunderland and Northumberland, said: ‘She starts at 9am just like the rest of us. We like to pick up new ideas and run with them. ‘She’s a lovely dog. She is very energetic and lively and charming. ‘Drugs are everywhere in society and people can potentially bring drugs onto the wards. We’ve even had reports in the past of drug dealers hanging around our hospitals. ‘It’s very important for us to ensure our hospital environments are as safe as they can be and Coco is another tool in the box. ‘If there are any concerns or suspicions then staff get in touch with the security team and they send John and Coco along and she will do a search. ‘Drugs and mental illness don’t mix and we need to do everything we can. There is only a small proportion of incidents but they can have a huge impact on vulnerable patients.’ Coco has been working at the hospital for five weeks and bosses say they were inspired by a similar scheme at South West London and St Georges trust, which hired a sniffer dog two years ago. Managers at that trust say since Paddy - a springer spaniel - arrived the presence of drugs on the wards has been drastically reduced and violence has also gone down as he has a ‘calming’ effect. Figures show the number of assaults on staff fell from 368 a year in 2008/9, before Paddy arrived, to 217 last year. Potential sniffer dogs are selected from the litter when they are just eight weeks old and trainers’ check their sense of smell by getting them to hunt for hidden toys. Usually Spaniels, Border Collies, Labradors and German Shepherds are trained-up as they have particularly strong senses of smell, an instinct for hunting as well as being very athletic. The dogs live with their handlers -usually police officers - and have a career of between eight and ten years. Gary O’Hare, director of nursing and operations at the trust, said: ‘Coco and John have been an excellent addition to our staff teams and have already made a massive difference to the way we deal with the problem of illegal drug misuse across our services. ‘The safety of our patients and staff is our main priority and this scheme will ensure we can continue to offer a safe and supportive environment for those receiving treatment, whilst giving people the confidence to report anything they find suspicious, either in our buildings or anywhere in our grounds.’ Dozens of hospitals are flouting government guidelines by allowing ambulance-chasing law firms to tout for business on their premises. At least 40 NHS trusts – around a quarter of the total – are letting personal injury firms display posters and leaflets in hospital wards and A&E departments to encourage patients to sue. Some hospitals are receiving tens of thousands of pounds each, according to Sky News. This is despite Department of Health guidelines, issued repeatedly since 2004, warning that the practice must end. It says there is ‘no place’ for such advertising, which raises ‘false expectations of large compensation payouts for minor injuries or that directly or indirectly promotes the bringing of frivolous claims’. The adverts are blamed for fuelling the compensation culture which saw claims against the NHS rise 20 per cent last year. It emerged recently that the health service has had to set aside more than £20billion for future negligence claims. As recently as February last year, NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson told trusts the advertising was ‘unwelcome’ and ‘should not be supported’.","Latest weapon in a hospital trust's fight against drug dealers is a spaniel .

Off to jail: Samantha Kidd sprinted into Brighton Magistrates' Court today, where she was jailed for five months for beating her disabled husband Eddie Kidd . The estranged wife of former motor-cycle stunt rider Eddie Kidd has been jailed for five months for beating the severely disabled star. Samantha Kidd, 44, had pleaded guilty to four counts of assaulting her wheelchair-bound husband, including punching and kicking him, throttling him and calling him ‘a f****** spastic’. The former James Bond stuntman sustained brain damage in 1996 when a jump went wrong. He also broke his neck and pelvis. Mr Kidd, 54, who has three children from previous marriages, has since been unable to talk or walk unaided and requires full-time care. Mrs Kidd was arrested for domestic . violence in December after her husband’s family reported her to police . days after the couple split up. Prosecutor Suzanne Soros said that on . one occasion Kidd was left shaking and 'absolutely hysterical' by . her actions. Kidd, of Seaford, East Sussex, dressed in a floral dress, showed no emotion as district judge William Ashworth sentenced her to five months in prison, concurrent on each count, and imposed a restraining order. Mr Kidd, who was previously married to Hot Gossip dancer Debbie Ash and ex-Stringfellows nightclub waitress Sarah Carr, first met his wife in 1988. They met again at a party in Mayfair in 2004, and have been married for more than five years. The court heard that the former actress, who once appeared in children’s TV series Byker Grove,  assaulted her husband three times at their home in Seaford, East Sussex, and once in Southampton between July and October last year.

Mrs Kidd was arrested for domestic violence in December after her husband's family reported her to police days after the couple split up . Sentencing: Samantha Kidd is protected by supporters as she arrived at court in Brighton today . Protected: Two men, described as minders by people at court, accompanied Mrs Kidd today . As she entered court, Kidd covered herself with an umbrella as she was ushered in by several burly minders. Opening the prosecution case, Ms Soros said: 'The Crown says this was a course of conduct against a man who is suffering with severe disability.' In one incident, Kidd rained a series of blows on him after she was woken up, according to a witness.Kidd told him: 'For f***'s sake, Eddie. How do you expect me to sleep?' Ms Soros said Kidd continued with 'a barrage of abuse and swearing' before launching a quick succession of half a dozen blows to his face and head. The witness said in a statement that Kidd had appeared to have 'lost the plot' and had to be forced off him. Ms Soros said that by his demeanour, Eddie Kidd appeared to be 'shaken up' by the incident. She added: 'He was completely unable to defend himself from the attack from Sam or take any action to protect his face or head.' On another occasion, Ms Soros said Kidd kicked Mr Kidd in retaliation after a carer had difficulty helping him out of a car and into a wheelchair. She also slapped his chest and called him a 'f****** spastic', a remark she claimed was what he referred to himself as, the court was told. Ms Soros said: 'The slap was described by the witness as being very aggressive to Mr Kidd's chest.' Happier times: Samantha and Eddie Kidd before it emerged they had split in December . In a separate incident, the court heard Kidd slapped Mr Kidd's face in 'retaliation and frustration' at his hand coming off a rail and coming into contact with her. Ms Soros said: 'In hindsight, she accepts that her view of that had been distorted by her stress and alcohol consumption at the time.' On another occasion, a witness heard Mr Kidd call out to them, and found Kidd with her hands round the front of his throat. The witness yelled out: 'What the f*** do you think you're doing?', the court heard. A struggle ensued and Kidd had to be forced to let go of her estranged husband who was 'absolutely hysterical', Ms Soros said. Well-known figure: Eddie Kidd raised more than . £100,00 for charity when he walked the London Marathon in 2011, left . with his wife Samantha and right, with a carer after they split . Alissa Scott-Beckett, defending, said Kidd had no intention of rekindling a relationship with the former stunt rider. However, she said she would like them to be friends in the future, and that Mr Kidd had sent her text messages asking to meet up, which she had resisted. Ms Scott-Beckett said Mr Kidd had suffered a 'serious deterioration' in his physical state, leading Kidd to binge drinking. She added: 'She found herself still loving Mr Kidd but not being able to mentally cope with the stresses that the relationship had. 'She found herself in a coping strategy of excessive alcohol consumption. That is now thankfully under control but that is the way she felt she was able to cope with the situation.' Ms Scott-Beckett said the situation had been brought about by the 'circumstances of the relationship' and Kidd's inability to cope. She went on, saying that Kidd - who has no previous convictions - herself had been a victim in what was a 'volatile and difficult' relationship but that she accepted responsibility for the offences. Brave: Stunt motorcycle rider Eddie Kidd jumping five cars in his heyday before he was left paralysed . Action man: In his prime Eddie Kidd was one of the most famous stunt riders in the world until he suffered serious head and pelvic injuries after a failed stunt jump in 1996 which left him unable to walk . Since she had entered her pleas, Kidd has been abused and assaulted in the street which had exacerbated mental health concerns, Ms Scott-Beckett said. She added: 'Mrs Kidd has suffered from considerable mental anguish. She apologises profusely to any mental stress this has caused him.' After sentence was passed, Ms Scott-Beckett asked for Kidd to be freed on bail pending the outcome of an appeal. But district judge Ashworth said: 'I have agonised about this sentence and bail is not appropriate.'The judge said Kidd had committed an 'abuse of trust and power'. And he said: 'These four assaults on Eddie Kidd represent a pattern of violent behaviour towards your husband which, taken together, are in the highest bracket for sentencing guidelines because your husband was particularly vulnerable and due to the repeated assaults on a disabled person.' He added: 'Whatever you felt about his disability, you didn't shy away from raining six punches on him or slapping, kicking and throttling him so much that you had to be pulled off him.'","Samantha Kidd, 44, admits assaulting wheelchair-bound star last year .

With its stone walls, picket gate and stunning views of the surrounding countryside, it seemed the perfect rural home. But this 200-year-old cottage opposite a village church concealed a sinister secret – an illegal drugs factory. In a underground bunker dug beneath the house’s patio decking, a gang was growing cannabis, processing cocaine and dealing in guns. This pretty cottage in Kilmersdon, Somerset, turned out to have a drugs bunker hidden under garden decking . Pretty setting: The gang had dug out the 50ft garden of the £350,000 cottage, which was rented by one of their members, and hid the entrance under patio decking . After a complex police investigation 11 men were jailed for a total of 70 years as for conspiracy to supply drugs and firearms. Yesterday neighbours said they had no idea the £350,000 cottage, in Kilmersdon, Somerset, was being used for crime. Percival Fowler, 91, said: ‘People . were always coming and going and they used to have meetings, but we had . no idea why. The house was always very busy, quite often there were . people in there and quite a lot of them went down into the garden. ‘I never suspected it was a drugs . bunker … They kept themselves to themselves.

He added: ‘It’s quite a small village so it came as a bit of a shock really when we saw the police cars.’ Detectives discovered the bunker in January 2011 following a surveillance operation involving drug suspect Mike Gorham. When they raided the home they found . the 55-year-old hiding in the makeshift underground room with the gang’s . ringleader, Steve Tamblyn, 29. Police uncovered 76 cannabis plants . worth £33,000, a small amount of cocaine and a hydraulic press used to . process the class A substance. Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It was shocking, to say the least. ‘I was in the church helping to set something up and when I came out there was a police van outside the house.’ Geoffrey Goold, left, and Ben Taylor, right, were jailed for three and four years respectively for the racket . Alan Pinner, 40, left, was jailed for three years and Scott Heal, 28, right, for two-and-a-half years .

A harrowing picture of the four foot metal box two marijuana growers kept a 15-year-old girl they used as a sex slave has been released for the first time. The photograph of the unnamed rape victim's coffin-like prison was shown in court today as her alleged captors Ryan Balletto, 30, and Patrick Pearmain 24, appeared before a judge in Northern California. The two men face charges of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants. In addition, Pearmain faces charges of kidnapping to commit robbery or rape and unlawful sex with a minor and Balletto faces charges of lewd and lascivious acts with a child. Scroll down for video . Toolbox: A harrowing picture of the four foot metal box, above, two marijuana growers kept a 15-year-old girl they used as a sex slave has been released for the first time . Authorities said the men locked the girl in the four feet long, two feet wide and two feet high box to stop her ruining the 'mission,' their code word for the marijuana operation. The box was hoisted at an angle and a hose was inserted 'to wash her off and rinse human waste from the inside of the box without letting her out,' police said. The girl's current whereabouts or condition were not revealed. According to court records, the suspects appeared before a federal judge during a three-minute hearing on Wednesday but entered no pleas. The two are scheduled to be arranged on Friday in federal court. The teen went missing in Los Angeles in April and was discovered a month later at the marijuana farm after a large-scale drug bust. Captors: 30-year-old Ryan Balletto, left, and 25-year-old Patrick Pearmain, right, were arrested in May after the girl they kidnapped called police, and authorities traced the call to a motel in Sacramento . Kidnapped: A girl who went missing in April in Los Angeles ended up being used as a sex slave on a marijuana farm in Northern California until she was rescued on May 1 . Prisoner: Balletto and Pearmain kept the girl locked in a 4-foot by 2-foot metal toolbox, sometimes for days at a time . The Los Angeles Police Department . described the 15-year-old girl as a runaway. They believe she was . kidnapped by Balletto and his associate Pearmain5, and taken to their . growing operation in Lake County, California. According . to a criminal complaint, when the girl wasn't being used to harvest . marijuana she was locked for days at a time in the tiny prison. The toolbox had holes punched in it so she could breathe, and a blanket. Another hole was drilled into the box so they could a run a hose through it to clean out human waste without letting her out. It was spray-painted with 'an animal skull surrounding the shadow image of a human skull with the logo 'bone collector.' After her rescue the girl recalled two occasions where she was in the box for three days. Apparently Balletto called her a 'trooper' for not screaming in the box. She was also told 'not to (expletive) up' because the men had a 'whole lot of money on the (marijuana) grow.' Trooper: According to the criminal complaint, Balletto called the girl a 'trooper' for not screaming in the box . In addition to the toolbox, police . found a homemade wooden rack used for sexual bondage, a noose , two . dildos, and a white towel with blood stains on it. LAPD . contacted the Lake County Police Department, saying Balletto may have . been responsible for the girl's kidnapping. Officers showed up at . Balletto's house on April 29, asking about the teen. The next day the girl called the police to report that she was okay. Authorities were able to trace that call to the girls location at a west Sacramento motel, where the two men were arrested and the teen transferred to protective custody. While arresting the men, police found a notebook with what seems to be a script written for the girl for her phone call to police. 'They think I'm missing' and 'I just want to make sure Ryan Balletto doesn't get in any trouble' are two of the lines from the script. The girl told investigators that both men had sex with her, and that it was consensual with Pearmain. Since she is a minor, officers informed her that she is 'legally unable' to consent to sex with an adult. Horde: Police found a huge arsenal of weapons during a raid on the growing operation and Balletto's home . The sex with Balletto, she said, was 'not as consensual' and that she did it to 'help him out.' Federal investigators believe there may be more victims. Police . later raided Balletto's grow operation and home where they found 1,400 . pot plants, $4,000 in cash, and 'the largest and most sophisticated bulk . of weapons seized in recent (department) history.' They found a cache of 22 firearms, including high-powered military-grade sniper and assault rifles, automatic assault rifles and pistols. Many of the firearms were already loaded. Along with the firearms they found military-grade body armor and scopes, high-capacity magazines and ammunition. Girlfriend arrested: Balletto's girlfriend Christa McConnell was also arrested. She faces child endangerment charges for leaving loaded weapons within reach of her five children . Authorities found most of the firearms in a safe at Balletto's house. A ponytail of hair was also found in the safe. Balletto's girlfriend, 27-year-old Christa McConnell, was arrested during the raid on the home. McConnell has five children with Balletto, according to the criminal complaint. During their raid they found a 7-month-old baby sleeping on the master bed with a loaded gun only two-feet away from the headboard. All five children were placed in the custody of Lake County Child Protective Services. McConnell faces child-endangerment and weapons charges. Last year, Lake County had 87 cases of residents cultivating marijuana. According to public information releases posted on the Sheriff's Office website, police have already eradicated nearly 60,000 pot plants just this month. 'Some in our community believe that marijuana grow operations are run by compassionate caregivers interested only in supplying medicine to the sick, U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag said in a written statement. 'Unfortunately, this case illustrates what we in law enforcement see - marijuana grow operations that include heavily armed, violent individuals, motivated by profit, carrying out abuse of vulnerable victims.'","The 15-year-old went missing in April from the Los Angeles area .

Ryanair will increase its baggage charges until no-one can afford to take luggage for the hold, the budget airline’s flamboyant boss said today. Michael O'Leary who admits to himself paying 'a fortune' in excess baggage, added it was likely that ‘at some point’ airlines would start charging even for hand luggage. His plan to price bags of his airline . was revealed a news conference in London. Mr O'Leary said that Ryanair . had already increased its charge for hold luggage by £20 for the summer . period to catch out holidaymakers. Rising prices: Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has revealed the airline will increase its baggage charges until no-one can afford to take luggage for the hold - and it's already increase its hold luggage charge by £20 this summer . Asked . what was the logic behind charging people more for the summer period, . he replied: 'That's when they are likely to bring more bags.' Mr O'Leary went on: ‘We will keep increasing charges until we get rid of (hold) bags.' He . said Ryanair had reduced the number of its passengers who checked in . hold baggage from 80 per cent  to 19 per cent and that this was saving . the airline ‘a fortune in money’. But he accepted that some passengers would always want to bring big bags that needed to go in the hold. He . said: ‘We will never get rid of (hold) bags but I would be disappointed . if we don't get our figure for (hold) bags down from around 20 per cent . to 10 per cent.’ Asked . if Ryanair would consider charging for hand luggage, Mr O'Leary said: . ‘At some point in the future I think it's likely that airlines will do . it but I can't get my head round how you would do it. I think it's . unlikely that we will do it.’ Carry-on only: Passengers wait to check-in at the Ryanair desk in Stansted. Passengers will still be able to bring hold luggage but it will become increasingly expensive as Ryanair tries to reduce the number of hold bags . Mr O'Leary's airline makes a fortune charging for extras’ and has even threatened charging passengers to use the toilet and to introduce ‘standing room’ style upright seats to boost passenger numbers. This week the airline said it had ordered pilots to fly slower – adding two minutes to journeys – to save about £70million a year in fuel costs. Asked if he was considering reducing the amount of air conditioning on his flights, Mr O'Leary said: ‘No. Even I would not do that.' Last year he admitted to Management Today magazine:’ Of course I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage.’ Ryanair also plans to offer advertising space on its planes  Asked if he would take an advert from low-fare rival airline easyJet Mr O'Leary replied: 'I would take an advert from anyone, even the UK Competition Commission (CC). Ryanair has been battling the Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities since 2006 in his efforts to take over Irish carrier Aer Lingus. Budget: A Ryanair jet taking off from Stansted Airport. Mr O'Leary this week ordered pilots to fly slower, adding two minutes to journeys, to save £70million-a-year in fuel costs . He said the Commission’s inquiry into the proposed takeover was ‘misguided’ and 'a political farce which has no case, no evidence and no credibility either’. Ryanair said that from the end of October it was adding one extra daily flight to its five main Ireland-UK routes - from Dublin to Stansted, to Manchester, to Birmingham, to Edinburgh and to Bristol. This is in direct response to similar flight increases recently announced by Aer Lingus. Cash generated from ‘extras’ -  known as ‘ancillary revenue’  or the industry term for any income that doesn’t come from selling seats -  was up by 25 per cent to £308million. This was helped by a boost from extra charges for allocated seating and priority boarding, as well as higher credit card fees. The decision to allow passengers to reserve a seat for a higher price echoes rival easyJet, where the extra option has also proved a success. It imposes a £70 fine on travellers who forget to print out their boarding passes online – adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of a family holiday for those who fall foul. And the cost of  changing the name on a ticket is £110. Ryanair’s outspoken chief executive Mr O’Leary has in the past branded those who don’t like paying for having their boarding cards printed out as 'idiots' who  should ‘b***** off’. But the opinionated airline chief has no sympathy for other passengers who fall foul of his tightly drawn rules. He criticised Berkshire mother-of-two Mrs Suzy McLeod who received backing from nearly half a million Facebook users when she was forced to pay £236 to print boarding passes for her family so they could fly home to Britain from Alicante, Spain. He said: ’So she gets on 'the Twitter' to complain. Emboldened by the rising tide of support, Mrs McLeod asks for compensation, to which we replied politely but firmly, thank you, Mrs McLeod, but it was your f***-up. We're not changing our policy.’ Three years ago competition watchdogs at the Office of Fair Trading accused Ryanair of ‘puerile, almost childish’ behaviour in the way it imposed unexpected charges.","Michael O'Leary said it was likely airlines will start charging for hand luggage .

Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is thinking about helming a Supreme Court challenge to the National Security Agency's recently uncovered program of phone and Internet surveillance of its private citizens. The government's monitoring program called Prism was launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to prevent future terrorist activity. Paul spoke out in the wake of the program coming to light, claiming that Prism is an invasion of citizen's civil liberties and announced his intention to get voter's signatures on a class-action lawsuit which he will bring to the Supreme Court. Scroll down for video. Republican Senator Rand Paul announced his intention to bring a class-action suit to the Supreme Court against the government's Prism program, which monitors citizen's phone and Internet records . A Libertarian Senator, Paul supports less government and claims that the phone and internet monitoring program is an infringement American's right to privacy, . 'The Founding Fathers didn’t want that,' he told Fox News Sunday. 'I think the American people are with me. Young people who use computers are with me.' On the news program Rand unveiled his plan to urge all Internet and phone providers to ask their customers to join in in a class-action lawsuit. 'If we get 10 million Americans saying we don’t want our phone records looked at, then maybe someone will wake up and something will change in Washington,' he said. The information surveillance program was exposed last week by The Guardian, who released details of the top secret court order issued to Verizon in April, requiring that the company turn over phone records to the government on an 'ongoing daily basis.' Rand Paul announced on Fox News Sunday that he would like to bring a Supreme Court challenge against the government's phone and Internet surveillance program of its private citizens . The court order mandated that the company give the numbers of both parties on the call, their locations, call duration, and the time the calls were placed, though the call's contents were not revealed or recorded. The telephone company was told to record their subscribers information whether they were suspected of a crime or not, resulting in roughly three billion phone records being turned over a day. 'That doesn’t look like a modest invasion of privacy,' Paul told Fox. 'I have no problem if you have probable cause … but we’re talking about trolling through a billion phone records a day.' One of Paul's biggest objections to the program is that the government is using a general warrant to obtain the data, as opposed to a specific warrant targeting specific suspects. Paul argued that this violates the Fourth Amendment with prevents unreasonable search and seizure of citizens. He also alleged on the program that the massive amount of data gathering is actually hindering the government's targeting of terrorists, as they are overwhelmed by the volume of audio conversations and cannot pinpoint specific criminal correspondence. President Obama defended the government's surveillance program saying 'you can't have 100 per cent security and also 100 per cent privacy' Paul first spoke out against Prism when it was brought to light last week, calling the NSA's program an 'astounding assault on the Constitution,' The Huffington Post reported. He condemned the Obama administration, calling his government 'authoritarianism,' and criticizing the new surveillance tactics as being harsher than anything President Bush used during his time in office . 'The irony is that people voted for President Obama hoping for something different,' he said. 'That's why a lot of people I think are disappointed in the president.' Meanwhile, the President and several Senators have come out in defense of the information monitoring. 'You can't have 100 per cent security and also then have 100 per cent privacy and zero inconvenience,' Fox News quoted President Obama as saying. 'We're going to have to make some choices as a society.' Senator Dianne Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, spoke in favor of the information monitoring programming claiming that it helped to keep America safe against further terrorist attacks . 'Terrorists will come after us if they can and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence, senator Dianne Feinstein, Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee said in a press conference. 'It's to ferret this out before this happens. It's called protecting America. I think people want the homeland kept safe.' Washington officials have acknowledged that all branches of the federal government were aware of the Prism act being carried out over the past few months under the Patriot Act, the Huffington Post reported. However Paul still has strong objections to the way in which the government has been gathering its data against terrorists. 'I've been saying for a long time that we ought to obey the Constitution and the Bill of Rights,' The Huffington Post reported that Paul said in a statement. 'I'm all for going after terrorists, I'm all for going after criminals, but I think you go to a judge and you ask for a warrant specified to a person. You shouldn't look at millions and millions.'

Parents are using iPads and tablet computers as ‘electronic babysitters’, research revealed yesterday. The tablet has become the go-to device to occupy youngsters with 91 per cent of families who own one admitting their child uses it, or even has one of their own. Some 50 per cent admitted that their child uses a tablet every day and 17 per cent confessed that their son or daughter turns it on several times a day. Screen test: The tablet has become the go-to device to occupy youngsters with 91 per cent of families who own one admitting their child uses it, or even has one of their own . An Ofcom report looking at how we communicate found that children are using a tablet to watch films, play games and do their homework from the age of five. But a clinical psychologist yesterday warned relying on such devices put children at risk of developing a string of health problems. According to the Ofcom survey which questioned 3,700 UK residents, live TV accounted for 90 per cent of all viewing in 2012. The average viewer enjoys four hours of TV a day and ‘the living room has been transformed into a digital media hub’. Although 41 per cent of households have cut back to just one television set, an increasing number are choosing to watch programmes on tablets. One in four households has at least one tablet computer with 56 per cent of them being used to watch TV live, YouTube or catch-up services. Starting young: An Ofcom report looking at how we communicate found that children are using a tablet to watch films, play games and do their homework from the age of five . It means many families are sitting in the living room together but all watching different content on different devices. Families are watching TV on increasingly larger screens, according to Ofcom. A slow decline in the number of 26-32 inch screens being bought has made way for a surge in the demand for bigger models of 43 inches or more. The so-called ‘jumbo’ sets made up 15.8 per cent of sales in the first quarter of this year – more than triple the amount sold in 2008. Some 41 per cent of households have chosen to invest in just one television and the number of children with TVs in their bedroom has dropped by 17 per cent. In the first quarter of this year, 52 per cent had a TV in their room compared with 69 per cent in 2007. The report also revealed that the rise of electronic communication has prompted a boom in mail revenue. Four in ten of those surveyed said they had received a parcel in the last month, reflecting the growing popularity of online shopping. A similar number said they had sent a personal letter recently and 58 per cent an invitation, greetings card or postcard. As a result the post industry secured revenue of £7.2billion in 2012, a 7 per cent rise on the previous year. While . this might resolve the issue of remote control battles, clinical . psychologist Linda Blair warned that missing out on the shared . experience of programme watching could have a negative impact. Dr Blair said: ‘There is so much more . loneliness these days because we’re missing out on physical contact with . others and this is just another example. ‘The . move away from the shared message, so that you have something to talk . about afterwards, is an obvious flaw if you have a family all watching . different things and my worry is that this will lead to the ignoring of . the people who really matter.’ She added: ‘The light that is emitted from our electronic devices affects the melatonin levels in our body and makes us much more alert and wakeful than we want to be and is one of the main contributions to insomnia now. ‘I get a huge number of kids who are unable to concentrate, or can’t get to sleep at night and one of the key things we work on is reducing screen time.’ The report also found that when people do choose to watch programmes on a television set, they will often be doing something else on a tablet, smart phone or laptop simultaneously. According to the report, more than 50 per cent of viewers divide their attention between watching the TV screen and surfing the net, talking to friends or shopping online, and 25 per cent take to social networking sites such as Twitter to discuss what they are watching. Ofcom’s director of research, James Thickett, said: ‘Just a few years ago, we would be talking about last night’s TV at work or at school. 'Now, we’re having those conversations live while watching TV – using social media, text and instant messaging.’","Some 91% families who own iPad or other tablet admit child uses device .

A British father-of-two has died in a head-on rickshaw collision during a trip to India where he was attending his father's funeral. Aji Vengalil Joseph, 43, sustained catastrophic head injuries when he was flung from the three-wheeled taxi as it smashed into another rickshaw. The vehicle landed on him and he was left in a coma for 17 days before he died. The accident happened the day before he was due to return home to Swindon, Wiltshire, after his father's funeral in Kerala, south west India.

'After the accident happened they took him to the hospital but I was told he actually walked from the ambulance into casualty. 'The hospital initially felt that the bleeding was less, so were pleased not to have an operation, but after one or two days he did not get better and they chose to operate. 'They then saw there was a vein broken in his brain and it became too dangerous to re-operate. It was then after two or three days the doctors said that he was brain dead.' The smash happened on July 3 after Mr Joseph and his brother had returned a rented car to the town of Kallara, a small town in the Kottayam district of Kerala.

A Mercedes grand prix race car driven to victory by racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio sold at auction today for a world record £19.6million. The Mercedes-Benz W196 won the German and Swiss grands prix during the 1954 season where the Argentinian driver claimed the second of his five world titles. Despite being one of the 'most significant motor cars of the 20th century', the unrestored Formula 1 car was left in a warehouse for decades before today's auction at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. The Mercedes W196 driven by Juan Manuel Fangio has sold for £19.6million at the Goodwood Festival of Speed . The unrestored Formula 1 car is 'a piece of mechanical jewellery' according to one motoring historian . The car was raced to victory by Fangio during the 1954 Formula 1 season, where he claimed his second world title . Collectors from three continents vied to be the highest bidder for the vehicle, which had been expected to fetch £10million by experts who said 'there were no parallels' in the market. The untouched condition of the Mercedes only added to its value, with its 'patina' - character - appealing to collectors. The final sale total reached £19.6million after the hammer went down at £17.5million. It smashed the previous £10.8million record set by a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa prototype in 2011. The German-made car, chassis number 00006/54, sold to a private buyer over the telephone, auctioneers Bonhams said. Fangio, who died in 1995 aged 84, won the world championship five times and is regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of motorsport. The car contains many features which were . innovative in the 1950s, including a fuel-injected engine, a . lightweight chassis weighing only 72lb and all-round inboard-mounted . brakes. The Mercedes W196 had independent suspension and a straight-eight engine which helped minimise its overall height. At the Swiss GP Fangio raced ahead to beat his nearest rival - Ferrari's Jose Froilan Gonzalez - by 58.7 seconds. The 'patina' - character - of the car only made it more attractive to potential buyers . The race-winning Mercedes languished in a warehouse for decades before today's auction . Fangio, who died in 1995 and won five world championships, is considered to be the first superstar F1 driver . Nicknamed El Maestro, Fangio once . said: 'When I was in a racing car, I always liked to see exactly where . the wheels were pointing. 'I asked for a version with no . bodywork covering the wheels for the Nurburgring race, and in no time . Mercedes had built one - and I drove it to win the German Grand Prix.' Motoring historian Doug Nye said Fangio would shake his head and smile a 'slow smile' if he were alive to see today's auction. 'He was a humble man, originally a mechanic from a potato town in Argentina, and he never forgot his roots,' said Mr Nye. 'As a driver, he was simply a genius. As a man he had no enemies. He was . universally loved, even by those he regularly beat on track. No . standard-setting sportsman could have a better epitaph. Bonhams chairman Robert Brooks is seen peering under the bonnet of the 2.5litre car before the auction . The car was sold to a private collector in the 1980s and then to a German businessman . The £19.6million total smashed the previous £10.8million record set by a 1957 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa Prototype in 2011 . After the 1954 season, Fangio's Mercedes W196 appeared at the following year's Italian grand prix but suffered gearbox failure. It was re-prepared to full race standard later that year and consigned to the Daimler-Benz Museum in Germany. In June 1965 it was exhibited in Munich and during 1966 it was shown at Le Mans in France and Hockenheim in Germany. It then appeared at the 1967 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, before being run in a tyre test at the Unterturkheim factory test-track and displayed in Berlin. In November 1967 it was exhibited at Stuttgart University. The car made further appearances in Luxembourg, Berlin and Hamburg in 1969 and was eventually presented to the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, Hampshire, in the 1970s. It was sold to a private collector in the 1980s and then into the ownership of a German businessman. 'Mercedes has long been recognised for the world-class quality of its . products and in 1954/55 they set out to rebuild their reputation for . automotive excellence post-war.' Mr Nye said the car was a 'window into the past'. He said: 'In every area of the car, . there is evidence of just the most fantastic workmanship. It was . designed by very sophisticated, hi-tech engineers. 'But more than that it was made by . ordinary working men who did a brilliant job. 'It's hand crafted and it's . just like a piece of mechanical jewellery.' Bonhams chairman Robert Brooks said: 'I have handled some of the world's most desirable and important motor cars during a motoring auction career spanning five decades, but I have reached a peak today with this legendary grand prix car. 'It was a personal privilege to preside over the sale of this vehicle, which is not only one of the most significant motor cars of the 20th century, but also the most important historic Grand Prix racing car ever offered for sale.' The auction house said the Mercedes is one of the most significant cars of the 20th century and the most important historic Grand Prix racing car offered at public auction. Potential buyers from three continents had shown interest in the vehicle, which was sold with noticeable blemishes. James Knight, group motoring director . at Bonhams, said: 'We had eight telephone bidders at the start of the . bidding and we had three people in the audience, so we had more than ten . people who were prepared to spend. 'Of those 11 bidders, only five got the chance to bid. 'We always knew that it was a very, very important car.'

Death: Isobel Reilly died at a party where she found drugs in flat belonging to Brian Dodgeon and Angela Hadjipateras, who were 70 miles away . A coroner today blamed a lecturer and his partner for the death of a 15-year-old schoolgirl who took an ecstasy overdose at an unsupervised party at their home. Isobel Reilly collapsed in a shaking fit and foamed at the mouth after taking two high-purity ecstasy pills and powder she had found stashed in a bedroom closet. The teenager, already in trouble for cannabis use, begged friends not to call 999, and when paramedics were finally summoned it was too late to save her. Coroner Fiona Wilcox said lecturer Brian Dodgeon and his partner Angela Hadjipateras were guilty of serious failures for leaving Isobel and her friends alone at their house, in Kensington, west London, while they went to another party, 70 miles away in Hastings. She issued a damning narrative verdict after hearing Dodgeon, 62, a self-confessed ‘old hippy’, had kept ecstasy, MDMA, ketamine, and LSD unsecured in the house for years. Despite teenagers getting drunk and smoking cannabis at previous parties at his home, Dodgeon claimed he never considered someone may hunt out his drugs stash. ‘I find if the party had been supervised by Angela and Brian, as they had done for all previous parties, even if they had just come home around midnight or just after, Isobel would not have died’, said Dr Wilcox, at Westminster Coroners Court. ‘She would not have taken ecstasy tablets that ultimately took her life.’ The couple knew Isobel and a group of teenage friends would be partying at their home when they left for the night, on April 22, 2011. They only made a last minute phone call to a neighbour, asking her to be ‘on call’ for a small gathering at their house. But the coroner found serious failures by Dodgeon and Hadjipateras, but rejected a verdict of negligence or unlawful killing because she judged their failure to supervise the party or secure Dodgeon’s drugs had not been ‘gross’. Blame: Lecturer Brian Dodgeon and his partner Angela Hadjipateras were 70 miles away and the coroner said today: 'If the party had been supervised Isobel would not have died' Isobel and others discovered Dodgeon’s drugs after rummaging through his bedroom cupboards between 12.30am and 1am. The schoolgirl, who had been drinking vodka and Strongbow cider during the party, is thought to have swallowed two high-purity pills from the tin of narcotic. Around an hour later, her body temperature rocketed to deadly levels as she began sweating profusely, constantly moving around, and talking incessantly. Death: The Kensington home of lecturer Brian Dodgeon where he kept drugs but insisted they would be 'virtually impossible' for the teenagers to find . One friend, who had also taken ecstasy that night, said: ‘She was all over the place, people came and told me she was out of it. ‘She was crawling and rolling over the bed. At one point, I saw her banging at the window of the bedroom.’ Pals told the inquest Isobel, who was already receiving drug counselling at school for cannabis use, pleaded with them not to call an ambulance when she first began acting strangely. Dr Avalon Probst, a consultant at Charing Cross Hospital, said Isobel could have been saved if paramedics had been called immediately. ‘The fact we have a description of a person not right for about an hour, there is a window there’, she said. ‘Had that been taken, this life might have been saved.’ But it was not until after 4am that someone dialled 999, and when paramedics arrived, Isobel’s face was already stiff and her body temperature had reached 41 degrees Celsius. The Chiswick Community School pupil was rushed to hospital but died later that morning. Dodgeon, who tried to kill himself by jumping off a road bridge in east London a week after Isobel died, wiped away a tear as he offered an apology to the teenager’s parents. Turning to Lynne Jones and Patrick Reilly, sitting in the front row of the court, he said in evidence: ‘I am so sorry about what happened. ‘All I can say was at the time I didn’t feel as though it was irresponsible to have left the party unsupervised.’ He added: ‘In retrospect, I very much regret I had drugs at all and I made that decision.’ Hearing: An inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court in London heard that the schoolgirl would 'probably' have survived if she had received medical attention when she first started to feel unwell . Untimely death: Flowers and candles were left in tribute to the schoolgirl near her home after she died from taking up to three ecstasy tablets . But Dodgeon, a research fellow at the University of London’s Institute of Education, continued to insist it was not reckless to leave the party unsupervised. ‘At the time, it didn’t seem likely that anybody would come into our bedroom and start systematically looking through the drawers’, he said. ‘There was a 0.1 per cent chance of anyone finding those drugs, there is also a 0.1 per cent chance that someone might turn the cooker on and some kind of gas malfunction causes a fire and people die.’ Ms Hadjipateras told the inquest she believed it was a ‘manageable risk’ when they left the party of more than 20 teenagers alone for the night. They had asked a neighbour to be ‘on call’ during the party, and she claimed to not know exactly where Dodgeon kept his drug stash herself. But Dr Wilcox ruled it was ‘highly likely’ Ms Hadjipateras knew about the drugs in the house. ‘I find it difficult to believe didn’t know there were drugs in that house, they had been living together and sharing that bedroom for fifteen years’, she said. ‘I have consider this was an explanation put together after the event to try to avoid culpability failing on Ms Hadjipateras, but I can’t come to a firm conclusion on that.’ Ms Jones, Isobel’s mother, told the court she would never allowed Isobel to go to the party, in Kensington, had she known it was unsupervised. ‘We know young people put themselves in risky situations, particularly if there are no adults around and if they know no adults of coming back’, she said. ‘I think it is pretty obvious so many things could have gone wrong and I’m not even thinking about drugs, but young people bringing in alcohol, older kids finding out and breaking into the house, and accidents happening. ‘I do think we were naive, but we clearly thought at that age, children would not be left unsupervised.’ Mourning: Friends and family release balloons in memory of the schoolgirl whose temperature soared to 41.7C after taking the drugs . Dr Wilcox said rejected parts of Dodgeon and Hadjipateras’ evidence, accusing them of ‘post event justification’ for their actions and for being inconsistent. ‘They appeared to state they wanted to give the impression they might be coming back, but considered against the evidence, I make a finding of fact that there was a general understanding they would be away for the night’, she said. ‘The evidence of Brian Dodgeon and Angela Hadjipateras I do not accept, I find it was post event justification.’ She recorded a narrative verdict which concluded: ‘Leaving the stash unsecured and the party unsupervised were both serious failures ... and led to the death.’ In a statement released after the inquest into Isobel’s death, her parents said: ‘They knowingly left a party of 14 and 15-year-olds all night, with a substantial quantity of class A drugs in an unlocked cupboard. 'We thought Isobel was in a safe place, somewhere she had stayed before and we would not have let her go if we had known it was to be unsupervised. ‘What is so painful was for us to learn that, if a responsible adult had been there to call an ambulance early enough, Isobel’s life could have been saved.’","Isobel Reilly attended party at home of Brian Dodgeon and Angela Hadjipateras .

The gang is also suspected of planning on setting the six-week-old kitten on fire before a passer-by intervened and saved the cat's life. The kitten, which has been named Chester, is now being cared for at Wear Valley and Darlington Cats Protection. The man, who did not want to be named, was driving through Chester-le-Street, in County Durham, when he saw the teenagers 'messing about'. He said: 'I was working in Chester-le-Street and was lost. I pulled up to make a phone call and saw the youths messing about. 'I got out and took the kitten off them while they shouted abuse at me. The kitten was traumatised - these people are just imbeciles and cruel. 'I suppose I saved it’s life. It was lucky I was in a van and higher up so I saw it, because if i had been in a car then I would not have seen it.' The youths are believed to have been about 14-years-old. Marion Maychell, a volunteer co-ordinator at the cat rescue charity, said: 'We are hoping that the kitten is going to be ok. 'I did not think it would make it through the first night. We will look after the kitten until we can home it. 'It is scary that people could do this. They may have been covering it in oil to set it alight. I think the man that rescured the kitten is a hero. 'Thankfully incidents like this are rare, but we are seeing an increase in them.' The kitten is thought to be about six weeks old. Rescued: Chester with Marion Maychell, volunteer co-ordinator at Wear Valley and Darlington Cats Protection . Vet Jeremy Demeyre, of the Wilson Veterinary Group, in Bishop Auckland, said: 'We washed the kitten and clipped its fur. I think he swallowed some oil. 'He may be alright, but problems may arise in the next few days. This is the first case I have had where someone has tried to drown a kitten in oil.' Anyone who can help home the kitten is asked to call 0845 313 4749.","Passer-by rescued kitten while driving through Chester-le-Street .

Cutting fuel duty for drivers in rural areas could lead to a postcode lottery, ministers were warned yesterday. Isolated areas of Devon, Cornwall, Herefordshire, North Yorkshire and Wales are among those earmarked to benefit from a 5p discount on their fuel. The scheme, which already operates in the Scottish islands and Scilly Isles, reflects the increased costs of transporting fuel to remote areas for a small number of people. But trying to extend it to mainland Britain by drawing lines around certain rural areas will be ‘very  difficult’, AA president Edmund King warned. He said: ‘On an island you have no other choice of where to buy petrol so there is not a postcode lottery, but this will mean garages on the other side of the B259 (for example) from the designated zone may go out of business. It will be difficult to set up.’ Ministers plan to cut fuel duty for garages in remote areas from 53p to 48p a litre in the hope they will pass the saving on to their customers and help boost the rural economy. The Treasury has said rural petrol stations can apply for the rebate if they have to charge more than 139p per litre for unleaded fuel and 145.5p for diesel. However Mr King said drivers in cut-off areas of Suffolk, Norfolk and Pembrokeshire had already contacted him to complain that their areas were unlikely to meet the threshold. He added: ‘It is certainly welcome for people in these areas, and it is a fact that if you are a garage in a rural area and you get fewer customers then you have to charge more. But you get 5p price disparities along one section of the M4 just outside London. Variation: People living in rural areas typically pay more for their fuel than those who live in towns . ‘It would be better if the pricing was more transparent. ‘And we would like to see the Government publish wholesale prices as they do in other countries.’ A fuel duty cut for some areas is defined as state aid, so the Government needs to persuade the European Commission it will not breach state competition laws. Rebates have been granted in other islands, including Corsica and some Spanish and Portuguese islands, but offering it to certain areas on the mainland is more complicated. Determined: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander (left) says he will do everything he can to 'make this happen', but AA president Edmund King (right) warned it would be 'very difficult' to extend the scheme . The current rebate scheme currently allows petrol stations in the Inner and Outer Hebrides, the Northern Isles, the Islands of the Clyde and the Scillies to claim back 5p per litre relief on fuel. The Government will collect fuel prices from 1,500 retailers in 36 remote areas over the next five weeks before applying to the Commission in the autumn. The cost of the new scheme looks set to run to millions of pounds. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander said: ‘The island fuel rebate provides much-needed help to keep down fuel prices in areas where costs of transporting fuel mean prices are much higher. ‘We will need to prove that there are areas which are similar to the islands in terms of pump prices and distribution costs, so I would urge local areas that may qualify to provide the information we need to make the case as robust as possible. ‘As a Highlander, I know that for people who live in rural areas driving is not a choice, but a necessity. So while it won’t be easy to get this agreed with the Commission, I want to do everything I can to make this happen.’","Isolated areas of the country could be set for a Government fuel subsidy .

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 14:30 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:22 EST, 1 August 2013 . The mother of a convicted murderer who stabbed a chef to death today sensationally claimed her other son is the real killer after he signed a confession to the crime. Nina Winter, from Bournemouth, Dorset, is making an extraordinary plea to the authorities to charge her elder son Danny Brand with the murder in a bid to free his ‘innocent’ brother Jake. The 52-year-old said: 'I don’t want either of my sons to go to prison, I love them both, but if one is going to be in prison it should be the right one.' Who is the killer? Convicted murderer Jake Brand (left) is serving 23 tears in prison. His mother says his brother Danny (right) was the actual murderer . Jake Brand, 23, was jailed for life last year after a jury found him guilty of killing chef Glyn Helliwell in Bournemouth in July 2011. Mr Helliwell, 42, was walking home during the early hours when he was confronted by the Brand brothers. The prosecution’s case was that Jake Brand stabbed him to death with a knife as he robbed him for his mobile phone. Danny Brand, 30, was also arrested in connection with the murder but was never charged. Jake claimed to a jury that it was his sibling who committed the act, although it took him five months to mention it as he had not wanted to get him into trouble. Loss: Chef Glyn Helliwell was murdered in Bournemouth in July 2011 . Nearly two years after the killing, Danny Brand signed an affidavit confessing to stabbing Mr Helliwell in self-defence and that his younger brother was innocent. Jake Brand took his case to the Court of Appeal this week to overturn his conviction on the back of this confession but it was dismissed by judges who said it was 'simply not credible'. Miss Winter today insisted the police have jailed the wrong man and is seeking justice for youngest son Jake, who is facing at least 23 years behind bars. She said: 'Danny told me what had happened at the time - that it was him and not Jake that killed the man. 'He said they came across the victim and he had a bottle in his hand, and he thought the man was going to go for Jake. 'Danny was just defending his brother but it all went wrong. 'I know my boys and I know Danny was telling the truth. 'My boys are no angels but they would never go out looking to hurt someone like that. 'Danny wrote a confession at the time but the police didn’t want to know about it. 'They just wanted to pin it on Jake because of his history with them.' Danny, a builder, had been due to attend an appeal hearing in London this week but failed to show up. Family members are now trying to track him down in the hope that he can convince the authorities that he is the killer. Miss Winter, who has two other sons, added: 'I haven’t spoken to Danny since he signed the affidavit two months ago. 'He was supposed to turn up to the appeal hearing but he didn’t, and we’re now doing all we can to find him. Nina Winter is making an extraordinary plea to the authorities to charge her elder son Danny Brand with the murder in a bid to free his 'innocent' brother Jake . 'I speak to Jake all the time, he calls me twice a week. I tell him not to give up. I have to have hope that Danny will do the right thing. 'I know him and he won’t be able to live with the guilt of killing a man and seeing his brother in jail for it. 'He has to be a man and do what is right. The victim’s family need to know the truth and justice must be done. 'I love my boys with all my heart, but it has to be the right one of them in jail.' Mr Helliwell, who was a chef at the Bistro on the Beach restaurant in Bournemouth, had been on a night out at the time of his murder. A court heard that Jake Brand, who has 70 previous convictions ranging from theft, assault and criminal damage, stabbed him with a 6in knife. He later pawned Mr Helliwell’s mobile phone for £20. The father of Mr Helliwell today said he is convinced the police have the right man. Derek Helliwell said: 'I kept an open mind at the trial but at the end of it I was convinced that it was Jake who killed Glyn. 'I think the right man is in prison.' A spokesman for Dorset police said they were satisfied with the outcome of the court case. He said: 'The court case has concluded and we are satisfied with the result. We will not comment on further appeals.'","Jake Brand was jailed for stabbing Glyn Helliwell to death in 2011 .

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 14:28 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:09 EST, 1 August 2013 . Jason Thomas has been jailed for three and a half years after he duped trust fund manager Luisa Smith out of £175,000 . A personal fitness trainer who told a trust fund manager he loved her to dupe her out of £175,000, which he spent on an extravagant lifestyle, has been jailed for three and a half years. Jason Thomas, 42, convinced Luisa Smith, 35, to send him the cash by claiming he needed to pay off drug debts. Thomas told 'infatuated' Smith that he would use some of the money to buy a house with her, Southwark Crown Court heard. But he fuelled his 'delusions of grandeur' by splashing out on designer watches, a jet-ski and a jaunt to Thailand with a second woman he intended to fleece. He also bought expensive art work, an Audi TT and a Mercedes SLK Kompressor with his ill-gotten gains. Smith, a trust fund manager at Capita Trustees in Jersey, was jailed for two years in 2011 after plundering two high profile accounts. She even remortgaged her flat for £40,000 and took out loans totalling £286,000 to help the man she was ‘smitten’ with, but didn’t see a penny of it herself. The cash was sent back to Thomas via the bank account of former Credit Suisse banker, Rory Codd, 34, who was cleared of involvement in the scam. Money channelled through Codd’s account was used to fund extravagant purchases including £40,000 in down-payments for a custom-built boat in 2009. It was claimed Codd also supplied the down payment for the Mercedes SLK Kompressor and the Thai holiday but he was cleared of conspiracy to acquire criminal property. Thomas, who did not give evidence during the trial at Southwark Crown Court, was convicted of fraud and conspiracy to acquire criminal property. He showed little emotion as the guilty verdicts were announced. After meeting Thomas through a friend, Smith immediately fell in love with him when they kissed on a date in 2008. Southwark Crown Court heard how Thomas told 'infatuated' Smith that he would use some of the money to buy a house with her . Within months, he was begging for cash to pay off his so-called drug debts. Smith paid £40,000 into his account in a ‘test run’ on June 27, 2009, before a further payment of £98,000 was made to Codd from a trust fund she was looking after. The scam emerged in August 2009, when Smith went on holiday and unusual payments were discovered by colleagues. She was later sacked and jailed after being convicted of two counts of fraud. 'I feel disgusted with myself, and embarrassed with the shame I have brought on my family' - Luisa Smith . Giving evidence Smith said she lost her sense of perspective towards the end of the scam. ‘It got to a stage where I didn’t know what was right and what was wrong, in my frame of mind at the time’, she said. ‘I knew it wasn’t right - it was wrong what I was doing because it was theft. But it didn’t cross my mind what the consequences of all this were.’ She was arrested when she returned from holiday in August 2009, and eventually confessed all to police. She said it was a ‘blessed relief’ to be able to confess all. ‘I feel disgusted with myself, and embarrassed with the shame I have brought on my family’, she said. ‘On various occasions, I tried to take my life by committing suicide, not to end my life but to end the situation I was in.’ Luisa Smith was jailed for two years in 2011 after plundering two high profile accounts . Prosecutor Riel Karmy-Jones said Thomas ‘used this woman to fund an extravagant lifestyle'. He said: ‘Jason Thomas has delusions of grandeur and has an over-inflated feeling of self-worth which his personal training could not satisfy. ‘He targeted a woman in a good job and he told her that he needed her cash because he was in debt to drug dealers or that his own clients had not paid him. And so the woman paid up wanting to impress the man she loved. ‘He said if she loved him she would be happy to give him money and help clear his debts,’ Ms Karmy-Jones added. Thomas, from South Woodford, Essex, was convicted of conspiracy to acquire criminal property and fraud. Codd, from Kilburn, north west London, was cleared of conspiracy to acquire criminal property. Thomas’ brother, Steven, 43, from Brentwood, Essex, was earlier cleared on the judge’s direction of conspiracy to acquire criminal property and a further count of acquiring criminal property. Jailing Thomas for three and a half years, Judge Michael Grieve QC refused to comment on his claim that he received Luisa Smith’s cash for the ‘sexual services’ he provided her. He said: ‘You persistently and inexhaustibly hounded Luisa for money for approximately two to three years. ‘She was overwhelmed by the love you professed for her. She had not been in a relationship for some years and was someone who lacked self-confidence. ‘She suffered from depression for which she was taking medication. She worked throughout this time for Capita, a trust fund administrator. 'She decided to steal money from a trust administered by her. You were undoubtedly the driving force behind this conspiracy. ‘As has been established in this process, you used your personal charm, lies and possession of expensive assets like cars and boats’. Judge Grieve added: ‘You obtained almost £100,000 from other resources to which she had access, including her parents’. Smith had even handed over an inheritance from her godfather, the judge said. The court was told Thomas had an extensive criminal record, including handling stolen goods in 1994, blackmail in 1995, common assault in 2001, possession of MDMA in 2002, assault occasioning ABH in 2008 and common assault in 2013.","Jason Thomas told Luisa Smith he needed money to pay off drug debts .

"PUBLISHED: . 10:29 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:57 EST, 1 August 2013 . The owner of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that ripped the head off another dog has admitted that the animal was dangerously out of control at the time. David Savage, 44, threw the body of Elvis, a Pomeranian, under a car, after the attack, a court heard, as a four-year-old girl looked on. David Savage, who has a previous conviction in 2006 for having a dog out of control, pleaded guilty to owning a dog dangerously out of control in a public place at Halton Magistrates’ Court, Cheshire, today. Admission: David Savage, left, pleaded guilty to having a dog dangerously out of control in public after his Staffordshire bull terrier ripped the head off a Pomeranian. Ripped apart: Gemma Antell's Pomeranian dog Elvis was killed in the attack last month . The dog, which is called George, bulled through a gate at a property belonging to Margaret Antell when it snatched Elvis in its jaws, tearing the pet’s head off in the attack last month. The Pomeranian belonged to Mrs Antell's Daughter-in-law Gemma, who posted pictures of George taken in the aftermath of the attack on Twitter and Facebook in a bid to track down the owners. The court heard Susan Campbell, a friend of Savage, was walking the dog and could not control it. Prosecutor Catherine Whincup said: 'It was broad daylight, in front of members of the public including a small child. 'Thankfully no human was attacked because of this.' She said that Savage, who has previously been subject to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order which he breached, did not try to stop his pet from killing Elvis. 'Beyond horrific': The dog's owner Gemma Antell posted a picture of the dog taken seconds after the attack on Twitter and Facebook in a bid to track down its owner . Mrs Whincup added Mrs Antell has been left ‘extremely distressed’ by the incident. Defending Savage, Gary Heaven said the dog had not shown violent tendencies before the attack. He said: 'During the period it was in his possession there was no occasion it had displayed any traits whatsoever that suggested it was capable of violence, let alone that level of violence. Devastated: Gemma Antell, left, from Warrington, Cheshire, used social media to track down George, the Staffordshire bull terrier that killed her pet dog Elvis, right . Accusation: Donna Clarke, the previous owner of dog George, told the court that the attack is out of character and must be down to the owner David Savage . 'The reason he wasn’t holding the dog himself is that he suffers from severe back pain. 'He had taken medication that morning and it had caused his hands to tremble quite badly. 'He wanted the dog to get exercise but wasn’t capable of holding the leash.' The prosecuton called for the five stone ‘athletic’ Staffordshire Bull Terrier, called George, should be destroyed. Savage got the animal four months before the incident from a friend. Magistrates say they will sentence him, and decide on the dog’s future, in a hearing next month. They expressed concern for his lack of remorse and previous conviction for a similar offence. A destruction order for the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and a ban on Savage from owning animals will be considered. Meanwhile, Campbell, also 44, who is charged with having a dangerous dog out of control in public did not appear in court today. She was arrested yesterday along with Savage, after both defendants failed to show up to an initial court hearing. Campbell was granted bail last night by Cheshire Police.","David Savage threw the body of family pet Elvis under a car after the attack .

"By . Anna Edwards and Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 14:54 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:34 EST, 1 August 2013 . A doctor who conned a wealthy widow out of £820k has been struck off for behaviour that amounted to ‘disgraceful misconduct’. Dr Ashraf Elnazir, a leading colonic specialist based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, befriended Gabriella Adler-Jensen after her husband Harry died, leaving her a £1.4m estate. The father-of-three persuaded her to buy property, land and 'invest' money in joint bank accounts between 2003 and 2006, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service has heard. Dr Ashraf Elnazir is accused of conning wealthy widow Gabriella Adler-Jensen (right), out of hundreds of thousands of pounds and funding his lifestyle with the money . Dr Elnazira also suggested she transfer large sums of cash into foreign bank accounts then misappropriated the funds for his own gain. Panel chair Sandra Sturdy said: ‘Balancing the factors, the panel considers that Dr Elnazir has demonstrated a blatant disregard for the principles that govern the behaviour of medical practitioners and it has concluded that his misconduct is fundamentally incompatible with his remaining on the medical register. ‘In all the circumstances of this case, the only appropriate, effective and proportionate sanction is one of erasure.’ Mrs Adler-Jensen's financial position diminished 'in direct proportion' to the doctor's own wealth increasing, the hearing was told. She paid for him to go on a £5,000 holiday to Dubai in 2003, during which the pair developed a sexual relationship, the panel heard. He also used funds to pay airlines, his racquet club, dentist's bills, his children's school fees and to buy cars. The leading colonic specialist, based at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, denies the allegations and said they never had a close relationship . On Tuesday the panel found his actions were . dishonest and likely to bring the medical profession into disrepute. 'The panel is satisfied that you dishonesty misappropriated Mr's A's money and property,' said panel chair Sandra Sturdy. 'The panel is also satisfied that you utilised Mrs A's financial resources for your own benefit and to the detriment of Mrs A. 'It considered that your actions were dishonest and, as such, in breach of a fundamental tenet of the medical profession. 'That being so, your actions had the very real potential to bring the medical profession into disrepute.' Dr Elnazir became close to the widow after the death of her 84-year-old husband in 2001. They were living in the same exclusive apartment block in Kensington when the grieving widow, who was herself in ill health, turned to the medic for guidance. The friendship blossomed and by the end of 2002 the pair regularly socialised and dined out together. After the decision Ed Morgan, for the GMC told the panel:  'The doctor was fully aware that Mrs A invested in him that degree of trust and was seeking his assistance to identify both security and safety. 'One symptom of the pattern of behaviour the doctor cultivated was repeatedly and consistently choosing his own interests and aspirations and relegating those of Mrs A,' he added. 'The pair opened a joint HSBC account for . 'business investments' into which Mrs Adler Jensen transferred around . £779,000 between 2003 and 2006' 'The doctor utilised funds and financial resources as his own, not seeking or gaining her consent for their use.' Mr Morgan continued: 'He caused Mrs A to incur significant cost in time, effort and emotional commitment simply to lay claim to that which she was entitled.' Dr Elnazir denied all the allegations against him and, giving evidence, told the panel he never had a close relationship with Mrs Adler-Jensen. 'According to the doctor he was the person who was abused. He classified the whole relationship as bizarre. 'He sought to persuade you that Mrs A was a colleague, that she was a business associate, that he didn't at any time consider her financial security and he didn't think there was any responsibility on him to protect Mrs A from herself,' said Mr Morgan. 'Having seen the opportunity the doctor lost no time in seeking to cultivate it and thereafter harvested the opportunities Mrs A represented under the guise of a close relationship.' In January 2003 Dr Elnazir persuaded Mrs Adler-Jensen to buy his flat in an exclusive block in West Kensington for £429,000, though it was only valued at £375,000. Despite her transferring sums of £134,000 £80,000 and £215,000 for the purchase of the property between February and September, Dr Elnazir retained joint ownership. He later claimed the sums were transferred as gifts for his children or that he considered them as a loan. When she transferred the sum of £215,000 he said he was 'beside himself and horrified' and thought the behaviour was 'bizarre'. But he used the funds to put towards the purchase of a new family home in Chiswick, London. Later that year the pair opened a joint HSBC account for 'business investments' into which Mrs Adler Jensen transferred around £779,000 between 2003 and 2006. The panel found Dr Elnazir withdrew around £70k for his personal use. Dr Elnazir and Mrs Adler-Jernsen also opened a joint US dollar account for currency trading in 2004 and the widow transferred large sums of money to foreign accounts on the doctor's request. She transferred a total of $645,645 including a sum of $440k to buy land in Egypt, which was never bought. On one occasion he told her his brother was in 'serious' financial trouble and asked her to transfer $20,000 because the Egyptian mafia would be 'after' him if the money was not paid. When Mrs Adler-Jensen sought recompense, first at the high court before reporting the medic to the GMC, Dr Elnazir branded her as 'the enemy', the hearing was told. 'Mrs A became the enemy and as the enemy he was able to concoct lies and further statements to her which were dishonest,' said Mr Morgan. 'We say the conduct was sustained, it was deliberate and it was targeted. There has been no expression of regret, nor any apology. 'Even now the doctor closes his eyes to his actions and the consequences that have befallen Mrs A as a result of them,' he added. 'You have found the doctor has been guilty of material acts of dishonesty. Those acts of themselves and collectively are a course of conduct that represents a significant and fundamental departure from good medical practice,' Mr Morgan told the panel.

The military has reported she committed suicide. But Chris and Adelia Sue Anderson, her parents, filed a lawsuit last month in U.S. District Court to force the Air Force to respond to their Freedom of Information Act request seeking more information about how their daughter died. The parents of Kelsey Sue Anderson (pictured here), 19, who reportedly committed suicide while serving on an Air Force base in Guam, contest that she was not depressed in the days leading up to her death are have filed a suit for more information . The Andersons say their daughter, an avid soccer player and horseback rider who worked in her hometown’s flower shop before joining the military, was unhappy with her job as a security guard on Guam but neither distraught nor depressed in their final contacts days before her death. The arrival of an Air Force colonel at their home, accompanied by local sheriff’s officers from Clearwater County, to relay the terrible news was a bolt from the blue, they say. 'We just want to know what happened,' said Chris Anderson, who with his wife runs a hunting outfitting business in north-central Idaho’s forests, in an interview Wednesday. 'We don’t care if it’s good or bad, we just want closure so we can get on with our lives. It’s been two years with no answers.' According to their federal lawsuit, the US Air Force told the Andersons in May 2012 an investigation into their daughter’s death was complete. Anderson, who the Army reports died from a self-inflicted gun wound, showed no signs of suicidal behavior in the days leading up to her death, her parents say . They expected to quickly receive a report about what happened in an aircraft maintenance hangar that housed two B-2 bombers. That’s where they’d been told their daughter’s body was found the morning of June 9 in a locked stall of a second-floor women’s bathroom, the apparent victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound from her own service weapon. Kelsey had been on Guam less than five months. When no documents arrived by August, however, her parents contacted Idaho US Senator Jim Risch and filed a Freedom of Information Act request with military offices in Virginia. Despite repeated requests Anderson's (pictured her on her down time) parents say they have been denied an official report from the Air Force disclosing the details of their daughter's death . Risch’s office received a letter from an Air Force colonel in September, saying the investigation into Anderson’s death had been closed but that it could take six months before her parents received a response. Months passed, however, and the Andersons say they heard nothing. The Air Force didn’t respond to a formal appeal they filed in May, either, according to their complaint. Now, they say, the Air Force is violating federal law by failing to provide them with information, or tell them why it’s exempt from disclosure. 'They basically ignore us, like we don’t exist,' Chris Anderson said. 'We’re her parents. We have the right to have an answer.' Anderson's parents say she had plans for her future and just want to know how she died so they can get closure and move on with their lives . Contacted by the Associated Press, Air Force officials said requests about the case must come from Kelsey Sue Anderson’s family. Risch aides were unaware the matter remains unresolved and pledged to contact the Air Force again if Anderson’s parents want additional help. 'We can certainly go back in and inquire on the case,' said Brad Hoaglun, the senator’s spokesman in Boise. Adelia Sue Anderson recalled last seeing her daughter at Christmas in 2010, two months before she shipped out to Guam. Though Guam would be 17 time zones and worlds away from Orofino, Kelsey was looking forward to its warm climate and beaches. Anderson's (seen here in happier days) parents have filed a Federal lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act seeking information about their daughter's alleged suicide . She had a plan. After winning $72,000 in college GI Bill assistance, she told her parents she wanted to serve her country for four years and then go to college, possibly to earn a degree as a veterinarian's assistant. It was also a chance for her to write a new chapter in the family's history of military service: Her father, uncles and grandfathers had served. 'She was the first girl, between my family and the Anderson family, who ever went into the service,' Adelia Sue Anderson said. 'She wanted to put her time in, get her money for an education, and then go on with her life.'","Nineteen year-old Kelsey Sue Anderson died at an Air Force Base in Guam from what the Army ruled a self-inflicted shotgun wound .

Paedophile: Anthony Nelson, 52, pretended to be a 13-year-old girl on Facebook to try to groom victims . A paedophile posed as a 13-year-old girl on Facebook to groom children but was caught by an undercover police officer. Anthony Nelson, 52,  tried to arrange meetings with the youngsters, some of whom were in primary school, so he could abuse them. But he became the victim of a double-bluff - because one of his targets was really an undercover police officer also pretending to be a child. Nelson, from Shildon, County Durham, is now facing a lengthy prison sentence  after pleading guilty to a string of sickening charges in court. One of the charges includes the possession of more than 1,300 images of  extreme child pornography. Last night, police warned of the dangers of social networking sites and called on adults to carefully monitor what their children do online. Twice-married Nelson was arrested in January when it emerged he had contacted an 11-year-old girl through a false Facebook account he had set up. He slyly gained the confidence of his victims by pretending to be a 13-year-old girl - persuading some of them to send him their mobile telephone numbers. The depraved dad then began engaging in sexually explicit text messages with the youngsters - some of primary school age - and tried to set up meetings. But he was unaware one of his intended victims was in fact an undercover officer from Durham Constabulary. A concerned parent had alerted the police about the Facebook messages sent to their own child - and detectives discovered there were many more. An examination of Nelson's computer showed he had contacted dozens of children from around the country over six months. Police have spoken to the parents of the youngsters and to schools to tell them what the former hotel night porter had been up to. Worry: A parent discovered suspicious messages on their child's Facebook account (posed by model) from the paedophile and told the police, who set up a sting . He pleaded guilty to making and possessing pictures of child abuse and bestiality, and inciting children to engage in sexual activity at Teesside Crown Court on Monday. Shameful: Nelson sat in the dock with his head bowed and sobbed when he said he wanted to sexually abuse children . With his head bowed and through occasional sounds of sobbing, he also admitted trying to arrange a meeting with a girl to commit a sex crime. He was remanded in custody and will return to court on August 13 to be sentenced. Speaking last night, Detective Constable Jonathan Stoker, who investigated the case, said that Nelson had preyed on his victims' naivety in a sickening way. He said: 'Nelson has taken advantage of young children, some of whom were still in primary school, to fulfil his sexual desires. 'While I have been speaking to some of the families affected by this case, one parent commented that 'it was like he had been in their house'. 'I would encourage parents and carers to make sure that if a child is part of a social network like Facebook, to check the account settings and to make sure it is as private as possible.' Nelson admitted two charges of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and attempting to arrange the commission of a child sex offence. He also pleaded guilty to 17 counts of making indecent images of children, possessing 1,384 such images and possessing extreme pornography.","Anthony Nelson was caught by an undercover cop pretending to be child .

The unsolved riddle of what happened to Lord Lucan is being brought to the small screen 40 years after the aristocrat disappeared. Rory Kinnear will play the peer who vanished after his family's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was found dead at the home of his estranged wife in London's Belgravia in 1974 after being bludgeoned with a lead pipe. The attacker also turned on Lady Lucan, beating her severely before she managed to escape and raise the alarm at a nearby pub. Mystery brought to the small screen: Lord Lucan's disappearance will now become the subject of television drama, with Rory Kinnear playing the peer . Lucan's car was later found abandoned and soaked in blood in Newhaven, East Sussex, and an inquest jury declared the wealthy aristocrat the killer a year later. What happened to Lucan remains a mystery and he was officially declared dead by the High Court in 1999 but there have been reported sightings of him as far afield as Australia, Ireland and South Africa. The two-part ITV drama is based on John Pearson's book The Gamblers, which claims Lucan's high-rolling friends who gathered at the Clermont Club in Mayfair, central London, and included Sir James Goldsmith and John Aspinall, spirited him out of the country after the murder. Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston will play Aspinall and the cast also includes Michael Gambon. Former Doctor Who star Christopher Eccleston (left) will play zoo owner and gambling club host John Aspinall . The show is written by Jeff Pope - the man behind last year's hit true-life crime drama Mrs Biggs - and filming starts later this year. Executive producer Francis Hopkinson said: 'This extraordinary and tragic event has fascinated people for 40 years. 'Jeff Pope's script, based on John Pearson's book The Gamblers, brings new insight and revelations, which will surprise the audience. 'We are delighted that a top cast and director have come together to tell this story.' The fresh speculation on what happened comes months after Lord Lucan's son revealed how rumours surrounding his father's mysterious disappearance pushed him to the brink of a nervous breakdown. In September last year George Bingham said the gossip surrounding the case, including claims he and his sisters had travelled to Africa for secret meetings with their father, sent his life spiralling out of control. The former investment banker denied those claims and added that he hoped his revelations will help end the speculation that has caused him and his family so much pain. Although Mr Bingham, who was aged just seven and in the house at the time of the killing, believes his father is innocent of the murder, he is adamant that Lucan did indeed go on to commit suicide.","Aristocrat has been missing for 40 years after family nanny found dead .

Dannii Minogue’s hair became the top talent on Australia’s X Factor on Tuesday night after the star judge appeared on the show apparently wearing a wig. The 41-year-old singer’s signature short hair style had been ‘replaced’ by flowing dark locks. The new look sent social media buzzing, with many of her fans speculating she was wearing a hair piece and ruling out hair extentions, with one writer commenting: ‘You have such beautiful hair. Why go the wig?’ Spot the difference: Dannii Minogue was spotted with short hair when arriving at Melbourne Airport, but when she appeared on the X-Factor she appeared to be sporting a wig . Sydney style commentator Melissa Hoyer said Dannii  - the sister of pop diva Kylie Mingoue -  was ‘on trend’, with wigs becoming a staple for many celebrities. Joan Collins and Tina Turner perfected the art of wearing wigs, while more recently by Sharon Osbourne, Beyonce, Adele, Lady Gaga and J-Lo have donned a fashionable hair piece. ‘I think it is fantastic that a style-oriented and savvy woman like Dannii can wear a wig and make it look cool,' wrote Hoyer. ‘It’s usually got nothing to do with a personal hair issue or bad hair situation It’s more like a great way of giving a celeb a new look with the help of a great hair stylist in the space of a few minutes.' She added: ‘If it is a good quality wig - some even feature “roots” so they look even more authentic - and it suits your face shape, then why not take the easier option? Stylish: Fashionista Lady GaGa has helped make wigs popular with her outrageous sense of style. Joan Collins (left) is also said to be a fan of the hairpiece . It’s not the first time Dannii has been seen with long hair.

That short style was still in evidence when she arrived in Australia later that month with her cropped hair peeking out from underneath a bowler hat at Melbourne airport. Then fans, who had seen those arrival pictures followed by the promotional shots showing Dannii’s long locks, were left in no doubt she had taken to a wearing a toupee - no-one could have grown hair that quickly.

The grandmother of murdered schoolboy Daniel Pelka today spoke out to defend her daughter saying social services should be blamed for his death. Jolanta Luczak said the four-year-old's mother Magdelena Luczak, 27, was a 'really normal girl' despite the fact that she is facing a lengthy prison term along with her partner Mariusz Krezolek. Speaking from her home in Lodz, Poland, Mrs Luczak told Sky News: 'I don't know who influenced her. 'I . don’t know what kind of man she met, what she did, what she was . thinking but please tell the judge that she was a really normal girl. 'Social services should also be held responsible because they also failed . the test.' Scroll down for video . 'Influenced': Jolanta Luczak (left), the mother of Magdelena Luczak (right) who murdered her son Daniel Pelka defended her daughter and claimed social services should also be blamed for his death . Luczak, 27, and Krezolek, 34, are facing . life sentences for murdering the four-year-old Coventry schoolboy who . was systematically starved under the noses of his teachers and health . professionals. Geoffrey Robinson, MP for Coventry North West, said Daniel was 'badly let down' not just by 'an evil stepfather and an indifferent and selfish mother' but also by his school, health professionals and social services. He called for children’s services director Colin Green to resign now, rather than in September as planned, saying: 'He takes with him the indelible stain of Daniel’s cruel death, which his department had failed to prevent.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said that Daniel's 'vile, evil murder' should be 'on all of our consciences'. Jurors took less than four hours to unanimously convict Luczak and Krezolek following a nine-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. They battered Daniel to death after a six-month campaign of cruelty in which he was denied food, 'imprisoned' in a locked box room and force-fed salt. The pair, both originally from Poland, also forced Daniel to perform arduous punishment exercises such as squats or running, while hoodwinking teachers and doctors into believing his weight loss was due to an eating disorder. Killer mother: Luczak, 27, seen (right) holding a baby put her use of cannabis and alcohol ahead of looking after her baby . Mr Robinson said: 'How can the staff . at the school attended by Daniel have failed to have recognised patterns . of behaviour that should have set alarm bells ringing, not only within . the school but within the corridors of power within the Council House? 'How . could anyone believe it to be normal for a child to climb on the top of . furniture to get to food; to scavenge around bins to access waste; and . to steal food from the lunch-boxes? 'What human being, with the slightest . understanding of children, would not have been concerned enough to take . action to set alarm bells ringing? 'Where were these individuals when Daniel needed them most? Bureaucracy triumphed over common sense, care, and compassion. 'Those who failed Daniel must examine . their own consciences, and conclude whether it is appropriate for them . to remain in their posts.' Speaking on LBC 97.3 radio, Mr Clegg . said: 'Clearly people must have seen something was wrong with this boy. I . think his death should be on all of our consciences.' Luczak told the court that her partner Mariusz Krezolek (pictured with her) had hit Daniel around the head and then tried to strangle her . Asked what the Government could do in . response, Mr Clegg said: 'What we have done already is get rid of a lot . of the complexity and bureaucracy that we worry might have meant that . cases were not picked up earlier. 'We’ve simplified the way in which child protection is organised.' Mr Clegg said an independent person . would be named as soon as possible to hold a serious case review into . Daniel’s death, which would play 'a disproportionately important role in . showing what more we need to do to make sure that people don’t fall . between the cracks'. Last night, it emerged that Krezolek is a wanted criminal in his homeland, while Luczak was a drug addicted prostitute. They have both been found guilty of . the horrific murder of Luczak's son Daniel, who resembled a . ‘concentration camp victim’ when he died following an ‘incomprehensible’ campaign of cruelty carried out by the evil pair. Krezolek . moved to Britain in 2006 despite the fact that Polish police were . hunting him after he violated the terms of his suspended sentence. ‘He is a wanted man,’ a police source said. ‘He breached the terms of his sentence.’ Krezolek’s sister also revealed that he was a violent criminal who was booted out of the army for attacking a fellow recruit. Speaking . from their family home in a village near Wroclaw in South West Poland . where she still lives, she also told the Mail that her brother . terrorised her when she was growing up. Asking not to be named, she said: ‘My brother is on a wanted list in Poland. He has brought public shame on the family. ‘He . was in the army and got into a fight and the person he beat up ended up . in hospital and he ended up in a martial court. He was punished for it. ‘When I was 18 and he was 15 he used to beat me up. It is horrible for me to talk about this. ‘Nobody wants to hear their brother . was involved in the death of a child, but I’m not going to defend him. Never in my life would I ever leave my children with him.’ Death: Daniel Pelka (right) was murdered by his mother Magdelena Luczak (left) and her partner after being starved and subjected to unimaginable cruelty over a five-month period . She added that he was a heavy drinker . who regularly used amphetamines and the police and local prosecutors . were regular visitors to the family home. Krezolek’s other sister, who lives nearby and also asked not to be named, said: ‘I have no brother.’ Krezolek met Luczak in England after . she left her life in a concrete housing estate in the run-down city of . Lodz in central Poland. Her mother Yolanta was described by neighbours as anxious and highly-strung. They added that she used to beat her daughter. Her father Witold – who was rarely at home – worked as a driver while her mother raised the children in the tiny flat. Neighbours told how the family of . seven had not paid rent for 24 years for their pokey three-bed council . apartment in a towering high-rise block. 'My mother came back with terrible stories' Magdelena Luczak’s younger sister . Luczak’s younger sister said her mother had been worried for her grandson’s safety when she visited two weeks before his death. The mother-of-two, who lives in Lodz . and asked not to be identified, said: ‘My mother went to England to . visit Magda two weeks before Daniel died and came back with terrible . stories. ‘She said “Something terrible is . happening in that house. Magda is being terrorised by Mariusz. Something . very bad is happening in that house”. ‘It’s my sister’s fault that she did not react when her son was in danger. She has responsibility for what happened.’ Luczak’s mother Yolanta told the Mail . her husband had died as a result of the stress of seeing his daughter . charged with the murder of his grandson. She said: ‘Mariusz doesn’t deserve to walk on this earth. I’m in no state to talk about this, my life is full of tragedy.’ As a girl, blonde-haired Luczak dreamed of being the next Emma Bunton and belted out Spice Girls songs at the top of her voice. ‘But just a few years later, she was . caking her face in make-up, wearing expensive clothes and being picked . up by strange men late at night. One neighbour, who asked not to be . named, said: ‘The same car would drop her off in the morning and pick . her up at night and we thought the driver was probably her pimp.’ Another neighbour added: ‘Magda had a very difficult childhood because her mother was aggressive.’ Last night, Daniel’s natural father, . lorry driver Eryk Pelka, said: ‘I feel hate towards Magda. I hope she . will never come out of jail. I had very limited access to Daniel once I . returned to Poland.

But a bizarre game of 'my one's bigger than yours' appears to have broken out between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko, who have got their lines crossed over who has caught the biggest fish. Just days after Mr Putin claimed to have caught a giant pike on a fishing trip, his next door neighbour Mr Lukashenko has boasted about catching a man-sized catfish. Tiddler: Mr Lukashenko describing how Mr Putin's pike was 'only this big' when compared with the catfish he hauled from the Pripyat river . Earlier today Belarussian state television showed Mr Lukashenko telling a government meeting about how he had wrenched a 126lb (57kg) catfish from the Pripyat river. During the boastful exchange, he did not mention Mr Putin or where exactly he had landed the monster. But deputy prime minister Mikhail Rusiy, who claimed to have witnessed the seismic event, said: 'It was as long as I am tall.' Last week Mr Putin claimed to have caught a pike weighing a whopping 46lb (21kg) while fishing in Siberia. He described it as a 'gigantic animal'. It was the latest in a long string of macho exploits by the Kremlin leader, which drew scepticism and mockery on social media. Fishy tale: Last week Mr Putin claimed to have caught this 46lb pike in Siberia, although sceptics warned it probably weighed less than a quarter of that . Blogger and author Alfred Kokh calculated the length, diameter and volume of the fish and said it could only have weighed ‘10-11kg' and not 21kg. Pro-opposition journalist Oleg Kashin added that a fish with the density of a 21kg pike the size of the one caught by Mr Putin would simply have sunk to the bottom of the lake. ‘A pike that heavy just could not swim,’ Mr Kashin wrote on Twitter. ‘She would sink to the bottom! In fact this pike was made from granite.’ A caption placed under two online pictures - one of Mr Putin holding the fish and the . other showing Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev emerging from a river in a . wetsuit with a satisfied look - read: ‘Wonder who planted that fish for Putin to catch?’ Although Belarus is Russia's closest ally, the relationship between Lukashenko, 58, and Putin, 60, has long been uneasy. The pair have exchanged critical and sometimes sarcastic comments about each other for years as Lukashenko has resisted the strengthening of Russia's influence over its smaller neighbour. Now that's a catfish: In 2005 this beast, similar to that caught by Mr Lukashenko, was pulled out of the River Ebro in Spain. Sadly photographic evidence of Mr Lukashenko's catch has not been released .","Alexander Lukashenko boasts 126lb catfish catch from Pripyat river .

Nigella Lawson was seen at Heathrow airport last night before the decree nisi was granted today . Nigella Lawson yesterday ended her ten-year marriage to Charles Saatchi on the grounds of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’ – in a hearing which lasted for just 70 seconds. The couple were granted a decree nisi at the High Court in London on the grounds that the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’, less than eight weeks after they had a heated row which saw Mr Saatchi grabbing his wife’s throat. Mr Saatchi – who initially described the incident as a ‘playful tiff’ – has now accepted a police caution for assault. Neither the 53-year-old television chef nor her art collector husband, 70, attended the hearing. However papers lodged at the High Court revealed it was Miss Lawson who petitioned for the divorce. She also answered ‘yes’ when asked if Mr Saatchi’s behaviour had continued. Lawson, who was the applicant in the case, also confirmed in the document that they were living apart. The document was signed by the popular cook and broadcaster on July 9. The pair now have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage. Neither the couple or their legal representatives attended the hearing. In Court 9, Lawson and Saatchi's names were 12th on a list read out among 14 other divorcing couples. The judge asked: 'Does any party or person wish to show cause against decrees being made or in the question of costs?' When there was no reply she said: 'I grant the pronouncement of decrees.' A decree nisi is a statement saying the court sees no reason why a divorce cannot be granted. It is thought the divorce will be rubber-stamped some time in September. Lawson flew into Heathrow Airport last night ahead of the documents being presented at the High Court today. The pair, who are said to be worth an estimated £150million and shared a £12million home in Chelsea, are believed to have agreed never to publicly disclose the terms of the divorce or financial settlements. They are also understood to have signed a pre-nuptial agreement when they wed in 2003. Court paperwork shows that Nigella Lawson applied to divorce Charles Saatchi on the grounds of his 'continuing unreasonable behaviour' It is understood Mr Saatchi dispensed . with lawyers to deal directly with Nigella's high profile lawyer Fiona . Shackleton in an attempt to keep his multimillion pound art collection . intact. The couple's marriage ended after Mr Saatchi was pictured choking his wife, who has made her fortune as TV's Domestic Goddess, at their favourite London haunt, Scott's restaurant, last month. Nigella was then left reeling by Mr Saatchi’s ‘cruelty’ after he announced in The Mail on Sunday that he would be seeking a divorce. In a final, crushing act of emotional control, he released an extraordinary statement to say that the marriage was over — without giving her any warning of his intentions. Proceedings: After the decree nisi is announced today Nigella and soon-to-be-ex-husband Charles Saatchi will be formally divorced in six weeks . The end of a marriage: The photo of Charles Saatchi choking his wife Nigella Lawson led to their divorce, to be heard at the High Court tomorrow . 'Heartbroken': Although Charles Saatchi announced he was divorcing Nigella Lawson - it was the TV star who was in the fact the applicant for the divorce . Nigella moved out of their home and has rented an apartment with her son Bruno. She is soon planning to head to Los Angeles where she is filming the new season of her ABC show The Taste. Earlier . this month, friends of Mr Saatchi told the Mail:‘He and Nigella agreed – . via Fiona Shackleton – to a speedy divorce. Fiona Shackleton is . Nigella’s first cousin and Charles highly respects her. ‘He did not hire a lawyer himself and he has not even spoken to Helen Ward, whom a Sunday paper claimed he has hired. ‘Fiona prepared a full court document, every detail of every asset was listed, and an agreement was reached with no dispute. ‘They . have agreed never to make public the terms of the divorce or financial . settlements. Fiona lodged the divorce document with the court last . Friday.’ Baroness Shackleton, who advised the Prince of Wales in his divorce and represented Sir Paul McCartney, has been nicknamed the Steel Magnolia for her charm and determination. The former advertising tycoon initially brushed off the incident as nothing more than a ‘playful tiff’, but further images revealed Miss Lawson suffered 27 minutes of anguish and had her nose repeatedly tweaked and twisted by Mr Saatchi. At one point he even put his finger up her nose as they dined outside Scott’s restaurant in London. Denial: The former advertising tycoon initially brushed off the incident as nothing more than a 'playful tiff' Distraught: Nigella Lawson has now moved out of her marital home and into a rented apartment with her children Cosima and Bruno . Mr Saatchi later accepted a police caution for assault. Friends say Nigella was willing right up until the end to give their marriage another chance and was left ‘floored’ and ‘blindsided’ by his decision to begin divorce proceedings against her. They were reportedly arguing over Miss Lawson’s son Bruno, 17, and daughter Cosima, 19, from her marriage to journalist John Diamond, who died in 2001 from throat cancer. Both children have been seen comforting their mother during the past few tense weeks at her new rented home and will join her in Los Angeles this summer. Nigella is also said by friends to have invited Phoebe Saatchi, 19, Mr Saatchi's daughter from his second marriage to Kay Hartenstein, to stay at her rented home, although it is unclear as of yet whether she take her step-mother up on her offer. Mr Saatchi appeared to blame Nigella for the end of the marriage, claiming he decided to divorce her after she refused to defend him in public. He also alleged that she had held him by the throat during arguments at home. Mr Saatchi said in his statement he had ‘clearly been a disappointment’ to his wife over the past year, and that they had been drifting apart. The tycoon's millions were amassed from the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, which he founded with his brother Maurice, now Lord Saatchi, and various astute business deals. Distress: Charles . Saatchi announced he was divorcing Nigella in a lengthy statement - . although her friends said she had hoped to repair their marriage . He has traded art over the years, making large profits on works by Damien Hirst and other British artists. His collection is reported to be worth £200million. The Saatchi Gallery, which Mr Saatchi opened in 1985, has included some of the UK’s most controversial and talked-about artworks. The current exhibition includes work from Jessica Jackson Hutchins, who makes papier-maché sculptures of household objects, and a piece by Jose Lerma and Hector Madera of a giant bust of a man made from paper. Mr Saatchi also famously bought Tracey Emin’s work My Bed for £150,000, for which he got an unmade bed littered with condoms, cigarette packets and underwear. It was later installed in a dedicated room in his own home.","Lawson was the applicant in the case which was heard this morning .

While most teenagers are playing computer games, Shandor Larenty likes to indulge in a different pastime - taming lions. The 18-year-old has built up an unbreakable rapport with 250kg Zavu - stroking, hugging and playing together at home in Johannesburg, South Africa. The pair are now so comfortable with each other Shandor is even able to give the huge cat a foot rub. Scroll down for video . Brave: While most teenagers are playing computer games, Shandor Larenty tames lions. The 18-year-old is pictured giving a foot massage to Zavu the lion in Johannesburg . Close: The teenager has built up an unbreakable rapport with the 250kg lion . In the family: The teenager's wildlife expert father Alex was famously pictured also giving a foot rub to another lion named Jamu . The teenager, who is originally from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, said: 'I've grown up doing this - it is something I love. 'My friends think I'm a little bit crazy going in with a fully grown lion.' Third-generation lion tamer Shandor showed early signs of carrying on the family tradition - interacting with elephants aged just 13-months-old. His first big cat encounter was with a cheetah aged 11 and he has never looked back. 'A lot of the lions that I work with were born when I started learning, so I've grown up with them,' Shandor said. 'Zavu is a special lion because he absolutely loves me and we are best friends. Bold: The teenager's father Alex Larenty was pictured in 2010 giving Jamu the lion a massage . Talented: Shandor's father Alex relocated to South Africa in 1999 from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire and he has been passing on his unique skills to his son . Family affair: The father and son play with Zavu the lion . 'He loves to be cuddled and be centre of attention. One of his favourite things though is the foot massage.' The move mimics a technique his wildlife expert father, Alex, 54, perfected with fellow male lion Jamu. Alex, who relocated to South Africa in 1999 from Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, has been passing on his lion taming skills to Shandor so he can continue the family's business of supplying big cats for TV shows and movies. Shandor, speaking from the family's dedicated South African Lion park in Johannesburg, added: 'My dad has always encouraged me to go into the wildlife field since I was a toddler. 'He is my mentor. Everything I've learnt about working with these animals has come from him.' Despite the risks involved Shandor doesn't fear working with one of nature's most dangerous hunters - and uses just a feeble stick for protection should things go wrong. Tame: The teenager manages to get the lion to reach up to this bar using one of its paws . Cute: Shandor cuddles up to a lion cub in Johannesburg . He said: 'Lions are extremely powerful. A male can weigh up to 250kg and have a jaw pressure of one tonne per square inch. Those teeth are very long and could do a lot of damage. 'An animal could turn on me and I would end up dead, but with my dad's experience it is very unlikely that would happen. 'I'm pretty confident going in with the lions now. The key is to show you aren't scared because they will take advantage of it if you are. 'When you go in with them you have to make sure you can stand your ground.' Proud father Alex added: 'You never know if your kids are going to follow in our footsteps, but I think it is great that he has. He's now doing virtually what I am doing. 'I do fear for his safety sometimes but then that's why I'm there. You train these lions to do all sorts of things, but you can't train them not to eat you. 'He's still learning his trade, but for someone his age he is doing extremely well. I've got to watch my job, he's after it.'","Shandor Larenty has built up an unbreakable rapport with 250kg Zavu .

"By . Reuters Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:12 EST, 31 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:35 EST, 1 August 2013 . National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander jousted with a few hecklers as he defended the U.S. spy agency's surveillance programs at the Black Hat security conference on Wednesday, but largely kept the crowd of cybersecurity experts and hackers on his side. 'Read the Constitution!' one heckler shouted at the 61-year-old four-star general as he responded to polite but tough questions selected in advance by conference organizers. 'I have. So should you,' Alexander shot back, triggering sustained applause. Scroll down for video . Hacks: NSA Chief Keith Alexander responds to questions after giving the opening keynote address at the Black Hat USA 2013 hacker convention . Hack Heaven: Hackers and security personnel attend Black Hat conference on Wednesday in Las Vegas . The four-star general, who wore uniform shirt sleeves, was the opening keynote speaker at the annual convention in Las Vegas, which drew about 7,000 cybersecurity experts and hackers from the private and public sectors. Alexander has been under fire from many civil liberties advocates and lawmakers since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents revealing previously secret telephone and internet surveillance programs run by the U.S. government. Snowden, facing U.S. criminal charges and holed up in Russia, disclosed details on how the NSA gathers and stores telephone calling records of virtually all Americans, and works closely with Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and other technology companies to obtain communications from users in other countries. The NSA is the U.S. spy agency that monitors foreign electronic communications. The NSA protects some of the companies represented at the conference and hires some of their best employees. At the same time, many security experts have profound enthusiasm for the causes of internet freedom and privacy. Hecklers: Alexander was heckled by protesters during Wednesday's conference . Alexander's comments in Las Vegas did not go beyond those he previously gave before Congress and at other public appearances in the past two months. He argued that the NSA surveillance programs helped disrupt more than 50 ""terrorist-related"" plots but said he supported wider discussions on how to balance national security priorities with privacy rights. Alexander, who is also in charge of the U.S. Cyber Command that handles military cyberspace operations, said the NSA initially examined only several hundred phone numbers, then looked outward to see who else those people had spoken to. His tone was mostly conciliatory, though he asserted that allegations of indiscriminate eavesdropping by the NSA had not been borne out by a Senate committee investigation, internal audits or reviews by administration officials.'We get all these allegations of what they could be doing, but when people check, like the intelligence committee, they found no times' that NSA internet surveillance had been willfully abused, he said. OVERSEAS BUSINESSES . The furor over the NSA surveillance programs threatens the overseas business of some U.S. companies, as technology buyers look to local alternatives to replace U.S. services that can be intercepted. Leaks: Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden is seeking asylum after leaking sensitive documents about the NSA's electronic surveillance programs . The first question from the audience for Alexander after his conference speech was whether he believes the NSA is hurting the ability of U.S. technology companies to compete for foreign customers. He said that companies should be able to disclose how little they actually turn over, as the industry is asking to do. Alexander also said the vast majority of countries have similar 'lawful intercept' programs and the NSA's version was an unusually good model because it was subject to U.S. court review, albeit in secret. Though not as critical as Congress and the courts, the security professionals at Black Hat still represent a key audience for Alexander. 'This is the greatest center of technical gravity in the world,' he said of his audience. 'It is important that we put the facts on the table.' Black Hat conferences bring together corporate, government and independent cybersecurity experts including some hackers. Asylum: Russian President Vladimir Putin has declined to hand Snowden over the U.S. officials . Because information on so many Americans is subject to collection without any suspicion of wrongdoing, Snowden's revelations have provoked a large privacy outcry. 'I've never sensed this level of tension or apprehension in the community,' said Black Hat founder Jeff Moss. He recalled the debate over U.S. restrictions on cryptography exports in the 1990s but said that ""pales in comparison"" to the fight about mass communications interception now underway. The U.S. House of Representatives voted last week not to cut funding for the NSA's calling-records program. The U.S. government on Wednesday released some declassified documents on the NSA's mass collection of telephone data. The documents included an April order by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court that directed Verizon to hand over data from millions of Americans' telephone calls and described how the data should be stored and accessed.","Hecklers told NSA Director Keith Alexander to 'read the Constitution'

Country music star Keith Urban will be coming back to American Idol it was announced on Thursday. And fans of the hit show are in for another treat as it is heavily rumoured that Jennifer Lopez may join him. Urban was the only remaining judge from last season on the Fox singing competition show. The 45-year-old's return was announced by Fox chairman Kevin Reilly who praised the singer's participation last season and said he was a fan favourite. Back on the panel: Keith Urban, shown in September, will be returning to American Idol it was announced Thursday . Meanwhile, 44-year-old Lopez reportedly may return to the judging panel after sitting out last season. A source told People the singer is 'very close to signing a deal with Fox to return to American Idol next season.' 'Both Fox and Jennifer are very happy about this and want it to happen very much,' the source added. J-Lo may be back: Lopez, shown last week in New York City, may return after wrapping her world tour . J-Lo returning? Jennifer Lopez, shown with Nicole Kidman and Urban in February, apparently is 'very close' to signing a deal . The source also denied recent reports that Lopez was turned down by NBC's hit singing competition show The Voice. American Idol last month said good-bye to three of last season's judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj and Randy Jackson. The source said Lopez wanted to return because her world tour has been completed and she has more time for her family and television projects. Last season's panel: Urban is shown in May with last season's judges Nicki Minaj, Randy Jackson and Mariah Carey . J-Lo first joined American Idol in 2011 as part of her attempt to rejuvenate her career. Reilly declined to comment on who would be joining Urban on the judging panel. Others in the running to join the panel include American Idol alums Jennifer Hudson and Adam Lambert and Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am. Joining the judges: Will.i.am, shown in 2009 in London, has been considered as a judge . There were reports on Thursday that Lopez and will.i.am had signed deals, but no confirmation from Fox. Will.i.am has been a coach for the past two seasons on the U.K. version of The Voice. Reilly told the television critics the goal was to recruit 'comfortable' judges and refocus on the show's contestants.

Battler: Terminally ill Rowena Darby is writing a lifetime of Christmas and birthday cards to her three-year-old son Freddie . A terminally ill mother is spending her final months making a lifetime of birthday and Christmas cards for her three-year-old son to help him remember her when he grows up. Rowena Darby, 33, who has been told by doctors that she has less than two years to live, has even written graduation and wedding day cards for Freddie in a bid to create a lifetime of memories for him. Mrs Darby, who lives with her son and husband Phil in Bolton, Greater Manchester, said that she is not interested in creating a bucket list of things to do before she dies, and just wants to be a normal mother for as long as she can to Freddie. She says that she is grateful to have been given time to prepare for her death. 'I’m privileged that I can prepare for my death - if I was in a car crash there would be none of these memories for Freddie,' she said. 'When I die it’s going to be awful for my family but at least they know it’s going to happen and because of this we’ve had the best quality time together beforehand. 'I know a lot of people in my situation create a bucket list but I just want to be a mum and do normal stuff with my son. 'There is nowhere I want to go - I just want to have a normal life with no regrets.' She added: 'I’d love more than anything to see Freddie’s first day at school in September next year. The longer I’m here, the more likely he’ll remember me. 'Freddie knows that I get treatment and go to hospital but he doesn’t know anything else because he’s too young. 'I have a permanent colostomy bag now and he knows that mummy goes for her medicine. 'I’ve always have more good days than I have bad days from the treatment which is good. I feel a bit groggy some days but you’ve just got to get on with it. 'I don’t care what they do to me, anything to keep me going as long as possible. As well as writing cards for her son, Mrs Darby plans to create an album of emails she has written to her son. Fighting on: Rowena, right, pictured with son Freddie, centre, and husband Phil, left, wants to keep living for as long as possible for her son . Creating memories: Mrs Darby has made a range of birthday cards for her son and even written a graduation and wedding day card . Actuary Mrs Darby has also started making bracelets while she undergoes treatment in hospital and set up a business, Roda Handmade, to sell them for £10 each and raise money to take her son on holidays. She said: 'I started making bracelets after going to a craft fair with my mum. I was bored in hospital when having my treatment. Prepared: Mrs Darby holds a box full of the cards she has written for her son . I took this kit in and made all these bracelets in under an hour and I worked out that I could sell them for £10 each. 'I got all the material for it and made a website and set it into a little business, Roda Handmade, and I use the money to take Freddie on holidays.' Mrs Darby began showing symptoms of rectal cancer in 2010 when she was pregnant with Freddie. She began getting constant pain in her abdomen and doctors performed a colonoscopy which found nothing before secondary tests in May 2011 found a tumour. She said: 'I wasn’t losing any weight or anything - I felt fine in myself apart from the pains. I had another colonoscopy in May and they found it. 'I knew before then that there was very little else it could have been. They told me it was so big it had grown through the bowel wall and my lymph nodes were inflamed. It could have been in there for years.' Mrs Darby underwent five weeks of radiotherapy to shrink the tumour and a subsequent operation to remove it along with part of her bowel and some of her lymph nodes in October 2011. As she began preventative chemotherapy in January 2012, doctors found a growth on one of her ovaries and she underwent a further operation to remove her bowels, the lining of her abdomen and had a hysterectomy. But the cancer continued to spread and Mrs Darby was told that her illness was terminal a year ago. Mrs Darby has also had alternative mistletoe therapy in Aberdeen, where she had injections in her stomach to induce a fever to prevent the cancer from growing. She said: 'Diet and lifestyle are really important. I believe my current diet, which is recognised as effective for children with epilepsy and Multiple Sclerosis sufferers, is slowing the cancer down.'","Rowena Darby of Bolton, Greater Manchester, has less than two years to live .

A seven-year-old girl was shot in the arm after her neighbor accidentally fired a gun more than 180 metres away. The Michigan man was practicing firing his 9mm handgun when the last bullet missed the target and traveled across a cornfield before hitting Abby Wrobel on Tuesday. She had been playing in the family's swimming pool in Tekonsha when the bullet ripped into her arm and narrowly missed hitting Abby's two-year-old sister Ella who was standing next to her. Shooting victim: Abby Wrobel was shot in the arm by a stray bullet as she played on her pool deck . Her mother, Jodi Scherer, told Newschannel 3: ' I could have easily lost a child ...it’s just scary.' She added: 'It came from the field and actually hit her up here, I mean how does that happen?' The mother-of-six said her children had been playing by the swimming pool when they suddenly started screaming and running. 'I ran up and Abby said, ""I’ve been shot!"",' Ms Scherer said. Her daughter described the moment she was shot as 'like a firework going into my arm'. The bullet went straight through her arm and fortunately did not damage any bones. Ms Scherer wants her neighbor, who has three children of his own, to be prosecuted. 'I mean, you can literally hear my kids . playing at that house down there when they're outside. So he knew there . were kids down there, he should have never been shooting this way,' she said. Shock: Abby's stepfather Jeremy Stem, and mother, Jodi, fear she will be too scared to play outside now . The man, who is in his 30s and has a concealed weapons permit, could now be charged with reckless discharge of a firearm causing injury, Michigan police said. Ms Scherer said that since the shooting her children have become too are afraid to play in the pool and run inside whenever they hear gunshots. One of Abby's sisters added: 'I cried more than Abby did. I think people should be more careful with their guns.' The . neighbor, who has not yet been identified, was said to have been shaken . up by the accident and plans to apologize to the family at the weekend, . according to NewsChannel 3. In a post on Facebook Abby's stepfather, Jeremy Stem, talked of his shock at the shooting and added: 'Sad she is now going to carry the scar and afraid she will always be afraid to be outside.' Scared: Jodi Scherer says her daughter could easily have been killed . Distant shot: The bullet was fired by a neighbor and traveled more than 180 metres across a field before hitting Abby . A 2012 study of reports of stray bullets in the U.S. found that 317 people were killed or injured in 284 incidents over the course of one year. Of those, 81 per cent had been unaware of the events leading up to the gun being fired. 'Victims of stray bullets are essentially ""collateral damage"" and are usually disconnected from the events that lead to their injury or death,' Garen Wintemute told Science Daily. '""They are innocent bystanders who typically have no opportunity to flee or take any other preventive measures,' the  director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis School of Medicine and Medical Center, added.","Michigan girl shot in arm after gun was fired more than 180 metres way .

Former NFL star Aaron Hernandez has written a letter to a fan from his prison cell, stating his innocence and claiming the murder charges are just part of God's plan. The letter was a reply to a note of support written by a former inmate of the Bristol County Jail, where the New England Patriots player is being held. In it, the 23-year-old claims that he is a victim of false accusations and writes of his ambition to get back on the playing field, according to TMZ. Arrest: Aaron Hernandez, center, is led from his home in handcuffs after being accused of murdering a semi-professional footballer . Law enforcement officials have verified the authenticity of the letter to TMZ. Written on a sheet of lined paper, Hernandez, who is accused of murdering semi-professional footballer Odin Lloyd in June, said: 'The world just makes things out of false accusations ... and it will all die down, especially when they say NOT GUILTY.' He added that the people who had turned on him would feel like c***, and said he believed God had put him in this position for a reason. Admitting that he has been humbled by his experiences during the arrest, Hernandez added that his earnings as a professional player had damaged his relationship with God. Accused: Aaron Hernandez arrives at the district court for a hearing . Murder charge: Aaron Hernandez, left, is accused of shooting Odin Lloyd, right, on June 17 .

The player, who was arrested at his $1.3 million North Attleborough mansion, was reportedly on a $40 million five-year contract with the Patriots. Hernandez is currently being held in a 7ft by 10ft cell, where he spends 21 hours a day in solitary confinement and is allowed out for only an hour of exercise each day. Guards have been told to treat Hernandez, now known as prisoner 174594 the same as the other inmates. It must be a stark change for Hernandez who, after signing the letter, wrote that he looked forward to being able to sign autographs again. The letter, addressed to a former inmate named only as Karl, signs off with a thank you for the gift of some pictures for his cell wall, and highlights the sportsman's desire to return to a life of football and signing autographs. Dreams: The former New England Patriots player, right, wants to return to his career on the football pitch . Jail time: Hernandez, left, is being kept in Bristol County jail while he waits for his trial . Hernandez, who was dropped by the Patriots after being charged with murder, has denied being a killer. At the end of July police divers in Connecticut have begun searching a lake in his hometown of Bristol for the .45 Glock semi-automatic pistol prosecutors said was used to kill Mr Lloyd on June 17. He was shot five times at an industrial park close to Hernandez's home. Surveillance video taken from Hernandez's home shortly after the shooting showed the professional footballer holding a gun, according to documents released by Attleboro District Court. He is suspected of killing Mr Lloyd because he knew about Hernandez's alleged involvement in a 2012 double murder, according to the New York Daily News. Your letter meant a lot and was very true! I know everything happens for a reason and I know 'God' has a plan for me and something good will come out of this.

Train drivers in Argentina have been caught on camera reading books, talking on the phone and even falling asleep while behind the controls. Shocking CCTV footage shows the drivers failing to pay attention as they speed along the tracks and zoom over level crossings. The video was released by interior minister Florencio Randazzo as part of a campaign to improve rail safety, weeks after three people died in a commuter train crash. Scroll down to watch the video . Busted: An Argentinian train driver who was filmed sleeping at the controls of his train . Negligent: Another driver was caught fiddling with his phone as his train raced down the tracks . One train driver can be seen sleeping through repeated road crossings between stations. Another covers up his cabin's camera with a shirt. Still others read books and talk on cellphones at high speeds. All the drivers featured have been fired or disciplined, according to Mr Randazzo. Additionally, all staff operating the rail network must now submit to a blood test when they start work each day to ensure they are not excessively tired or under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Their licences will expire and have to be renewed annually, and conductors will be required to undertake 100 hours of extra training before sitting rigorous new exams. Not paying attention: This driver rooted around in a backpack instead of watching the tracks . The cameras were installed in trains after a deadly crash in Buenos Aires killed three passengers in June. Last year a train slammed into a crowded station, killing 51 and prompting the government to assume direct control of the rail network. The revelations from Argentina follow in the wake of a horrific train crash in Spain last week which left 79 people dead. The driver admitted to a judge yesterday that he had been talking on the phone moments before the accident near Santiago de Compostela. Lazy: All the employees caught on camera misbehaving have been disciplined or fired . Argentina's train unions have objected to the installation of CCTV cameras and went on strike for one day over the issue. They claim that both of the recent crashes in the country were due to faulty brakes, while the government blames mistakes by the trains' conductors. Union leader Ruben Sorero said, 'I'm not going to defend a motorman who goes asleep,' but accused Mr Randazzo of tarring all workers with the same brush by highlighting cases of abuse. However, the minister insisted the videos should speak for themselves, adding: 'These measures aren't against anyone, but rather in favor of passengers having a right to have well-trained conductors driving responsibly.'","Negligent train drivers exposed after being filmed while at work .

It said the train driver's licence had also been withdrawn. Mr Garzon was questioned for almost two . hours at the court in Santiago de Compostela, the north-western town near . where the accident occurred. The death toll from Spain's worst . train disaster in decades rose to 79 after one injured person died yesterday. Seventy people are in hospital with injuries from the crash.

Sixth graders at a New York City school no longer have to read a book on their summer reading list after parents objected to its sexual content. Angry parents had 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' struck off the reading list for 11-year-old kids attending Public School/Middle School 114 in Rockaway Park, Queens because they objected to passages about masturbation. All incoming sixth-graders had been originally expected to write a graded-essay on the book, until outraged parents raised their objections. The award-winning young adult novel, by author Sherman Alexie, is about a Native American boy who transfers into an all-white high school. It includes lines such as: ‘And if God hadn’t wanted us to masturbate, then God wouldn’t have given us thumbs. So I thank God for my thumbs.’ One angry parent said she didn’t want the school dictating when she had to discuss masturbation with her son. ‘It’s about... masturbation - which is not appropriate for my child to learn at 11,’ Kelly-Ann McMullan-Preiss, 39, told the New York Daily News. 'It was like ""Fifty Shades of Grey’ for kids.""' She was one at of least eight parents who had planned to boycott the controversial book until the school’s principal announced on Wednesday that it was no longer required reading. ‘Not every child is emotionally mature . enough at 11 years of age to handle this content,’ PTA co-president . Irene Dougherty told the Daily News. ‘It really should be a parent’s decision how much information is given to their children.’ One parent had described 'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' as 'Fifty Shades of Grey' for kids . A Department of Education spokesman said selected texts are school-based decisions. Author Alexie had previously defended the book after it was pulled from an Oregon classroom in 2008. 'Everything in the book is what every kid in that school is dealing with on a daily basis, whether it’s masturbation or racism or sexism or the complications of being human,' he told The Bulletin a the time. 'To pretend that kids aren’t dealing with this on an hour-by-hour basis is a form of denial.' The book won the 2007 National Book Foundation award for Young People's Literature.

New boss: Ross McEwan, current head of retail banking at RBS who will succeed Stephen Hester as chief executive from October 1 . The new boss of Royal Bank of Scotland has waived his bonuses until 2015 – but will still receive a basic package of more than £1.3million a year. The State-backed bank yesterday confirmed the appointment of its retail supremo Ross McEwan as chief executive, replacing Stephen Hester on October 1. In a bid to avoid a fresh row over fat-cat pay, the little-known New Zealander has decided to forfeit his annual bonus worth up to £2million until 2015. But he will still pocket a £1million salary in 2014, a £350,000 cash payment instead of a pension and up to £3million in long-term share awards which could pay out in 2017. Mr McEwan was already lined up for a controversial ‘golden hello’ payment from RBS of about £3million when he was poached last summer from his role as retail chief at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. He received £1.6million of this last month, or £860,000 after tax, as compensation for share bonuses given up when he left his last job. The news comes as RBS posted a profit of £1.4billion for the first half of the year, up from a £1.7billion loss in the same period last year. But profits at the core part of the bank actually fell, largely driven by a 61 per cent slump in its investment bank and a 7 per cent fall in the UK retail bank. Deborah Hargreaves, chairman of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘It’s good that he is giving up his bonus. But most people would think that £1million is more than enough to live on and would question why someone running a State-backed bank needs a bonus in the first place.’ Chancellor George Osborne welcomed the new RBS boss, saying he was impressed by ‘his vision of RBS as a strong, UK-centred corporate bank that is focused on supporting the British economy’. RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton said Mr  McEwan was the only candidate who had been offered the job and described him as a ‘great champion for customers’. A woman walking past the headquarters of the Royal Bank of Scotland in the City of London as insider Ross McEwan was appointed today . Shares in RBS fell by 3.3 per cent to 322.5 yesterday, as the bank revealed it had set aside another £185million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance. This takes its total bill for the scandal to £2.4billion. It has also set aside £385million to pay for future fines and lawsuits, including a likely fine from the European Commission for rigging Libor interest rates. Mr McEwan becomes the latest foreigner to take a key role shepherding the British economy back to health, with Canadian Mark Carney starting his job as governor of the Bank of England last month. Mr McEwan is believed to have ticked the boxes for RBS and the Government because of his strong credentials in retail banking. He owns a farm in New Zealand and is a keen cyclist.","Ross McEwan, head of the retail bank, will start the top job in October 1 .

Guilty: Dr Barend Delport, a GP from Swanley in Kent, admitted sexual assault and creating indecent images . A married GP and Christian leader has admitted sexually assaulting child patients as young as 18 months and taking indecent photos of them during medical examinations. Dr Barend Delport, 55, also pleaded guilty to having 500,000 indecent images of children on his computer, including some at category five, the most serious level. Police said the South-African born doctor had committed ‘an appalling and gross breach of trust’ during his nine-year reign of abuse. A court heard he indecently assaulted three girls, aged 14, four and 18 months, and three women, at his surgery in Swanley, Kent, between 2003 and 2012. He was stopped only after a mother asked why her young daughter had been intimately examined and photographed by Delport when she had complained of a stomach ache. Friends of the family GP and Baptist church elder expressed their shock that he had committed such ‘despicable crimes’ while hiding behind a facade of respectability. Yesterday he pleaded guilty to 26 sexual offences at Maidstone Crown Court as members of his former church, Eynsford Baptist Church, and a neighbouring church packed the public gallery for the plea hearing. Anthony Haycroft, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant has pleaded guilty now to three offences of sexually assaulting children and three offences of sexually assaulting adults, as well as a plethora of offences for possessing, making and taking indecent images of children. ‘He had thousands of images downloaded from the internet of children and hundreds of images of child patients that he himself has taken. The crown regards these offences as of the utmost severity.’ Delport persuaded parents that he needed to conduct a genital examination of their children, before taking graphic images of the young patients. Custody: The disgraced doctor is being held until his sentencing on September 9, where the judge has said he will be jailed . After police received a complaint in . March, a letter was sent to every patient at The Oaks surgery urging . them to get in touch if they had concerns. It provoked a string of . similar allegations, spanning a decade. Delport initially tried to claim that . the images of patients were for ‘training purposes’ or because it was . ‘the worst he had ever seen’ of a particular illness. Shortly after his arrest, Delport . resigned from the surgery and fled the £500,000 three-bedroom home he . shared with his wife Sally in the village of Eynsford. Friends said he . had been warned by police to leave the area because he could be targeted . by the families of victims. Breach of trust: Dr Delport took indecent images of patients at The Oaks surgery, in Swanley, Kent . Mrs Delport, 54, a jewellery maker, . did not attend court yesterday. The couple, who have no children, are . said to ‘remain committed’ to one another, although they live apart. Members of Eynsford Baptist Church . yesterday spoke of their ‘sense of betrayal’ by the man they had . considered a spiritual leader. At the time of his arrest, he was . presiding over every Sunday service following the departure of the . minister. He would hold so-called ‘soaking . sessions’ in the waiting room of the surgery, when members of the . community were invited to ‘immerse’ themselves in Christianity by . listening to religious music and meditating. Delport attended religious conferences . in Canada and even wrote a book published in 2008, called Interpreting . Visions, Dreams And Symbols From A Biblical Perspective. A source said: ‘People trusted him . with their lives to guide them and give them advice when, all along, he . was a paedophile. He believed God would talk to him directly about what . was wrong with a patient. No one can believe what was actually going on. It is shocking.’ Friends said Delport earned more than . £100,000 a year and enjoyed spending his money on golfing holidays, . clothes and technology. The GP will remain in prison until . sentencing next month. Judge Martin Joy told him there would be ‘an . inevitable, lengthy custodial sentence’. Delport has already been suspended by . the General Medical Council and is expected to be struck off the medical . register following sentencing.","Dr Barend Delport admitted taking intimate pictures and sexual assault .

Embarrassing: Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) boss Sir Ian Andrews has resigned after it was revealed he breached its code of conduct . Dozens of major firms linked to rogue private investigators could be named following the resignation of the official who has protected their identities. Sir Ian Andrews stepped down from his role as chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency after breaching its code of conduct. The former Ministry of Defence mandarin failed to declare his interest in a consultancy firm he set up with his wife. His sudden move raises hopes that a potentially incendiary list of 102 names held by Soca could finally be made public. MPs on the home affairs committee are angry that the companies and individuals have escaped scrutiny or criminal investigation. Reacting to Sir Ian’s resignation last night, the committee’s chairman Keith Vaz said the decision to keep the list secret could be overturned. ‘Sir Ian was part of the decision making process that required the home affairs select committee kept the lists Soca sent us confidential,’ said the Labour MP. ‘I shall be writing to his successor to ask if he or she will now review this decision. Having lost its chairman, Soca is clearly a troubled organisation. With it due to be abolished in nine weeks’ time, it is important we clear up all outstanding issues as a matter of urgency.’ In a letter to Mr Vaz, Sir Ian said he had ‘no alternative’ but to resign from the £65,000-a-year part-time role. He said the ‘oversight’ came to light after he was grilled by MPs over his role in the Soca secrecy scandal last month. He added: ‘I have failed to maintain the standard of integrity to be expected of the head of a public body, let alone one charged with law enforcement.’ Sir Ian went on: ‘I have no  explanation other than it was  both a genuine and unintentional oversight but it is nonetheless inexcusable, and the responsibility is mine alone.’ SOCA has attracted criticism for its lack of transparency from senior MPs who are investigating the scandal . The resignation is an ignominious end to a role that began in ridicule when Sir Ian was accused of being a ‘Yes Minister’ appointment. He admitted having no direct experience of policing or law enforcement when he was appointed in 2009 after retiring from the civil service. Until last month he remained largely in the shadows as he steadied Soca after years of criticism of its poor performance, low morale and unnecessary secrecy. Decision: Reacting to Sir Ian's resignation last night, the committee's chairman Keith Vaz said the decision to keep the list secret could be overturned . It will be transformed into the National Crime Agency in October under new leadership with a wider remit to tackle organised crime. Under questioning by MPs, Sir Ian was accused of keeping secret a report about blue chip companies fuelling an underworld trade in illegal information. The dossier from 2008 highlighted how blagging, hacking and stealing private data was rife outside the media but was not considered by the Leveson Inquiry. After his appearance before MPs, Sir Ian, 59, was accused of failing to declare that his wife is a leading figure in the private investigations industry. Moira Andrews, 54, is a senior lawyer for G3 Good Governance Group, a global security and investigations firm. Sir Ian insisted yesterday that there was no conflict of interest, but said he later realised he failed to declare their joint company to his employer. Sir Ian and his wife set up Abis Partnership Ltd, a ‘legal activities’ firm registered at a mail box address in Cheshire, in February 2012. Companies House records disclose few details about its work. Sir Ian said it is a vehicle to supply management consultancy services to clients that he did declare. The Soca register of interests shows Sir Ian as working for the Ministry of Defence, Department of Health, Foreign Office and Transparency International.","Sir Ian Andrews admitted he 'had no alternative' but to quit £65,000 job .

Anger: Former Tory Treasurer Peter Cruddas publicly criticised they way he was treated by David Cameron . Former Conservative Party co-treasurer Peter Cruddas today lashed out at David Cameron for the way he was treated following claims he sold access for donors to meet to the Prime Minister. Mr Cruddas has won £180,000 damages in his High Court libel action over a Sunday Times allegation about charging £250,000 to meet the PM. The 59-year-old businessman brought the claim against Times Newspapers Ltd and two members of the newspaper’s Insight team over three articles which appeared in March 2012. But he rebuked his former colleagues at Tory HQ who ‘cut me off within two hours of the story breaking’ and has had a ‘dark cloud’ hanging over him ever since. During the legal action Mr Cruddas complained the Sunday Times suggested that, in return for cash donations to the Conservative Party, he corruptly offered for sale the opportunity to influence Government policy and gain unfair advantage through secret meetings with the Prime Minister and other senior ministers. During the litigation, the Court of Appeal ruled that ‘corruptly’ meant ‘inappropriate, unacceptable and wrong and gave rise to an impression of impropriety’. He also said the Sunday Times meant he made the offer even though he knew the money offered for meetings was to come Middle Eastern investors in a Liechtenstein fund, in breach of the ban under UK electoral law. In addition Mr Cruddas said the article meant he was happy that the foreign donors should use deceptive devices to conceal the true source of the donation. The newspaper, which also has to make a £500,000 costs payment by mid-August, had pleaded justification but failed to prove its claims. Mr Cruddas also succeeded in his claim for malicious falsehood but no separate damages award was made in respect of that today. He said later: ‘The dark cloud that has hung over me and my family since the Sunday Times published its malicious lies about me 16 months ago has finally been lifted and justice has been done. ‘My world was turned upside-down when that article was published. I remember vividly having to walk into my offices the day after the article was published and face 500 of my staff, many of whom had a clip of the Sunday Times interview on their video screens. It was humiliating. ‘I was also embarrassed to accept invites to events which meant that my charities suffered. The Conservative Party cut me off within two hours of the story breaking and did not want to hear my side of the story. ‘I was constructively dismissed from my role as party treasurer and made to feel like an outcast as the Prime Minister and the party lined up to criticise me on television and radio. This hurt me immensely and further damaged my reputation.’ Pressure: The Sunday Times claims triggered a crisis for David Cameron, who was quick to distance himself from Mr Cruddas in March last year . Mr Cruddas said that since the article was first published he had ‘kept a dignified silence’. But he added: ‘Perhaps the Sunday Times under-estimated me and thought I would quietly disappear but I knew all along that I was telling the truth and that the story was malicious, so I was prepared to fight all the way. ‘I hope my victory shows that this type of journalism employed by the Sunday Times and its journalists Heidi Blake and Jonathan Calvert is totally unacceptable, particularly post Leveson.’ He added: ‘Today is a good day for me. I am delighted that my good name has been restored. My family, friends and legal team have shown me huge support throughout, which has kept me going, and I sincerely thank them.’ Former Conservative treasurer and major donor Lord Ashcroft said the party ‘needs to learn major lessons from this debacle’. Writing on the ConservativeHome website, Lord Ashcroft said: ‘Mr Cruddas quite rightly alerted the party’s hierarchy to events and must have hoped for, even expected, its full support. 'Yet, despite contradicting the paper’s version of events, he was forced to resign within hours and was ostracised by senior party figures (except predictably Michael Gove) over the next weeks and months. He has had no Party invitations since his resignation.’ Criticism: Former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft called for Mr Cameron to apologise to Mr Cruddas . Lord Ashcroft said: ‘I hope that Mr Cameron will now offer Mr Cruddas an apology for his criticism of him, and for forcing him to step down as treasurer with such haste when Mr Cruddas was fulfilling his unpaid role well and effectively. That would be the right thing to do. ‘Surely the instincts of our party should always be to stand by one of its own until it has been proved that an individual has acted illegally or improperly even if it may be politically appropriate in certain circumstances to suspend someone pending an outcome.’ Lord Ashcroft urged Mr Cameron to scrap the inquiry, led by Lord Gold, which he ordered into Conservative Party funding in the wake of the allegations against Mr Cruddas. ‘Perhaps, given that the inquiry was an over-the top, knee-jerk reaction to what has now proved to be a false premise, it needs to be quietly wound up sooner rather than later,’ said Lord Ashcroft. ‘This whole episode involving Mr Cruddas has not been our party’s finest hour.’ Conservative chairman Grant Shapps repeatedly refused to apologise on behalf of the party for the way Mr Cruddas was treated. He told reporters: ‘I think Peter Cruddas did exactly the right thing. He has pursued this through the courts and got the outcome that he wanted, the right outcome as well, and good luck to him. ‘He has got the right to that and it’s good that he did.’ Pressed on whether there was a need for the Tories and Mr Cameron to say sorry, Mr Shapps said: ‘I don’t really think it’s a question of that, I think it’s a question of congratulating Peter Cruddas for managing to pursue this and get the right outcome.’","Mr Cruddas wins £180,000 damages in High Court libel action .

But he was left red-faced after his . mother waded into the argument and told him off for stealing jewellery . from an innocent woman. Embarrassing: Charlie Cooper, 20, pictured left, paid the price for being friends with his mother Teresa, pictured with him right, on Facebook after she told him off for complaining about his photo being published in a local newspaper next to a report on his court case for theft . Complaint: Charlie Cooper left this message on the Facebook page of the Herne Bay Gazette after they printed his picture - accusing the newspaper of breaching his human rights . Cooper, from Kent, wrote on Facebook that the Herne Bay Gazette had not asked his permission to print the photo. In a statement on the . newspaper’s Facebook page, which contained several spelling errors, he wrote: 'Well done guys, im having to watch my back every time I go out now, . thanks to the idiots at the gazzette im getting threats left right and . center, I know what I did was wrong but you didnt ask me if you could . take a picture and put it in the papers, I know the public have a right . to know but.i have my human rights, and now they have been breached, . thanks guys well done'. His mother Teresa responded to his remarks, telling him he didn’t have a right to complain as he had committed the crime. Telling off: But the 20-year-old's mother Teresa told him off for complaining - pointing out he shouldn't have committed the crime in the first place . Determined: Despite his mother's advice, Cooper continued to defend his Facebook complaint, saying he didn't want his picture taken . She wrote: 'They don’t need your permission to take your picture if the courts have given them permission to be there to do so.' He replied: 'They do, I dont want my picture taken. End of.' But it was a case of mother-knows-best when she had the final say and told him: 'It done now. That lady didn’t want her jewellery taking but you did it anyway, end of.' The row prompted Cooper to block his mother on the social networking website. Argument: Mrs Cooper and her son continued to debate the newspaper's use of his picture until he tells his mother he is blocking her on Facebook . He angrily posted: 'This is why I didnt have you on facebook mum, you say things like that, im blocking you ok.!'. Undeterred, . she replied: 'Its the truth charlie, you dont like the truth, until you . realise things like this you will never learn ok.' Crime: Cooper stole jewellery worth £1,500 from Vandra Henderson while working with his father to clean her home . Canterbury Magistrates Court last . week heard Cooper stole the jewellery worth £1,500 from Vandra . Henderson, in Whitstable, last year, to fuel his drink . and drugs habit. Prosecutor Julie Farbrace said Mrs Henderson, who is in her late 50s, had her home cleaned every two weeks by Cooper’s father. Cooper helped his father in October and November and at the time the jewellery went missing. The home owner alerted police, who discovered that Cooper had sold the pieces to a jeweller in Margate. Magistrates told him he had let his family down. Chairman of the bench Carole Kincaid said: 'This was a very serious offence in which there was a breach of trust. 'The jewellery you stole not only had a financial value, but also a sentimental value. You have also let your family down.' Cooper drank up to two bottles of wine a day and took party drug MDMA, the court was told. 'This was not part of a long course of offending,' Nigel Numas, defending, said. 'At the time he was suffering from problems with drink and drugs. He was drinking two bottles of wine a day and taking MDMA.' Magistrates gave Cooper a 12-month community order with 240 hours unpaid work. He must pay £1,519 in compensation to Mrs Henderson, plus £85 prosecution costs and a £60 victim surcharge.

A woman in Kentucky has been summoned to testify against her murder suspect wife - even though the state exempts straight spouses from testifying against each other. The trial of Bobbie Jo Clary, who is accused of beating a man to death in 2011, is expected to become a significant case for gay rights as, although Kentucky has a spousal privilege law, it does not recognize same-sex marriages. It means that Clary's wife, Geneva Case, has been legally subpoenaed to testify after she allegedly heard Clary say that she had killed the victim. 'Unconstitutional': Geneva Case, left, has been subpoenaed and must testify at the murder trial of her partner, Bobbie Jo Clary, right, even though same-sex couples are exempt from testifying at each others trials . The couple traveled to Vermont for a civil union ceremony ten years ago. 'It's a real marriage to us,' Case told WHAS11. 'We went there and we got married. It's my right not to have to do it - everybody's right not to have to testify against their spouse.' Clary's attorney Bryan Greenwood has filed a motion to quash the subpoena. 'Our . argument is that the constitutional amendment [banning same-sex . marriage] is unconstitutional and the court should strike it down,' he told ABC News. Together: The couple, pictured, traveled to Vermont for a civil union ceremony ten years ago . Clary, 37, faces the death penalty . for allegedly beating George Murphy, 64, to death at his home in October . 2011, but she claims she only attacked the man because he was raping . her. Prosecutors say she then told Case she had beaten the man to death and that Case saw blood on the interior of Murphy's van. They added that Case should testify against Clary - and that there are no laws blocking her from doing so. Like many states, Kentucky has a spousal privilege law exempting spouses from testifying against one another in court. Prosecutors said that law does not apply . to Case because she is a woman and Kentucky does not . recognize civil unions or same-sex marriages. In court: Clary faces the death penalty for murdering a man she claims was raping her in October 2011 . Killed: George Murphy was found bludgeoned to death by a hammer. He died of blunt force trauma . In 2004, Kentucky passed a law by . referendum that makes it unconstitutional to recognize same sex . marriages or unions. 'Our position is that spousal privilege only applies to a . valid marriage and these two parties do not have a valid marriage,' prosecutor Stacy Grieve said. But Gatewood pointed out in a hearing on . Tuesday that the state recognizes other types of unions not covered . under Kentucky law, such as common law marriages from other states. 'There's . no marriage certificate or ceremony or marriage in common law marriage, . but Kentucky recognizes it. If you're going to do it for heterosexual . couples but not a civil union from another state, that's a violation of . equal protection,' Gatewood said. Supportive: An attorney for the couple said he will take the fight to the Supreme Court if he has to . He said that he was willing to fight the case in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. 'It's very stressful,' Case said. 'I wish she could come home. There's nothing we can do right now though.' The case will be reviewed by Attorney General Jack Conway and the judge will make a ruling by August 16.

Iron-rich foods such as steak, spinach, liver and nuts could cut the risk of dementia in later life, say researchers. A study has found that people with anaemia – where levels of red blood cells are lower than normal – were more likely to develop conditions such as Alzheimer’s. The most common cause of anaemia, besides heavy blood loss, is iron deficiency, suggesting that a dietary change could help protect against dementia. Rich: Steak is a source of iron-rich food, which may help protect against dementia . Researchers made the connection between dementia and anaemia after studying more than 2,500 adults aged between 70 and 79. ‘Anaemia is common in the elderly and occurs in up to 23 per cent of adults aged 65 and older,’ said lead researcher Dr Kristine Yaffe, of the University of California San Francisco. ‘The condition has also been linked in studies to an increased risk of early death.’ Of those who took part in the study, 393 had anaemia at the start, while all those involved were given memory and brain power tests. At the end of the study, 445 – or about 18 per cent – had developed dementia. The research found those who had anaemia at the start of the study had a nearly 41 per cent higher risk of developing dementia than those who were not anaemic. Spinach: Anaemia may play a role in dementia by reducing oxygen supplies to the brain, which can damage neurons. Foods like spinach could combat that . The link remained after considering other factors, such as age, race, sex and education, says a report in the medical journal Neurology. Of the 393 with anaemia, 89, or 23 per cent, developed dementia, compared to 366 of the 2,159 who did not have anaemia, or 17 per cent. Dr Yaffe said anaemia may play a role in dementia by reducing oxygen supplies to the brain, which can damage neurons and have been shown to reduce memory and thinking abilities. Dr Doug Brown of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘Maybe our parents were right to tell us that we should eat more spinach. ‘This interesting research suggests that lower iron levels may have a link with cognitive health later on in life. ‘However, more research is needed and we shouldn’t make the jump to claim that anaemia causes dementia. ‘The best way to reduce your risk of dementia is to lead a healthy lifestyle. Enjoy a balanced Mediterranean diet rich in fruit and vegetables, oily fish and even the occasional glass of red wine, take regular exercise and don’t smoke.’ Dr Eric Karran of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘This large study adds to previous observations of a link between anaemia and a higher dementia risk, but it hard to say with any certainty that anaemia is a causal factor in the condition.’ ‘While age is the biggest risk factor for dementia, current research suggests that lifestyle choices may have an influence on our dementia risk.’","Iron-rich foods can delay onset of degenerative disease, say researchers .

After several delays, Swedish budget fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz says it has launched its online sales operations in the United States. H&M opened its U.S. online store today, saying it will sell everything available in its high street stores. The online store, which was initially planned to open in 2012, will also feature some exclusive clothes that aren't available elsewhere and the company's home decor collection H&M Home. E-commerce launch: H&M opened its U.S. online store today, selling everything in its high street stores . Daniel Kulle, U.S. President for H&M, called the launch a 'significant milestone' for the company. Retail experts say H&M may struggle to make the kind of profits from U.S. e-commerce enjoyed by pricier rivals, though. H&M has prospered in the United States without a big online presence and is mindful of the likely impact on profit margins of the high shipping and return costs associated with such a vast country. However, with more and more shoppers buying clothes from home, the Swedish firm was forced to speed up its online roll-out to capture a slice of the growing market. H&M has grown fast in recent years in . the U.S., it's second-biggest market, but has twice pulled back from . announced dates for the online launch, blaming unexpected complexities . in setting up an operation well integrated with its stores. Meanwhile, its main rival Inditex and . others such as online e-store ASOS have expanded in the market, while . Amazon is pushing further into apparel after EBay prospered with its . fashion offering. 'You don't want to lose out on being the port of call for younger shoppers. So H&M should really get in there' 'You don't want to lose out on being the port of call for younger shoppers. So H&M should really get in there,' Planet Retail consultant Isabel Cavill said. Apparel has become one of the . fastest-growing online retail segments. H&M has e-stores in eight . European countries and says they are now as profitable as its . bricks-and-morter shops. In . North America, a quarter of clothing sales will take place on the . internet in 2030, up from 7per cent in 2011, Goldman Sachs predicts. Researcher Euromonitor International sees the U.S. online apparel market . more than doubling in a decade to $41 billion in 2017. 'Generations . of shoppers are growing up for whom the multi-channel is a basic . expectation,' said Kantar Retail consultant Bryan Roberts. Fast fashion: The online store, which was initially planned to open in 2012, will also feature some exclusive clothes that aren't available elsewhere and the company's home decor collection H&M Home . H&M has been struggling to work out a viable logistics model in the country, where many shoppers expect free deliveries. 'H&M is low-price, quite low-margin and makes it work by selling very high volumes. An issue with that is very high costs for shipping and, most significantly, returns. It's a particular problem in the U.S.,' Conlumino consultant Neil Saunders said. Up to half of fashion items sold online are returned. At H&M, a shopper may well buy up to three times as many items than at Zara or ASOS.Analysts place average prices at Zara at least 40per cent above H&M's, with ASOS in between. H&M would be wise not to charge for shipments in the U.S., consultants have said. One more likely way for H&M to support margins is to focus the website on its pricier garments. H&M's U.S. online store will charge a $5.95 shipping fee after August 15 and the same again for returns. However shoppers that sign up to its mailing list are entitled to free shipping. All items on offer in stores will be available on the website, said Nils Vinge, head of investor relations at H&M. 'H&M is low-price, low-margin . and makes it work by selling very high volumes. An issue is . very high costs for shipping. It's a . particular problem in the U.S.' There is pent-up demand for H&M online and the launch will make a buzz after the brand became well-known. But for a latecomer to an already crowded market, it may be a challenge to lure enough shoppers already used to other sites. 'H&M will need significant volume. That's absolutely key, and that is going to take time to build. It may take years to get to a good level of profitability, also because of the cost for the infrastructure,' Conlumino's Saunders said. Inditex and ASOS ship all goods straight from home markets Spain and Britain. H&M's model is one with regional hubs, meaning bigger costs when entering some markets, but shorter shipping distances. In the U.S., it has built a hub for the online business, the running of which it has outsourced. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates H&M's online sales make up about 6per cent of group turnover, which last year amounted to 121 billion Swedish crowns. Some consultants said that, for an even wider exposure online, H&M should also sell its clothes through one of the big one-stop online shops, along the lines of a recent deal between British discount retailer Primark and ASOS. Vinge said the chain was focusing on rolling out its own online stores, but did not rule it out. 'We are very very pragmatic. We want to be where our customers are,' he said.","H&M has twice pulled back from announced .

At . one point before the birth, Turner passed her mother in the hallways of . the Circle of Life Women's Center, part of the Ogden Regional Medical . Center. She was on her way to see Hoffman. 'She's like, ""What are you doing? Are you going to see Courtnee?""' Turner said. 'And I'm like, ""No, I'm going to have my baby.""' The sisters were in rooms across the hall from each other, both feeling bad they couldn't be with the other to provide support. Nurses helped by keeping each up-to-date on the other's contractions and the babies' heart rates. 'We couldn't go really into each other's room very much, but we would send pictures back and forth and text and ask how each other is doing,' Hoffman told the Deseret News. Their mother was bouncing back and forth between the rooms as each went through the stages of labor, said Dr. Darren Housel, who delivered both babies. The fact that both babies came naturally, rather than being induced, made it even more remarkable, he said. It was something he hadn't seen before in his 20 years as a doctor. 'We are all kind of baffled that such a coincidental thing would occur,' Housel said. 'Over 5,000 babies, I can safely say that I've never delivered sisters on the same day. It was cool, a fun experience to be part of.' The three sisters say their bond is now stronger than ever. 'It's been fun to go through it together,' Hoffman said.

Three reasons to celebrate: Boston Stokes (left) and Mack Turner (right) will likely share birthday parties, along with their cousin Stryker Hoffman, in the years to come . The three baby cousins were together for the first time Tuesday. 'I . really think that there's a reason why all three are born together,' Turner said. 'They are going to have a great support system for each . other.' Utah had the . highest birth rate in the country in 2009, U.S. Census data shows. Utah . had 19.4 births per 1,000 people.

Mariusz Krezolek had also been arrested at least six times for offences including assault and burglary. But despite his serial offending, he was never put on a plane back to Poland. Instead, together with Magdelena Luczak, he carried out a campaign of cruelty against Daniel Pelka, starving him of food, force-feeding him salt and holding him underwater. Their brutality culminated in his death in March 2012 from a head injury, locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress. Scroll down for video . Callous: Mariusz Krezolek and Magdelena Luczak carried out a campaign of cruelty against Daniel Pelka which culminated in his death . Abuse: Daniel Pelka was starved of food, force-fed salt and held underwater . Last night an MP demanded to know why Krezolek was able to stay despite his criminal record and called for a full inquiry into whether opportunities were missed to deport him. Geoffrey Robinson said: ‘My primary concern is for the functioning of the protective services in Coventry, including social workers and teachers. But I am also concerned as to whether the police may have missed opportunities to deport this man, who was capable of inflicting a sadistic punishment on child- and was able to stay here despite a criminal record.’ As fury mounted over the case: . Tragic: Daniel died in March 2012 from a head injury, locked in a cold room on a soiled mattress . Guilty: Daniel's mother Magdalena Luczak (right), 27, and stepfather Mariusz Krezolek (left), 34, were found guilty of his murder . Krezolek was first arrested months after he arrived in the UK in 2005. In February the following year he was convicted of drink-driving and given a 16-month driving ban. The following month he was fined £50 after he was caught stealing from a shop. In April that year he was arrested again for driving while disqualified and in May handed a 16-week suspended jail sentence. Three months later, in August 2006, he was arrested again for driving while disqualified and this time was locked up by magistrates who handed him an 18-week sentence. In September 2007 he was again arrested for driving while disqualified and sentenced to 16 weeks in jail. He was handed a further 20-week term in February 2008. Injury: Police were alerted 14 months before Daniel (right) died when he was found with a broken left arm. No action was taken after his mother (left) convinced the authorities he had fallen off a sofa . He was also arrested in August 2010 for assault and in April 2011 for burglary but on neither occasion was he charged. Police were also alerted 14 months before Daniel died on January 5, 2011 when he was found with a broken left arm. No action was taken after his mother . convinced the authorities that he had been hurt falling off a sofa. It . has also emerged that in the year leading up to Daniel’s murder, police . visited his home at least three times over rows between the couple. 'How can the staff at the school . attended by Daniel have failed to have recognised patterns of behaviour . that should have set alarm bells ringing, not only within the school but . within the corridors of power within the Council House?' - MP Geoffrey Robinson . During the entire period, Krezolek was wanted by Polish police for breaching the terms of a drink-drive sentence. If anyone had contacted the authorities there, he could have been extradited to stand trial. Instead he was free to inflict terrible damage on his stepson. The post-mortem examination revealed Daniel’s body had 23 injuries in addition to the head wound. By the time he died, he was a ‘bag of bones’ with the same weight as a normal toddler. Teachers had caught him stealing food from bins but believed the mother when she told them he had a genetic disorder. They also made no record when he turned up to school with bruises on his neck and  black eyes. Daniel was left to die for 33 hours after suffering the head injury on March 1 last year. Mr Robinson said Daniel was ‘badly let down’ by ‘an evil stepfather and an indifferent and selfish mother’ but also by his school, health professionals and social services. He called for the resignation of children’s services director Colin Green, saying: ‘He takes with him the indelible stain of Daniel’s cruel death, which his department had failed to prevent.’ He added: ‘How can the staff at the school attended by Daniel have failed to have recognised patterns of behaviour that should have set alarm bells ringing, not only within the school but within the corridors of power within the Council House? Calls for resignation: Geoffrey Robinson (left) has called for the resignation of children’s services director Colin Green (right) ‘How could anyone believe it to be normal for a child to climb on the top of furniture to get to food; to scavenge around bins to access waste; and to steal food from the lunch-boxes? What human being, with the slightest understanding of children, would not have been concerned enough to take action to set alarm bells ringing? Last night police defended their actions and sought to put the blame on the Polish police for failing to issue a European Arrest Warrant. A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: ‘Following Krezolek’s arrests for drink driving in the UK, checks were made against the Police National Computer to establish if he was wanted in connection with other offences either in the UK or internationally. A European Arrest Warrant had not been raised by Polish authorities and so it was not known by arresting officers here that he was sought for traffic offences elsewhere.’","Mariusz Krezolek was also arrested at least six times for range of offences .

Russell Brand was facing a new storm last night after attacking  the thousands of BBC licence fee payers who complained over his abusive rant at Fawlty Towers star Andrew Sachs. Brand was forced to quit his BBC Radio 2 show in 2008 after The Mail on Sunday exposed obscene answer-machine messages which he and  co-presenter Jonathan Ross left  for Mr Sachs, then 78.But in an interview with today's Desert Island Discs, the 38-year-old actor says  the incident - dubbed 'Sachsgate' - was a 'dishonest scandal'. He claims many of  the 42,000 people who complained to the BBC either had no real idea  of what they were complaining about or were motivated by an anti-BBC agenda. Brand said it was  telling that the broadcast of the messages had attracted just two complaints - and that number only swelled in the light of what he said was hostile press coverage. Russell Brand pictured with then-wife Katy Perry, at the 2011 Grammys claims many of the 42,000 people who complained to the BBC either had no real idea of what they were complaining about . He says: 'There was obviously a pre-existing agenda in privately owned media to destabilise, attack and diminish the BBC.' When Desert Island Discs host Kirsty Young challenges him about whether viewers were motivated by the same agenda, he says: 'They were. Of course they were.' But attacking his remarks, Tory MP Philip Davies, a member of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said: 'Of course the people who complained at the time were genuinely offended by this man's actions. The fact that he doesn't seem to realise that shows that he hasn't learnt anything.' The messages left by Brand  and Ross concerned Mr Sachs' granddaughter Georgina Baillie,  a burlesque dancer and Brand's former girlfriend. He tells Ms Young the fact the comedy veteran was booked as a future guest on the same show showed the incident in a different light. Brand says: 'The situation with the granddaughter had been talked about in a previous show. 'I would always talk about things from my personal life on that radio show in a relatively respectful, cheeky way. The subsequent week Andrew Sachs was booked to come on the show as a guest on the phone. How we broke the story of the messages left by Brand and Ross concerned Mr Sachs' granddaughter . 'I think what people imagined happened is that I went, ""Right, let's leave a message for Andrew Sachs.""  That is not what happened. What happened was he didn't answer the phone and so I said, ""Right, let's leave a message."" ' Brand says he accepts it was 'really, really wrong' to leave 'embarrassing and upsetting messages'. But he adds: 'It is offensive if someone calls up an answerphone, does some swearing and hangs up. But if, incrementally, that act is led to by a series of innuendo and jokes, it's a different thing. It's still a thing that is wrong but it is not the thing that they are offended by.' Brand also says his desire to start  a family is 'almost unseemly' - but refuses to talk about his failed marriage to Katy Perry. Last night Andrew Sachs said: 'My thoughts are the same as they were. We kept silent at the time and I don't want to have an opinion on it. If he wants to think it's a dishonest scandal, then that's up to him.' The show is broadcast on BBC Radio  4 at 11.15am today.","Russell Brand, 38, left obscene messages on Andrew Sachs' machine .

Adidas has suspended its contract with Tyson Gay after the former double world sprint champion failed an out-of-competition dope test. 'We are shocked by these recent allegations, and even if we presume his innocence until proven otherwise, our contract with Tyson is currently suspended,' an Adidas spokesman said. Adidas' agreements with athletes give it the right to terminate the contract 'if the athlete is found guilty of the possession or use of drugs or any other prohibited substance by the relevant governing sports body having jurisdiction over the athlete.' Scroll down for video . Shock: Tyson Gay has had his contract with Adidas suspended . Gay, who has been on Adidas' books since 2005 and who was . the fastest man in the world this year, has tested positive for an . unidentified substance and former world record-holder Asafa Powell was . among five Jamaican athletes to have failed drugs tests for a banned . stimulant. Chinese sporting goods company Li Ning, which sponsors Powell, was not immediately available for comment. Usain Bolt’s agent Ricky Simms said . that his client was not implicated in the scandal, but Olympic relay . gold medallist Sherone Simpson confirmed she had tested positive for . oxilofrine at Jamaica’s national trials last month. Unconfirmed reports claimed that  27-year-old Nesta Carter, who ran 9.87sec in a Madrid 100m on Saturday night, had also fallen foul of the authorities. If proved, the three quickest men over 100m this year will have failed drugs tests and will miss next month’s World Championships in Moscow, leaving the sport in crisis. Star men: Gay (left) has recorded the fastest 100m this year and Powell (right) is a former world record holder . Gay, 30, the second fastest man of all . time, has run the three quickest 100m times of 2013, but tested . positive for an unnamed substance at an out-of-competition test on May . 16. The triple world . champion will have his ‘B’ sample tested this week, but has already . pulled out of the USA’s World Championships team and Friday’s Diamond . League meeting in Monaco. Gay said: ‘I don’t have a sabotage story. I put my trust in someone and was let down. ‘I don’t have anything to say to make this seem like it was a mistake or it was on USADA’s (United States Anti-Doping Agency) hands, someone playing games. I don’t have any of those stories. ‘I made a mistake. I know exactly what went on, but I can’t discuss it right now. I hope I am able to run again, but I will take whatever punishment I get like a man.’ You too: After the news of Gay's failed test, it emerged that Asafa Powell (left) also tested positive . On a dark day for athletics, it emerged Powell was one of five Jamaican athletes to have failed tests. Powell, Simpson and Carter are coached by Stephen Francis at the MVP Track and Field Club and the two confirmed failed tests relate to banned stimulant oxilofrine. Two athletes who compete in field events, including a junior, are also understood to be implicated. Powell and Simpson both insisted they had not taken the drug intentionally, with sources suggesting it was part of a supplement introduced to their training group. But if their ‘B’ samples back up  the findings of the ‘A’ samples, they will face two-year bans and may never run again. Devastating: Gay has admitting to using a banned substance . Gutting: The news is a true blow to those involved in athletics . Powell, 30, said: ‘A sample I gave this year has returned “adverse findings”. The substance oxilofrine was found, which is considered by the authorities to be a banned stimulant. I have never knowingly or wilfully taken any supplements or substances that break any rules. ‘I am not now — nor have I ever been — a cheat. My team has launched an investigation and we are cooperating with relevant agencies and law enforcement authorities to discover how the substance got in my system. ‘This result has left me devastated. I am reeling from this genuinely surprising result. I accept the  consequences. My fault, however, is not cheating but not being more vigilant. I want to reiterate that in my career as an athlete I have never sought to enhance my  performance with any substance.’ Pulling out: Gay will take no part in the Moscow World Championships next month after the findings . A member of Powell’s support team was reportedly detained by Italian law enforcement officers last night after a property in Italy was raided. It is believed the trainer provided the sprinter with supplements that could have  contributed to the positive test. Simpson, 28, also took responsibility. ‘As an athlete, I know I am responsible for whatever goes  into my body,’ she said. ‘I would not intentionally take an illegal  substance. I am sorry for any hurt or embarrassment this positive test may have caused.’ This is the biggest crisis to hit athletics since the BALCO scandal at the turn of the century, when a number of American athletes, including Olympic champion  Marion Jones, were found to be taking banned substances. Veronica Campbell-Brown, a friend of Gay and the world 200m champion, was suspended after a positive test for a banned masking agent in June. Another one: Sherone Simpson (left) has also tested positive for a banned substance . Former world 110m hurdles champion . Colin Jackson said it was an ‘absolutely awful’ day for track and field, . while British 200m champion James Ellington called it a ‘disappointing . day for our sport’. Jackson added: ‘Gay is a global star. It takes away faith from the public. The good side is it doesn’t matter what level you’re at; if you’re taking drugs you will get caught.’ Neil Black, performance director of British Athletics, said: ‘I would start with utter disappointment. You think of the athletes striving day by day and it must rip the backside out of them. We all suffer.’ The banned drug oxilofrine that top Jamaican sprinters Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson have tested positive for is a stimulant used to boost the body's ability to burn fat. The substance helps athletes boost their power-to-weight ratio with more lean muscle and less fat, and so increase their speed. It may also increase the rate at which the heart reaches its maximum performance during exercise, meaning a greater supply of oxygen can get to the muscles earlier. Oxilofrine is an agent that stimulates part of the nervous system and was previously used to treat low blood pressure. More recently, it has started to appear in combination with caffeine in dietary supplements marketed as weight loss products. However, the superiority of using oxilofrine over an exercise warm-up to achieve this appears unconvincing. There have been no previous findings in Britain but competitors in cycling, athletics, weightlifting, rugby union and American football have been banned in the last three years. They include the USA's Amy Dodson, one of the world's top amputee runners, who received a six-month ban in 2011 and American cyclist Flavia Oliveira who was banned for 18 months in 2009. Both said they had unknowingly ingested the stimulant via an over-the-counter supplement.","Tyson Gay admits guilt after testing positive for banned substance .

Charlotte Church's father was left with a bloody, swollen face and black eyes after allegedly asking for cocaine at a New Year's Eve party. James Church, 47, suffered a fractured eye socket after the attack at a Cardiff snooker club in the early hours of January 1 this year. The man accused of hitting Mr Church was today cleared of two counts of grievous bodily harm after claiming he acted in self-defence. James Church, the father of singer Charlotte Church, suffered a fractured eye socket and black eyes during a New Year's Eve fight in a Cardiff snooker hall . Mr Church is the stepfather of singer Charlotte Church, whose mother Maria was also at the New Year's Eve party . Charlotte Church's mother Maria, pictured with the singer in 2004, screamed in horror when she saw her husband minutes after the fight . Robert Moore, 46, said Mr Church's injuries could have been caused by a toilet door. He described Mr Church, a businessman, as someone who 'thinks he walks on water - he thinks he's God's gift for some reason.' Moore, who is unemployed, claimed he saw Mr Church using cocaine at the party and said he was asked by Mr Church if people were 'doing' the drug. Later, the men bumped into each other in the snooker club's toilets where violence ensued. Prosecutor Jeremy Jenkins said: 'Moore struck Mr Church on the head with a bottle causing him to fall to the floor. 'While on the floor he was kicked in the right eye and then continuously kicked in the face and stamped on. Robert Moore, 46, was cleared of two counts of grievous bodily harm today after claiming he acted in self defence . 'Photographs showed footmarks to the forehead. 'It was a sustained and unprovoked attack resulting in serious injuries.' Charlotte's mother Maria screamed in horror and went hysterical when she saw her battered husband minutes after the fight, the court heard. Mrs Church, 47, told the jury: 'I had never seen such a smashed-up face. He was an absolute, complete and utter mess and badly injured. 'When I saw his face I absolutely screamed - I went hysterical. I've never experienced anything like that before. 'I shouted: ""What's happened?"" and he told me he'd been punched, stamped on and kicked.' The incident happened at the Potters Bar Pool Hall, now known as the Canton Sports Club, in Leckwith, Cardiff. Cardiff Crown Court heard that five months earlier Moore had shouted threats at Mr Church based on the fact that he was Charlotte's father. But at the New Year's Eve party Moore said there would not be any trouble and the pair shook hands. Moore told the court: 'He came in confrontationally asking for cocaine and I said we didn't do cocaine. 'He came towards me to ""do"" me and I got in first. We both fell over and I fell on top of him and we were both chucking punches.' Mr Jenkins told the court that Moore's claim that Mr Church has asked about a cocaine was a 'gratuitous lie to blacken his character.' Moore replied: 'That's total nonsense. I didn't attack him. He attacked me.' Mr Church, a businessman, adopted Charlotte in 1999 after marrying her mother Maria. The family is pictured in November 2000 . Photographs taken after the fight showed Mr Church's bruised and swollen face . Mr Church, right, was seen outside Cardiff Crown Court with his wife Maria, second left, during the trial .

A couple were found dead yesterday after taking chemicals in a  suspected suicide pact at a top Scottish hotel. The discovery of the bodies triggered a major chemical alert in Edinburgh city centre. Police and firefighters were called to the five-star Scotsman Hotel at lunchtime yesterday. Investigators entered wearing  special protective suits after a partial evacuation of the historic building was ordered. Scroll down for video . Officers wore specialist suits to enter the room where the two bodies were found at The Scotsman . It is believed the man and woman, who . were found in bed together  in their sixth-floor room, were of  Russian . or Eastern European origin. Their names had not been released last . night. Efforts were on-going last night to trace the pair’s next of kin. It is not known if they were in a relationship but they are believed to have different surnames. Police were called around 12.15pm after the bodies were found by a cleaner. Guests on three floors were then evacuated. A large cordon was put in place outside the hotel entrance in North Bridge and along the pavement towards the Balmoral Hotel in Princes Street. It is understood that a container of chemicals was found in the room. The fire service treated the deaths as a ‘chemical incident’, which saw around 25 firefighters, three fire engines and a support crew called to the scene. A ‘detection, identification and monitoring unit’ was also called in to check for hazardous materials. Precaution: The sixth floor was evacuated while officers carried out checks of the luxury hotel in Edinburgh . Firefighters wore protective clothing including ‘gas-tight’ suits and breathing apparatus. After the initial call, fire crew . were seen leaving the hotel wearing chemical protection or ‘hazmat’ [hazardous materials] gear. They were then hosed down before removing the protective clothing. Thousands of performers and tourists . are currently in Scotland’s capital for the Fringe Festival, which . officially begins today. Among those evacuated from the building were guests attending a wedding reception. Speaking at the scene, Chief . Inspector Murray Dykes of Police Scotland said: ‘At about 12.15pm, the . body of a man and woman were discovered within the Scotsman Hotel. ‘There has been a full turnout of police, fire and ambulance. ‘At the moment we are treating the . deaths as unexplained. We will be doing a full forensic recovery of the . bodies and inquiries will continue.’ The investigation is at an early stage and neither the ages or nationalities of the deceased had been established. Asked about the chemical aspect of . the incident, Mr Dykes said: ‘There has been a hefty response for this. We’re treating all things as they come in. The Scotsman hotel in Edinburgh where a man and woman were found dead today . Investigation: Inside one of the rooms at The Scotsman which has been evacuated . ‘The reason that there has been a full turnout is because we are taking full precautions at the moment.’ Sources close to the investigation confirmed that the couple had apparently ingested chemicals. The Scotsman Hotel is just off the Royal Mile and a short distance from Princes Street, the city’s main shopping thoroughfare. Standard rooms cost upwards of £250 a night, while the rate for the penthouse suite in late August is £1,125. Norma and Derek Cameron, from Kelso, . Roxburghshire, are staying at the hotel for two nights. They were . prevented from returning to their room on the eighth floor after . spending a day in the city. Mrs Cameron, 71, said she and her . husband had intended to get ready for an evening at the Royal Edinburgh . Military Tattoo. ‘We wanted to get in and get refreshed,’ she added. ‘The police weren’t giving anything away. They just said that the hotel had been closed and everyone evacuated.

I’m not sure I want to go back in now.’ Lynn Massie, 34, and Neil Cooper, 31, . from Aberdeen, were awaiting to collect their luggage after a two-day . break when the incident happened. Miss Massie said: ‘We’re really . shocked. I feel very sorry for the families of the two people. I don’t . know what happened but it’s quite sad. ‘You don’t expect something like this to happen at a five-star hotel. It’s a shame for the hotel staff too.’ Guests who left the hotel were not . permitted to return until the evening. Carl and Susan Ware, from Sydney, . Australia, who had travelled to Edinburgh for the Tattoo, were . prevented from checking into the hotel. Mr Ware, 55, said: ‘We were told we . weren’t allowed in. The incident had already happened when we arrived. We were told we could get in at 4.30pm or 4.45pm. I just hope we are not . on the same floor.’ US tourist Betty Cuniberti, from San . Francisco, California, said she was in her bedroom on the sixth floor . when the fire alarm sounded and firefighters went round the hotel asking . people to leave. She said: ‘There was a very loud bang . on the door and when I opened it, it was a fireman and somebody from . the hotel saying it was being evacuated. ‘They told me it was safe to take the elevator but I wasn’t happy to do that so I took the stairs. ‘I feel just terribly about what’s happened. It’s really tragic.’ Fire crews started to leave the scene at around 4pm yesterday. However, three floors of the luxury . hotel remained closed to the public last night, with guests being found . alternative accommodation. The Scotsman Hotel in the heart of Scotland’s capital city opened around 12 years ago. It was once home to the offices of . The Scotsman newspaper. The building opened its doors to the public in . Edinburgh for advertising in 1831. The middle floors of the building, . now home to luxurious rooms and suites, were originally used for . editorial offices. Investigation: A large cordon was put in place outside the hotel entrance in North Bridge . The North Bridge Brasserie was once . the grand reception area. In 2001, the newspaper moved to its own . purpose-built offices in Holyrood, paving the way for development of the . hotel. Now with 56 rooms and 12 suites, the . hotel retains its ‘originality and quirky features and this, along with . the five-star service we endeavour to deliver, offers visitors a unique . experience,’ according to the hotel’s website. As part of a major . £19.5million refurbishment project, the split-level penthouse suite was . created with a private sauna and a terrace with views across the city. In another similar incident in May, a . mother and daughter were found dead after a double suicide pact in a . budget hotel in Greenock, Renfrewshire.

Step-gran doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, and a straightforward ‘gran’ has the potential to cause offence. But when it comes to little Prince George, it seems as if the Duchess of Cornwall might have the tricky issue cracked – with the unlikely name of GaGa. Yesterday Camilla revealed to the Daily Mail that ‘GaGa’ is what her own grandchildren call her. ‘I don’t know if it’s because they think I am,’ she joked, ‘but it is still very sweet.’ Camilla disclosed her quirky nickname as she and Prince Charles visited the Sandringham Flower Show in Norfolk, which is held on the Queen’s private estate. Thousands of well-wishers waited in driving rain to greet the couple, particularly to congratulate Charles on the birth of his first grandchild, Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge. Seeking shelter in the Sandringham Women’s Institute tent, Camilla chatted proudly about Prince William and Kate’s ‘lovely’ new addition to the family as she stocked up on £1.20 packets of chocolate buns. For many families in which parents are divorced or separated, the issue of what to call a step-grandparent can become a social minefield, sometimes causing bitter rifts – although clearly not here. The Duchess of Cornwall made the revelation at the 132nd Sandringham Flower Show at Sandringham House in Norfolk . Ga Ga: The Duchess of Cornwall quipped, 'I don't know if it's because they think I am!' Asked what she had decided to call herself, Camilla told the Mail: ‘That’s something we have got to have a think about. We haven’t decided yet.’ She continued, laughing: ‘My own grandchildren call me GaGa. I don’t know if it’s because they think I am! It is funny but is still very sweet. Family: The Duchess has forged an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry . ‘We are all just about to go off on holiday together, there will be seven children in all. Can you imagine? It can be quite chaotic, but I just love having them around.’ Camilla has five grandchildren under the age of five from the two children she had during her first marriage to Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles. Her son, Tom Parker Bowles, has two children with his wife, Sara: Lola, five, and Freddy, three. Her daughter, Laura Lopes, and her husband Harry also have Eliza, five, and twins Gus and Louis, three. Although she was described as  ‘the Rottweiler’ by William’s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, friends say Camilla is a warm and generous woman, who adores her growing family. She frequently chats happily about how the ‘entire brood’ regularly take over her private home in Wiltshire at weekends. She has also managed to forge an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry, and was seen offering Kate some wifely advice over lunch shortly before her wedding. As his wife chatted about pet names, Prince Charles was busy collecting gifts from well-wishers to be passed on to baby Prince George, including teddy bears, babygros and books. Charles said: ‘It’s a wonderful feeling [to be a grandfather]. It’s a very nice feeling, isn’t it?’ Cute: The Duchess is presented with some seeds by 22-month-old Evelyn Holt . Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, carries her new born son, the Prince of Cambridge, who may soon be calling his step-grandmother 'Ga Ga' Long to reign over us: Kate and William pose for pictures with their new baby son, George Alexander Louis . He was clearly delighted to receive a teddy bear embroidered with George’s name from 55-year-old Sheila Clark, of Glasgow, asking: ‘You didn’t put a bet on it did you?’ Unfortunately not, she said. He also told Freda Aspinall, 73, herself a great-grandmother, that baby George was ‘very sweet’ but it was ‘too early to say’ who he looked like. ‘I think I am going to have to go on a babysitting course as it’s a while since I have done this sort of thing,’ he added.","Royal reveals her grandchildren's quirky nickname for her .

"By . Inderdeep Bains . PUBLISHED: . 16:11 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:42 EST, 2 August 2013 . Scheming ‘heir-hunters’ who conned a dead woman’s unsuspecting relatives out of her almost £240,000 estate have been ordered to pay the victims back. Beneficiaries Limited targeted three siblings after their 93-year-old aunt Charlotte Cook died in a rest home without leaving a will. The company charged the bereaved family thousands of pounds in expenses before taking a massive cut of their £237,342 inheritance, a court heard yesterday. Edinburgh-based Beneficiaries Limited billed more than £132,000 in commission and expenses . The siblings were left with little more than £10,000 each - money they still haven’t received. Judge Richard Parkes branded the frauds ‘calculated, cynical and well planned’ and ordered the company to pay £200,000 compensation to the victims and fined it £25,000. He said: ‘The relatives lost extremely substantial amounts of money in a very unfortunate and upsetting set of circumstances.’ The Edinburgh-based Beneficiaries Limited denied seven counts of fraud by false representation and three charges of misleading consumers by omission but a jury found them guilty on all 10 charges. Following her death in January 2009 Mrs Cook’s financial guardian, solicitor Colin Bell, contacted Beneficiaries Limited to administer her will because she had no known family and no will. During the trial last month the court heard that the business had racked up more than £15,000 in bills before they even contacted Mrs Cook’s family. Gordon Menzies, prosecuting on behalf of West Berkshire Council, described how two people from Beneficiaries Limited - company director Alexander Pilley and a female colleague - visited siblings David Mitchell, Lesley Mitchell and Patricia Byrne at their homes in Surrey in October 2009. He told the Reading Crown Court, Berkshire, that during meetings over two days the pair refused to tell the relatives who had died or how much the estate was worth. Mr Menzies said the relatives were then given a contract to sign which stipulated Beneficiaries Limited would get a 40 per cent share of any inheritance payout and the family would cover the company’s expenses. If they didn’t sign, the court was told, they would not get anything. Beneficiaries Limited were not represented at the trial at Reading Crown Court and no one from the company attended . Mr Menzies said the company charged the siblings £3.33 per minute to meet with them over two days. Other expenses included £250 per person per night allowances for overnight stays. The company’s commission and expenses amounted to over £132,000 including over £7,000 for the family visits. Mr Menzies said, Beneficiaries Limited went on to sub-contract work to other firms which were also run by Pilley in a ‘highly artificial, very sophisticated and very cynical way of doing business’. The siblings should have got more than £35,000 each but were told they would receive little more than £10,700. A further two relatives in Canada should have received more than £50,000 each. In total, the company should have paid out £213,096, but as yet they have not paid anything and the money appears to have disappeared. The company was not represented at the trial and nobody from the firm attended. The judge was told that it had no assets and was soon to be dissolved. Pilley, of Livingston, West Lothian, was ruled to be unfit to stand trial last month. A separate jury therefore went on to conclude in a trial of issue that Pilley had committed ‘the acts and omissions’ which comprised the offences. Speaking outside of the hearing victim Lesley Mitchell explained how she had never met her aunt and that only of her cousins in Canada was aware of her. The 59-year-old from Surrey said: ‘We couldn’t believe it when we learned we were due an inheritance. Sadly, I don’t think that we will ever see any of that money as it has all gone.’","93-year-old Charlotte Cook died without leaving a will in 2009 .

Sufferer: As a father I've seen first-hand how Type 1 diabetes has dominated the life of my eldest son, Ben, for the best part of 30 years . The news that Home Secretary Theresa May has been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 56 will ignite the attention of anyone who has an interest in this condition — especially as it is so rare for someone of her age. I have several patients with Type 1 diabetes, but as a father I’ve seen first-hand how it has dominated the life of my eldest son, Ben, for the best part of 30 years. In my 36 years as a GP, I can’t recall a fiftysomething patient who has developed it out of the blue. Doctors occasionally see the onset of Type 1 in teenagers or young adults in their 20s, but later than that is very unusual. I would imagine someone as organised as the Home Secretary will be able to manage her condition and go on living a relatively normal life. But as I have seen with Ben, even if you are meticulous in your management of Type 1 diabetes, you can only minimise — never completely absolve yourself — of complications. Mrs May, who had been strongly tipped to succeed David Cameron as Conservative leader, admits she often works an 18-hour day. And although long ministerial hours will still be achievable, she will have to ensure that she eats regular sit-down meals. There can be no erratic snacking on chocolate or crisps for the diabetic. Like Ben, Mrs May will have to inject herself with insulin. Some people use pumps which infuse a continuous flow of insulin rather than several large shots, but these are not as common as the injections — simply because they are formidably expensive and fairly new. But no matter how careful you are, mistakes will be made, and we see this with Ben all the time. If he has too little insulin, or too much food and not enough exercise, he can’t go long before his blood sugar can go stormingly high. The penalty for that is serious complications such as eye and kidney damage and a greatly increased rate of atheroma formation, the process of clogging up of arteries in the heart or brain with cholesterol deposits. Too much insulin and he may pass out through too low a level of glucose in the blood, a so-called ‘hypo’ (hypoglycaemic attack). Ben developed diabetes when he was seven, and as a child he would become very aggressive, spitting at us and lashing out before passing out unconscious if we couldn’t get a sugary drink or snack down him in time. Although Ben manages his diabetes with great care and has led a full life — gaining a history degree from Manchester University and carving out a successful career in TV commercials — he has by no means been immune to complications. The Home Secretary should take heed. Diabetes is the most common cause of acquired blindness in the western world, and six months ago Ben lost his driving licence because he has a retinopathy — where the retina at the back of the eye becomes damaged. He has passed out on countless occasions, sometimes on his own on a train or in an airport where, distressingly, onlookers have mistaken him for a drunk. For that reason he wears a medical bracelet to alert people to his condition. Coping: Like Ben, Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured last month) will have to inject herself with insulin . This will be something that Mrs May must be worried about. There’s every chance that she might keel over at the despatch box or in a meeting. For this reason, everyone around her — from her personal secretary to her driver — must be up to speed on her condition. She will want to be independent, yet everyone must be aware of the signs and symptoms of her condition because every now and then a meal will get missed or she will take in too much insulin and she will go off beam. A diabetic always wants to be independent but, as parents, we had to brief everyone from friends to teachers to skiing instructors about Ben’s condition in case he passed out. Unfortunately, Ben has also suffered from kidney failure and had a transplant. Now, that kidney has also failed and he is due to go back on to dialysis. One day in the next year or so, he hopes to have another transplant, this time of a kidney and pancreas, which should cure him of diabetes. It’s very new technology and I know of no patients who have gone through this operation, but it’s part of the new world of transplanting that offers hope to diabetics everywhere. The tragedy is that he will have to wait for someone else to die before he can be cured. Type 1 is most commonly called acute juvenile onset diabetes because it is a dramatic disease that suddenly appears and almost universally affects young people. Only last week, a child of only one was diagnosed at my practice. This is in contrast to Type 2 diabetes, also known as maturity onset diabetes, which, although it is also recognised by the presence of high glucose levels in the bloodstream, is almost a different disease entirely. We see Type 2 in middle-aged and older people, usually in the context of excess body weight, the problem being a relative rather than an absolute deficiency of the hormone insulin. But Type 1 diabetes is a medical emergency and an incurable illness that occurs because of the sudden loss of insulin, a  protein hormone that is  produced by nests of cells that are situated in the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is a medical emergency . and an incurable illness that occurs because of the sudden loss of . insulin, a  protein hormone that is  produced by nests of cells that are . situated in the pancreas . Insulin is vital for the control of blood glucose levels. Glucose is the most important currency — the pound sterling — of energy in the body. It is the preferred fuel for our heart muscle, it is the only energy source that our brains can use, and insulin is the hormone that controls glucose levels, mobilising it from stores and enabling body tissues to use the glucose at the site needed. With Type 1 diabetes, quite suddenly, insulin production ceases — usually because the cells making it are rapidly killed off by antibodies or a virus. Glucose levels then soar and the patient becomes acutely ill within days, with weight loss, thirst, weakness and eventually a state called diabetic ketoacidosis — a derangement of the chemistry of the entire body, with over-breathing, vomiting and eventual loss of consciousness. Before the Twenties, when insulin was discovered and could be purified (from beef or pig pancreatic tissue) and then injected as a treatment, death was the outcome. Thankfully, treatment has come a long way since those dark days. Ben was diagnosed six weeks after he had suffered a bout of chicken pox. Doctors believe that a virus may trigger Type 1 diabetes in someone who has a genetic susceptibility. We had noticed he had started climbing up to the sink to drink water from the tap as he was suffering from extreme thirst. He was also getting up regularly in the night to urinate. Colleagues: Home Secretary Theresa May is pictured with Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this month. Mrs May will want to be independent, yet everyone must be aware of the signs and symptoms of her condition . These are common symptoms of diabetes but to my shame, I didn’t spot what was happening straight away. At the time, my wife was 38 weeks pregnant with our second son, Cosmo, and I simply thought Ben was being wilful because the new baby was nearly here. In the end, I took a urine sample which showed his sugar levels were high. So I took a blood sample and to my horror, his blood sugar reading was six times higher than it should have been. I rang Guy’s Hospital to inform them of my boy’s symptoms and to my astonishment, they asked me to bring him in a couple of days. When I told them he would be dead by then, they admitted him straight away. There, he was diagnosed with Type 1, and . my wife was admitted with him because she had to learn quickly how to . manage our son’s incurable illness. Ben checks his blood glucose around four to five times a day - and it’s likely that the Home Secretary will have to do the same . His treatment involves striking a careful balance between food intake and the dose of insulin needed. Diabetics must be particularly watchful over the amount of carbohydrate and starch they consume, as glucose forms the main building bricks of much larger starch molecules. Insulin is usually injected between two and four times daily, depending on the needs of the individual. Ben checks his blood glucose around four to five times a day — and it’s likely that the Home Secretary will have to do  the same. He has to prick his finger and insert a dot of blood into a portable gizmo. It means he can govern carefully what he needs to eat and also calculate the correct insulin dosage to inject into himself at that moment in time. The Home Secretary will have to get used to this routine and fit it into her already busy schedule. How much energy she has been using a day will need to be taken into consideration. Sitting in Cabinet meetings or an office uses less fuel than dashing about to constituency meetings, going to the gym, or hill walking  on holiday. The essence of treating a patient with diabetes is to educate them to enable them to self govern and take full responsibility for managing their own condition with rigorous self discipline and meticulous  attention to all details. Only in this way are future complications minimised and a normal life possible — even for a future possible Prime Minister.","Theresa May has been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 56 .

The father of National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden told Russian television that he is grateful to President Vladimir Putin and his government for protecting his son. Speaking to the state-owned Rossiya 24 channel in footage broadcast Wednesday, Lon Snowden of Allentown, Pennsylvania, thanked the Kremlin for the 'courage' shown in keeping his son safe. Addressing his son, Lon Snowden said that 'your family is well and we love you.' He added that 'I hope to see you soon, but most of all I want you to be safe.' In this frame grab taken from Rossiya 24 channel, Lon Snowden, the father of National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden thanks President Vladimir Putin and his government for the 'courage' they have shown in keeping his son safe . Lonnie Snowden said he would not fly to Russia to serve as an 'emotional tool' in the United States' efforts to persuade his son to surrender . Lon Snowden, a former U.S. Coast Guard, also said in an interview with the Washington Post that he asked to speak with his son but the FBI told him it wasn't possible. Instead they asked him to visit his son in Moscow. Speaking . to Washington Post reporter Jerry Markon, the supportive father said: . 'I was asked if I would consider flying to Moscow. And I said ""yes, but . however, I want to know what the objective is and I want to be able to . speak to my son to see if there is value, because I'm not going to fly . to Moscow to sit on the tarmac to be an emotional tool for you, for the . government.' The younger Snowden has been stuck in the transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since arriving from Hong Kong on June 23. Russia is considering his request for temporary asylum, which he submitted on July 16. Putin has warned that Snowden could be granted asylum on condition he agrees not to hurt U.S. interests - implying that the American would have to stop leaking material on Washington's spying efforts. Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, has said the fugitive told him he could meet that demand. The Guardian newspaper on Wednesday made a new report on U.S. intelligence-gathering based on information from Snowden, but Kucherena said the material was provided before Snowden promised to stop leaking. 'He warned me that he had already sent to the press an array of revealing information and secret documents and, unfortunately, could not stop its publication,' Kucherena was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. NSA leaker Edward Snowden is seen during his meeting with Russian activists and officials at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow, Russia on July 12 . Snowden has been living at the airport for five weeks, awaiting Russian visa papers to be able to leave and seek asylum . Snowden, who revealed details of a U.S. intelligence program to monitor Internet activity, has received offers of asylum from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Bolivia. However, the logistics of reaching any of those countries are complicated because his U.S. passport has been revoked. Snowden would need the country he wants to reach to issue him travel documents and he would have to find a way to get there. The only direct commercial flight to the region, one that goes to Havana, Cuba, flies over Europe and the U.S., which could cause complications. Some European countries refused to allow Bolivian President Evo Morales to fly through their airspace on his way home from Moscow earlier this month due to suspicions Snowden was on his plane. The elder Snowden said that, considering those issues, his son's best option may be to stay in Russia. 'If it were me, I would stay in Russia and that's what I hope my son will do,' he said, adding that he hopes to be able to visit him in Moscow. Anatoly Kucherena (L), the Russian lawyer assisting Snowden, told media at Sheremetyevo airport last week that Snowden has been granted the papers that will allow him to leave the transit area of a Moscow airport where he is holed up . Kucherena told the Vesti-FM radio station on Wednesday that he is arranging for Snowden's father to visit Russia. Kucherena said that he would send Lon Snowden a letter of invitation to Russia later on Wednesday. Kucherena said that Snowden asked him to get in touch with his father because 'he needs moral support.' The elder Snowden told Russian television that he feels proud of his son. 'My son is a principled young man, he is a man of courage and what he saw he couldn't live with,' he said. 'I know that I have raised him to do the right thing. Sometimes the right thing means personal sacrifice, and that's what he did.' To the Post, the father backed his son's position and described him as 'wholesome' and patriotic'. He said his son grew up in Maryland surrounded by federal agents and law enforcers in his family, but Edward was always the 'brilliant one'. 'I have never known him to be cruel or harsh with anyone at any time,' he said. Snowden Jr began working in intelligence in 2003, he told the reporter, under the Bush administration; he saw how things evolved, he told the reporter. With the arrival of the Obama administration he hoped that things would change, but Snowden Sr said rather than getting better, things got worse. Since leaking the National Security Documents to Wikileaks, Snowden Jr has been trapped in the transit area of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, unable to travel and seek asylum elsewhere because the U.S. revoked his passport. His father believes he is doing the right thing remaining in Russia, since he says the U.S. institutions and media have generated 'propaganda' about his son and he would not be given a fair trial if he were to return. He said: 'Where at this point, unless someone's been living in a cave without a TV, can my son get a fair trial?' He said, based on the behavior of the . U.S. government, both the Congress and Justice departments, he has lost . confidence that they are operating in good faith.

Casper ruled before trial that that was not a legal defense . to crimes including murder. Bulger, . 83, is on trial in a broad racketeering indictment that accuses him of . participating in 19 murders in the 1970s and '80s as leader of the . Winter Hill Gang. He has pleaded not guilty. Payout: Bulger said he wants $800,000 seized from his apartment to go to the families of his victims, including Patricia Donahue (left), widow of Michael Donahue, and their son Tommy (right) He . fled Boston in 1994 and was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives . until he was captured in Santa Monica, California, in 2011.

Prosecutor Brian Kelly said it has . always been the intention of the government to give the case to victims' families, but added that he wasn't sure if Bulger could choose who . received the money. The . Halloran and Donahue families had been awarded a combined $8.5 million . in 2007 after a judge ruled the FBI was responsible for the deaths of . the men, My Fox Boston reported.

She's famous for being incredibly nice to everyone she meets and now singer Leona Lewis has gone one step further by revealing that she would give up her career to end animal testing. Although the EU has outlawed testing beauty products on animals, the rest of the world is yet to follow suit - much to animal lover Lewis' dismay. Asked to choose between a global ban on vivisection and her singing career by an interviewer, Lewis said that she would plump for the former, adding: 'I could still do my music . in any capacity if I wanted to, but I think it’s just so important for . humans to show compassion. Animal lover: Vegetarian singer Leona Lewis says she would give up her music career for a ban on vivisection . 'They say you can judge a society on how it . treats its animals, and I think that’s very true – it all filters down.' She added: 'The EU ban will put pressure . on the rest of the world: they won’t be able to sell their . animal-tested products in Europe any longer, so it makes financial sense . that they replace their animal tests with alternative methods if they . want to trade in this lucrative market.' This isn't the first time Lewis has made clear her feelings on the issue of animal cruelty. In 2008, the singer reportedly turned down a seven-figure offer to appear at a Harrods sale launch from former boss Mohammed Al Fayed on the grounds that the retailer stocks fur. She also supports several animal rights charities and has attempted to raise the profile of animal rights by collaborating with Topshop on an ethical accessories line and The Body Shop - which has long campaigned against vivisection - on a beauty range. Along with a cruelty free make-up collection, vegetarian Lewis also fronts the beauty retailer's White Musk Libertine perfume collection. Although real musk, which is taken from the Musk Deer, is banned under the CITES act on endangered species, synthetic musk, as used in The Body Shop's product, does no harm to animals - or the people who use it. Cruelty free: Lewis poses with a bottle of her White Musk Libertine perfume created for The Body Shop . Interview: Lewis made her comments in the August issue of Cosmopolitan which is out now . That the chemical, which predates The Body Shop, was declared safe for use after extensive testing - some of which could have been done on animals - cuts no ice with Lewis, who points out that vivisection is far less effective than modern tests. 'I tell [cynical people] there are so many tests that are so superior to animal testing that the practice is actually laughable and needless,' she revealed in an interview with Cosmopolitan. 'I’m really hopeful but people need to know there’s still a long way to go - I don’t want them to get complacent and not sign the Cruelty Free International pledge. 'I’m not about bashing people over the head and telling them what they should do, but I have a point to make and I will make it subtly, showing people they can choose to do the right thing.' Lewis also revealed that she refuses to use any product that could have something of animal origin and insists that her make-up artist and hair stylist don't use products that have been tested on living creatures. 'I definitely am quite strict about it. My makeup and hair people know I don’t use any brushes that use real animal hair, and we stay away from products from parts of the world where they’re animal-tested and not humane at all.

'Also The Body Shop’s dry oils, which I put on in the shower, and its Strawberry Bubble Bath and Coconut Body Butter are the best things ever. 'I’m quite obsessed with coconut – I put it on my skin and on my hair. I learnt that from my grandma. I even put it on my horse. That sounds pretty weird, but I put it in his hair and he really loves it!' But it hasn't all been smooth sailing for Lewis thanks to confusing labels and baffling chemical names, which meant that she had to give up some products after discovering they contain cochineal (made from beetle blood) and fish scales. 'I’ve only just learnt that a lot of the red pigment in cosmetics is actually from beetles, and I think some of the shimmers in bronzers can be made from fish scales. 'So I like Body Shop products; I don’t have to worry about such ingredients in its red lipsticks and shimmer palettes. I couldn’t even kill a spider or a fly or anything. I’m very Buddhist in that sense.' Read the full interview with Leona Lewis in the August issue of Cosmopolitan, on sale now.

He may be just 3ft 1ins tall but height has never been a barrier for this 16-year-old who has become a top performer at the extreme sport of free-running. Kain Francis - who has a rare form of dwarfism - risks life and limb, scaling high buildings, leaping off objects and standing on his head, to indulge his passion for the craze. And at 96 centimetres, or 3ft 1ins, the teenager has learned to cope with the rough and tumble, having spent years battling against bullies who targeted him over his condition. Scroll down for video . Talented: Sports mad Kain Francis, 16, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, has been picked for the basketball and football in the Dwarf Games in America . Kain’s proud family said he had . overcome cruel barbs from people who called him Mini-Me, after the . diminutive character in the Austin Powers movies. Now the aspiring TV producer is off to the World Dwarf Games in America, competing in football and basketball. Former . Perry Beeches Academy pupil Kain, from Kingstanding, Birmingham, said . he had learned to overcome the attention his height attracted. Rough and tumble: The teenager risks life and limb, scaling high buildings, leaping off objects and standing on his head, to indulge his passion for free-running . 'It got to me when I started secondary school,' he said. 'I didn’t realise it would be as bad as it was. The kids would pick me up without asking me and joke about me getting into my bag. 'They’d call me Mini-Me and midget. 'In the end, it was sorted out when I flagged it up to the teacher. 'Now if someone asks what is wrong with me, I just tell them. I even went to a college to talk about my condition and everyone understood it a lot more. 'I haven’t really seen anyone else in the city with my type of dwarfism.' Head over heels: 3ft 1ins tall Kain Francis took up the extreme sport of free-running in order to keep fit . Ambition: Kain Francis has never let his height prevent him from fulfilling his love of playing sport and keeping active . Kain now works part-time as a junior administrator at Acer Equipment, in Solihull, West Midlands, and is to start at Walsall College in September. He said his love of free running stemmed from a desire to keep fit. 'A friend started doing it and I wasn’t very fit so I thought I’d do it to improve myself. 'It is really difficult and it involves climbing really tall objects. 'The tallest is probably around 20ft high.' Kain’s condition was diagnosed after he was born nine weeks early at Birmingham’s City Hospital. His . 5ft 2ins mum, administrator Luan, 42, said: 'Around two days later, a . doctor noticed there was something wrong with his bone structures. 'He said it seemed to a be a genetic mutation and asked if there was dwarfism in the family.' His parents were told he had skeletal dysplasia and more tests were carried out to find out what type of dwarfism he had. But doctors were baffled as he had the chromosome normally missing in those with the condition. Diagnosis: Kain Francis, pictured aged three, with his one-year-old sister, was diagnosed with a rare form of dwarfism shortly after he was born . Luan added: 'At the time it was devastating. This wasn’t picked up during the 20-week scan when I was pregnant. 'We did our own research to find out about how it would affect him. 'There were lots of support groups for people with dwarfism, including the Restricted Growth Foundation. 'But we are quite independent. Eron and I wanted to give him the best upbringing possible and didn’t want him to feel any different.' But the differences in Kain became more noticeable as he got older, especially why he stands next to dad Eron, 47, who is a strapping six-footer. 'He started walking at about 13 months like others, but he looked like a baby chicken,' Luan said. 'His gait was different, too. But cognitively he was fine and was a typical baby in many other ways. 'He is stared at every day. People point and stare. I can take it from children, but I find it difficult from adults. 'Sometimes people will stop their car just to look at him. People think he’s just like Verne Troyer.' Luan . said of one incident: 'About ten years ago, a man on his scooter saw . Kain and put his little finger to his mouth as the character does in the . movies. 'I said to him: ""How dare you? You wouldn’t take the mickey out of someone with a different disability like that"". 'I still feel that way. No other disabled person would be treated that way, but people think they can poke fun at those with dwarfism. 'I have even come across people who are scared of those with the condition. The word midget is highly offensive too and has no place in today’s society.' Kain, who was a 13-year-old sister called Ella, faces at least two years of surgery to straighten his legs after he returns from the week-long games, to be held in Michigan, USA, from Saturday. Surgery: Kain Francis will undergo operations on his legs when he returns from representing his country at basketball and football in the Dwarf Games in Michigan . 'I can’t wait to go to the games as I’ve never been before,' he said. 'I won’t be able to compete in the National Dwarf Games at the Alexander Stadium, Birmingham, next year as I’m having an operation on my legs so I’ll be recovering for quite a while.' Kain was first introduced to the national games aged four and won a young achievers’ award the following year. He took part until he was six, when he first underwent leg surgery, and returned at nine. Over the years, he picked up medals in football, javelin, the discus and the relay race. 'He is amazing at football,' Luan said. 'He has very good eye-hand co-ordination. 'I really encouraged him to go for the world games, and we had to raise £1,700. Hopefully he’ll do really well. 'He is very independent and doesn’t dwell on being a dwarf. He is just a boy who is slightly different.' More information about the games and the Dwarf Athletics Association is available at www.dsauk.org. Kain’s trip to Michigan is being subsidised by the Dream it, Believe it Achieve it Foundation.","Kain Francis, 16, has rare form of dwarfism and is just 3ft 1ins tall .

"By . Ashley Pearson . PUBLISHED: . 10:34 EST, 19 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:51 EST, 19 July 2013 . A . first time mum-to-be at 35, Ashley Pearson writes in a weekly column on . Femail Online about fertility issues, the ups and downs of pregnancy . and ultimately the joys and stress of motherhood for the career girl who . may have come a bit late to the party, but is happy to be here just the . same... As I wandered, contraction-ridden through the overheated hallways of the labour ward at Chelsea Westminister Hospital, I wondered if I had made a serious mistake in choosing to give birth here. Post-pregnancy woes: Ashley didn't realise how much havoc having a baby would wreak on her body . No, not because of the overcrowding, the long wait to see a doctor, the desperately hot atmosphere (I was told that despite the warm temperatures outside, the heaters were still running and no one knew how to turn them off) but because I was surrounded by women who appeared to have arrived straight from a photo shoot. Literally.  There was not one mum to be bigger than a size 10 (US size 6), hair was freshly blown out, nails immaculate and they’d perfected that whole 'I have make up on but it looks like I don’t' look. I arrived swollen, sweating and irritable, in the only item of maternity clothes that still fit me, with hair that could have used a washing and at least three sizes bigger than anyone else. I couldn’t believe it. Hadn’t anyone else gained weight in any place other than their picture perfect tiny bumps? I felt like a hippo who had wandered into a savanna populated only by gazelles. After a difficult birth which culminated in an unplanned C-section, I was over the moon delighted to bring home my beautiful, healthy baby girl. Everything I had heard about the all consuming love you feel for this little person was true. My gratitude was overwhelming. It was completely life-changing; and beyond my greatest expectations. It was also hugely difficult.  I’d anticipated challenges with breast feeding, lack of sleep, shifting hormones and recovering from the surgery, and I found them. However, what I was totally unprepared for is the state of my body after childbirth.  Naively, I had expected to walk out of that hospital not looking pregnant anymore. The reality was that in addition to still appearing to be deep into my second trimester, I actually looked heavier than ever, as my nine month sized bump had served to distract from what was going on with the rest of me, which had now aggressively re-emerged from the background. Seeing myself for the first time out of the shower was jarring. I wish more women had warned me about how that might feel. The first time I saw myself in a mirror post baby, the angry purple stretch marks, the milk- heavy breasts, the excess, loose skin on my formerly pilates-honed abs, was truly demoralising.  Some of it was due to the baby of course, but to some degree, much of it was my own doing. Having not thought about my weight or denied myself anything food-wise for the past nine months, I was left with the result.  I realised that I had a mountain to climb and felt entirely unprepared. Tough: Like Zac Goldsmith's wife Alice, 27, getting her pre-baby figure back has proved challenging for Ashley . Gathering up my courage, I decided to tackle things head on and step on the scales.  To my shock and horror I discovered I was 20 pounds heavier than when I had gone into the hospital! I had delivered a nine pound baby - how could that possibly be? As I expressed my dismay and began frantically Googling , I noticed a sheepish expression flicker across my husband’s face. Apparently, when I’d decided on impulse to weigh myself a week before I was due to give birth (after having avoided the scales through most of the second and all of the third trimester) my husband had shaved off a solid 25 pounds - being unable to see the digital read out myself over my massive belly. 'I knew you’d be upset,' he said guilty, 'and you had enough to worry about, so I knocked off a few pounds when you asked me what it said.' The man clearly knows me too well.  While it may have been insightful at the time, I was now left with a bitter and very unappealing truth about the state of things. A stone heavier than normal when I’d conceived, I had gained another three stone during the pregnancy. I thought about celebrities like Kate Hudson who managed to shift 80 pounds of pregnancy weight in three months before heading back to work on a film.  I was amazed at her self discipline and openly coveted her daily trainer, nannies and personal chef. The famously self-disciplined Victoria Beckham told Vogue that after the birth of her baby Harper, she headed straight to the gym and followed a workout regime prepared by celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson. 'I worked out a lot. I ran a lot. I did it six days a week. I become quite obsessive when I get into something.' Beyonce was back on stage within several months of giving birth Blue Ivy and wearing sexy catsuits that showed off a stunning post-pregnancy body. She said at the time, 'Y’all have no idea how hard I worked. I had to lose 60 pounds. They had me on that treadmill. I ate lettuce!' Comparing myself to these women just made me feel more inadequate. I felt completely out of my league. Exhausted I could barely function let alone imagine working out. In fact, due to my surgery, I had been warned off working out for 8-12 weeks. Slimline: Thanks to trainer Tracey Andersen, Victoria Beckham swiftly got back into shape after Harper's birth . Demoralising: Both Beyonce and Gwyneth Paltrow got their bodies back but admit it was hard work . Tiring: Instead of seeing her next pregnancy as a holiday, Ashley will treat it like an Ironman challenge . As I struggled with night feeds, breast feeding and taking care of my new baby, I still couldn’t shake off the new and awful feeling that I no longer felt like myself. My life looked nothing like it had before and I was walking around in a body that just didn’t feel like my own. Needing to heal and advised to wait until exercising, I made a few big decisions in the weeks to come.  I stopped stepping on the scales for one. I knew it would take time to get back to a place where I felt good, and I didn’t want the pressure of worrying about numbers. I also immediately ordered some clothes in sizes that would have formerly filled me with dread - but that actually fit me at the weight I now was. Therefore I could stop picking through my meagre and well worn selection of maternity gear.  And lastly I made a decision to treat myself to a diet home delivery food programme. Knowing I had no time to shop for healthy food, the energy to prepare it or the discipline to meal plan, I figured after what I’d been through I deserved it. I chose Soulmate foods because I’d heard the food was good and they were able to tailor a programme for breast feeding mums like myself.  All three decisions were good ones for me. It began to dawn on me that I ought to endeavour to love and care for my altered and changed body the way I loved my new baby. Putting up with all indignities without hesitation and forgiving everything without question. These were the first of many steps I knew it would take to get back to a place that felt like me. It was going to be a long journey but ultimately I would focus on keeping my baby healthy and trying to be patient with what my body could now do. As a mother over 35 I was learning the hard way that it’s especially vital to be in great physical shape when having a baby.  After all, we are already pushing our bodies to do something it would have physically preferred to do a decade ago. We are asking a tremendous amount of our bodies –and maintaining optimum health and fitness before and during our pregnancies seems the least we can do in return. Indeed, next time I get pregnant, if there is a next time, I will do things very differently.   In her wonderful book, How To Be A Woman, Caitlin Moran talks about her second pregnancy and says: . 'This time around though, I’m doing things differently. For starters, I haven’t spent the last two months of my pregnancy thinking, ""Let Christmas last forever! Every morning can start with two mince pies, served with cream, six miniature heroes, and some Pringles! It’s Crisp-mas! Hurrah for pregnant me!"" 'As a result, I haven’t put on forty pounds, and I’m capable of things like ""walking"", ""standing"", and ""getting off the sofa without making an 'Oooof' Sound"".' Looking back, my biggest error was not viewing my pregnancy from a physical fitness perspective. It’s a gruelling physical challenge requiring a great deal of preparation and constant care. Afterwards, I felt like I had run a marathon that I’d prepared for by walking around the block.  Indeed, beleaguered by morning sickness at points and tiredness at others, I treated my pregnancy in its entirety like it was a condition or illness; resting, taking it easy, pampering myself – whereas I will view the next one like the Ironman challenge it is.

NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams used a segment on last night's news to tell viewers that he'll be absent from the anchor's chair while he has a complete knee replacement. The segment describes the surgery Williams, along with 650,000 other Americans this year, will have to replace a knee that was damaged in a high school football game decades ago.Yet in what may be a sign of increased competitiveness in an evening news ratings race that Williams has dominated for several years, NBC News would not say Friday when Williams would go under the knife. Popular: Brian Williams has dominated the ratings but will be off the air for a few weeks soon for complete knee replacement surgery . Spokeswoman Erika Masonhall would say only that Williams will anchor Nightly News on Monday. Williams discussed the knee replacement surgery Thursday in a Nightly News segment about the procedure by Dr. Nancy Snyderman. 'If you don't see me around here for a while, this is the reason why,' he said, describing the 'helmet to the knee' injury he suffered playing high school football. 'I have been in pain for 35 years,' said Williams. 'I have paid a very high price from what's been confirmed to be the single worst New Jersey high school Catholic League football career in history,' he joked. Lester Holt will anchor the nightly news while Williams is away. Williams, 54, said he's had three previous surgeries on his right knee but the pain was becoming more of an issue. When it began costing him sleep, Williams said he realized it was time to take care of it. Leave of absence: Williams, seen here with his wife Jane, can expect to be back behind the desk from three weeks time up until three months . Bone-on-bone: Williams has been in agony for 35 years with his knee, which has lost all its cartilage meaning there's no cushioning between his bones. Surgery will replace knee with an artificial joint . 'If this doesn't go perfectly, it can't hurt any more than it does now,' he said. Snyderman said most people who have knee replacement surgery miss between three weeks and three months of work, depending on the physical nature of their jobs. Full recovery takes between six months and a year. Williams joked during an appearance on David Letterman's Late Show two weeks ago that 'I want to come back almost a little too early gooned on medication. I think it will be great viewing.' His newscast showed a rare sign of ratings vulnerability last week. The Nielsen company said ABC's World News beat NBC among the 25- to 54-year-old demographic that most news advertising sales are based on, breaking an NBC winning streak of 243 consecutive weeks. NBC won when viewers of all ages were counted.","NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams will undergo knee surgery .

Drew Hanley, 29, alleges Leathers was a mentally unstable drug abuser who took cocaine when they were together. Mr Hanley, who says he dated Leathers between 2007 and 2008 when she was a mere teenager, had harsh words for his 23-year-old ex. Former lovers: Drew Hanley (left) used to date Anthony Weiner's sexting partner Sydney Leathers between 2007 and 2008 when Leathers was a teenager .

'She nearly ruined my life.' Leathers' publicist told the Enquirer that Mr Hanley's account of the one-year relationship is 'ridiculous.' Mr Hanley claims that Leathers lived with with him and his brother in Indiana for several months when she wasn't getting along with her family. That's when they started dating. But, he said, the relationship was fraught with difficulties. 'She would become depressed and lock herself in the bathroom and start cutting herself,' he said. Mr Hanley, now 29 and happily married with a daughter, says Leathers needed psychological help - and claims she still does . Leathers admitted earlier this week that she was considering starring in a porn movie . 'She was into doing a lot of drugs, especially cocaine.' Mr Hanley claimed to the Enquirer that when he finally broke up with her, she tried to 'ruin his life.' She called his boss and tried to have him fired by claiming that he had threatened her. She then called police and said that she was stalking him, he alleged. 'They realized it was false and dropped the case,' he said.

She fell off the building!' after his date plummeted to her death from a 17th-storey balcony. Stephen Close, 35, had been out to dinner with Jennifer Rosoff, 35, on Wednesday evening before she invited him back to her apartment in New York. At just before 1am yesterday the pair, who were on their first date, went onto the . narrow balcony of the apartment for a cigarette. But when Miss Rosoff placed her leg on the railing to stretch, insisting to her concerned . date that it was safe, the balcony collapsed, sending the successful advertising executive plummeting 140 feet to her death. As reported by the New York Post, witnesses heard Mr Close, who works in real estate, scream : 'My friend fell! She fell off the building!' A witness said he was 'hysterical' and ran outside screaming 'Oh my god!' Speaking to the newspaper, a police source said Mr Close tried to warn the woman to get down. He heard two pops before the railing buckled, sending his date plummeting to the ground. 'He . looked at the balcony, and he told her, ""Look, this thing looks . unstable. Hey, maybe you want to get down,"" the source said. Emergency crews pronounced Rosoff dead at the scene. The medical examiner will determine a cause of death. Rosoff, . who graduated from Tulane University in New Orleans with a degree in communications, worked at The New .

As news of Rosoff's tragic death spread online, tributes started pouring in from devastated co-workers and friends. Rosoff's sister, Alexis Treeby, heard about her sister's tragic demise at about 5am. 'She was a lovely person. My children adored her,' Treeby told DNAinfo. 'She was kind, generous and did charity work.' Jennifer Rosoff, 35, plunged 17 floors to her death after the balcony railing gave way when she leaned on it . The two metal balcony railings on Rosoff's corner apartment were bent down in a V-shape . Those . who knew her described Rosoff as an 'A-player' in the highly . competitive media advertising field who was career-driven and very . athletic. ‘Jenn was a force to be reckoned with, smart, dynamic and charismatic,’ Lisa Hughes, the publisher of The New Yorker, told the New York Times. Danny Bellish, 26, a sales manager at the food magazine Saveur, recalled to amNY how in 2009, Rosoff drew a map for him on the back of a menu outlining all the things he needed to do to advance his career. Rosoff, who at the time worked for . Cosmopolitan, also helped Bellish's girlfriend land an internship and . organized a trunk show for his mother's jewelry business. The gray brick high-rise building on Manhattan's Upper East Side was built before World War II. Only . the higher-floor corner apartments have balconies, and the city's . buildings department ordered residents to stay off them following the . woman’s deadly fall.

The company that manages the upscale . Manhattan building was slapped with a fine earlier this year . for filing a safety inspection reports several months late, it was . revealed tonight. However the safety inspection was carried out and residents maintain the building was well maintained. In . 2010, after 24-year-old social worker Connor Donohue fell from his . 24th-floor balcony at 330 East 39th Street  when the railing gave way, . the city conducted safety inspections on hundreds of residences. Tenants . at 16 buildings were ordered to stay off their balconies because they . were deemed unsafe. 'A-player': Rosoff's friends described her as a 'force to be reckoned with' who was career-driven and athletic . Some 800 . building owners failed to file mandatory inspection reports on the . safety of their balconies and terraces, officials found. They are . required to file every five years. For . Rosoff's building, which was bought by the property management company . Stonehenge a year-and-a-half ago, the inspection report was last filed . in February several months past due, causing the company to incur a $250 . penalty. Local . residents said their apartment building is well-maintained and that Stonehenge has been making major improvement to the units.

Dynamic: Rosoff, a graduate of Tulane University, worked at The New Yorker, Lucky Magazine and Cosmopolitan before recently joining a new media advertising startup . ‘We are cooperating fully with the investigation into the cause of this terrible accident.’ Those . who knew the 35-year-old described her as an 'A-player' in the highly . competitive media advertising field who was career-driven and very . athletic. Jennifer . Rosoff went outside for a cigarette with her date, who she met online, . about 12.50am Thursday when the railing of the narrow balcony collapsed . after she propped her leg on it to stretch, according to DNAinfo. When . the volunteer charity worker's date told her that it wasn't safe to . lean on the railing, she insisted she 'did it all the time' before . tumbling from the Stonehedge 57 apartment ledge, landing on construction . scaffolding on the first floor. Emergency crews pronounced Rosoff dead at the scene. Associated Press said the railings were made of metal, which witnesses claim were 'bent and twisted'. New York Post claims its sources revealed the date told police he heard two sharp pops before the railing collapsed. Police have cleared the man, who had met Rosoff in person for the first time that night, of any possible wrongdoing. DNAinfo reported the man's parents answered his apartment door and said he . was home, but declined to comment. Neighbors . at the 400 East 57th Street building, near First Avenue in Manhattan's . Midtown East, compared the sound of Rosoff's fall to a 'gunshot' and a . 'punch'. Soda executive Steve Hersch, who lives two doors down from Rosoff, told DNAinfo: 'I heard a bang.

Playing tricks on your senses can have some interesting effects, especially when you suffer from motion sickness.

Shia LaBoeuf's uncle claims he is 'seeking to impoverish' him after the actor filed a suit suing for the return of an $800,000 loan he made to his uncle, plus $39,999 in interest. Barry Saide, 61, the actor's maternal uncle, filed papers seeking to have LaBoeuf's suit dismissed yesterday in Manhattan Supreme Court. The papers claim Saide lent 'hundreds of thousands' of dollars to LaBeouf and his mother Shayne Saide before the actor hit the big-time, and that he wouldn't have accepted the loan from LaBoeuf if he knew it would come to this. Close: Shia LaBoeuf was raised by his mother Shayne Saide following his parents' split, and according to Barry Saide, their financial situation was unstable . 'Had I thought that Shayne and Shia would take this extraordinary step and seek to impoverish me, I never would have borrowed a dollar from Shia,' Saide claimed in the papers. The loan was made by Shia to his uncle in 2009, after Saide's recruiting business United Staffing Solutions, which he has run for more than 30 years, suffered during the financial crisis. Saide's court filings claim LaBeouf told him not to worry about the expense because he 'had more money than he could ever need.' The affidavit notes that LaBoeuf is now a highly successful and well-paid movie star and that his Transformers films earned him $20 million, while he was paid $8 million for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Fiery: Shia LaBoeuf, pictured in Canne last year with his mother Shayne, has become known for his angry outbursts and now appears to be having a feud with his uncle . 'Prior to Shia’s ascendancy to film stardom... I loaned Shayne hundreds of thousands of dollars to assist in the support of Shayne and Shia,' Saide's papers state. 'I never sought repayment of this money; Shayne, Shia and I are family.' Saide says that he and his sister grew up poor on New York's Lower East Side. LaBoeuf's mother separated from his heroin-addict father soon after his 1986 birth and Saide said that her 'work history could best be described as itinerant... she never achieved any lasting financial success.' According to the papers filed by . LaBoeuf and his mother,  Saide signed a loan agreement agreeing to pay . the actor and his mother back in 15 installments, with interest, . beginning in January of 2011 and ending in April 2012. 'Defendant has failed to pay a single . installment of either principal or interest to me or to any entity . controlled by me,' claims LaBoeuf's suit. Star: Shia LaBoeuf (left) has the money to look after family members such as his mother Shayne (right) but is now suing his uncle over a $800,000 loan . However, . Saide says the agreement he and his nephew signed states that the loan . could be voided in exchange for a 25 per cent share in his business. Saide says the case is a 'private, family matter' that 'should never have been elevated' to legal courts. Neither Saide nor LaBoeuf has commented on the case, but Shayne Saide spoke to the New York Post yesterday. She was unaware that her brother had responded to the suit she and her son filed earlier this year. 'You caught me off guard. I didn’t know that Barry is doing this,' she told the Post. In response to Saide's claims that he had supported her financially during Shia LaBoeuf's childhood, she laughed. 'He has his own interpretation of life,' she said. 'He’s going to do what he has to do. That’s Barry.'","Shia LaBoeuf is suing for return on $800,000 he lent Barry Saide in 2009 when his business struggled .

'Dine and dasher': Saul Zelaznog has been taken into police custody after allegedly failing to pay his bar tab . An alleged serial 'dine-and-dasher' has been arrested after the owners of a Reno pub named and shamed him on Facebook because he 'left without paying his hefty tab'. Saul Zelaznog was taken into police custody today accused of failing to pay his $100 bill at Brewer's Cabinet on Tuesday night. The restaurant owners reported Zelaznog to police, but also took matters into their own hands by posting a picture of the Reno resident with a warning on their Facebook page. In their post, the owners claimed the 'serial thief' also skipped out on bills at three other outlets - Chapel Tavern, Imperial and Campo. They also called on residents who saw  Zelaznog to 'remind' him to pay his bill. 'And, while you're at it, you could tell him that visiting restaurants/bars with your friends, running up a huge bill, roughing up servers and then bailing is pretty uncool...pathetic, really. Get a life, man,' they wrote on Wednesday. Within hours, the post had gone viral with hundreds of shares and comments. 'Just trying to look out for all the other business owners,' co-owner Chris Kahl told Reno Gazette Journal. '$100, that’s a lot of money to lose...All his friends paid and left, and he was the last one. The server needed to collect his money. He said he forgot his wallet.' He said the server let Zelaznog go to avoid a confrontation, before Kahl contacted the Reno Police Department. Name and shame: Restaurant Brewer's Cabinet identified Saul Zelaznog on Facebook, accusing him of not paying a bill . However Zelaznog tells a different story. He said there was simply a misunderstanding, and . he had forgotten a method of payment. 'They’re acting like I ran out of there. I was going to be back to take . care of my tab,' Zelaznog told Reno Gazette Journal. He said he was involved in a similar situation at another local restaurant, but left a 'nice watch' as collateral. 'I’m not trying to burn bridges around town,' he said. 'This is a small little town.' Update: Brewer's Cabinet announce 'Mr. Z' has been taken into police custody . However staff at other watering holes that Zelaznog frequented disagree. 'Ya . know, it's really unfortunate that we put faith in people and they . don't always pull through and it makes it harder for us to trust . everyone else,' Campo manager Nick Meyer told KRNV news.

So it's no wonder she looked puffy-eyed and much older than her 41 years as she emerged in New Jersey on Wednesday. Perhaps trying to detract from her weary appearance, the Real Housewives Of New Jersey star donned a garish purple outfit as she headed to the gym. The eyes give her away: Teresa Giudice looked like she'd endured a sleepless and likely tearful night as she hit the gym in New Jersey on Wednesday . With her hair pulled back and wearing . next to no war paint, the mom-of-four stood out in her purple patterned . three-quarter leggings, which she teamed with a near-matching purple . T-shirt, black socks and white runners. Later than evening, however, it was a perfectly coiffed Teresa who attended the Beauty Buster Awards in New York City. Her long dark hair in perfect curls and with her signature heavily kohl-rimmed eyes and nude lips, she didn't miss the chance to promote her Milania Hair Care line. Trying to distract us? The Real Housewives Of New Jersey star donned a garish, eye-catching purple outfit - but all eyes were on her pained expression . 'You can't stop living': Photographer Lora Warnick revealed the star was 'in good spirits' and 'didn't seem depressed at all' as she attended the Beauty Buster Awards in New York City on Wednesday night . The star put on a brave face at the . event, pouring herself into a tight-fitting royal blue off-the-shoulder . dress with strap detail around the neck. 'You . can't stop living,' she rather cheerily said as she posed for . photographer Lora Warnick - who noted that the star appeared to be 'in . good spirits' and 'didn't seem depressed at all' as she chatted with . guests, according to RadarOnline. Just a day earlier, the New Jersey native and her husband of 15 years, Giuseppe 'Joe' Giudice, made an appearance of a very different kind - at the Martin Luther King Jr courthouse in Newark, New Jersey, after being charged with 39 counts of fraud. Disheveled: An unshaven Joe Giudice was spotted on Thursday outside his home in Towaco, New Jersey for the first time since posting bail two days earlier . The multitude of indictments included . conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false . statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud. Joe . is also charged with failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008, . during which time it is alleged he earned close to $1 million. The businessman also faces further charges in Passaic County, after obtaining a driver's licence using his brother's identity. A united front: Joe and Teresa arrived hand-in-hand to their court hearing at the Martin Luther King Jr Federal Courthouse in Newark, New Jersey, after being indicted on 39 charges of fraud . The 43-year-old rejected a plea deal through his lawyer, Miles Feinstein, in April. Neither . husband nor wife entered a plea during Tuesday's brief court session . and they were released on a combined $1 million unsecured bail bond. Judge . Cathy Waldor did, however, order them to surrender their passports and . restricted their travels to New Jersey and New York amid fears of a . 'great escape' to Italy. Speaking to the masses of gathered reporters at the courthouse following the proceedings, US Attorney Paul Fishman confirmed, 'We are confident we have enough evidence to convict the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt.' Out on bail: The couple were charged with 39 counts of fraud and released on a combined $1 million bail following their brief court appearance in which neither entered a plea . While Teresa's attorney, Henry . Klingeman, says he believes the government is prosecuting the couple . because of their celebrity, it seems he's not the only one who thinks . fame is playing a pivotal role in the proceedings. Fellow . reality TV star and former New York City Real Housewife Bethenny . Frankel has given her unfiltered opinion on the situation. Asked . to comment on the developing saga while promoting her talk show, . Bethenny, at the TCA Tour Panel in Beverly Hills on Wednesday, the . 42-year-old said, 'My first thought today was, ""Oh, if they weren't on . reality TV, none of this would probably ever be exposed.""' Further charges: Joe is also charged with failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008, during which time it is alleged he earned close to $1 million . She continued, 'It's just funny how . certain people are [like a] moth to a flame. It's almost like, not that . you want to get caught, but people who love to be in the spotlight often . have a lot of skeletons in their closet. It's just an interesting . thing. 'Do I feel sorry for them? No, I . don't,' she stated honestly. 'Not so much, because it broke the law. You . broke the law and you went on television. That's not really that . smart.' The mom-of-one did, . however, express sympathy for the couple's children - Gia, 12, . Gabriella, 10, Milania, seven, and Audriana, three - who have been . caught up in the drama. No support here: Former Real Housewives Of New York City star Bethenny Frankel said, 'Do I feel sorry for them? No, I don't,' when asked about the situation at Wednesday's TCA Tour Panel . It's certainly an unsettling time for the entire Giudice family, with Teresa and Joe now each facing up to 50 years in jail if convicted on all charges. Meanwhile, Joe could also potentially be deported back to Italy after it was revealed during the hearing that despite having been married to his American wife for more than a decade, the family patriarch is not a US Citizen. The Giudices' hearing is set for August 14 and, according to their attorneys, both will plead not guilty.","First public outing since charged with 39 counts of fraud .

She tried to laugh it off and said she did not want to make a big scene about it. 'He grabbed me a little too tight, then proceeded to slide his hand down . my arm and then did a little grab on my derriere. I . didn’t want to make a scene there were kids around,' she told Fox. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New Victim: Emily Gilbert has claimed the 70-year-old Democrat harassed her at a fundraiser where she was hired to sing in December . Her husband Jason said he saw the sexual harrassment take place but felt helpless, thinking: 'He's the mayor, what can I do? Accused: San Diego Mayor Bob Filner has launched an extraordinary defence against allegations he sexually harassed a former employee - by claiming he never received sexual harassment training . Her husband Jason said he saw the sexual harassment take place but felt helpless, thinking: 'He's the mayor, what can I do? 'We don’t want any money, but we think the mayor should make a donation to a woman’s cause… Actions speak louder then words. He needs to resign.' Earlier this week, Filner launched an . extraordinary defense against allegations he sexually harassed a former . employee - by claiming he never received sexual harassment training. Former employee  Irene McCormack Jackson sued the mayor and the city on July . 22, alleging the mayor asked her to work without panties, demanded . kisses, told her he wanted to see her naked and dragged her in a . headlock while whispering in her ear. At its Tuesday night meeting, the City Council voted 9-0 to deny funds for Filner's legal expenses in the lawsuit filed by his former communications director. Lawyers representing Filner have claimed that if San Diego had provided mandatory sexual harassment training, then Jackson may never have filed the case. The claims suggest that if Filner is found liable in the claim, he could blame his own city council. As reported by NBC 7, in a letter, Filner’s lawyer Harvey Berger, said: 'The City has a legal obligation to provide sexual harassment training to all management level employees. The City failed to provide such training to Mayor Filner. 'This is not an excuse for any inappropriate behavior which may have occurred, but I have learned that many – if not most – people do not know what is and what is not illegal sexual harassment under California law.' Action: Irene McCormack Jackson, the mayor's former director of communications Jackson sued the mayor and the city on July 22 . The council is attempting to distance itself from the leader of the nation's eighth-largest city amid mounting calls for his resignation. At its Tuesday night meeting, the City Council voted 9-0 to deny funds for Filner's legal expenses in the lawsuit filed by Jackson. City councilman Kevin Faulconer said: 'His employers, San Diego taxpayers, did not have to bail him out for the mess he created.' Earlier in the day in a closed session, the Council voted 9-0 to have the city sue Filner to require that he pay all costs incurred by the lawsuit, which names the city as a defendant in addition to Filner. 'If Bob Filner engaged in unlawful conduct and the city is held liable, he will have to reimburse us every penny the city pays and its attorney fees,' City Attorney Jan Goldsmith said. Seven of nine City Council members have urged Filner, the city's first Democratic leader in 20 years, to resign. Since Jackson filed her lawsuit, seven other women have . offered detailed accounts of Filner's alleged advances, including . touching and forcible kisses. Veronica 'Ronne' Froman (front left), Sharon Bernie-Cloward (front right), Joyce Gattas (back left), and Patti Roscoe (back right) all told their stories of harassment . Lisa Curtin, director of government and military education at San Diego City College, said on KPBS-TV Tuesday that the then-congressman asked her in 2011 to remove her wedding band after questioning whether it was real, asked her on a date and moved to kiss her. She said she felt his tongue on her cheek after she turned her head. 'The City of San Diego maintains a zero tolerance policy as to sexual harassment and sexual harassment is not within the course and scope of employment,' according to the city's lawsuit filed in San Diego Superior Court. The mayor's office and his attorney, Harvey Berger, didn't immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Ann Ravel, chairwoman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission, said an official cannot accept more than $440 a year in donated services. Campaign money can be used only to defend against alleged violations of the state's campaign finance law. An official can, however, create a legal defense fund under state law, Ravel said. Filner, . who is divorced, said Friday he would enter two weeks of 'intensive' therapy on August 5, defying calls from his own party leaders to resign. The former 10-term congressman is less than eight months into a four-year term as mayor. Land-use . surveyor Michael Pallamary published a newspaper notice on Sunday to . begin a recall bid, two days after gay rights activist and newspaper . publisher Stampp Corbin did so. Pallamary . accused Corbin of being a stealth supporter of the mayor and threatened . to file a complaint with the San Diego County district attorney's . office alleging election law violations. Pallamary . said Corbin would make little effort to collect the more than 100,000 . signatures needed to get a recall measure on the ballot, setting it up . to fail and preventing another recall drive for six months. Promises: Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego speaks at a press conference on Friday announcing his intention to seek professional help for sexual harassment issues . Corbin denied the accusation on Tuesday, saying Pallamary or anyone else was welcome to join the recall drive. He . said he wouldn't pay anyone to collect signatures - a common practice . in California - but that anyone could visit his office to sign the . petition or pick up blank forms to circulate. Corbin, . who was appointed chairman of a city commission under Filner, declined . to say if he voted for Filner or how he would cast his ballot in a . recall. He said his motive was to bring swift resolution to the controversy. 'There's nothing going on in the city, in City Hall. Everyone is focused on this scandal. That is not good for this city,' he said. Confusion over whether recall petitions can circulate concurrently isn't the only procedural flaw uncovered since the mayor came under pressure to resign. The city attorney's office says a rule that voters must cast a ballot on a recall to be eligible to pick a replacement should be repealed because a federal judge struck down a nearly identical law during the successful 2003 recall of California Gov. Gray Davis. Tony Krvaric, chairman of the San Diego County Republican Party, said Friday that he didn't expect big GOP donors or business leaders to make significant donations to a recall.","Bob Filner is being sued by former employee  Irene McCormack Jackson .

"By . Sara Smyth . PUBLISHED: . 13:02 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:54 EST, 1 August 2013 . U-turn: Taro Aso has retreated his controversial remarks just days after they were made. He said his comments were 'misinterpreted' Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso has retracted comments he made this week suggesting Japan should follow the Nazi example of how to change the country's constitution. Aso drew outrage for saying Japan should learn from how the Nazi party stealthily changed Germany's constitution before World War II before anyone realized it. He suggested that Japanese politicians should avoid controversy by making quiet visits to Tokyo's Yasukuni war shrine. Speaking to reporters, Aso today said he had been misunderstood and only meant to say that loud debate over whether Japan should change its postwar constitution is not helpful. 'It is very unfortunate and regrettable that my comment regarding the Nazi regime was misinterpreted,' Aso told reporters. 'I would like to retract the remark.' Aso, who is also deputy prime minister, made the comments about Nazi Germany during a speech on Monday in Tokyo that was organized by an ultra-conservative group. Critics of the ruling Liberal Democrats are uneasy over the party's proposals for revising the U.S.-inspired postwar constitution, in part to allow a higher profile for Japan's military. According to a transcript of the . speech published by the newspaper Asahi Shimbun, Aso decried the lack of . support for revising Japan's pacifist constitution among older . Japanese, saying the Liberal Democrats had held quiet, extensive . discussions about its proposals. 'I don't want to see this done in the midst of an uproar,' Aso said, according to the transcript. Since revisions of the constitution . may raise protests, 'doing it quietly, just as in one day the Weimar . constitution changed to the Nazi constitution, without anyone realizing . it, why don't we learn from that sort of tactic?' Japan's history of military aggression, which included colonizing the Korean Peninsula before the war, is the reason its current constitution limits the role of the military. Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said the administration of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 'in no way looks positively at the Nazi regime. Since the end of the war (World War II), our nation has consistently built up a society which thoroughly advocates peace and human rights.' 'This direction remains unchanged, going forward,' he added. Aso is known to speak in a meandering style that has landed him in trouble for off-the-cuff remarks in the past. He has apologized previously for accusing the elderly of being a burden on society, joking about people with Alzheimer's disease, saying the ideal country would be one that attracts 'the richest Jewish people,' and comparing the opposition Democratic Party of Japan to the Nazis. Controversial: Taro Aso gave a speech about hos Japan should change its constitution. He said: 'Just as in one day the Weimar constitution changed to the Nazi constitution, without anyone realizing it, why don't we learn from that sort of tactic?' On Thursday, Aso insisted that he was . referring to the Nazis 'as a bad example of a constitutional revision . that was made without national understanding or discussion.' 'If . you listen to the context, it is clear that I have a negative view of . how the Weimar constitution got changed by the Nazi regime,' he said. 'This is a constitution for all,' Aso said. 'I just don't want (the revision) to be decided amid a ruckus.' The Nazis' rise to power in the early 1930s amid the economic crisis brought on by the Great Depression was facilitated by emergency decrees that circumvented the Weimar constitution. So was Adolph Hitler's seizure of absolute power after he was made chancellor in 1933. It was not a matter of revising but of abusing the constitution. Opposition leaders condemned Aso's remarks, saying they showed a lack of understanding of history and hurt Japan's national interest. Some demanded Aso resign. Aso's comments 'sounded like praise for Nazi actions and are totally incomprehensible,' said Akihiro Ohata, secretary general of the Democratic Party. 'Minister Aso's ignorance about historical facts is so obvious,' said Seiji Mataichi, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party. 'I also want to remind him that praising the Nazis is considered a crime in EU nations.' The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a group dedicated to keeping alive the history of the Holocaust, urged Aso to 'immediately clarify' his remarks. Praise: The deputy Prime Minister's comments have been widely criticised. Secretary general of the Democratic Party said his comments 'sounded like praise for Aso's actions and are totally incomprehensible' 'What ""techniques"" from the Nazis' governance are worth learning? How to stealthily cripple democracy?' Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in a statement. 'Has Vice Prime Minister Aso forgotten that Nazi Germany's ascendancy to power quickly brought the world to the abyss and engulfed humanity in the untold horrors of World War II?' In South Korea, Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Tai-young said Aso's remark 'will obviously hurt many people.' 'I believe Japanese political leaders should be more careful with their words and behavior,' Cho said. In China, which also suffered invasion and occupation by Japanese imperial troops before and during the war, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said the comments showed that 'Japan's neighbors in Asia, and the international community, have to heighten their vigilance over the direction of Japan's development.' Hong also objected to Aso's comments on visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, which commemorates Japan's 2.3 million war dead, including 14 wartime leaders convicted of war crimes. Aso urged lawmakers in his speech to visit the shrine at times other than the closely watched anniversary of the end of the war on Aug 15 to avoid diplomatic flare-ups. 'We demand that Japan seriously contemplate history, remain committed to promises it made on historical issues, and take concrete actions to win the trust of its Asian neighbors and the international community,' Hong said.","Taro Aso, 72, said the country's constitution should be changed in the same way the Nazis did in Germany .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:52 EST, 2 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:56 EST, 2 August 2013 . A jury recommended Friday that three Somali pirates be sentenced to life in prison in the slayings of four Americans aboard their yacht off the coast of Africa. Prosecutors had sought the death penalty, but a federal jury in Norfolk, Va., recommended the only other possible sentence for Ahmed Muse Salad, Abukar Osman Beyle and Shani Nurani Shiekh Abrar. Formal sentencing will be this fall. The three men were among 19 who boarded the Quest in February 2011 in hopes of taking the Americans back to Somalia and ransoming them for millions of dollars. The plan fell apart when the U.S. Navy began shadowing the sailing vessel. Life in prison: Pirates Shani Nurani Shiekh Abrar, left, Ahmed Muse Salad, and Abukar Osman Beyle, back, will likely face life in prison for killing a group of Americans in 2011 . Abukar Osman Beyle . Shani Nurani Shiekh Abrar . Ahmed Muse Salad . The yacht's owners, Jean and Scott Adam of Marina del Rey, Californa, and their friends, Bob Riggle and Phyllis Macay of Seattle, Washington, were shot to death several days after they were taken hostage at sea. The Navy had told the pirates that they could keep the yacht in exchange for the hostages, but they refused to take the deal because they didn't believe they would get enough money. The only person authorized to negotiate the Americans' release was also based in Somalia. With the yacht nearing the Somali coastline, the destroyer USS Sterett began maneuvering between the Quest and the Somali shore when a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at it. Held captive: Scott and Jean Adam owned the Quest and were shot dead by the group of pirates as the Navy tried to secure their release . Victims: The owners of the Quest had been traveling with Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle of Seattle Washington, who were also killed . Soon after, gunshots were fired on board the Quest. By the time Navy SEALs scrambled aboard, all four Americans had been mortally wounded. They were the first U.S. citizens killed in a wave of pirate attacks that have plagued the Gulf of Aden and Indian Ocean in recent years. In their justification for seeking the death penalty, prosecutors wrote that the men killed or attempted to kill more than one person during a single episode. They also said their actions endangered the U.S. military and that the Americans were killed 'in an especially wanton and gratuitous manner.' In the case of Salad, prosecutors said he has demonstrated a lack of remorse in the Americans' deaths and made boastful statements about them. Defense attorneys for Salad had argued he should not be eligible for the death penalty because they claimed he is mentally handicapped. Defense documents say Salad has a low IQ, a poor memory and had difficulty functioning as a child in Somalia. Defense attorneys also noted in court filings that his co-defendants describe Salad as 'slow' and inept at fishing. Ransomed: The Americans were sailing off the coast of Somalia when a group of pirates stormed their boat the Quest, hoping to take them back to land and hold them for ransom . The U.S. Supreme Court has banned executing those with certain mental disabilities. Prosecutors argued Salad is competent, and Chief U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith issued an order that concurred with that assessment. 'The court finds that Salad failed to prove ... that he suffers from significant deficits in intellectual functioning or adaptive skills. Thus, he is determined not to be intellectually disabled, and is, therefore, eligible for the death penalty, if so imposed by the jury,' Smith wrote in an order. The decision to seek the death penalty was made by Attorney General Eric Holder. Executions under federal law are extremely rare. Only a handful out of more than 1,300 executions since 1976 having been carried out by the federal government, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which tracks statistics. Eleven other defendants who were aboard the Quest have already pleaded guilty to piracy and have been sentenced to life in prison. Four other suspected pirates were killed aboard the yacht. A fifth suspected pirate was released because he was a juvenile. Another man who prosecutors say was a land-based negotiator and the highest-ranking pirate they've ever captured has also been convicted of piracy and sentenced to a dozen life sentences in prison. Pirating problem: The four Americans who died were just the first targeted in a long string of pirate attacks that continued in the Gulf of Aden .","A federal jury recommended Ahmed Muse Salad, Abukar Osman Beyle and Shani Nurani Shiekh Abrar for life in prison .

The Food and Drug Administration says an outbreak of stomach illnesses in Iowa and Nebraska is linked to salad mix served at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants in those states and supplied by a Mexican farm. The outbreak of cyclospora infections has sickened more than 400 people in 16 states in all. The agency says it is working to determine whether the salad mix is the source of illnesses in the other 14 states. A salad mix including iceberg and romaine lettuce, as well as red cabbage and carrots is to blame for more than 200 people catching cyclosporiasis in two states . 'It is not yet clear whether the cases . reported from other states are all part of the same outbreak,' the . agency said in a statement. 'The investigation of increased cases of . cyclosporiasis in other states continues.' Both Olive Garden and Red Lobster are owned by Orlando-based Darden Restaurants. In a statement, Darden spokesman Mike Bernstein said the FDA's announcement is 'new information.' 'Nothing we have seen prior to this announcement gave us any reason to be concerned about the products we've received from this supplier,' Bernstein said.

Intestinal illness cyclosporiasis can result in diarrhea that can last for two months . Tracking the bug: Cases of people sickened by a parasitic infection have been reported in 16 states in total . The FDA said it traced illnesses from the restaurants in Nebraska and Iowa to Taylor Farms de Mexico, the Mexican branch of Salinas, California-based Taylor Farms. The company, which provides produce to the food service industry, said its facility located about 180 miles north of Mexico City in San Miguel de Allende is the only one of its 12 sites to be connected to the cases. The salad mix in question includes iceberg and romaine lettuce, as well as red cabbage and carrots, according to officials. In a statement on the company's website, Taylor Farms says the Mexican facility is 'state of the art and has an exceptional food safety record.' The statement said the company is working with FDA investigators who are looking at the facility and that the product is out of the food supply. The agency said its investigation has not implicated packaged salad sold in grocery stores. The salad mix may be out of the commercial food chain as the most recent known illness in those two states was in Nebraska a month ago. The typical shelf life for a salad mix is up to 14 days. There have been more recent illnesses in other states. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most recent illness was July 23. Cyclospora is transmitted through raw . fruit and vegetables by leaving it’s droppings on fruit and vegetables, . according to health officials who have said rinsing food isn’t enough to . rid it of the problem. The cyclospora parasite causes the intestinal illness cyclosporiasis if people eat or drink contaminated food and water. Symptoms include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, cramping, flu-like aches and pains, and a low-grade fever. Health officials have said diarrhea can last nearly two months.","The FDA has linked an outbreak of cyclospora infections in Iowa and Nebraska to a salad mix served at Olive Garden and Red Lobster .

Last Picture: Stephen Rakes looks over his shoulder as he leaves the courthouse after attending the trial . The Boston liquor store owner mysteriously found dead days after he was relieved from testifying against alleged mob boss, Whitey Bulger, WAS murdered, MailOnine can reveal. Toxicology results show that Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes was poisoned with potassium cynanide . The substance was delivered to the unfortunate Mr Rakes in an iced coffee. But in a bizarre twist his death was unrelated to the high profile trial currently gripping Boston and beyond. William Camuti, 69, from Sudbury, MA has been charged with attempted murder, misleading police and unlawful disposition of human remains and was arraigned in court this afternoon. MailOnline first reported that Mr Rakes's death was murder as his long term friend Mr Davis revealed: 'He was poisoned with cyanide.' Today District Attorney Marian T Ryan confirmed Camuti's arrest. She said: 'We allege this defendant intentionally put poison in the victim's iced coffee and then disposed of his body.' Camuti and Mr Rakes had known each other for several years and Mr Rakes is understood to have owed Camuti a considerable sum of money. Ice cold killer? William Camuti, 69, is arraigned in Concord District Court for allegedly lacing Stephen Rakes's iced coffee with potassium cyanide . Boston authorities believe that Camuti acted alone and lured Mr Rakes into a meeting at McDonald's in Waltham, MA on the day of his death to discuss a potential investment property. According to investigators no such property existed. Once there, Camuti allegedly bought both men iced coffees and laced Mr Rakes's beverage with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide. They believe he then drove the dying man around for a couple of hours to ensure the poison took full effect before abandoning the body in woods in Lincoln, MA. According to Mr Davis the Bulger trial offered  'the perfect opportunity' to commit the crime and 'have a cover story...already in place.' Mr Rakes's death was originally ruled as a suicide. But long term friend Steve Davis, whose sister was allegedly murdered by Bulger and his right-hand man, Stephen 'the Rifleman' Flemmi, maintained from the start that his friend was a victim of foul play. The revelations come the day Bulger said he would not give testimony in his trial. In an angry tirade in which the alleged gangster told the court 'do what you want with me' and branded the proceedings a 'sham.' Respects: Pallbearers remove the casket of Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes from a funeral home in Boston's South Boston neighborhood on Thursday, July 25, 2013 . Tears: Weeping mourners depart Gate of Heaven church in South Boston . Rakes openly despised Bulger, the former . crime boss who headed Boston's notorious Winter Hill Gang, and was ready . to testify that he threatened his daughter at gunpoint to force him . to turn over his liquor store for $100,000 so that he . could make it his mob's new headquarters. Mr . Rakes was laid to rest at a small funeral last week. Around 100 . mourners attended the brief ceremony at the Gate of Heaven Church in . south Boston. Speaking at the time, Raymond Muise of Dorchester told the Boston Herald: 'He was one of the best. There’s something wrong. It’s strange what happened to him. 'He lived for his family. He was very good to myself and the rest of the people around him, and . he worked hard all his life.' After his suspicious death, friend Steven Davis made no secret of his view that his friend had been murdered: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket. 'Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now.' Davis said the first indication of anything amiss with Rakes was on Wednesday 17 July, the afternoon he was removed from the witness list of U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz at the U.S. District Court in South Boston. James 'Whitey' Bulger: He was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives after he fled Boston in 1994. He was finally captured two years ago in Santa Monica, California and faces 32 counts, including 19 murder charges . The 59-year-old's death came just weeks after Rake revealed he was no longer scared of the gangster and that he was grateful to be alive to testify. 'They took everything from me,' he said of the mob. 'They don't care about nothing. They don't care about what they take from you... At least I’m still alive. I’m alive and I’m grateful for that.' Rakes, who had previously refused to testify against Bulger, had told Davis that he was 'nervous' about the 'bombshell' he thought he was going to drop on the stand at the feared mobster's trial. 'He was looking forward to taking the stand. He told me over and over he had a big bombshell to drop,' said Davis. However, . he was robbed of this chance when U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz . informed Rakes that he was no longer needed as a witness - a decision . that reportedly 'devastated' him. Rakes . had harbored decades of anger at Bulger and his accomplices, Stephen . 'The Rifleman' Flemmi and Kevin Weeks, after they allegedly forced him . to hand over his South Boston liquor store in 1984 by holding a gun to . his daughter's head. 'The day I see him in a box, not breathing, will be better,' Rakes said in April. Steven Davis told NBC: 'No car, no automobile, no ID. Steve carried his ID right here all the time in his pocket. Of course I think (he was murdered). Because of how everything falls into play here now' Scene: Lincoln Police guard the side of the road where Stephen Rakes was found dead on Wednesday 17 July . Secluded: This is Mill St in Lincoln, Massachusetts, where Stephen 'Stippo' Rakes was discovered dead . Indeed, Rakes had been a constant presence at Bulger's trial at the US District Court in South Boston. Attending . every day for the past six weeks, the trial began after the notorious . gangster was captured in California two years ago after 16 years on the . run from authorities. Davis . told ABC News that the last time he saw Rakes was in court the day before his death . but he failed to reach him during the night and alarms bells started . ringing when he didn't meet him for breakfast on Wednesday as usual. 'Stippo would not kill himself. Absolutely not,' said Davis. Davis said that his friend was 'in good shape' and the two of them would frequently cycle across Boston. 'He had everything to live for and was looking forward to his day in court. It doesn't make sense.'

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 00:02 EST, 3 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 00:08 EST, 3 August 2013 . Three million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas lost access to CBS programming in a fee dispute on Friday, threatening their ability to watch popular shows like 'Under the Dome' or see Tiger Woods pursue his 8th win at the Firestone Country Club. The nation's second largest cable operator said that CBS refused to have productive negotiations, which were repeatedly extended after their previous deal expired at the end of June. As Friday's blackout stretched past a couple of hours, it appeared consumers would be caught in the crossfire for some time. CBS blackout: Time Warner Cable has pulled the plug on CBS in several cities in a dispute over broadcasting fees . 'It's become clear that no matter how much time we give them, they're not willing to come to reasonable terms,' Time Warner Cable said. Multiple stations that carry CBS programming in New York and Los Angeles were replaced around 2:15 p.m. Pacific time with a message from Time Warner Cable saying that CBS had 'demanded an outrageous increase' in the fees it demands to carry its TV stations' signals. CBS said it regretted Time Warner Cable's decision, calling it 'ill-advised.' The broadcaster said it asked for an extension, but that Time Warner Cable didn't agree to it. Most of the cable subscribers affected live in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas, but customers in other markets also lost signals. Three million Time Warner Cable customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas see this message when they switch channel to CBS . The CBS stations that went dark are WCBS and WLNY in New York; KCBS and KCAL in Los Angeles; KTVT and KTXA in Dallas; WBZ and WSBK in Boston; KDKA, WPCW-CW in Pittsburgh; KCNC in Denver; WKBD-CW in Detroit and WBBM in Chicago. About 2.5 million Time Warner Cable customers also lost access to Showtime, the premium channel that carries shows such as 'Dexter.' TMC, FLIX and Smithsonian channels - all owned by CBS Corp. - also went dark. In its message to subscribers, Time Warner Cable said it would replace the lost programming with shows from Starz Kids and Family temporarily. The fight centers on the rising fees that TV station owners like CBS charge cable and satellite companies to retransmit their content. Research firm SNL Kagan estimates retransmission fees will reach $3 billion industry-wide this year and double to $6 billion by 2018. Viewers are missing out on CBS shows such as 'Under the Dom' SNL Kagan analyst Robin Flynn said that figure could be revised upward soon as TV station groups merge to gain leverage at the bargaining table. For example, Tribune Co. announced plans to buy Local TV to form a group of 42 TV stations last month. Earning revenue from pay TV subscribers is crucial to CBS's growth prospects, analysts say. Even though CBS sends its signal out over the airwaves for free to anyone with an antenna, about 85 percent of its viewers watch TV through a pay TV provider. Such fees ensure the company is not so reliant on advertising dollars, which rise and fall with the economy. Meanwhile, Time Warner Cable is fighting to hold the line on costs as it struggles to keep subscribers. It lost 191,000 cable TV subscribers in the most recent quarter, ending with 11.7 million at the end of June. Even as the dispute lingered on, both companies posted healthy quarterly earnings this week. About 2.5 million Time Warner Cable customers have also lost access to Showtime, the premium channel that carries shows such as 'Dexter' Time Warner Cable grew its net income 6 percent to $481 million, or $1.64 per share, as revenue rose 3 percent to $5.6 billion. CBS grew net income 11 percent to $472 million, or 76 cents per share. CBS's revenue also grew 11 percent to $3.7 billion thanks in large part to the fees that are in dispute with Time Warner Cable. Jonathan Atkin, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said TV distributors are taking a stand because programming costs are going up about 10 percent this year, an increase that's too high to pass onto customers. 'They feel pressure when some of these cost drivers are going up the way they are,' Atkin said. 'They do need to show some teeth and try to negotiate something better.' He said the dispute would probably end quickly to avoid depriving customers of key sporting events, like the PGA Championship starting on Thursday. CBS also airs its first preseason NFL game Aug. 23. Time Warner Cable subscribers are set to miss out on the chance to watch Tiger Woods at the PGA Championship as a result of the dispute .","Customers in New York, Los Angeles and Dallas have lost access to CBS programming in a fee dispute ."

The FBI has developed the capability to remotely switch on the microphones in Android handsets and record user’s conversations, claims an anonymous former U.S. official. The same technology also enables investigators to do the same to microphones in laptops without the user knowing, the person said. The claims, made in a Wall Street Journal report on the FBI’s use of hacking tools, come hot on the heels of revelations that the National Security Agency gathers data on millions of American citizens. An anonymous ex-FBI official claims that they've developed the capability to remotely switch on the microphones in Android handsets and record user's conversations without them knowing . Unlike the NSA, the FBI claims it only uses surveillance and hacking in specific cases. The use of sophisticated technology has grown as agents seek to keep up when tackling organized crime, counter-terrorism and child pornography suspects who use cutting-edge technology. The bureau is investing heavily in recruiting hackers in order to improve its surveillance capabilities to catch terrorists and criminals in the act. The FBI is supposed to have a warrant in order to carry out such surveillance techniques, but sources familiar with the FBI say these new methods are increasingly seen as a way of getting round having to apply for a warrant in some cases.

Two special dogs who were abandoned as pups formed a close friendship when they were both rescued by a dog shelter, and now the two have been adopted out together to a new 'forever home'. Eve, a Catahoula Leopard Dog mix, was found by a Bear Valley mail carrier as a nine-week-old puppy nearly frozen in a snow drift on Christmas Eve. Dillon is a two-year-old Border Collie cross who was dropped off at a dog boarding kennel - and never picked up again. Best friends: Eve (left) and her partner in crime Dillon (right) Complementary: Eve can't see and Dillon can't hear, but together they're unbeatable . Pound puppies: Eve and Dillon became inseparable when they met at Marley's Mutts . Eve is deaf and missing one eye; Dillon is completely blind. Staff at the Marley's Mutts, where the two both ended up, were worried their disabilities would mean they wouldn't be able to socialize together, but were amazed when the opposite happened. 'I thought their disabilities would separate them, but from the beginning they just clicked,' Josh Skow told ABC 23. The pair became inseparable, and their abilities served to help each other, rather than their disabilities hampering them. According to HuffPost, Eve's disabilities made it difficult for her to interact with other dogs, and she was constantly chasing shadows due to her inhibited senses. Overjoyed: Marley's Mutts staff were delighted the two dogs were going to be adopted together . 'Dillon and Eve are the perfect compliment [sic] for one another, and . essentially watch/lookout for each other.. Each has never been more at . ease than when they are together. We walk off leash and she leads him. His acute hearing helps her feel more comfortable about her inability to . hear. Yin and Yang they are!' says the Marley's Mutts Facebook page. The staff at Marley's Mutts were hoping against hope that the pair would be adopted together, but they were not optimistic that they would find anyone willing to take on not one but two large, disabled dogs. Settling in: Eve and Dillon are getting used to their new home together . Eve had returned to Marley's Mutts shelter after an unsuccessful adoption due to the extra problems that arise from her disabilities, while Dillon arrived at the shelter last month. Marley's Mutts is active on Facebook and other social media and posted about the two dogs' plights, getting their network of 'Mutt Militia' to help. Shelley Scudder happened to see the posts and found herself unable to stop thinking about Eve. 'A co-worker of mine showed me a picture of Eve and by the fourth day I said ""OK, I've got to meet this dog.""' Smiles: These two disabled dogs are happier than they've ever been since they met each other . Home wanted: Some of Eve and Dillon's friends still needing a home . When she arrived to meet Eve, she quickly discovered she came in a pair, but with four dogs, a fiance, an 11-year-old and a new home, Scudder was unsure if she could handle two more dogs. After witnessing the special relationship between the two dogs, though, she couldn't say no. 'The home they are in is quite honestly perfect, and the two even have an 11-year-old human that they have added to their gang!' Skow told HuffPost. The pair, who look remarkably similar, faced a grim future had they not been adopted.","Two white dogs, one blind, one deaf, formed a special bond at a dog shelter .

Sporty Spice Melanie Chisholm is living up to her nickname by this year taking on a number of fitness challenges. She's already competed in the five mile National Lottery Anniversary Run and the Virgin London Triathlon and now she's preparing for her biggest endurance feat yet - the Great North Run. The singer, 39, will take part in the half marathon in October with a team of runners raising money for the charity Shelter. As well as completing the gruelling 13.1 mile distance, their challenge will be to beat former GB 400m athlete Iwan Thomas, who will be raising money with his team for Macmillian Cancer Support at the Great South Run in October. Sporty Spice: So far this year Mel C has competed in the five mile National Lottery Anniversary Run, left, and the Virgin London Triathlon . As October's Great South Run in Portsmouth is a shorter distance than the North East half marathon at 10 miles, the competition is based on which team raises the most money and not on who runs the fastest. But that hasn't stopped the pair getting competitive. 'Mel is pretty fit at the moment but I think I could beat her over a half marathon,' Iwan, 39, told MailOnline. 'I guess I have a bit of an edge being an ex-professional athlete as you . always have that mental strength, so when it starts to hurt, you know how . to push yourself through that pain barrier.' The race is on: Mel and Iwan will compete to see whose team can raise the most money for charity . Mel C said she has been running three times as week as well as doing gym workouts, swims and bike rides. But she intends to step her running training up over the summer so she can complete the half marathon - with an aim of finishing in under two hours. She admitted she is slightly daunted by the distance: 'It will be the furthest I’ve run in my whole life. I have been having lots of fun in the triathlon and enjoying the different disciplines of the swim, bike and run but I have never done long distances,' she said. 'I have always wanted to do a half marathon but I am putting myself in the deep end with the Great North as it’s the biggest half in the world, everyone knows about it and it’s not an easy course, it’s quite undulating. Iwan’s told me it’s really hard but I’m not sure if he’s just psyching me out!' Mel said she is enjoying the running training as it gives her some 'me' time as she juggles her singing career - she has a single out with Matt Cardle and will go on tour again later this year with Jesus Christ Superstar - alongside being a parent to daughter, Scarlet, four. Catch me if you can: Mel has been training hard and hopes to finish the half marathon in under two hours . She said: 'It can be tricky and that’s what stops me training as much as I would like. My daughter is my priority but I have when she is at school to train. 'Like everyone I just have to try and fit it in. I’m lucky in the respect that I don’t have a 9 to 5 job so sometimes I will have a morning or afternoon free.' Mel, who has been open about her battle with eating disorders in the past, said she now prefers to stay in shape by exercising and eating healthily. She said: 'When you are exercising you can . be more relaxed about your diet. When you are in the public eye there is . a lot of pressure to stay slim and look a certain way but if you are . active and eating well then most of the time it takes care of itself. 'I'd say to young girls it’s always better to exercise and eat healthily . than diet. There are no quick fixes, diets really don’t work. 'There are . times when I was younger when I have gone with the trends and tried . different diets. I did a low carb one once but that made me feel awful . because I am so active.' Benefits: The singer said she loves running as it clears her head and keeps her physically healthy . She admitted she is currently stocking up on carbs to get her through her half marathon training. 'It’s just a case of making sure you have . enough fuel when you are demanding more of your body. So I am having . more carbs for energy. I also have to make sure I eat regularly and . never leave long gaps so I always have something in the tank,' she said. She revealed she did try the Alkaline Diet earlier this year - beloved by her fellow Spice Girl Victoria Beckham - but she can't sustain it long term. She said: 'I have done the Alkaline Diet before we . went on tour with Jesus Christ Superstar. I’m really into eating to . benefit what you were doing and it was recommended to me so I tried it. I . enjoyed it and it gave me a lot of energy. 'It’s basically vegetarian . and involves taking acid out of your diet, so no meats or processed . foods. It’s the things we know anyway about not eating things that are . bad for you and sticking to whole grains, soya and pulses. But it’s hard . to stick to when barbecue season hits as I do like a burger!' Mel added that her exercise regime means she can find it difficult to find clothes to fit her toned arms - 'but then I just get the guns out!' she joked. If the Great North goes well she said she would be tempted to do double the distance at next year's London Marathon. ompetitive: Iwan and Mel are good friends as well as rivals . It's a race Iwan knows well as he's raced it numerous times with a pb time of 3 hours and 58 minutes. He said the transition from sprinter to long distance runner wasn't easy. 'Every year I do the London Marathon and . people overtaking me saying, ""what are you doing, you should be faster . than this!"" But it’s completely different,' he explained. 'It’s a different pain to what I was used . to. Racing over 400m you get lactic acid and have to dig deep and then . you may feel sick for ten minutes afterwards if it was a hard race. But . the marathon, the first year I did it I couldn’t walk down the stairs . until the Thursday after! It's the toughest thing I have ever done.' Iwan was also keen to set the record straight about a recent triathlon at Blenheim where it was reported he 'nearly drowned' when he pulled out of the swim. 'It's the toughest thing I've ever done': Iwan said swapping 400m running for marathon training hasn't been easy . He said: 'I hadn’t done a triathlon for a couple . of years and I got in the water and had a bit of a panic attack. I . wasn't breathing properly so waved to the rescue boat to get a lift . home. It wasn't as bad as it was reported, I didn't nearly drown. 'It . hasn’t put me off triathlons though, they are such great fun. I was furious with myself afterwards for not . finishing.' Iwan added that he's delighted more people are getting into sport after the London 2012 Olympics and that Brits have been coming out top this year in everything from the Tour de France to Wimbledon. But he said he's disappointed drugs scandals has been overshadowing clean performances in athletics. He said: 'When I heard about Tyson Gay and Asafa . Powell I was really angry and disappointed for the sport. 'It is a good . thing we are catching the cheats out but the danger is people . tarnish all athletes with the same brush. People might be put off the . sport because they think the very best are on drugs but that’s not the . case. It’s just a handful of idiots who see the benefits of being the . best in the world and take short cuts to get there.' MEL'S TIPS . IWAN'S TIPS .

Some families of the men he died alongside are suing the MoD over the killings, a situation Anna describes as 'embarrassing' The widow of a British soldier who was one of six military policemen murdered in Iraq has condemned relatives of the victims for attempting to claim compensation. Anna Aston, whose 30-year-old husband Corporal  Russ Aston was killed ten years ago, said the group legal action against the Ministry of Defence for negligence was ‘wrong and embarrassing’. She said: ‘I have nothing against these family members and we have all grieved together, but I do find this embarrassing and I have told them so.’ Cpl Aston was one of the six policemen, known as Red Caps, who died when 250 protesters stormed a building in Majar-al Kabir, Maysan province, on June 24, 2003. Lawyers representing  the families are now suing the MoD after the Supreme Court ruled earlier this year that  such claims for negligence could go ahead. But Anna, 41, said the claim is unfair on the 750 families of British troops killed in Iraq  and Afghanistan who have  coped silently. Anna, of Newhall, Derbyshire, who is raising her and Russ’s daughter Paygan, 11, said: ‘It was war and everything goes wrong in war – Russ knew that. ‘That is the same for so many deaths in both wars. What will happen if the families of all these soldiers bring claims? The situation would get ridiculous. I want fairness and less negativity.’ Solicitor Simon McKay, who  is acting for the relatives, said the claim, which may be funded by legal aid, would allege negligence to equip the Red  Caps properly under Article 2  of the European Convention on Human Rights. An inquest into the death of Russ and the other Red Caps – Simon Hamilton-Jewell, 41,  Paul Long, 24, Ben Hyde, 23,  Tom Keys, 20 and Si Miller, 21  – reached a verdict of  unlawful death but failed to condemn Army commanders  for their actions. Corporal Russell Aston, 30, was killed alongside five other Royal Military Police officers when a 400-strong mob descended on a police station in Majar al-Kabir in Iraq in June 2003 .","Anna Aston lost her husband in country's restive Maysan province in 2003 .

'There was no evidence presented that the domestic . circumstances which preceded these alleged events have changed.' The 37-year-old former FHM model has been in jail since July 7 and it has obviously taken its toll on her. She was indicted for criminal attempt to commit armed robbery, burglary in the first degree, two counts of aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony. Officers arrived at the 1160 block of Drewsbury Court to find Benson, star of the VH-1 reality series, Baseball Wives, wearing a bullet proof vest and an ammunition belt containing several rounds. She had a Batman knife in her waistband, a police-issue baton in her hands and a revolver in her purse, according to the incident report, obtained by the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The 911 call made by Kris Benson was later released and the Mets pitcher sounded calm as he quietly told the operator he is hiding in the basement. Listen to Kris Benson's 911 call: . Threat: Kris Benson called police from his basement after his estranged wife Anna allegedly broke into his home on July 7 . 'She told me to go get a lighter for her to smoke a cigarette,' Mr Benson said in the 911 call, which was released by TMZ. 'When I left the room, I just did a beeline for the basement.' As the operator tells him to stay on the line, Mr Benson can be heard saying: 'I just got my hand on the back door in case I hear her coming down the stairs.' He then fled the house and hid in his neighbor's garden until police arrived. When the 911 operator asked him what his wife had said, he explained that he had managed to record her. Mr Benson also appears to stifle a shocked laugh when he explains that his 'soon to be ex-wife' was wearing a bulletproof vest when she allegedly threatened him. Mrs Benson however, told the New York Post last month: 'I would never hurt [Kris]. I am still in love with him.' Arrested: Anna Benson, the estranged wife of ex-baseball pitcher Kris Benson, was arrested Monday morning . She added: 'We have been married for 15 . years, and he can’t keep it in his pants. He can’t stop f*****g my . friends, in my house. But that doesn’t mean that I don’t love him.' Mrs Benson was arrested on July 7after allegedly breaking into his home wearing a bulletproof vest and threatening him with a gun and metal baton. She reportedly barged in on Sunday night and ordered Mr Benson to give her $30,000 after she was forced by the court to vacate the couple's marital home, TMZ first reported. The mother-of-three was wielding an 'expandable metal baton' and threatened to hit him if he didn't give her the money. She also brandished a handgun and a loaded ammunition belt, according to a police report reviewed by TMZ. Mr Benson, who filed for divorce last . year, left the home and called police. He was not injured but Mrs Benson reportedly smashed his computer with the expandable metal baton. She said the reason she was wearing a bulletproof vest was because of a deal she had made with the manufacturer.

A growing number of people are ignorant about the First World War and know little more about it than what ‘Baldrick’ said in the TV comedy Blackadder, a new report claims. One in ten think Hitler was the leader of Germany when the war started and nearly one in 12 young adults thinks Britain and Germany were allies, not enemies. A similar number think Margaret Thatcher was the Prime Minister at the time, according to the report published on the eve of tomorrow’s 99th anniversary of the start of the Great War. Primary source material? Tony Robinson as Baldrick and Rowan Atkinson in the titular role in Blackadder, which is now where many Britons get their knowledge of the events of the First World War . The British Future think-tank report . claims many Britons base their knowledge of the First World War on . Blackadder, starring Tony Robinson as Baldrick. The 430 British-born soldiers who were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War are to be specially honoured by the Government for  their bravery. Individual sand-coloured paving stones, almost 2ft square, will be laid near war memorials in the villages and towns where the men were born. The Government hopes they will inspire youngsters to learn of the deeds of their forebears. The . report states: '""I think it began when an archduke shot an ostrich . because he was hungry,’’ said Private Baldrick in Blackadder Goes Forth. 'That is now among the most significant sources of public knowledge (or myths) of the Great War.’ British Future director, Sunder Katwala, said: ‘Most people do know that there was a war in 1914 and four out of five of us that Germany was an enemy. 'But almost everything else is minority knowledge. ‘Beyond images of mud, trenches and barbed wire...the First World War is getting lost in the Second.’ By BARONESS WARSI, Minister for Faith and Communities . 'Daddy, What did YOU do in the Great War?' The famous 1915 recruitment propaganda poster, aimed at coaxing fathers across Britain into joining up . Daddy, what did YOU do  in the Great War? So  goes the famous 1915 recruitment poster, aimed at coaxing fathers across Britain into joining up and playing their part in the ‘war to end all wars’. One year before we mark the centenary of that conflict, which, of course, didn’t end all wars, we are starting to ask one another a similar question: what did YOUR forefathers do in the Great War? For me, the centenary offers an opportunity to address the historical blind spot we have when it comes to recognising the contribution of Commonwealth soldiers. After all, think of the First World War and you think trenches and Tommies, poems and poppies. You don’t think of Aussies landing on the scorching shores of Turkey. You don’t think of men from the West Indies travelling to Egypt. And you certainly don’t think of sepoys in turbans, serving on the Western Front. But they deserve to be remembered. The largest volunteer army was the British Indian Army, which provided 1.2million men to fight. This is a staggering contribution; it’s thought that a tenth of the British war effort came from Indian soldiers. Despite the scale of sacrifice – 74,000 lost their lives in battle – knowledge of the contribution is sadly lacking. My mission is to make sure their bravery, and that of others, is not forgotten. Immediately after the outbreak of war, divisions from India were dispatched to Europe. Thousands of men travelled across the world to fight for King and country – a King who wasn’t from their land and a country which they’d probably never seen. It wasn’t just the propaganda that lured these men to battle. It was the glory that bravery would bestow on them, tribally and spiritually – and the 11-Rupee monthly salary. Why is it so powerful to tell these stories? When I visited the battlefields of France and Belgium earlier this year, I found it incredibly powerful to see the graves of Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jews, Hindus, lying together, side by side, just as they had fought side by side. Scanning the countless names of the war memorials, and seeing the Khans and Singhs listed on the Menin Gate, is the most powerful reminder that this was a truly global war. I don’t have any relatives who fought in that conflict. But both my maternal and paternal grandfathers fought in the Second World War. They were in the Bombay Royal Sappers and Miners Regiment serving, I believe, in Aden and Burma. I feel a great sense of pride knowing that my grandparents were fighting for this country long before my parents even came to these shores. Plenty of Khans and Singhs listed... A pedestrian passes the Menin Gate Memorial where the names are engraved of about 56,000 fallen soldiers of Great Britain and its Empire who died during the First World War . I hope that uncovering the Commonwealth contribution to the First World War will have a similar impact on other people. What better way of showing that people of all faiths and all backgrounds can unite in the name of freedom than by illustrating a shared history, one based on unity, freedom and comradeship? This is particularly potent at a time when questions are regularly raised about loyalty and identity, about who genuinely belongs to this country and about our history. Groups like  Al-Muhajiroun and the EDL argue you cannot be British and Muslim. The story of the Muslim soldiers during the First World War puts paid to this myth. It shows that just under 100 years ago we weren’t only rubbing along together, we were serving the British King together. I hope that, come 2018, after four years commemorating this war, there will be many more people who know what their relatives did in the First World War. And that many more will know just how many people – of all ethnicities, races and faiths – fought for the freedoms we Britons enjoy today.","One in ten people think Hitler led Germany during the First World War .

Hillary Clinton's longtime spokesman and adviser, Philippe Reines, was so enraged after hearing about Antony Weiner’s latest sexting exploits that he told the New York mayoral candidate he wanted to ‘reach through this phone’ and ‘pull out’ his throat. The incident took place on a campaign conference call just hours before Weiner’s infamous news conference on July 23, when his wife Huma Abedin, a close personal friend of Reines, spoke publicly in support of her shamed husband. According to another participant on the call, Reines used an expletive and proceeded to berate Weiner, reports The New York Times. Although not a paid member of .

Weiner, along with wife Huma Abedin, spoke to the media on July 23 after new revelations about his explicit online correspondences came to light . Reines has also been acting as the key communications channel between Abedin and Mrs Clinton and it was him who ensured that she knew about Weiner's latest escapades before the story broke. Abedin, now 37, is herself a longtime aide to the former secretary of state, having started working in the Clinton White House at the age of 19. But her ties with Hilliary Clinton have been put under great stress as the Weiner circus has seen the media draw unflattering comparisons with the Clinton's own time in the national spotlight over extra marital affairs back in the 1990s. Reines’s behind-the-scenes presence illustrates the overlapping roles played by Clinton advisers as they seek to help Abedin navigate her husband’s increasingly toxic campaign, and at the same time protect the Clinton brand from any collateral damage. Reines have been using their expertise behind the scenes for some time to help Abedin relaunch Weiner’s political career.

In Washington, Reines may be known as Mrs Clinton’s fiercest protector, but last summer he was helping Weiner and Abedin when they spoke to People magazine for a glossy feature that signaled the beginning of Weiner’s attempted comeback . Unfortunately Reines hadn’t factored on Weiner engaging in online liaisons after leaving Congress and those actions have left him exasperated for what else he can do to help. His role now seems to be more damage limitation and he recently advised Abedin against appearing in her husband’s latest campaign video, which was released on Monday. In recent days Abedin also has . stopped campaigning in New York at her husband’s side and has returned . to Washington where she remains employed by Mrs Clinton.

He described himself as 'someone who’s not going to pull any punches, or say everything is dandy when it’s not.' While in Washington, Abedin has also meet with other key Clinton aids and old friends including Cheryl Mills, who was Mrs Clinton’s chief of staff at the State Department. Clinton is of course weighing up her own political return with a presidential run in 2016 thought to be extremely likely. People close to the Clintons said they would prefer if Weiner just bowed out of the mayoral race, but they didn't believe his faltering campaign will have any real impact on Mrs Clinton’s political future - beyond some short-term embarrassment.

Barrier: Some Christians now claim their religious beliefs are preventing them from getting the top jobs because they are seen as 'potential trouble' Christians are less likely than atheists to be promoted to top jobs, official figures show. Nearly a quarter of people with no religious belief live in homes headed by someone with a senior executive position or a job in one of the professions. However, well under a fifth of Christians work in the best-paid and most influential jobs or are married to someone who does. The figures also show high levels of senior and professional employment among the Jewish and Hindu communities. The breakdown of employment and religious belief, produced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) from the 2011 census, comes as campaigners claim it is becoming harder for Christians to get to the top. Barrister Andrea Minichiello Williams, a member of the Church of England’s General Synod, said: ‘If you hold views that are contrary to the prevailing orthodoxy you are seen as potential trouble. ‘This is a real phenomenon. Christianity is now a bar to appointment or promotion.’ But others believe the Christian majority are being out-paced by more ambitious religious groups. Economist Ruth Lea, of the Arbuthnot Banking Group, said: ‘Jews and Hindus are proportionately so much more successful than Christians. The driven people tend to come from minorities. 'Christians are the majority group, and they do not seem so ambitious and hard working.’ Miss Lea, who is an Anglican, added: ‘There doesn’t seem to be any discrimination here. What these figures say is that if you are determined you can make it.’ The number of people claiming to be Christian in England and Wales fell by 4million in the decade to 2011 to 33million.

Trademark attorney Vicki Bennett, of Saunders & Dolleymore, which represented Lodestar, said: ‘The trademarks Route 66 and Route A66 are visually, phonetically and conceptually similar. 'Mithril Ales’ use of the mark for the sale of beer creates a likelihood of consumer confusion.’ Mr Fenwick, whose brewery is based near Darlington, received a letter from Lodestar's lawyers requesting that he change the name of his beer. The letter also invited Mr Fenwick to offer a proposal for financial compensation to the firm. He said that his beer still tastes the same but just has a different logo now. Mr Fenwick said he was most offended by Lodestar's accusation that he was making a premium lager rather than his traditional ale.

A cheating family doctor is pictured renewing his wedding vows with his forgiving wife - just weeks after his affair with a patient culminated in a catfight. GP Terence Burley, 63, patched up his 38 year marriage with wife Jane, 62, despite nearly divorcing over his on/off six year affair with the woman. Mrs Burley paid tribute to her husband as her 'soulmate' in a blogpost about their vow renewal. Forgiven: Dr Terence Burley and his wife Jane pictured on the day they renewed their vows after his affair with a patient . She added: 'This was a choice made with mature reflection - we had chosen to forgive and to reconcile in celebration of 38 years of marriage. 'In reality marriage is a minefield of endless compromise and rumpled beds, if you’re lucky!' She explained that they had first met when they were both students in London, adding that the ceremony where they renewed their vows was 'very moving' 'I remembered the reasons why I had agreed to do this which were profoundly deep-seated,' she said. 'Over the past thirty years, I had raised my brood and rediscovered my . academic confidence by going to Oxford as a mature student in my . fifties. Charges: Dr Burley was found guilty of misconduct at a tribunal today following his on/off affair with a patient . 'Little did I know then, that, just with all good things in life, for a . woman, there is always a price to pay for a glimmer, a taste of sheer . joy. 'Do all long relationships benefit from an emotional m.o.t? Perhaps, but . we had gone to decree nisi and back and I do not regret my decision to . issue the papers because all women must evaluate the state of play and . take action if necessary.' The blogpost emerged as father-of-four Dr Burley was found guilty over the affair at a Medical Practitioners Tribunal today. The tribunal found that he had 'engaged in an emotional and sexual relationship' with a woman - known only as Patient A - while he was her family doctor, but cleared him of 'pursuing' her. It ruled that he 'ought to have known' she was emotionally vulnerable when the relationship began. It eventually ended after a fight between his wife and the patient at his family home in Peterborough, where police had to be called. The tribunal heard how the doctor became infatuated . with the woman after having been her . family’s doctor for more than 25 years. Patient A, who is now in her 60s, told . the hearing the doctor tried to seduce her when she went to his surgery . feeling low about the death of her mother. ‘He started kissing my neck and his hands were going on my buttocks. I felt very, very uncomfortable,’ she said. ‘His left hand was on my right side trying to undo the belt on my trousers. I didn’t want to get anywhere near all that.’ Patient A said Dr Burley was declaring that he had been ‘in love with me for over 25 years.’ She told the tribunal: ‘I said what . was he doing, that it wasn’t right and that he was a married man with . four children and why was he doing this at this time.’ She managed to walk away but claims Dr Burley then began telephoning her and visiting her at her late mother’s house. On another visit to the practice, a blanket was laid out on the floor. She said: ‘He asked if I would take my top off. I didn’t say yes, but didn’t refuse because I was frightened on my own.’ History: Dr Burley had been the woman's family's GP for 25 years at the Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire . Eventually the pair began a sexual . relationship. They would often split up in a series of rows, after which . they would come back together. On one occasion the GP announced he . had left his wife and wanted to move in with Patient A – only for . their relationship to cool off again. The hearing was told the lovers . had sex while he was helping care for her estranged husband, who was . terminally ill with stomach cancer. The affair came to a definitive end in . January 2009 when a ‘violent’ cat-fight erupted between Patient A and . the doctor’s wife at the Burleys’ home in Peterborough. Patient A was arrested the following . day and interviewed by police. She was bailed before later being told no . charges would be brought. She then made her complaint to the General . Medical Council. GP: The Minster Medical Practice in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, where Dr Burley was a partner . Previously, Dr Burley had suffered fractured ribs . and a broken nose after he and Patient A's school-age son became embroiled in a . brawl in 2008. Dr . Burley faced allegations of pursuing and engaging in an emotional and . sexual relationship with a patient over three periods between 2003 and . 2008. He admitted conducting an on-off affair but denied pursuing the . woman and was cleared of the charge. He said the relationship developed ‘by mutual agreement’. The panel heard that when Dr Burley . informed a colleague about the affair, he was told it was . ‘inappropriate’ and that Patient A must register with another doctor. A decision will be made over Dr Burley's future as a doctor at a further hearing later this year.","GP Terence Burley, 63, renewed vows with wife Jane after affair with patient .

A group of thugs who were involved in a shopping centre brawl which led to the death of a 24-year-old man have been jailed. Five men from rival gangs in Walthamstow and Stratford were sentenced for their part in a running battle at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, east London, which broke out when a yoghurt pot was thrown. The violent exchange ended in the death of Liam Woodards who was stabbed in the chest. Riaz Anderson, 19, and Tristian Mullings, 21, from one gang were both jailed for 20 months, while Danny Caton, 24, Michael Ndefo, 22, and Rhys Regisford, 21, all from the rival gang were jailed for 34 months, 28 months and 16 months respectively for violent disorder. Stabbed: Liam Woodards, 24, was stabbed during a violent exchange between two gangs at Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, east London . The Old Bailey heard that terrified shoppers fled and shops closed their shutters when trouble broke out on June 29 last year at the then-newly opened centre which is next to the Olympic Park. The fighting started when Caton threw a yoghurt pot at a rival gang member. Mr Woodard, who celebrated his birthday just a day before he was killed, was stabbed, steel chairs were thrown and at least three knives were brandished by gang members including Anderson and Ndefo. The gangs continued to do battle when Mr Woodard collapsed. As one gang fled, three of the men, Caton, Ndefo and Regisford, seeking revenge for Mr Woodards's stabbing chased them to Stratford underground station where one rival was stabbed in the shoulder and another was hit with a belt. Busy: Shoppers fled and shops closed their shutters after trouble broke out at the Westfield Shopping Centre in June last year (file picture) The attackers men fled when they spotted a PCSO coming up a nearby escalator. The whole incident, just weeks before last summer's Olympics, was caught on CCTV. The court heard that 45 minutes before the murder of Mr Woodard, Anderson and Mullings had been threatening and intimidating three other youths in the mall. Then the duo with four others saw the rival gang consisting of at least eight others, including Mr Woodard, and witnesses described how the two gangs became increasingly hostile to each other. Drinks glasses and the yoghurt pots were then hurled at each other which sparked the mass brawl. Prosecutor Duncan Atkinson said: ‘This was a frightening event for members of the public who were obviously around at the time, simply trying to shop and enjoy themselves at such a venue shortly before the London Olympics was due to begin.’ Sentencing them, Judge Stephen Kramer QC said: 'Those who engage in this kind of needless, mindless and potentially dangerous violence in public must expect to receive a custodial sentence. Jailed: The five men were all sentenced for violent disorder at the Old Bailey in London . 'Westfield Shopping Centre in Straford in east London was busy with members of the public, normally going about their business, That normality was shattered by what happened in about two-and-a-half minutes. 'Such was the intensity the area where it was happening emptied of members of the public and shops shut their doors. 'The confrontation between the members of the two groups appears to be a turf war.' He told Caton, Ndefo and Regisford: 'Each of you lost a friend that day. 'That was upsetting for you but although it may explain it does not excuse the violent behaviour in which each you engaged.' Anderson, who was given a warning when he was found with a knife at school aged 14, and Mullings were jailed for 20 months each for their part in the violence. They had no other convictions. Caton was given 24 months for his role in the incident, but, because he was in breach of a suspended sentence for aggravated burglary, must serve 34 months behind bars. Ndefo who used a knife to stab a rival in the shoulder was given 28 months behind bars. He had previous convictions for ABH, criminal damage and affray. Regisford, who wanted to become a fitness instructor and only joined in the violence at the Underground station using a belt as his weapon, was given 16 months. He had previous convictions for having a knife, assault and theft.","Liam Woodards died at Westfield Stratford after being stabbed in the chest .

A British student who has not been seen since attempting to scale a 19,000ft Peruvian mountain on his own 10 days ago is feared dead. Experienced rock and ice climber Thomas Jagger, 22, set off to climb the Pisco mountain in Peru on July 24 on his own after his climbing partner was sick. He left for the glacier in the Cordillera Blanca mountain range in western Peru without his friend Luke Dyer at around 8.30am. Fears: Thomas Jagger went missing when he tried to scale a Peruvian mountain on his own when his climbing partner was sick . The University of Warwick maths student had travelled to Peru on July 20 to carry out a hiking trip in the famous Alley of Huaylas in the Ancash region. Jagger’s sleeping bag was reportedly spotted by another trekker at the Moraine Camp, a base camp at 16,240ft where climbers spend the night before ascending the Pisco peak. A fellow climber who met the pair in Peru, and had breakfast with Mr Jagger before he set off, said: 'His plan was to solo the mountain from the Moraine Camp on the 25th. 'He was soloing the mountain because Luke was sick,' explained the 24-year-old from Washington DC. He ended up climbing alone. 'I don’t think he would have preferred to solo it,' he explained, adding that Luke had been nervous about climbing the peak. Mountain range: Mount Pisco is located in the west of Peru . 'He was on and off sick. Tom was getting frustrated with the whole thing and decided to just go and climb. 'Unfortunately, there was a big storm the day he planned to summit and we don’t know exactly what happened. He was supposed to summit and return on that same day, the 25th. 'Another climber saw his sleeping bag still at the Moraine Camp the following day. 'We suspect that he might have fallen into a crevasse. This all seems like a nightmare.' A spokesman from the British Embassy in Lima said: 'We were notified on July 27 that a British national, Thomas Jagger, has been reported missing in Huaraz, Peru.

Fresh out of a 90-day stint at the Cliffside Malibu Rehab Center and reportedly 'doing amazing'  as she spends a few days in a sober living facility as she adjusts to life back in the spotlight, she has been dealt another blow. Ahead of the August 2 release of her new movie, The Canyons, the film's screenwriter, Bret Easton Ellis, has labelled the star 'mixed up', 'scattered' and 'bossy'. Back in the spotlight: She may be freshly out of rehab, but Lindsay Lohan's woes are far from over - with Bret Easton Ellis, the screenwriter of her new film, The Canyons, labelling her 'mixed up', 'scattered' and 'bossy' In a candid interview with New York website Gawker, Bret revealed that his time on set with the 27-year-old was fraught with lateness and nervousness on the actress's part. A former drug user himself, he puts a lot of Lindsay's behaviour down to her Adderall dependency. 'She’s a very mixed up 20-something,' he says, adding of their first encounter on set, 'She was late, she was a little scattered, we had nervous small talk, and then she turned it on immediately.' Hostile co-stars: James Deen has said that working with Lindsay on The Canyons was like working with 'a child' - a sentiment echoed by the film's director, Paul Schrader . 'She was sometimes bossy - I don’t know if that’s the Adderall.' It wasn't all bad, though, with the American Psycho author admitting that he 'genuinely liked her' and she has real talent. '[Lindsay's] very knowledgeable about film and composition and lighting and hitting your mark. When she did our first table read, she blew me away,' he raved. Not all bad: Bret Easton Ellis - pictured here in 2010 - also said the actress 'blew me away', at her initial table read, and that he 'genuinely liked her' 'I don’t see her as lost. I know a lot of . 20-somethings and they’re all messed up. But when you’re out in the . public, you’re magnified 100 per cent, and I can understand how you’d go . a little bit further. But she was ultimately very nice.' However, the film's director, Paul Schrader, told a very different story of his experience working with the troubled star earlier this month. According to RadarOnline, he was quoted as saying that 'tardiness, tantrums, absences, neediness, psychodrama' plagued the shoot. Not over yet: She looked happy to leave Cliffside Malibu Rehab Center on Tuesday, but on their advice to the judge in her probation case, Lindsay must attend three 50-minute therapy sessions a week for 16 months . A sentiment echoed by Lindsay's co-star, James Deen - Farrah Abraham's sex-tape partner and porn star - who reportedly said working with the actress was akin to working with 'a child'. The bad rap from her colleagues comes just days after Variety gave the actress a rave review on July 28, saying she has a 'fascinating presence' and is 'affecting' in her role, to which she tweeted the response, 'Wow...humbled and feeling so much gratitude'. Meanwhile, Lindsay may have left rehab on Tuesday beaming from ear to ear, but it has since been revealed that staff at the rehab facility are fearful that she will return to her old ways. In a letter obtained by TMZ, Cliffside Malibu Rehab Center CEO and founder Richard Taite recommended to the judge in Lilo's probation case that she be issued with court-ordered therapy. On the home stretch: Lilo's lawyer, Shawn Holley, says it was the star's decision to have a sober companion and she is 'doing well', adding, 'She is so positive and [wants to get] her life on the right track' 'Our entire clinical team is in . unanimous agreement that if these sessions are not required by the court . and attendance verified once a month to ensure accountability, it is a . set up for almost certain failure,' was the ominous warning given to . Judge James R Dabney. In . open court this morning, the judge agreed to the recommendation terms, . which state that Lindsay must participate in three 50-minute therapy . sessions per week for the next 16 months. 'This . should be done face-to-face while she is in town and via Skype or phone . session if she is out of town,' the document specifies. Leading lady: The 27-year-old tweeted, 'Wow...humbled and feeling so much gratitude,' on July 28 after Variety referred to her as having a 'fascinating presence' and being 'affecting' in The Canyons . Speaking to E! News, her lawyer, Shawn Holley, says the star is determined to stay out of trouble this time around, adding, 'It was [Lindsay's] idea to have a sober coach with her. She is doing well. She is so positive and [wants to get] her life on the right track.' Lindsay's father, Michael Lohan, has also publicly praised his daughter, revealing he is 'very, very proud of what she's accomplished, how far she's come and how seriously she's taking her sobriety and her future'. Lindsay's three-month treatment sentence for substance abuse issues stems from a June 2012 car accident, in which she plead no contest to charges of lying to police about being behind the wheel.","Lawyer Shawn Holley claims star is 'doing amazing' and 'it was her idea to have a sober coach with her'

Hussein and Hassan Benhaffaf had their liver, bladder, gut and intestine divided in February 2010 when they were just five months old, after being born conjoined from chest to pelvis.

Exhausted: Since the birth of her first child just weeks ago, Ashley says she feels like she has aged 10 years - and doesn't recognise the bleary-eyed woman in the mirror . Let’s face it, not everyone is comfortable with injecting a toxin into their face. And for pregnant and breastfeeding women particularly - it is most definitely not on the menu. When new mother Kim Kardashian first came home with baby North, there were rumours that she had elected not to breastfeed, in order to get back to her beloved Botox injections sooner rather than later. However, she was subsequently said to have changed her mind. Maybe she found out about Baby Botox. A term once used to describe . miniscule but strategic amounts of Botox carefully applied and with . great restraint, Baby Botox has taken on a whole new meaning amongst the . yummy mummy set. Indeed . it’s becoming increasingly popular for pregnant women and the new, and . often breastfeeding mother determined that her face not look as tired as . she feels. And while . ‘No-Tox’ face treatments have been around for a while, the market for . mums is booming with brand new and innumerable options to keep you . looking your best during this challenging and constantly exhausting time . of your life. Most of us realise that having a baby . affects not only your body, but also has a major impact on your face. I . can vividly recall waking up shortly after my daughter was born and . thinking ‘who in the world is she?’ as I stared at my bleary eyed, . slack-jawed face after a 3am feed. I had aged a decade it seemed, in the space of a few weeks. Early . mornings, late night feeds, the stress of making sure that the baby’s . taken care of properly combined with a general lack of sleep can lead to . a look of perpetual weariness that I suspect all new mothers are . familiar with. As more sleep was not an immediate possibility, I began my research into what actually could be done. To be sure, there are lots of options out there: I tried and liked Beetox, (bee venom), Pre-tox, (Peptide gel), Dr Nabet’s L.Boxin (natural enzymes), and Endocare (snail secretions). All good choices and worth exploring. owever what I discovered is, at the moment, the term most buzzed about amongst beauty editors – and indeed at Gymborees and Starbucks around the nation -  is ‘VTOX’. Created by skincare guru Linda Meredith and voted ‘the best alternative to Botox’ by Tatler Magazine, VTOX is quite simply, the Queen of Baby Botox. No-Tox? It was rumoured Kim Kardashian elected not to breastfeed so she could take up Botox injections again after her baby's birth - but she is said to have subsequently changed her mind. Right, Gwyneth Paltrow has visited the Linda Meredith clinic and Madonna is said to be a fan of Meredith's oxygen facials . It contains neuro-peptides and natural algae which surround the muscles with proteins to block the skin contracting. Says Linda, 'Researching through the thousands of ingredients available, I found that the most effective botanical was Algae Extract. Combined with other natural ingredients, the skin will appear more youthful and relaxing without looking frozen in time.' A toxin-free treatment with staying power, VTOX works by gently helping the skin avoid conforming to expression lines when the muscles contract. The key words here are ‘gently’ and ‘natural’. It’s like Botox without the poison or freeze. Sold online as a stand alone lotion, or as part of a professional facial treatment, VTOX is hugely popular amongst the women who frequent Linda Meredith’s Knightsbridge salon - whether pregnant, breastfeeding, or just looking for smoother skin in a natural way. 'Botox is a registered trademark of Allergan a U.S. based company. It is used to freeze certain muscles in the face to reduce expression and age lines. The LM alternative is called V-TOX that uses algae derivatives to relax the skin. Our product was designed for those clients who did not want to have a toxin injected into the skin as well as for women who are pregnant and should refrain throughout their pregnancy. It is a more effective treatment for those with deeper frown lines no matter what age. The Standard Oxygen treatment is carried out and then the V-TOX is added to specific areas that need to be treated or a fine layer can be applied generally over the entire face and neck. The product is then infused into the skin by the steady flow of oxygen.' - Linda Meredith . A skin care expert for more than 40 years, Linda Meredith developed VTOX after a storied career of taking care of some of the world’s most beautiful and famous faces. Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Moss, Stella McCartney, Kate Beckinsale and Sienna Miller have all been clients. Linda says, 'Unsurprisingly, staying young and beautiful for as long as possible is on every woman’s wish list. Medical professionals continue to develop treatments deemed ‘cosmetic,’ some of which are certainly beneficial, but others put pressure on women to have procedures they are not totally comfortable with. The first buzz word was of course ‘Botox’ but not all women want to be injected with a poisonous toxin.' She adds, 'When developing my own range of skincare products one of my priorities was to have an effective option for those women looking for a Botox alternative including those pregnant or breast feeding who had to refrain from their usual Botox fix.' The VTOX Oxygen facial begins with a deep cleaning, steaming and intense hydration followed by a generous amount of the VTOX cream. It feels tingly but not unpleasant. This is followed up by more gentle blasts of pure Oxygen, layered on to plump up what is now, rather smooth skin. The end result promises to leave you with skin as smooth as the bottom of the baby in your arms. I emerged glowing, which many facials can admittedly achieve, but also got the added benefit of the lift that I was looking for. My skin was tighter and looked less tired than it had been in quite some time.  I was delighted to look a bit more like the person I was used to seeing in the mirror. And after all, post baby, it may take months or even years to get one’s body back, but women like me are quickly realising that your face doesn’t have to wait. VTOX retails for £99 and a VTOX Oxygen Facial is £150. Both can be found at www.lindameredith.com .

'I'd been feeling incredibly sick . since . late June, which [my partner Liam and I have] worked out is most likely . when we conceived,' Sophiia told MailOnline. 'I . went to my doctor multiple times and he just said it was stress. 'Towards the end, from around . February, I started to fully feel kicking. I didn't know what that felt . like, and I'd heard from someone . with IBS that she felt little bubble-like sensations all the time and . her tummy felt hard because of that, so I brushed it off.' Sophiia continued: 'It started to . really annoy me early March, so I got an emergency appointment at my . doctor's surgery. 'The woman we saw didn't seem to want to help in any . way at all. She told me that she could't do anything for me as . emergency appointments were reserved for emergencies. She didn' even . offer me advice. 'She felt my stomach, and said nothing. I heard from the . midwives at the hospital that she'd written in my notes that my stomach . felt hard, but she didn't do anything about it, or even suggest the . obvious - that I was pregnant - even though I'd also complained of feeling pressure . throughout my abdomen.' Mother and son: Sophiia, 20, says Michael, now four months, is the best thing that has ever happened to her and boyfriend Liam, 18 . But the riddle was solved in March, when early one morning Sophiia found herself in agony, unable to sit, stand or lie down. 'I was in early labour for a good . couple of days, but I thought it was just period pain! It got really bad . the night before he was born - I couldn’t sit or lay down, and standing . up was agony too. 'I only knew something was wrong when . I felt the unbelievable urge to push, got to the bathroom and I started . bleeding everywhere. 'I phoned an ambulance at about . 5:30am and when they got to our house they asked all sorts of questions . about the pain, and told me I was most probably pregnant.' Father and son: Liam, 18, with his baby son Michael shortly after his birth - which came as a complete surprise to both his parents . Sophiia and her boyfriend Liam, 18, . had been together for a year before having Michael, and had talked about having babies but . decided to wait for a while since they were both still in college. But they didn't get to wait very long, as that night the pair of them were rushed to hospital, both in complete shock. 'I literally didn't believe what they . were saying. I was rushed into A&E at Southampton General and they . asked me the questions again, and again told me I was more than likely . pregnant. 'I was in so much shock that . regardless of how many times they said it, I didn't believe it. I was . taken to another room where they took an ultrasound of my stomach, and . it showed my baby was right down in the birth canal.' The surprised mother-to-be had been in labour for . almost four days before she fully realised what was happening. They . rushed her to Princess Anne maternity hospital where she gave birth . naturally to her son about an hour later. Hello, world: Baby Michael, who was conceived despite his mother Sophiia being on The Pill . Luckily, Sophiia isn't a big drinker and doesn't smoke, so she wasn't inadvertently harming her baby's health while she was pregnant. 'The most I did was drink Red Bull three times a week before a workout,' she said. She and Liam had been dieting and working out together before the birth, which is partly why she returned again and again to her doctor when she was not losing but actually gaining weight. But since she was taking the Cerazette contraceptive pill she did not think the weight gain could possibly mean she was pregnant. 'It . upsets me a little that I didn't get to experience pregnancy like other . women do,' Sophiia said. 'I didn’t have any scans or classes for what on earth to do . when you’re having a baby, but everyone around us always tells us how . well we're doing, and how well we've coped with the shock. 'Initially when we found out that I was in labour, we were both incredibly scared and in shock, and really didn't know what to do. 'But as soon as our son was born, it was the most intense feeling of love that we just looked at each other and knew what to do. 'Nothing else we've ever done has felt so right, we love our son too much to explain, and couldn't imagine life without him. We're just so lucky to have him, we call him our little miracle.' Happy family: Liam and Sophiia, pictured with baby Michael, are hoping to marry in April and expand their family as soon as possible . But Sophiia and Liam are less enamoured with the way her doctors treated her. 'I really am not impressed with my doctor. The fact that literally three days before I gave birth my tummy was felt and nothing was said is ridiculous. 'She made such a massive error in judgement. It borders heavily on negligence. I have severe back pain, and have serious pain in my left hip as a result of a terrifying and agonising labour: I can't do anything anymore without being in huge amounts of pain.' Despite this, the new parents think baby Michael, now four months old, is 'the single most amazing thing to happen' in their lives. 'We're planning to get married in April, and hoping to try for another baby soon because we’d love to expand our family.' Let's just hope the next one isn't so much of a surprise. Our little miracle: Next time she is pregnant, Sophiia would like the chance to experience it properly rather than having a surprise birth nine months later .","Sophiia-Marie de Faia had baby Michael in March after four-day labour .

Missing: Friends feared the worst when Garin Dart vanished without a trace from Tokyo in May but police now say he has left the country after taking £40,000 from his company . A British businessman who disappeared suddenly from Tokyo two months ago had taken £40,000 of his company's money and left the country, it was reported today. Friends and colleagues feared popular Garin Dart, 41, had been killed or kidnapped by Japanese gangsters when he vanished on May 22, leaving his pregnant wife Yukako, 38, and their child. But police in Tokyo have confirmed they have stopped looking for the CEO after discovering he had withdrawn the money from his company Bluesilver, an events management company for foreign businesses and expats, and left Japan for an unknown destination. Superintendent Hiroshi Kozono, of Tokyo Metropolitan Police, told The Times: 'We are not actively moving [on this case]. There is a possibility of embezzlement.' As well as his business, Mr Dart was co-founder of Foreign Volunteers Japan, a network he set up in the wake of the 2011 tsunami. Friends had told the newspaper Mr Dart was tired and working very hard, but that he seemed perfectly normally on the day of his disappearance. In an article on the Foreign Volunteers Japan website, colleagues said he sent text messages at around 1pm about an upcoming meeting at the Tokyo Hilton Hotel. After that there was no communication by him with friends or family in Japan or in the UK. Police confirmed he had not been arrested or hospitalised and reports said his bank account and credit cards had not been touched. Mr Dart's assistant Ayako Kawauchi, who was the last person to see him, said that on the day he went missing colleagues thought he may . have fallen asleep somewhere, as he seemed tired. Bruno Dammizio, Mr Dart's Canadian business partner, said: 'He has literally vanished into thin air. There has been no trace of him . in any shape or form. No communication with friends or family.' But police confirmed prior to his disappearance he had withdrawn £39,500 from the Bluesilver account, of which some was deposited into his personal account. The rest he took in cash. Ms Kawauchi told police that she usually handled banking and it was unusual for Mr Dart to have made the transaction. Police are not investigating any criminal complaint against him. It was suggested that Mr Dart's family were informed about what happened weeks ago. After he went missing, his family reportedly asked friends not to hand out flyers or posters appealing for information. His mother Finella Dean, 64, flew to Tokyo after her son went missing but did not meet with police. A spokesman for Bluesilver said: 'The fact he was carrying a large amount of money is compatible with the event business. Some vendors prefer cash.' Disappearance: Mr Dart last made contact with colleagues at 1pm on May 22 when he sent texts about an upcoming meeting at the Tokyo Hilton Hotel (pictured) Mr Dart had moved to Japan from Britain in 2003 where he set up his business, which had been growing more and more successful. Today, friends of Mr Dart expressed their shock at the latest twist in his disappearance on a Facebook group which had appealed for information about his disappearance. Some suggested the relatively small amount of money he took may mean there was a serious reason he had to leave. Branden Brazil wrote: 'We have yet to get the full story. I have no idea what his motivation for running off is. Certainly, the amount of money he allegedly took, is hardly enough to support a long term jetsetter's life in Rio. I imagine that he had very serious reasons to leave, and at this time, those reasons are mere speculation.' While Corrie MacDonald said: 'None of us really know what has happened and what has driven him to do any of this - we are all still speculating - but a lot of us know Garin well enough to realise he is a great guy, good friend and that he was a loving & very proud family man and yes if this is what he has done then its not a good thing to do BUT he must have had extremely good reasons to and will have had no other choice and wherever he is he is definitely not sunning it up on a beach. Lets all just hope that he will come back to us safe & sound.' More: Tokyo police give up search for British businessman .","Garin Dart, 41, vanished in May leaving his pregnant wife and child .

Last chance: Silvio Berlusconi faces the end of his political career if his appeal against corruption charges is not upheld by Italy's highest court . Silvio Berlusconi's lawyers made their final arguments in front of Italy's highest court, seeking the reversal of a conviction that halt to the three-time former premier's 20-year political career. The highly anticipated decision could catastrophically weaken the fragile coalition government of Enrico Letta, which is struggling to pass measures to help Italy out of recession. A decision could come later today or tomorrow. Berlusconi has urged supporters not to let the decision interfere with the government, but analysts warn that the situation is volatile. Centre-right lawmakers have already slowed work in Parliament to protest the high court's decision to take the case in July instead of the autumn. Without the support of those MPs the country's coalition will not have the votes to carry out its legislative agenda, a situation that could cause the country to face fresh elections. Berlusconi and three others were convicted in October of tax fraud in the purchase of television rights for Berlusconi's Mediaset network. Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison with a five-year ban on public office, which was confirmed on appeal. If also confirmed by Italy's highest court, Berlusconi would lose his Senate seat and be banned from running in elections for the duration of any public office ban. The state prosecutor on Tuesday . recommended shortening the public office ban to three years - which . Berlusconi defence lawyer Franco Coppi told reporters indicates a . 'blatant error' in the sentencing. Police stand guard outside the Court of Cassation in Rome, as a gaggle of journalists gather to await the decision in Berlusconi's appeal. If found guilty, his supporters in parliament could seek to bring down the government . Berlusconi's defense team, long-time defender Niccolo Ghedini and Mr Coppi, an appellate expert, began what was expected to be several hours of arguments late this afternoon. Earlier, defence lawyers for the other three defendants made their case. At one point, chief justice Antonio Esposito grew impatient with the exhaustive arguments, telling a lawyer for one of the defendants: 'We have read everything.'","Decision could mark the end of former PM's 20-year political career .

Two children watched in horror as their mother was turned into a human fireball when a barbecue exploded in the sun. Mother-of-two Hayley Hassard was watching her son play cricket when a gas canister blew up and ignited her thin summer dress last weekend. Her friend Angie Hall tackled her to the ground and rolled her until the flames were extinguished - leaving the 45-year-old badly burned. Injured: Mother-of-two Hayley Hassard was left with burns on her leg and back after her dress caught alight when a BBQ gas canister exploded . Ms Hassard has to change the dressings on the burns on her legs and back every two days and is unable to work or even sit properly while her injuries heal. Ms Hassard, from Hull, East Yorks, said: 'I saw the flames go up on the barbecue and remember thinking it was a bit bright and I moved Angie away. 'The next thing I knew I saw a white flash and someone said it was a canister that had exploded. 'My dress just lit up and caught fire. It was only a thin summer dress. Someone shouted ""Hayley is on fire"".' Ms Hassard tried to put the flames out as her sons Jack, 11, and Sam, eight, watched helplessly. Recovery: Ms Hassard has had to take time off work because of her burns and needs to change her dressing on her injuries every two days . She added: 'The next think I knew, Angie was on top of me and she’d rugby tackled me to the ground. 'She didn’t think of herself. She just did it. I dread to think what would have happened if it wasn’t for her quick actions. 'People were standing there frozen and she just went into action. Lucky: Ms Hassard with friend Angie Hall who managed to grapple her to the ground and roll her until the flames went out . 'My husband was running across the field. I think I would be in a specialist burns unit now, dealing with much more severe injuries, if it wasn’t for her. 'I want to highlight to people to know what to do if something like this happens. Angie’s quick actions are what saved me from much more serious injuries.' Angie Hall, 53, of Kingswood, said instinct took over when she saw her friend engulfed in flames. She said: 'Hayley told me to move forward as the flames were high on the barbecue. The next thing I knew, there was an explosion and everyone screamed and ran. All I heard was someone shout ""Hayley is on fire"". 'Hayley was spinning around trying to get it out. Instinct kicked in, I pushed her over and started rolling her. 'Everyone has said she was like a fireball. It was a gut reaction for me, I just wanted to get there and knock her over.' Ms Hassard had been enjoying watching her son Sam play cricket at a sports field in Willerby when the canister exploded. Her father, Terry Gosnell, who was also there, said: 'There were quite a few people there. If it had not been for Angie, her burns would have been dreadful. 'I can’t bear to think about it. She raced over and rugby tackled her to the floor and rolled her 20 or 30 yards. 'Hayley’s burns would have been far more serious. Instead of her back and tops of her legs, we would have been looking at her whole body.

A gang of fraudsters who helped up to 250 Bangladeshi immigrants con their way towards British citizenship and a ‘gold mine’ of benefits was jailed for nearly 20 years yesterday. Charging a minimum of £10,000 per person, they provided each with bogus paperwork suggesting they had been working in this country for five years. One gang member worked at a branch of Barclays Bank from where he was able to fraudulently open accounts for  the ‘clients’. Juber Ahmed (left) and Motiur Rahman (right) were jailed for between twelve months and four years . Ringleader Ataur Rahman used Talakdar Lutfur Rahman (right) and the rest of his gang to arrange false documents for more than 250 immigrants . Armed with their fake documents, the immigrants were able to secure UK citizenship and bring their families over from Bangladesh – and win entitlement to claim benefits and free NHS care. Immigration officials believe as many as 250 ‘clients’ acquired fake paperwork, but so far just ten have been traced and face being deported. Yesterday a judge jailed the seven-strong gang for almost 20 years, saying ringleader Ataur Rahman Talukdar ‘deliberately set out to undermine the immigration laws for his own profit’. Sentencing the gang at Manchester Crown Court, Judge Blake described Talukdar as ‘the mastermind and puppeteer of the whole conspiracy’. Afterwards, Detective Sergeant Jeff Taylor, of the Home Office team which exposed the gang, said the scam had given immigrants access to a lucrative ‘gold mine’ of benefits. ‘The scam was so good as it made you 100 per cent British – and legally entitled to every single benefit,’ he said. ‘Although £10,000 is a lot of money, it is nothing compared to what you can rake in when you are British, which was like gold dust or a gold mine to these people … they were claiming everything they could.’ Wahidur Rahman, 46 (left) was the chief executive of the Computer Skills and Development Agency. His signature appeared on nearly 1,000 passports. His brother Mohammes Habibur Rahman (right) was in the gang . 23-year-old Haroon Miah was enlisted because he worked in Barclays bank and illegally opened accounts for his 'clients' British-born Talukdar arranged false documents for more than 250 immigrants over a five-year period before his arrest in 2011, earning hundreds of thousands of pounds from the scam. ‘He was raking in more money than a drug dealer,’  Det Sgt Taylor added. Talukdar, 49, enlisted 23-year-old Haroon Miah, who worked at a branch of Barclays and would fraudulently open accounts for the immigrants, and Wahidur Rahman, 46, then chief executive of the Computer Skills and Development Agency, based in Oldham. Bangladeshi immigrants would pay Talukdar between £10,000 and £14,000 for a package of fake documents in order to obtain a passport, the men’s six-month trial heard. They travelled from as far afield as Aberdeen to open accounts through Miah, while Talukdar allegedly secured fake utility bills, employer references and even certificates of competency in speaking English. Rahman’s signature appeared on 998 fraudulent passport applications, although investigators accept they were forged without his knowledge. The Home Office was only tipped off about the scam when one of Talukdar’s ex-workers walked into a Manchester police station in  2011 and revealed all – otherwise they admit it might never have  been detected. His business was raided while he was in the middle of finalising a naturalisation package for a new Bangladeshi customer. Barclays said Miah had been sacked following his arrest in 2011. Talukdar was convicted of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and Proceeds of Crime Act offences and jailed for eight years. Miah was jailed for three years after being convicted of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration, and Wahidur Rahman escaped with a suspended sentence after admitting conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Other gang members, including three of Talukdar’s brothers, were jailed for between 12 months  and four years and three months  for crimes ranging from immigration deception charges, to  money laundering and identity documents offences.","Group charged more than £10,000 for bogus paperwork saying they had worked in the UK for five years .
