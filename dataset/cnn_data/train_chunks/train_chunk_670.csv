Human hair has been identified in fossilised hyena poo - a finding suggesting that our ancestors were eaten by the predatory animals. The fossil was discovered a few years ago at Gladysvale cave in South Africa, but has only recently been analysed by scientists, who identified the hair. African researchers believe the hyenas either actively hunted our ancestors living 257,000-years-ago or scavenged some dead bodies, ingesting hair. Human hair has been identified in fossilised hyena poo - a finding suggesting that our ancestors were eaten by the predatory animals. Pictured is a block of calcified cave sediment containing part of the hyena latrine, showing the largest piece of fossilised faeces . African researchers believe the hyenas either hunted our ancestors living 257,000-years-ago or scavenged dead bodies and ingested the hair. However, they have not ruled out that the animal just fancied a snack of human hair that it found somewhere . Gladysvale Cave, is a fossil-bearing cave located about 13 km Northeast of the well known South African hominid-bearing sites of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans and about 45 km North-Northwest of the City of Johannesburg, South Africa. It is a complex cave system made up of several underground chambers reaching a depth of about 65 metres. It is situated within the Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site. Many thousands of fossils have been recovered from the Gladysvale deposits including rare remains of hominids. Almost a quarter of a million bones have been recovered from the external Gladysvale deposits since excavations began in 1992. Fossils recovered include antelope, giant zebra, carnivores including extinct wolves, monkeys and hominids attributed to Australopithecus africanus and early Homo. However, they have not ruled out that the animal just fancied a snack of human hair that it found somewhere, Discovery News reported. The fossilised faeces was part of a 'hyena latrine' discovered in a cave located in the Sterkfontein Valley in South Africa, according to researchers at the University of Witwatersrand. Gladysvale is a complex cave system made up of several underground chambers reaching a depth of about 65 metres. Phillip Taru and Lucinda Backwell, authors of the research  published in the Journal of Archaeological Science, said brown hyenas roamed the savannah grasslands, like they do today. Other hairs demonstrated that the animals shared their environment with warthogs, zebra, impala, and kudu, as well as hominins - a tribe of our ancestors. The scientists focused on examining scale patterns and cross sections of hair to identify the fossilised hairs. The fossil was discovered a few years ago at Gladysvale cave . in South Africa (pictured is the Gladysvale walkway), but has only recently been analysed by scientists, who identified the hair . The researchers said: 'A lack of hair scales has been documented in human hair subject to pathology. They even suggested that our ancestors had many a bad hair day, because of  'abrasion of the hair resulting from inhabiting rock crevices' that could have reduced the number of scales found on the hairs. A total of 48 hairs were extracted from . the 12 fossils using fine tweezers and were examined using a scanning . electron microscope. They identified the origins of the hairs using standard guides as well as comparing them to a collection of samples from 15 indigenous southern African mammals. The findings support previous tentative identifications of fossilised human hairs and give scientists a better picture of the local Middle Pleistocene mammal community as well as an insight into the  environment in which archaic and emerging modern humans in the interior of the African subcontinent lived.","The hair was found in a fossil discovered in Gladysvale cave in the Sterkfontein Valley in South Africa .

Apple has released a total of eight iPhone handsets since 2007 and each one has been released with the promise of faster speeds and improved performance. But how different is the original model to the current 5S? Fan site EverythingApplePro has created a video test of all eight handsets, from the original to the new model, plus the 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5 and 5C. Each of the handsets were 'freshly restored and not jailbroken' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand. Apple's new software has been slammed for causing users to feel sick. Features on software including zooming screens and app windows, full-screen slide transitions, a 'faux-3D parallax effect' on the home screen. As the phone is tilted, the icons appear to move independently from the wallpaper. Stuff magazine investigated the effects these motion-based features had on users and discovered claims of nausea, motion sickness and even vertigo. In the first test, all the phones were powered off simultaneously and the 3GS shut down fastest, followed by 3G, then the 4, then the original model. The newer handsets all took noticeably longer than the older models, but took exactly the same amount of time as each other, to the second. The voiceover explained during the video that iOS 6 had a much faster shut down time than iOS 7 and this was highlighted in the test. Each of the phones booted up at different times, but EverythingApplePro highlights that the models differ in the amount of processing power and RAM and software between the newest and oldest phones, meaning this was not unexpected. The newer models all booted up first, and at almost the same time, yet the original phone booted up faster than the iPhone 4. Apple's iPhone 3G was the slowest to boost. Fan site EverythingApplePro has created a video test of all eight handsets, from the original to the new 5S model, plus the 3G, 3GS, 4, 4S, 5 and 5C, pictured. Each of the handsets were 'freshly restored and not jailbroken' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed . In the final tests, EverythingApplePro launched the Reddit.com, and Apple.com websites. The male voiceover explained that the 5S loads sites 'instantaneously' adding: 'the extra processing power and the new Wi-Fi capabilities, its an amazing device'. When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5 and the voiceover continued the loading times go 'downhill' from there. In conclusion, the video maker claimed: 'I learnt that the amount of processing power is greater as the generation goes on, but it's marginally less noticeable the higher you go, so if you have a 5 I wouldn't really recommend upgrading to a 5S just based on the fact you want extra amount of power, because it has an amazing amount of power as it is.'

He's only two weeks old, but fluffy Felix the kitten may already have used up his nine lives after clinging on to the bottom of a lorry for almost 170 miles. The stowaway was found underneath a container HGV when it parked up at a factory that makes made-to-measure blinds by the factory owner Andrea Cooper. Now he’s set for a happy home life with her once he’s had some TLC at a local animal rescue centre. Adorable: Tiny Felix the kitten was found under a lorry after travelling 170 miles . Dark eyes: The kitten was named Felix after the origin of his journey, Felixstowe . Staff there are convinced his mother may have put him in a metal box on the lorry’s chassis out of harm’s way while she went off hunting around the docks in Felixstowe, Suffolk. But while her back was turned the 40 foot long lorry was loaded with a container and driven off to its destination in Nottinghamshire. The delivery arrived at The Mill Factory Shop in Sutton-in-Ashfield last Wednesday, but it was only when the driver switched off the engine that staff heard the little cries of the terrified creature. Andrea, 48, said: 'We could hear him, but we couldn’t see where he was. We tried to coax him out with some food, but we were wasting our time as he was too young to have been weaned. 'One of the lads managed to reach up inside the metal box and got hold of him and pulled him out. 'He was shaking and covered in oil. He looked like a rat. He was so frightened. Saved: Factory owner Andrea Cooper found little Felix under the HGV . Feeding time: He is being cared for by Millwood Cat Rescue in Nottingham but is likely to be going home with Andrea . 'We got some formula milk and fed him with a syringe that we had in the first aid box. Then we rang round some local rescue centres to see who could look after him. Andrea took him to the Millwood Cattery in West Bridgford, Nottingham and staff there quickly gave him a name. Owner Ronnie McMillen said: “It was a straightforward choice really, he was Felix who’d stowed away from the docks… Felix-stowe! 'Felix is also Latin for lucky, so that was quite apt too! 'There’s a lot of feral cats around the port and it seems that Felix’s mum must have popped him in the box under the lorry to keep him safe and dry while she went off hunting. Obviously when she came back he’d gone. Curious: As he was located on the outside of the container Felix is thought to be a British cat . Unfortunate: Andrea said that she thinks people need to have their animals neutered to avoid the problem of strays . 'If he’d been inside the container we would have had to put him in quarantine, but because he was on the lorry, well almost, everyone is satisfied he’s an Englishman! 'He’s settled in well and he’s feeding well and putting on weight so he’ll be able to leave in a few weeks. After what he’s been through he’s a little miracle. 'He’s got plenty of company here, there’s so many strays around at the moment. People need to have their animals neutered to avoid this problem, they can get financial help if they are struggling.' Felix was cute that despite her head telling her she shouldn’t have another cat animal loving Andrea has decided she will give him a home alongside her other moggy nine-year-old Fluffy. 'I kept think I shouldn’t, but he was so cute and he went through so much to find me,' she said. 'Obviously it was meant to be, you can’t fight fate.'","The two-week-old kitten survived a 170-mile journey under a lorry .

"By . Rebecca Camber . PUBLISHED: . 09:08 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:22 EST, 3 October 2013 . A schoolboy plotted to carry out a ‘new Columbine massacre’ – bombing schools, a university, mosque and cinema, a court has heard. The neo-Nazi fanatic stockpiled an arsenal of weapons at his home in Loughborough, including pipe bombs, petrol bombs, air rifles and a crossbow in preparation for a wave of atrocities, the Old Bailey heard. The boy, who was 16 when he was arrested, is accused of planning to unleash terror at a sixth-form college where he was studying A-levels and a former school where he had been bullied. Terror trial: The suspect, who cannot be named so his face is hidden, is accused of stockpiling weapons to Columbine-style massacre in Loughborough . Other targets were said to have included Loughborough University, a mosque, a cinema and council offices. In a notebook covered with swastikas, the boy, who suffers from Asperger’s syndrome, allegedly wrote how he would ‘enter each classroom taking out the teachers; use explosives to eliminate most of the students’. Inspired by the mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999 in which two teenagers murdered 13 classmates in Colorado, the boy is said to have compiled a ‘hitlist’ of 19 teachers and pupils in his notebook under the heading ‘Plans and Tactics for Operation the New Columbine’. And giving evidence today, the boy's . former science teacher told the court he would look at weapons on the . internet while at school, and even asked which weapon he would like to . be shot with. The teacher, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'He was encouraging me to look at the guns and make some sort of judgment about whether it was a good gun. 'He asked me which gun I would prefer to be shot with. The message - which I took to as an empty threat at the time - was he was considering a shooting.' The teacher claimed that the student would launch 'tirades' against particular religions, aiming his abuse mainly at the Muslim and Jewish faiths, as well as targeting a pupil with German grandparents. He said: 'Instances of racism, tirades - long, drawn out - which were frankly painful to listen to. He seemed to believe that people of the Muslim religion did not have a place in this country.' 'He said, 'I f*****g hate Muslims' and expressed a desire to blow up a mosque.' Legal arguments: Prosecutor Max Hill QC (left) told the jury that if they believe the suspect, who is represented by Ali Bajwa QC (right), was planning a massacre then they should find him guilty . The teacher added: 'He was aware I'm a . chemistry teacher. He also liked to ask about explosives which I did . not get involved with because I do not want to be the one to teach . someone how to commit an atrocity.' The . teenager also claimed to have gone to an English Defence League (EDL) march and asked the teacher if he had attended, the court heard. 'I can only guess that he takes pleasure in humiliating and trying to intimidate with such a remark,' said the teacher. When police raided the accused's home in . February this year they were shocked to  find terrorist manuals and an . astonishing array of weapons in the bedroom of ‘an average young man in . an average house’. They . found partially assembled petrol bombs, pipe bombs and other explosive . devices, pyrotechnic fuse cords, a stab proof vest, a gas mask, three . .22 rifles, two .22 blank firing pistols, three ball-bearing guns, a . crossbow and a military belt. The . teenager, who is now 17, cannot be named for legal reasons, had a giant . swastika flag above his bed and was a member of the extremist English . Defence League. Jurors heard yesterday how he fantasised about mass killings in disturbing recordings and a notebook covered with swastikas, alongside the words ‘EDL no surrender British and proud’ and the mantra: ‘When order fails, violence prevails’. Jurors were shown extracts said to outline his plans. The boy allegedly wrote: ‘Before we go into school gates, enter K block and chain both exits shut. 'Enter each classroom taking out the teachers. Use explosives to eliminate most of the students.’ The defendant also drew a stick figure with arrows showing where weapons and explosives would be concealed inside a trench coat for his ‘operation’, the court heard. On other pages he described filling a can of fuel with nails, screws and ball bearings before lighting it with a rag or an electrical connection wired to a phone. On a Dictaphone he allegedly recorded himself saying: ‘I think soon I’m going to be doing some tests. Test some explosive maybe. ‘So I know what is easiest to make, most effective and reliable. I think I’m going to make a pipe bomb cause they sound pretty easy and testing these things will tell me the amount of stuff I need to carry out the operation.’ On a later recording he said: “How the **** could anyone treat a fellow person like people’s treated me. That’s a question you want to be asking, that’s what drives people to do this. Look at all the ******* things in the past . . . Columbine, Virginia Tech, numbers of others. All because of bullying and how people are treated.’ Plan: Targets were alleged to include Loughborough University and five other sites in the area . The notebook contained essays on his apparent hatred of Muslims. He allegedly wrote: ‘There’s too many Muslims in the UK and Europe, so we must stop them coming over here and send the ones already over here back home before they take over European governments and put Sharia Law in place.’ Jurors were shown videos of the then 16-year-old and two friends, who dubbed themselves the United Revolutionary Army, making bombs out of white spirit and bottles. The balaclava-clad gang throw them at a wall at the back of the property, causing a short burst of flames. Max Hill QC, prosecuting, said: ‘He is talking about British people rising up and fighting Islamic fascism that is sweeping the world. 'He is a member of the EDL Leicester division and a supporter of the Knights Templar, which we suggest are far-right wing British National movements.’ The defendant, dressed in a black T-shirt, sat slumped in the dock yesterday with his head bowed. He is said to have targeted the Reel Cinema in Loughborough because of ‘the attitude of the staff and the prices’, the court heard. He listed Loughborough council offices because of an apparent grievance with a Pakistani member of staff. Mr Hill said: ‘For an average young man in an average house, the list [of weapons] you may think is startling. Child’s play? ‘You will be considering whether he is just a misfit, or whether he is something altogether more sinister.’ The boy denies possessing items for terrorism and possessing a terror manual, the ‘Mujahideen Poisons Handbook’. He has admitted possession of petrol bombs and pipe bombs but denies having parts for making improvised explosive devices. The trial continues.

A murderer who slashed April Jones’ killer Mark Bridger across the face in jail was given another life sentence yesterday. Juvinal Ferreira used a knife he made from a prison-issue Bic razor to cut Bridger on July 7, severing an artery and leaving a wound that needed 30 stitches. Robin Frieze, defending, told Leeds Crown Court that Ferreira hoped the assault in Wakefield jail would make Bridger reveal where he had hidden the body of the five-year-old girl from Machynlleth in mid Wales. Frieze said his client was 'under the impression that if he put the defendant in a state of fear then it would be more likely that it would achieve closure for the family of his victim'. Child killer Mark Bridger (left) was slashed by Juvinal Ferreira (right), who has been given a life sentence for the attack. Bridger, who murdered five year old April Jones, needed 30 stitches . But Mr Justice Coulson said this was not a 'realistic ground of mitigation', adding: 'Convicted murderers cannot appoint themselves as unpaid investigators of another crime, no matter how serious. 'They plainly cannot do that by themselves committing violent crimes.' Mr Justice Coulson handed Ferreira a life sentence with a minimum term of five years after he pleaded guilty to GBH with intent - meaning that he will now not be considered for release until March 2036. Jonathan Sharp, prosecuting, told the court: 'Bridger’s notorious recent conviction for the murder of April Jones, and the circumstances of that offence, became known to the defendant, and it is that which provided a pretext for this offence, which is a premeditated assault with a weapon resulting in exceptionally serious injury. April was kidnapped and murdered by Mark Bridger, who coaxed her into his car as she played on her bike on October 1 last year . 'Bridger was transferred to HMP Wakefield in June of this year and since Thursday July 4 he had been permitted association with other prisoners. 'The first few days had passed without incident. 'However, his presence had been noted and discussed on the wing, and the defendant decided to attack Bridger. 'The defendant saw him and walked directly up to him with the blade held between thumb and forefinger. 'He then slashed him down the face, causing a deep wound extending from temple to chin. 'He paused for a moment and looked Bridger directly in the eyes - in Bridger’s own words ""as if to admire his work or show me who it was"". Mr Sharp told how Ferreira claimed he had flushed the weapon away but a search found a weapon close by that was very similar to his description. Ferreira initially denied the claim, telling prison officers: 'What’s up, I’ve done nowt wrong', later admitting what he had done. He was born in Guinea and grew up in the Gambia, arriving in the UK in 2007 with his mother and they lived in Dereham in Norfolk in April 2008. It was here that he was 'frequently observed drunk and behaving in a bizarre and sexually aggressive manner,' Mr Sharp told. The court heard he became friendly with a 47-year-old lady named Elaine Walpole, and he began regularly visiting her at her flat. On April 26, 2008 he raped and murdered her in the flat. The court heard her death was as a result of a single stab wound to her neck.","Juvinal Ferreira cut Mark Bridger's face and arm with a shiv .

Lousiana sheriffs revealed Monday that the pastor shot dead while singing to a service was accused of rape by his confessed shooter's wife. Just two days before Pastor Ronald J. Harris Sr., 53, was killed while singing to a revival crowd of more than 65, former deacon Woodrow Karey's wife filed sexual assault charges against the pastor. Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso said the charges were still being investigated Friday when the 'Karey walked into the Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center, and shot Harris at close range' before turning himself in minutes later. Bizarre shooting death: Ex-deacon Woodrow Karey (left) shot pastor Ronald Harris Sr (right) to death Friday night while the preacher was singing in front of about 65 church members at a revival. It was revealed Monday that Karey's wife filed charges against Harris two days before the murder. Mancuso says the woman and preacher had exchanged text messages, and it's not yet clear whether a sexual assault took place. Harris was preaching at about 8:20 pm on Friday when he was shot . twice by the former deacon and fell to the floor. Harris was pronounced dead at the scene. Sixty-five people were inside at the time, including the victim's wife, said Chief Deputy Stitch Guillory. 53-year-old Karey left the church four years ago, according to Mr Harris' daughter Talisha Harris, who added that her family is 'puzzled' by his motives. He was booked on a second-degree murder charge and remained jailed Sunday, his bond set at $1 million. The preaching had not yet begun Friday night when the gunman burst into the sanctuary. The congregation of 65 people or more was waiting for some out-of-town visitors, Harris said. Confessed: Pastor Ronald J. Harris Sr. was preaching at about 8:20 pm on Friday at Tabernacle of Praise Worship Center when he was shot twice by a lone gunman. Soon after, Karey turned himself in . Her father was singing. So was she, as a member of the five-person praise group that accompanied him. Then, . she said, the woman who had been handing out visitor packets at the . front door ran in, shouting, ‘He got a gun! He got a gun! He got a gun!’ ‘He . came in down the middle aisle. He shot at my daddy’ but hit a flower . pot, Harris said. ‘My daddy ran. He shot him in the back. When he fell, . he came closer and shot him again.’ The gunman ran out a side door, she said. After . officials arrested Karey a block from the church, he told them where to . find two guns in a nearby wooded area - one was a shotgun, the other a . .22-caliber pistol. Karey has no history of mental illness or criminal activity. Harris said her father always made time for his own children, and acted as a father to many other children. ‘The people in our church, he'd treat them as if they were family,’ she said. Harris said that forgiveness and love wouldn’t be her father’s only message to his killer. ‘He'd say, ""Come to church. And let God visit (your) mind.""' Family members who answered the telephone Saturday at the Harris home in Lake Charles said there would be no comment.

"By . Press Association . PUBLISHED: . 15:47 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:57 EST, 2 October 2013 . A motorcyclist was today charged with reckless driving after prosecutors said he sparked a tense encounter with the driver of an SUV and a throng of other bikers that ended with blood and broken bones on a Manhattan street. Christopher Cruz, 28, of Passaic, New Jersey, declined to comment as he was released on $1,500 bail, facing misdemeanor charges that also include unlawful imprisonment. His attorney, H. Benjamin Perez, said his client denied all the allegations. 'He will come back to fight this case and clear his name,' he said. Accused: Christopher Cruz, 28, appears in Manhattan Criminal Court after he allegedly sparked a row between a Range Rover driver and a group of bikers on Sunday with his reckless driving . Arrest: Cruz appears in criminal court with his lawyer H. Benjamin Perez in New York on Wednesday . Cruz is the only person charged criminally so far in the Sunday encounter that was caught on a helmet-mounted camera worn by another biker and was posted online anonymously. The Manhattan district attorney's office decided not immediately to prosecute a second person arrested, Allen Edwards, 42, who surrendered to police on Tuesday. But prosecutors said the investigation continues, and they served notice that they intend to take the case against Cruz to a grand jury - a sign that more serious charges are likely. Karen Friedman-Agnifilo, the prosecutor overseeing the DA's investigation, said authorities were trying to build the strongest cases possible. Out: Cruz exits Manhattan Criminal Court with his girlfriend after posting bail on Wednesday . Arrest: Christopher Cruz is pictured (in white) before he was rear-ended by Range Rover driver Alexian Lien on Sunday - which sparked a massive chase. Cruz has been arrested for reckless driving . 'Prematurely charging individuals with low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation, and could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of serious crimes,' she said. Prosecutors and police said Cruz was participating in a motorcycle rally speeding along Manhattan's West Side Highway. Cruz cut in front of a black Range Rover and, still staring at its driver, slowed down so much that the rear tire of his motorcycle bumped the front of the SUV, they said. He got off and approached the SUV, prosecutors said. Video captured the moment as about two dozen riders slowed down, swarming the SUV and blocking its path. Some dismounted and approached the vehicle. Police said some of the bikers then began damaging the Range Rover. The SUV driver, who police say was frightened for his family in the car, suddenly lurched forward, plowing over another rider before heading north. The cyclists gave chase, pursuing the driver for about 2.5 miles. 'Victim': Edwin Mieses Jr, 26, from Massachusetts was hit by a Range Rover as it tried to escape a group of bikers. But Mieses' family has said that he was simply trying to help another biker who was hurt . Fears: Mieses, pictured left and right with his wife Dayana, will not walk again, his family has said . On . camera: This shows the moment the Range Rover driver panicked and hit . some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and . child. It is believed he hit Jeremiah Mieses here . The chase ended when the SUV exited the highway and got stuck in street traffic. The video showed one biker smashing the driver's window with his helmet. Police said the group then pulled the man from the SUV and beat him, although that part isn't shown on the video. The police department confirmed that the video is authentic. The SUV driver, Alexian Lien, 33, was taken to a hospital for stitches for his face. His wife and 2-year-old were not injured. A call to his home wasn't returned Wednesday. Cruz's attorney said his client wasn't involved in the beating. Cruz has previous arrests in New Jersey, including a theft case in which he pleaded guilty, according to Manhattan prosecutors. Court records concerning the New Jersey case weren't immediately available. 'The bottom line is that my client had nothing to do with what happened to this gentleman' and doesn't know the people who attacked the driver, Perez said. 'He never left the location of the accident, and he at no time ever assaulted this man - or his vehicle, for that matter.' Fears: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . Smashed: When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet . The biker who was struck as the SUV fled, Edwin Mieses Jr., remained hospitalized Wednesday. His legs were broken and he has spine injuries that will leave him paralyzed, his wife said. She said her husband, who goes by Jay, is the victim, not the driver of the SUV. 'Everyone wants to blame the bikers for something this man did,' Dayana Mieses said. At least one other biker was injured. Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the motorcyclists were participating in a periodic rally in which more than 1,000 bikers head for Times Square. He said police were caught by surprise by the unpermitted event last year but were aware it was taking place this year and 'did a fair amount of enforcement' to break up the procession. There were 15 other arrests and 55 motorcycles confiscated, Kelly said.","Christopher Cruz was released on bail after being charged with reckless driving, among others, for 'starting the scrap in NYC on Sunday'

The Pope has accused many of his predecessors of being 'narcissists' who have let themselves be flattered by 'courtier' aides. Reformist church leader Francis promised to do everything in his power to change the Vatican's mentality, saying that the Holy See had been too focused on his own interests. Refusing to mince his words, the 76-year-old's remarks were the latest volley in his assault on Catholic tradition, which has included stiff criticism of its obsession with sexual morality. Reformist: Pope Francis has accused many of his predecessors of being 'narcissists' who have let themselves be flattered by 'courtier' aides, as he continued his assault on Vatican traditions now seen as outdated . 'The [papal] court is the leprosy of the papacy,' said Francis in a long interview with the atheist editor of Italy's left-leaning La Repubblica newspaper. It was published today as he began a private, three-day meeting with eight cardinals from around the world to help him reform Vatican administration, known as the Curia. There are some 'courtiers' among the Curia's administrators, he said, but its main defect is that it is too inward-looking. 'It looks after the interests of the Vatican, which are still, in large part temporal interests. This Vatican-centric vision neglects the world around it and I will do everything to change it,' he said. Francis said the eight cardinals he had chosen to make up his advisory board did not have selfish motives. 'They are not courtiers but wise people who are inspired by my same feelings. This is the start of a Church with an organisation that is not only vertical but also horizontal,' he said. 'Wise people': Pope Francis poses meets with his so-called 'Group of Eight' cardinals, during their first of three days of meetings at the Vatican today to help him reform Vatican administration, known as the Curia . But Francis stayed away from themes of sexual morality, on which he has signalled a dramatic about turn in Catholic doctrine. He last month declared in an interview with Jesuit journals that the Catholic Church must shake off an obsession with teachings on abortion, contraception and homosexuality and become more merciful. Francis, who is credited with bringing a new style of openness, consultation and simplicity to the papacy, also today revealed that he considered rejecting his election as the first non-European pope in 1,300 years. He was selected by his fellow cardinals to be the 266th pope after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI.

He told how on the night fellow cardinals elected him in the Sistine Chapel on March 13, before formally accepting, he had asked to go to an adjoining room to be alone. 'My head was completely empty and a great anxiety came over me. To make it go away and relax I closed my eyes and every thought went away, even that of not accepting, which the liturgical procedures permitted,' he said. Speaking of his personal faith, Francis said: 'A Catholic God does not exist... 'I believe in Jesus Christ, his incarnation. Jesus is my master and my pastor, but God, the father ... is the light and the creator. This is my being.'","Argentine pope promises to reform Vatican's inward-looking mentality .

Built between 1883 and 1885, the twelve-story red-brick building was one of New York's first private apartment cooperatives. Among its distinctive features were the delicate, flower-ornamented iron balconies on its facade, and its grand staircase, which extended twelve floors up. The building was a designated New York City landmark since 1966, and joined the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. As of August 1, 2011 the hotel stopped taking reservations for guests in order to begin renovations, but long-time residents remain, some of them protected by state rent regulations. The renovations prompted complaints by the remaining tenants of health hazards caused by the construction. These were investigated by the city's Building Department, which found no major violations. In November 2011, the management ordered all of the hotel's many artworks taken off the walls, supposedly for their protection and cataloging, a move which some tenants interpreted as a step towards forcing them out as well.

Smiling on the outside: Hannah Anderson has been regularly posting to her Instagram account since she was rescued on August 10 after her family friend Jim DiMaggio kidnapped her and killed her mother and brother . Memories: Hannah Anderson has posted pictures of her family on Instagram following her ordeal where her young brother and mother (right) were killed . She began answering questions from friends and strangers on social media site Ask.fm, and in some remarks the strain of the continued interest in the case is beginning to show. When one woman asked Anderson why did she 'never run' away from her captor James DiMaggio- saying that 'he never have you handcuff or anything- Anderson snapped back. 'How do you know he never had me handcuffed? Because there you are wrong. Don't assume things you don't know. Just stop,' she wrote. In another, a user accused her father of 'mooching off other people' and she responded: 'Why don't you shut the f*** up and get the facts right. He's trying a******. Why don't you get a life instead harassing people? (sic)' Much loved: The teenage girl has posted many pictures of her late brother and mom who were killed by a family friend . Remembering the other victims: Hannah regularly posts old pictures of her mother Christina and brother Ethan, both of whom were killed by her captor before he fled with her to Idaho . Signs of trouble: She regularly posts inspirational messages hinting at her inner anguish . Though her re-emergence on Ask.fm came only four days ago, Anderson has been an active user on Instagram, regularly posting smiling selfies with friends to her nearly 9,000 followers. There have been hints of emotional struggles, however, as she regularly posts old pictures of her mother Tina and brother Ethan, both of whom were tied, beaten and their bodies burnt. 'Just because i am strong enough to handle PAIN doesn't mean i deserve it [sic],' read one recent post. Some of that pain is self-inflicted, as she admitted to reading the autopsy report about the deaths where the medical examiner detailed the way in which they were beaten before DiMaggio set the house on fire and drove off with Hannah. She said that 'I need to know what happened to them'. The question-and-answer style social media site is popular among teens but it has been gaining a larger audience as it has been cited in a number of cases of bullying that have resulted in suicides. Happier moments: Anderson shared these pictures of herself and her boyfriend at their homecoming dance . Grieving: Hannah posted this picture with her brother Ethan and this message: 'Can't get you off my mind tonight. Miss you so much. I just wanna see you so bad. It's not the same and it never will be. I love you with all my heart' Anderson's conversation shows that she is a target for such internet trolls as well, with a number taking issue with the smiling, cheery photos that she has posted in the days and weeks following the family tragedy. Another told her to 'stop editing your pics, it's not a good looks for you'. Dead: FBI agents shot and killed Jim DiMaggio after they discovered him with Hannah in Idaho days after kidnapping her from California . 'Sad that you don't even know me and run your mouth but I give you props for having balls to talk s*** over ask lol,' she responded. Another talking point was the optics of how she walked into the memorial fundraiser for her mother and brother wearing short jean shorts and holding a cup from Starbucks. 'My friend randomly showed up with Starbucks and I guess she got me one,' Anderson wrote in one post, and continued by saying in another: 'Yeah it's stupid what was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me? People just find the littlest reasons to bash on me (sic).' Her social media presence shows that in spite of days where she says it ‘just doesn’t feel real’, there have been some more light-hearted moments in her life of late. Anderson attended her school’s . homecoming dance in an embellished pink dress, and posted pictures of . herself kissing her new boyfriend that she started dating a month ago. Those . moments of teenage milestones hide the apparent pain that she continues . to go through, she says that she regularly breaks down in the evenings . and uses her happiness during the day as a way to project a better . image. Adored: Hannah posted these pictures of her little brother Ethan with the words 'miss you' and 'my angel' Watching her back: Anderson has faced critics online and at school, as many have raised questions about her behavior in the days and weeks following her return . Timing: Anderson said that the reason she had Starbucks at her mother and brother's funeral was because a friend got it for her. 'What was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me?' ‘I break down all the time. I don’t like crying I front of people [sic]. I’m the type of person that makes sure everyone else’s feelings are ohkay [sic] before I take care of mine. Sorry I don’t take pics of me crying? That makes me a bad person I guess,’ she wrote on Ask.fm. DiMaggio was killed by the agents when they found he and Anderson in the woods of Idaho. He has been ruled as the sole suspect but questions arose when investigators found correspondence between he and the teen prior to the kidnapping. San Diego Sheriff Bill Gore reiterated that in spite of the unexpected evidence, Anderson is ‘a victim in every sense of the word’. Hannah Anderson posted this tribute for an event for her late mother on her Instagram account, hitting back at critics who have attacked her 'odd behavior' Harrowing ordeal: Miss Anderson has been forced to defend herself, often posting inspirational messages, after she was attacked by Internet trolls .","Hannah Anderson, 16, was kidnapped by family friend Jim DiMaggio in August after he tied up her mother and brother and killed them .

A family of six are living in a tent at the bottom of a friend's garden after being refused a council house because they would not abandon their pets. Lorraine Botton, 54, and her five children moved from East Sussex to Kent with the promise of a new home, but got in a row over their four dogs and three budgies. They claim they were told to give them away if they wanted a council property, so turned the house down.

Home: The Bottons say they were promised a new council house but have ended up in this garden because of a row over pets . For the last six weeks the family have been camping in a friend's garden and cooking on a portable stove. Lorraine is squeezed inside the 12ft by 10ft tent - designed to sleep four - with children Moses, 18, Caleb, 19, Genty, 22, Louise, 26, and Naomi, 36 - as well as their pets. It has two sleeping compartment designed for two adults in each and a central communal area. They've managed to find room for some home comforts including a TV, fridge, tumble dryer, iron, an electric heater and lamps. But they have no running water and are relying on their friends for their toilet, washing and laundry facilities. Upset: While they have home comforts including a TV, fridge, tumble dryer, iron, an electric heater and lamps in their tent, it is not the house they wanted . Food: The six adults have been cooking off gas outside for the past six weeks as winter approaches . Housing chiefs in Maidstone, Kent have warned Lorraine it could be Christmas before a property which allows pets becomes available. Argument: The family say they may be waiting until next Christmas for a home and fear they may 'freeze to death' But she still refuses to get rid of her precious pets and said she would squat if nothing is found before winter. She said: 'I feel scared that someone will unzip the tent and hurt us, or even murder us. 'We need a property as soon as possible so we are safe. I just want to be able to lock my front door. 'If we don't get a house soon, we will have to squat. 'I've been told there might not be anything available until Christmas, and we can't wait that long. We'll freeze to death. 'The tent leaks and it is cold. I have to go outside with a little cooker to make food, often in the rain. 'That is not right. I shouldn't have to beg people for baths or to do my washing.' Lorraine, who suffers from epilepsy and arthritis, claims she was hounded out of their last home in Hastings, East Sussex. She and her family stayed in a B&B for two years before moving to Maidstone in August to be closer to relatives. A Maidstone Borough Council spokesman said he could not comment on specific housing applications but admitted there was a 'limited supply' of social housing. He said: 'We have a responsibility to provide families in priority housing need with emergency accommodation, and whilst they are in temporary accommodation to assess their need.

An estate agent is accused of raiding $500,000 worth of possessions from a $7.6million house he'd just sold to a New York socialite. Gallery owner Tina Kim and her husband Jae Chung bought their home in West 81st Street, New York City, with the help of realtor David Kim last December. But the family never changed the locks on the doors, allowing the 42-year-old to allegedly let himself in and empty the property of their belongings. Art lover: Tina Kim's gallery is on the third floor of this building on New York City's West 25th Street. The socialite's family home was allegedly emptied by her real-estate agent after she went on holiday in the Hamptons . Ms Kim and her husband, who employ a maid, nanny and personal driver, were relieved of possessions including rare artworks, high-end fashion accessories and credit cards. A police source told the New York Post that Kim, who is no relation to Ms Kim, 'decorated his apartment by framing the artwork on his walls.' The suspect, who was arrested last week, is said to have stolen almost everything from the victims' home, 'even humidifiers, cigar boxes and all the woman's purses', including one worth $90,000. Kim knew the family was leaving New . York City for the Hamptons on August 16 and crept into their town house . through the service entrance, police sources said. High fashion: Pricey Louis Vuitton accessories were said to be among the possessions Kim helped himself to from his client's family home . Over three consecutive days he is said to have taken away possessions including Louis Vuitton accessories, a Gucci wallet, a crystal pen, electronics and artwork, storing the haul at his apartment in the same block. Court records claim that on seven occasions he also used one of the victim's credit cards to make $50,000-worth of purchases in various shops. The family called police after returning home on August 19 to find their home plundered. Officers are said to have recovered the stolen property from David Kim's apartment. Lance Fletcher, the suspect's private attorney, said: 'There’s been no evidence linking him to the apartment where the burglary occurred except for the alleged proceeds from the burglary.' Ms Kim has run the Tina Kim Gallery in Chelsea since 2007, after first setting up in Manhattan's 57th Street five years earlier. She has said that if she was not an art dealer 'I would probably be on the other side, as an art collector.'","Art dealer Tina Kim's home was raided while she was in the Hamptons .

Little did they know when this sheet of paper was signed off that the worst case scenario would come true just 15 days later. The original insurance certificate covering the ‘total loss’ of the Titanic for $5million (£3.1million) was revealed today, showing the cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sank in April 1912. And a handwritten amendment at the foot of the policy suggested the ship’s owners only insured the vessel for her sea trials and delivery journey from Belfast to Southampton as an afterthought. Document: The original insurance certificate covering the 'total loss' of the Titanic for $5million (£3.1million) was revealed today, showing the cover was taken out two weeks before the ship sunk in April 1912 . The trials were due to take place in March but were delayed, possibly because she was not insured. The document states: ‘This policy is subject to total loss or constructive total loss of the vessel.’ The Titanic’s parent company, the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, received the full insurance payout within 30 days of the disaster in the Atlantic Ocean that saw 1,512 lives lost. According to the Atlantic Mutual Insurance Company policy, the firm had to pay an excess of $500,000 ($310,000). The policy was arranged through brokers Willis Faber which assembled a consortium of insurers that each took a share of the risk. Certificate: The document is being sold at auction in Devizes, Wiltshire, with a pre-sale estimate of £15,000 . One of the largest of the 77 partners was Atlantic Mutual, which paid out $100,000 (£62,000) of the claim. 'To our knowledge, it is without equal. It is an unremarkable piece of A4 paper but it holds the key to $5million' Andrew Aldridge, auctioneer . Atlantic Mutual went bust in 2011 . following massive insurance pay outs in the wake of the 9/11 bombings in . New York City and Washington D.C. Interesting and historic documents from its archives were put into an exhibition in New York last year which is when the Titanic ledger was purchased by a dealer. He is now selling it at auction in Devizes, Wiltshire, on October 19 with a pre-sale estimate of £15,000. Fateful journey: The Titanic leaves from Southampton on her maiden voyage on April 10, 1912. During the voyage, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank off Newfoundland . Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry . Aldridge and Son, said: ‘This is the one and only document that exists . today relating to the insurance for Titanic. Claims for the Titanic totalled £16million - the equivalent of £1.7billion in today's money. The life insurance policy payout to the wife of John Thayer, a prominent businessman from Philadelphia, who drowned in the disaster, was the largest of its time - at £31,000. Strangely, his wife died on the same day as when the ship went down - 32 years later on April 15, 1944. William Carter, who survived, claimed £3,100 for his Renault vehicle that sank with the ship. This became the first ever claim for a car damaged in a collision with an iceberg. White Star Line paid out around £2.5million to Titanic claimants - £2.2million to British claimants and £400,000 to Americans. However, people in the US originally filed claims totalling £10million - so only a fraction of this was eventually paid out. ‘To . our knowledge, it is without equal as we have been unable to locate any . other such documents. It is an unremarkable piece of A4 paper but it . holds the key to $5million. ‘Looking . back, the words “total loss” seem slightly prophetic, given just how . soon after the policy was taken out that the ship was lost. ‘It is quite extraordinary that the owners of Titanic received the payout within a month of the disaster, barely after the funerals of the victims had taken place. Today that process would take months if not years.’ Those who either drowned or froze to death in the Titanic disaster died mainly because there were not enough lifeboats on the ship and those that were used were half-empty. The crew of the ship had also failed to heed warnings of ice in the North Atlantic and were sailing at speed through an ice field when it struck the huge iceberg. Mr Aldridge said: ‘While the Titanic’s owners were swiftly recompensed, the families of victims who sued for negligence had to wait four years for compensation and even that that totalled $663,000. ‘If the disaster happened today the owners would very likely be charged with criminal manslaughter and have to pay out millions and millions of pounds in compensation.’","Original insurance certificate covered 'total loss' of Titanic for $5m (£3.1m)

A mother has spoken of her shock after she gave birth to a baby with two fully formed front teeth. Vicki Griffiths had planned to breastfeed little Eva Faith but changed her mind after seeing the newborn’s teeth. Eva astounded nurses and midwives as well as her family when she was born weighing 7lbs 4oz at the James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. Eva Faith was born on September 8 with two front teeth in her lower gum. Her mother, Vicki Griffiths, 26, said she had been planning to breastfeed but that she changed her mind when she saw the teeth . Initially, nobody realised and it was only when Mrs Griffiths went to have a bath after giving birth that her husband Steven spotted the teeth in his daughter’s lower jaw. Mrs Griffiths, a 26-year-old child minder, said: ‘When I came back into the room Steven said, “she’s got teeth, you know!” and then we both burst out laughing. ‘We were in shock, and so were the midwives. ‘She had her mouth closed to begin with, so we didn’t notice. It was quite bizarre to see them.’ She added: ‘I had been planning to breastfeed, but when I saw Eva’s teeth I was put off. I don’t think anybody could blame me!’ Mr and Mrs Griffiths now worry that Eva will soon start sprouting more teeth before she is old enough to have Calpol or other children’s medicine. Jonathan Wyllie, consultant neonatologist at James Cook, said: 'It probably happens about three times every two years here and we deliver 4,000 babies a year. It's every 2,000 to 3,000 births' Mr and Mrs Griffiths (pictured) are worried that Eva will grow more teeth before she is old enough to be given any pain relief . The mother-of-three said: ‘I kept asking the midwives and nurses what I could give Eva if she was in pain, but nobody was able to answer me. ‘They just kept going away and then coming back with more people to look at Eva’s teeth. Nobody could believe it. ‘When we came out of hospital I went to see my GP and he said that he had never heard of this happening before. ‘Midwives with 25-years’ experience were also saying they’d never seen it.’ Little . Eva Faith was born on September 8 and is now at home with her parents . and older sisters Elizabeth, seven, and Emily, five, in Redcar, . Cleveland. At first Mrs Griffiths thought the teeth . would have to be removed in case Eva were to choke on them, but she was . checked over by a paediatrician who said they were stable enough not to . present a problem. Mrs Griffiths said: 'I had been planning to breastfeed, but when I saw Eva's teeth I was put off. I don't think anybody could blame me!' Eva is now thriving on bottled milk and delighting all that meet her with her unusual feature. Mrs Griffiths added: ‘Eva often has her mouth open, especially after she has woken up. ‘A professional baby photographer came round to take some pictures, and she simply could not believe it. Everyone thinks Eva is lovely, but can’t get over her teeth.’ Jonathan Wyllie, consultant neonatologist at James Cook, said: ‘It probably happens about three times every two years here and we deliver 4,000 babies a year. It’s every 2,000 to 3,000 births. ‘Babies are born with one or two teeth and it’s usually in the lower gum.’ Teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth. They occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies. They usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure meaning they are often wobbly. They are not usually well formed but can injure the baby's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain. Natal teeth are often removed shortly after a baby is born because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them. These teeth are not usually associated with any other medical problems. There is no known explanation for them other than that a child is more dentally developed.","Vicki Griffiths, 26, gave birth to 7lbs 4oz Eva Faith on September 8 .

A judge has ruled that there is enough evidence to send a Salt Lake City pediatrician to trial for the murder of his ex-wife. Following two days of testimony, Utah Third District Court Judge Robin Reese made the decision today that John Brickman Wall, 49, will stand trial for the 2011 murder of Uta von Schwedler. The state medical examiner ruled that von Schwedler, 49, died from drowning as well as fatal amount of Xanax, and said this week he could not determine whether her death was a homicide or suicide, but could be certain that it was not accidental. Respected doctor: John Brickman Wall appeared withdrawn as he entered court for his preliminary hearing in the case of his ex-wife's death . Horror: Uta von Schwedler, a mother of four, was found dead in her bathtub in September 2011 with a knife under her body and blood splattered nearby . Police called the death suspicious . when it occurred in September 2011 but no charges were filed against . Wall until April of this year. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said there wasn’t one single piece of evidence that finally led to the charges. Instead, . he said, a combination of factors played a role, including DNA evidence . under the victim’s fingernails that didn’t rule out Wall; the fact that . von Schwedler died in part due to an overdose of Xanax but didn’t have a . prescription and was not depressed; and Wall’s inability to explain his . whereabouts the night of her death. Trial: Brickman Wall will face first-degree felony counts of murder and aggravated burglary in connection with the October 2011 death of his ex-wife, Uta Von Schwedler . The body of Uta von Schwedler, 49, was discovered in an overflowing bathtub in her home on 27 September 2011. A knife was found under her body, and she had cuts and abrasions not consistent with suicide. Police said there was evidence of a struggle, and that the crime scene looked posed. An . autopsy revealed von Schwedler also had a large amount of Xanax in her . system at the time of her death - a drug she was not known to take and . for which she did not have a prescription. According . to the Deseret News, the prosecution told the court that Wall did have a . prescription for Xanax, and that he also made out a prescription for . his mother for a large dose of the drug, which was filled shortly before von . Schwedler's death. Both . the prosecution and the defense had myriad theories as to how the drugs . came to be in von Schwedler's system, including the possibility that . Wall injected Von Schwedler with the drug, and that he used his skills . as a doctor to persuade her to take it. The . prosecution told the court that all evidence points towards Wall being . in the house at the time of his ex-wife's death, and that the doctor . had a motive. Police found blood stains and overturned objects in the victim’s bedroom. The . back door had been unlocked, prosecutors say, and a key was missing from . its hiding place. In addition, a family friend told police John Wall was driving in the area at about 7am on the day of the killing. Charging documents indicate police interviewed about 30 people while investigating the killing. Wall will return to court on October 21 to face first-degree felony charges of murder and aggravated burglary and is expected to plead not guilty. Beloved: von Schwedler was a brilliant scientist who specialized in DNA and HIV research . Wall and von Schwedler had been involved in a bitter custody . battle over their four children after divorcing in 2006. Their son, Pelle Wall, 19, testified at a custody . hearing that he was so afraid of his father when he was living with him . that he slept with a pellet gun and a knife. Following . an interview with police, the documents state, John Wall told a friend, . 'Only a monster would do what was done to Uta. If it was me, I don’t . remember.' Today judge Robin Reese supported his decision to send Wall to trial, saying that Wall had developed a deep anger and hatred for his ex-wife over a long period of time. The judge said that it 'seems unusual [Wall] couldn’t tell police, friends and neighbors that he didn’t kill his ex.'","Dr John Brickman Wall, 49, has been ordered to stand trial for the murder of his ex-wife in 2011 .

A macho father-of-three construction worker who used to secretly wear women's underwear to work has now become a woman. After struggling with his gender his entire life, Sam Bowler finally decided to make the change. Much to the surprise of fellow builders, the lipstick-wearing digger-operator said: 'Call me Samantha.' Thankfully, within a couple of days the construction crew fully accepted their new brunette, bejewelled member of the team. Accepted: Samantha Bowler, 47 works as a digger driver on a building site - she used to be a macho man . Decision time: But after a lifetime struggling with his gender Sam, now Samantha, took the decision to begin living as a woman . Samantha, 47, said: 'I was afraid I’d get a lot of abuse, but the lads on the site have been great. 'They were a bit shocked and left me alone the first day and someone called me ""Sam the Man"" which I can handle. 'But my work mates all became very relaxed and easy about it within a couple of days. 'I feel very comfortable in the site canteen - everyone has been very respectful.' Samantha knew from the age of five that she was different from the other boys in school. Growing up she preferred to play with girls and dolls rather than join in with the boys playing football. Life-long struggle: The father-of-three has been conflicted about her gender from the age of five . She would secretly dress in her mother’s clothes, borrow her make-up and style her hair in the bathroom mirror. But because she was confused and afraid to talk about her feelings she developed a macho male persona. She said: 'I became a loner, isolated . and insecure - I found the best way to cope was to suppress my feelings . by being a man in a man’s world. 'I worked as a computer engineer, then on building sites, I got married and became a father. 'I was divorced when I was 24 but soon married again and had another child. Transition: Samantha suffered from hate crime in her community in the early days of her transition, left. Now she is confident and content in her now female gender and is accepted by her construction co-workers . From the age of five Samantha used to wear her mother's make-up and play with girls' toys . Samantha would secretly wear women's underwear to work in her job as a construction worker . 'I took up karate and gained a black belt - I did weightlifting, I was a family man who loved to be at home. 'I was married for 11 years, I loved my wife but deep down I hated my body. I longed to be someone else, the person I am now.' After a second divorce Sam lived alone and wore women’s clothes and make-up when no one was around. And under her builder’s clobber of jeans . and a jumper she would be wearing women’s underwear on the site: 'It was . not for any sexual reason - I just wanted to be me, feminine.' Struggling with her secret, Samantha tried to be extra macho, taking stereotypical masculine jobs, doing weight training and karate . Samantha had three children with three women - the last partner encouraged her to seek psychiatric help . Samantha later had another . relationship and fathered a third son with a new woman who because of . Sam’s deep depression encouraged her to get the help she so urgently . needed. Samantha was diagnosed with gender . dysphoria - a condition where a person feels there is a mismatch between . their biological sex and their gender identity. Samantha changed her male name by Deed Poll. After four years of hormone therapy, and overcoming hate crime in her local community of Pontypridd, South Wales, Samantha is nearing the end of her gender transition. She continues to work on the building site but one day hopes to switch to a full-time role as a transgender counsellor . She said: 'Before I transitioned I was . aggressive, short-tempered, flippant - I was trying to prove my . masculinity and overplayed it. Samantha says she is a better 'father' now to her children having gone through the gender transition . 'Since I have transitioned I am nothing like that. I am gentle and kind and I think I have the patience of a saint.' Samantha says she is a better father now, especially to her five-year-old who still calls her dad. When she’s not on a building site Samantha acts as a consultant on transgender issues for the government, the police and local authorities. She has recorded educational videos for . many organisations, talking about her life story and telling of some of . the abuse she has endured. Ultimately, she hopes to ditch the building site work and switch to this role full time. She said: 'I am proud of who I am and I’m not going to pretend to be anyone other than me anymore. 'I consider myself unique and very fortunate. 'How many people get to live two lives, I don’t deny my birth gender but I’m happy and proud of who I am now.'","Sam, 47, shocked fellow builders when he said: 'Call me Samantha'

Hamzah Khan's father, Aftab, told police a year before the toddler's death that his son was being neglected. Tapes of the conversation were played at the manslaughter trial of the boy's mother, Amanda Hutton . The devastated father of the four-year-old boy allegedly starved to death by his mother had begged police to check on the child before his death, a court has heard. Tapes were played at the manslaughter trial of tragic Hamazah Khan's mother, Amanda Hutton, of the conversation between Aftab Khan and police in 2008, following his arrest for an assault on Hutton. During the conversation, he repeatedly told officers of his concern for his son and issued a chilling warning to them when he said: 'When it all comes out I will come back and say I told you so... you guys aren't listening.' Hamzah was found dead in his cot in September 2011 and had been there for 21 months. On the tape, he also accused Hutton of being 'bitter and twisted' and an alcoholic. 'Get a doctor to check the kid (Hamzah). I want you to check Hamzah, get a doctor to check him and check how undernourished he is and how neglected he is. 'There's something wrong with that kid.' Asked if he had taken his son to the doctor, Aftab, who said he had been with Hutton 'on and off for 22 years' and who later admitted the assault on her in court, said: 'She will not let me. I've told her time and time again, there's something wrong with him, take him to the doctors. 'I changed his nappy when she'd left him for about a day and a half because of the drink problem.I can't do anything. She's overpowering. Go and live with her and you'll see the big bad story. 'It all boils down to she's an alcoholic she won't listen to anybody. I'll report her to the social services.The authorities can't be bothered. I will get the social services involved, you aren't listening. 'So if anything else happens afterwards you guys know about it. 'This is the problem, authorities, you don't believe the right people. She's a bitter and twisted woman and there's something seriously wrong with her. 'She don't brush her teeth, she don't clean herself, she don't look after herself. She's an alcoholic.' The brother of Hamzah Khan (pictured) has told a jury how he saw the child sleeping in a buggy that stank of urine . He also confirmed police had been called to the house on eight separate occasions in the two-and-a-half years up to 2008. Detective Inspector Ian Lawrie told the court officers visited the home . in Bradford, West Yorks., after the interview. The court is due to hear . evidence from officers in relation to that visit. On trial: Amanda Hutton faces manslaughter charges after her son Hamzah Khan's decomposed body was found at home 21 months after his death . Bradford Crown Court also heard evidence from Hamzah's brother, Qaiser Khan, 22, who said his sibling had 'appeared neglected', and had been sleeping in a cot which 'stank of urine'. He also claimed he had witnessed the child eating the contents of his nappy. Mr Khan told a jury at Bradford Crown Court how he went to the house between December 2008 and March 2009. He said Hamzah slept upright in a urine-soaked buggy that 'stank'. Mr Khan said his brother was left in a dirty nappy and he witnessed him eating the contents. 'Hamzah appeared neglected,' Mr Khan said. He explained to the jury: 'I was only at the house for a couple of days. The buggy smelled so bad of urine I got disinfectant and cleaned it out.' Mr Khan was also asked about a text message sent from his phone to Hutton in December 2008. Paul Greaney QC, prosecuting, said the text said: 'Watch out Monday you b****. I’m going to go to the police station to report you for child neglect and abuse. Look at Hamzah.' Mr Khan said he did not remember sending it. Asked by Stephen Meadowcroft QC, defending, if he was exaggerating what was happening at the house because he had a bad relationship with his mother, Mr Khan said: 'I’ve seen this with my own eyes.' Mr Khan told the court that when he was aged about 13, he was made to drink 'mouldy, off milk' by his mother as punishment. He said his mother would spend her days drinking. 'She would go upstairs and drink and then I wouldn’t see her for most of the day,' he said. Earlier, Mr Khan refused to answer any questions when he first stepped into the witness box. But after a break he returned to court to give his evidence. Qaiser Khan, 22, was giving evidence on the third day of the trial of his mother Amanda Hutton, who denies the manslaughter of her son Hamzah Khan . The prosecution has told the court Hutton starved her son to death. The defendant told police her son died after he was taken ill. Mr Meadowcroft said he was suggesting that Hutton was coping before Hamza’s death. The barrister said: 'The child died tragically and it wasn’t her fault. After that, she collapsed.' Mr Khan said: 'Urined buggy - was that coping? That was before 2009. 'It was quite clear she wasn’t coping. She hadn’t cleaned the house up and she didn’t clean the nappies.' The trial continues.

Technology site, TechCrunch, wanted to test the new Touch ID feature which allows the phone's owner and four other Touch ID profiles to unlock the phone using skin-recognition technology.

Users can 'train' their iPhone to read and learn their unique fingerprint and when they touch the home button, the phone is unlocked. Touch ID can also be replace an App Store password when buying music, apps or books. It uses a 'laser cut sapphire crystal' to take a high-resolution image scan before the Touch ID software in iOS 7 detemines whether the print belongs to the owner or not. All fingerprint information is encrypted and stored securely inside the device's chip. The prints are not stored on an Apple server, or backed up to iCloud. After a few false starts, the cat's . paw was recognised as one of the owner's five chosen keys and was able . to access the phone's content.

Though different parts of the body were able to be registered and then recognised as keys, when trying to fool the phone's software by using the opposite hand than registered access was denied. The experiment pointed out however that no other animals could be used to unlock the phone as cats have unique fingerprint like paws. Another technology site, Pocket-Lint, found Touch ID is not just a fingerprint sensor, but a toe and fingerprint sensor.

A fit and seemingly healthy father-of-three collapsed and died from a sudden cardiac arrest just days after celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary. Graham Richards, 41, died while out running during his lunch break. He had never previously had any problems with his heart and regularly took part in triathlons. Graham Richards (pictured with his daughter, Rosie, nine) collapsed and died of a cardiac arrest while out running. He was 41-years-old and had just celebrated his tenth wedding anniversary with wife, Heather . In August last year, Mr Richards, from Oxfordshire, returned home early from a family holiday in Scotland as he had to go back to work as a software engineer. His wife, Heather Richards, 40, remained in Scotland with their children, Dylan, 11, Rosie, nine, and Felix, seven, for a few more days. The day after Mr Richards returned to work, Mrs Richards received a call from his mother at 4pm to say that she had been contacted by his colleagues because he had not returned from his three mile lunchtime run. Mrs Richards said: ‘Then I had another call to say he was in the hospital. ‘Obviously I was concerned but cardiac arrest was the last thing on my mind, I just thought he would have fallen over and hurt himself or something like that. ‘It was really frustrating and I started to get quite worried because I was finding it so hard to get answers and we were so far away.' When Mr Richards (pictured with his wife) collapsed, a passerby gave him CPR until an ambulance arrived. Paramedics fought to save him but they were unable to restart his heart . Mrs Richards called the hospital repeatedly in an attempt to find out what was going on but no one was able to tell her anything as Mr Richards had not yet been identified. She only learned what had happened after a colleague of his went to the hospital to identify him. She said ‘Then the final call was from a police officer at 7pm. ‘He told me Graham had collapsed and . that despite efforts to revive him he hadn’t made it. My reaction was . just one of total disbelief.’ Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system. It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia. Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning. Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing. In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked. This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert. She told MailOnline: 'I still can't believe that someone with no medical conditions can have a cardiac arrest like that.' When Mr Richards collapsed a bystander tried to save him by administering CPR while an ambulance was called. When paramedics arrived, they fought to keep him alive but they were unable to restart his heart. Mrs Richards said: ‘I didn’t know what to do at first, I just felt completely helpless. ‘We were all still in Scotland, seven hours away from Oxfordshire, so we had to get in the car and come all the way back knowing that. ‘I didn’t know whether to tell the children first or wait until we got to the hospital, it was just horrendous.’ Mrs Richards added: ‘Graham had never had any problems with his heart and he was such a fit man. ‘He always used to joke about how he never needed to go to the doctor. ‘He used to take part in triathlons - he really was the last person you would have expected this to happen to.' After Mr Richards' death, a post-mortem examination revealed that he had died of a cardiac arrest - he had no undiagnosed heart defect. Since Mr Richards’ death, Mrs Richards has campaigned to have a defibrillator fitted in the family’s home village of Blewbury, in Oxfordshire. A defibrillator does not guarantee . the survival of a person who has gone into cardiac arrest but it . increases their chance of survival from nine per cent to 50 per cent if . it is used within four minutes of the cardiac arrest occurring. After four minutes, the person will have suffered brain damage caused by oxygen starvation. A post-mortem examination revealed that Mr Richards (pictured with his children Felix, left, Rosie, centre, and Dylan, right) died of a cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating as a result of a malfunction in its electrical system . The machine is fully automated meaning that no training is required to operate it - once the 'start' button is pressed, the machine talks the user through what to do. It measures the patient's heart rhythm before administering a shock and will not shock them if their heart rhythm is normal. It is placed in a publicly accessible cabinet which can be opened with a key code - this code can be given out by 999 call handlers. Mrs Richards has raised the money as part of the Arrhythmia Alliance’s Hearts and Goals campaign which is fronted by Fabrice Muamba, the Bolton Wanderers footballer who suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch last year. Mrs Richards said: ‘The defibrillator is a legacy for Graham. He was the kind of person who always got involved in good causes and would have liked the idea that he could make a difference. Mr Richards' children (pictured) and wife have raised enough money to have a defibrillator placed in their village in Oxfordshire. They are now campaigning for them to be distributed more widely . ‘I suppose there will always be that doubt that a defibrillator could have saved Graham but we will never know for sure. ‘These devices do increase the chance of someone surviving so dramatically that we wanted to make sure our village was protected in his name. ‘We hope it never needs to be used but if it ever did it could save somebody’s life. An automated external defibrillator (AED) is a life-saving device for use in the event of a cardiac arrest. It is a portable device that analyses heart rhythm and administers an electrical charge to the heart if needed. The user does not need to have any training as the AED will give spoken instructions when it is activated. It will tell the user to connect the pads to the patient's bare chest. The device will then measure the patient's heart rhythm and will charge in preparation to deliver a shock if necessary. It will then instruct the user to ensure no one is touching the patient and to press a button to deliver the shock. Once this has been done, it will instruct the user to give CPR for two minutes after which it will analyse the patient's heart rhythm again before advising on whether to give a further shock or more CPR. Using a defibrillator increases a cardiac arrest patient's chance of survival from about nine per cent to 50 per cent. ‘It has provided a real focus for the . children as well. It means they can remember their father in a positive . way and his name is attached with something positive and allows us to . try to move on as a family. ‘I can’t think of a better tribute for Graham.’ Trudie Lobban MBE, Founder and CEO of Arrhythmia Alliance, said: ‘To see people take the lead on this is great - it provides a superb example to other communities. ‘Because Heather and the rest of the village know only too well the consequences of sudden cardiac they have pursued this with great enthusiasm. ‘That is clear to see in the energy and commitment they have shown in pulling the project together so quickly. ‘They have turned a terrible tragedy into something positive. ‘Automated external defibrillators dramatically increase the chance of a person surviving in the event of them suffering a sudden cardiac arrest. ‘Sudden cardiac arrest can strike anyone at any time and is the UK's biggest killer, causing 100,000 deaths every year. Every community should have public-access AEDs available 24/7 ready in cases of emergency. ‘Blewbury is now a safer place thanks to the work of Heather and all of those who helped bring this together. I cannot think of a better legacy for Graham.’ For more information about the Hearts and Goals campaign, visit www.heartsandgoals.org .

When Kristina told Mr Cepulionis he smelled and suggested he take a shower, a furious row erupted, the Old Bailey heard. Zinkevicius showed no emotion in the dock as a jury of eight women and four men unanimously found him guilty of murder. Judge Wendy Joseph QC adjourned sentencing until next Friday. She told him: ‘It is proscribed by law that the sentence is life imprisonment.’ Zinkevicius was convicted in February 2011 for affray after stamping on a homeless man at the Whitechapel Mission.

Charged: Stanley Dishon, pictured, was indicted on Wednesday in connection with the death of his niece Jessica Dishon, who was last seen on September 10, 1999 at the family's Shepherdsville home as she got ready for school . A 55-year-old Kentucky man has been charged with kidnapping and murdering his 17-year-old niece 14 years ago. Stanley Dishon was indicted on Wednesday in connection with the death of Jessica Dishon, who was last seen on September 10, 1999 at the family's Shepherdsville home as she got ready for school. Her body was found beaten and strangled 17 days later in a dumping ground known as the Salt River bottoms, about seven miles from her home. Bullitt County Sheriff David Greenwell, who was first on the scene 14 years ago, broke down in tears at a press conference as he claimed the cold case had finally been solved. He said the investigation into Jessica's slaying was reopened six months ago based on strong tips but he refused to outline the new evidence pointing to Dishon. However, he said he was confident indictment would stick and hoped the charges would bring closure to Jessica's family and the community, which was rocked by the tragedy. Dishon had been serving a state sentence on sexual assault charges when he was moved to Bullitt County jail on new sex charges recently, authorities said. The sheriff's office had identified the Dishon family's nextdoor neighbor David 'Bucky' Brooks as the prime suspect and arrested him January 18, 2001.

He was freed more than two years later after a judge declared a mistrial -- because a detective testified that Brooks had failed a lie-detector test, which is not admissible. The charges were dismissed. Greenwell said on Wednesday he is confident the Brooks family had nothing to do with crime and that Dishon acted alone. 'As far as I'm concerned we have indicted the right person,' Greenwell said. He said Dishon has been cooperating with police. Cold case: The investigation into Jessica's slaying was reopened six months ago based on strong tips . According to Brooks' former attorney, John Spainhour, Stanley Dishon had been a person of interest in the case, but investigators chose to look at people who they thought were more involved. Dishon occasionally lived with Jessica Dishon and her father Mike, who is his brother, before the murder, Spainhour told the Courier-Journal. On Wednesday, Jessica's brother Michael Dishon, 27, wouldn't comment on the charges saying simply, 'We don't care who did it. We just want that person to be brought to justice.'","Kentucky man, Stanley Dishon, was indicted on Wednesday on murder and kidnap charges in the death of Jessica Dishon, who disappeared in 1999 .

Court: Junior doctor Suhail Ahmed sexually assaulted and secretly photographed female patients during intimate examinations . A junior doctor sexually assaulted and secretly photographed female patients during intimate examinations. Suhail Ahmed, 28, touched the women, all in their 20s, as he removed their clothing in order to get a better view of their bodies for his mobile phone camera. Ahmed, who worked at Torbay Hospital in Devon, was today jailed for 18 months. Exeter Crown Court heard Ahmed would section his victims' beds off from the rest of the ward so he was alone with them. Ahmed, of Cyncoed Road in Cardiff, then carried out intimate examinations claiming his mobile phone was being used to time their heart rate. The court was told some of his patients were in extreme pain or recovering from surgery at the time of his attacks, which were carried out between March and June last year. He was suspended by the hospital after he was caught when two women separately made complaints. A subsequent police investigation uncovered 110 images of patients at the hospital in 'various stages of undress' uploaded onto his computer from his phone camera. Footage from a secret camera Ahmed hid in a property owned by his family was also discovered. Ahmed later pleaded guilty to 11 counts of voyeurism and two counts of sexual assault by touching. Judge Francis Gilbert QC jailed Ahmed for 18 months and ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for the 'very serious offences'. 'You asked female patients in their 20s to remove more clothing than was necessary for examination purposes and on two occasions you touched them,' the judge said. 'You then used your mobile phone during examinations to photograph those patients. You said you were using your phone to time their breathing or their heart rate. 'Your victims describe their distress at what you did and the continued effect it has had upon them. A doctor is trusted not only by his patients but also by his employers.' Exeter Crown Court heard the offences took place when Ahmed was working as a trainee surgeon. Prosecuting, David Bowen said: 'The defendant from time to time used to examine female patients.' 'All of the victims are female and in their 20s. The defendant took photographs with his mobile phone of the unclothed and uncovered parts of his female patients.' Hospital: Ahmed, who worked at Torbay Hospital in Devon, (pictured) was today jailed for 18 months . Mr Bowen said Ahmed also performed 'perfectly appropriate' medical procedures on his patients. Footage from a secret camera - also . believed to have been taken last year - hidden in a property owned by . Ahmed's family was also found. It showed young women using the bathroom. 'These files included sound and the victims have not been identified,' Mr Bowen said. Ahmed initially denied any wrongdoing but later admitted the offences in police interview. Mr Bowen said his victims had been left devastated by their ordeal, with one left unable to leave her house. Defending, David Martin insisted the photographs had not been distributed or shown to anyone. 'Here is an individual who has in every way ruined his career,' Mr Martin said.

Former Major League Baseball player Chad Curtis is facing up to 15 years in prison after he was convicted Friday of ‘inappropriate touching’ involving three girls – all of them minors. Curtis, 43, was convicted Friday in a Michigan court room after a week-long trial during which all three of the girls, two of them only 15 at the time of the indiscretions, took the stand and testified about his conduct with them last year in the weight room of a high school where he was a volunteer coach. The two-time World Series champion was set to become the school’s head football coach last fall, but resigned when the allegations were made public. Guilty: Former Major Leaguer Chad Curtis has been convicted of sexually assaulting three underage girls . Despite being described by defense witnesses as a man of ‘high moral character,’ the Grand Rapids Press reported, the girls’ detailed accounts and no-nonsense testimony did the former Yankees outfielder in. ‘We give these young ladies so much credit for their courage,’ Barry County Prosecutor Julie Nakfoor-Pratt told the paper. ‘It took a lot of courage to testify.’ Curtis was first accused of inappropriately touching the buttocks of two female students, both 15 at the time of the incidents as recent as April 2012, while he was the volunteer strength and conditioning coach at Lakewood High School, according to reports. A third student, 16, then came forward and said Curtis touched her private areas and kissed her breasts the previous summer. It is high, it is far, it is gone!: Curtis connects on his game-winning home run against the Atlanta Braves in the 10th inning of game 3 of the 1999 World Series . The Yankees win!: Curtis is carried off the field after his game 3-winning home run, the defining moment of his career . ‘It appears as if [the victims] left quite a strong impression with the jury,’ the prosecutor told the Press. ‘They were unequivocal about what happened to them.’ This week’s trial resulted in a guilty verdict, pleasing his victims, according to the Press. ‘This has been such a long road for them,’ Nakfoor-Pratt told the paper, adding that ‘this is a step in the healing process for them.’ The conviction came despite a female massage therapist testifying on the defense’s behalf that she didn’t think it was ‘unusual to massage the area around someone's butt in a full-body massage,’ the Press reported. While that may have explained two of the occurrences, the massage therapist didn’t address the third girl’s accusations. ‘It definitely was not therapeutic touching,’ said the prosecutor. Last taste of his former glory: Curtis waves to the crowd during the teams 63rd Old Timers Day in 2009, he likely won't be back in the future . Curtis played 10 seasons during his big league career. First coming up with the then-California Angels in 1992, the outfielder then moved on to the Detroit Tigers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians, New York Yankees and Texas Rangers. Curtis won two World Series rings with the Yankees in 1999 in 2000 – famously hitting a game winning walk-off home run in the 10th inning of game three of the 1999 World Series, his second of the game. Curtis retired from professional baseball in 2001 at the age of 32. The soon-to-be convict was previously athletic director at another school district before being dismissed for reasons unknown, which Curtis explained as differences with the administration. When the allegations were first made public, the devout Christian asked his community to pray that the case ‘would be resolved in a way that is honoring god.’ He faces up to 15-years in prison at his September 26 sentencing.","Chad Curtis was convicted of sexually assaulting three girls aged 15 and 16 between 2011 and 2012 .

But the BBC later said he had picked it up by mistake. Although he realised his error, McCoy didn't have time to swap his paper for the expensive gadget and instead 'went with it'. A spokeswoman for BBC News explained: 'This morning as Simon McCoy was preparing to introduce this story, instead of picking up his tablet to hold as he went to air, he mistakenly picked up a ream of paper that was sitting next to it. 'In the rush of live news, he didn’t have an opportunity to swap the items, so simply went with it.' In the past the presenter has been seen briefly resting his head on the desk when cameras cut to him.

The camera had cut away for the local news to be read, but when it returned Mr McCoy was seen with his head resting on his folded arms on the desk. He suddenly sat bolt upright and looked sheepish as he tried to regain his composure beside co-presenter Martine Croxall. Following a number of mocking messages from Twitter followers, McCoy eventually tweeted: 'I was not asleep!' He added: 'It was a long desk head-banging that wasn't meant to be picked up in the BBC1 opt!!' But his co-presenter weighed in and jokingly told her own followers: 'Intravenous caffeine now being administered to @simonmccoy.’ Previous: Mr McCoy appeared to be asleep when the camera cut away for him to read the local news during a bulletin last year .

But her guest was in fact taxi driver Guy Goma. Mr Goma gamely attempted to answer the interviewer's questions, but later described the incident as 'very stressful'. In 2009, a segment on BBC Breakfast about an expletive-filled rant from actor Christian Bale on the set of the Terminator film which was caught on camera left producers red-faced.

Ordeal: Police burst into the home of Shirley Williams, 75, after mistaking her bungalow in Deganway, Llandudno, for a drugs den . She said: 'There was an almighty bang three times as they battered the door. I went to the door and police were shouting ""open the door"". I had the keys in my pocket. 'As I opened the door a plainclothes policeman came across and said ""stop, I think we have got it wrong"".' Mrs Williams had moved into the rented bungalow in a normally quiet neighbourhood at Deganwy, Llandudno, only days earlier.

Stores across the UK opened their doors at midnight on Tuesday for the special launch of the game, which reportedly cost around £170 million ($275 million) to make and market - more than films such as Avatar. Around a quarter of the poll participants who owned gaming devices said they were likely to buy Grand Theft Auto V, pictured, when the new consoles come out. While 22 per cent said they would pick up a copy of Activision Blizzard's Call of Duty: Ghosts game . Online retailer Amazon sold out of the game on pre-orders alone. Experts estimate it could generate £1 billion during its first year on sale, with gamers predicted to snap up some 25 million copies - breaking current records. The Grand Theft Auto series has accumulated sales of 135 million copies since its 1997 debut. GTA IV has reportedly sold more than 25 million copies since its 2008 release.

Racing pundit John McCririck was sacked by Channel 4 because bosses didn’t want their own version of ‘unpopular’ Simon Cowell, a tribunal heard yesterday. Jamie Aitchison, the commissioning editor for sport at Channel 4, said the veteran broadcaster was seen as an irritating ‘comic act’ who brought a ‘farcical tone’ to shows – and insisted the decision to fire him was nothing to do with his age. Mr Aitchison told the employment tribunal that several viewer surveys found a large section of the audience disliked the 73-year-old, with some describing him as ‘cocky’, ‘a bully,’ ‘arrogant’ and ‘obnoxious’. Fashion presenter Gok Wan, pictured left, was considered for a role covering horse racing by Channel 4 bosses in the same revamp that saw pundit John McCririck, pictured right, axed, the tribunal heard . Jennifer Eady QC, representing . McCririck, put it to Mr Aitchison that ‘unpopular’ personalities like . Simon Cowell boosted ratings. Mr . Aitchison admitted that using this tactic could work well, but said it . wasn’t his chosen route to success, adding: ‘I don’t find Simon Cowell . entertaining.’ Fashion . presenter Gok Wan was considered for a role covering horse racing by .

How To Look Good Naked presenter was under consideration to front a . fashion segment for the newly revamped Channel 4 racing coverage, the . hearing into Mr McCririck's ageism claim was told. Station . executives considered the move while they were deciding how to make . Channel 4's racing coverage more 'serious' after it was awarded the . exclusive terrestrial rights to broadcast horse racing - including the . 'Crown Jewels' of Ascot and the Grand National, the tribunal heard. However, executives from the broadcaster insisted Wan would not have been commentating on races and would only have been used to front fashion segments as part of the racing coverage. Jamie Aitchison, the channel's commissioning editor for sport, told the hearing: 'Gok Wan is in fashion, that is what he would have been doing.' Asked if Wan would been commentating on the betting, he said: 'He would be nowhere near that. He was going to do fashion and that was it.' Earlier in the hearing, Mr Aitchison claimed Mr Cririck was . ditched after 29 years because his 'pantomime' style had compromised . his credibility, and not because of his age. McCririck - known for his bling, sideburns and deerstalker - has appeared Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Wife Swap in recent years. Tribunal fight: John McCririck, seen here arriving at the employment tribunal hearing with his wife Jenny today, had become a 'comic actor rather than a serious horse racing journalist', the hearing was told . He is seeking £3million compensation from Channel 4 and production company IMG Media after he was dismissed earlier this year. Conservative MP Philip Davies today backed McCririck's fight for compensation and branded his sacking a 'catastrophic mistake'. Mr Aitchison, Channel 4's commissioning editor for sport, told the Central London Employment Tribunal that McCririck was no longer regarded as a serious journalist. 'John McCririck's reputation within the general public, and therefore many potential viewers, had been affected by a number of notorious appearances on a variety of television shows,' he said. 'As a result, he was seen by many as a comic actor rather than a serious horse racing journalist.' He said McCririck's persona did not fit in with the programme's new 'serious' image. 'No discrimination': Channel 4 head of sport Jamie Aitchison told the tribunal McCririck was sacked because his persona did not fit with the new serious image of Channel 4's racing coverage . He said: 'John McCririck was considered to have a pantomime style of exaggerated delivery that was incongruous with the more serious, measured style proposed for the programme for 2013. 'It was felt that John McCririck's presenting style would not help Channel 4 Racing appeal to a wider audience, which was critical following the acquisition of extended television rights.' He said McCririck's style was 'out of step with the vision of the programme, and also unappealing to many potential viewers.' He . also accused the eccentric pundit - known as 'big Mac' to his fans - of . hogging the limelight from his fellow presenters because he 'loved the . camera'. However, Mr Aitchison insisted this had nothing to do with the pundit's age. Flamboyant: Horse racing pundit John McCririck at Royal Ascot in 2005 when it was held in York.

Mr . Aitchison phoned McCririck on October 26 last year to tell him he was . being ditched from the show allegedly just half an hour before an . official press release was sent out announcing the news. Support: Philip Davies MP told the hearing that Channel 4's decision to axe McCririck was a 'catastrophic mistake' However, he revealed televison bosses 'only decided definitely not to include McCririck late on in the planning process'. He said that the station wanted to bring in younger viewers, not necessarily younger presenters. Jennifer Eady QC, representing McCririck, said: 'IMG (Media) pitch on the basis that they will attract younger viewers through younger presenters. 'You are scratching around for an explanation for what is plainly the case, which is the majority of people at Channel 4 who attended this presentation said it was given on the basis they were going to bring in younger on-screen talent.' Mr Aitchison said the reference to 'young and upmarket' was a 'reference to viewers'. He said they were worried the press would launch a campaign to reinstate the controversial 'love him or loath him' pundit. He added that horse racing press officer Hannah Walker, said 'she felt John McCririck would be likely to use the ""ageism card"" as this was a possibility I had mentioned. 'Another potential consequence Hannah pointed out is that the Racing Post might support any ""campaign"" John McCririck might embark upon once he had heard the news. 'This was because, as Hannah pointed out, John McCririck is ""very much a love or loath person"" so it was possible he might garner some support from the press.' But while the station admit the flamboyant presenter was a hit with some fans, they branded his presenting style as 'pantomime' and outmoded. And according to some audience surveys, McCririck was least popular presenter with viewers describing him as 'cocky', 'irritating' and a 'bully', the tribunal heard. He added: 'John was also known for using controversial nicknames for his co-presenters and others while on screen. 'For example, John referred to Clare Balding as ""ravishing"", would call Tanya Stevenson ""the female"", called Nick Luck 'Lord Snooty' and frequently referred to his own wife as ""the Booby"". 'John's nicknames for women contributed to a wider reputation he had for making sexist comments and other bizarre behaviour through his appearances on reality television programmes such as Celebrity Big Brother, Celebrity Wife Swap and Ultimate Big Brother.' His reality TV stints had meant his 'standing in the public eye had suffered', the TV executive said. And McCririck had a 'propensity to irritate and offend viewers' which meant he was seen as a 'celebrity entertainer and a comedic figure', Mr Aitchison said. Meanwhile, Mr Davies, MP for Shipley in West Yorkshire, threw his support behind McCririck's ageism legal battle. The MP, a lifelong horse racing fan who used to work in his mother's betting shop, has appeared as a guest on Channel 4's The Morning Line racing preview programme alongside McCririck and is now joint chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on betting and gambling. He said in a statement to the Central London Employment Tribunal: 'I hold John in the highest regard and believe that he is an expert in his field and an excellent television broadcaster. 'He is probably the only person, apart from Clare Balding, who has reached out to audiences beyond horse racing. 'I'm also of the view that it was a catastrophic mistake when he was dismissed from presenting Channel 4 racing.' Mr Davies, who is parliamentary spokesman for the Campaign Against Political Correctness, told the tribunal that he 'can't think of anyone who is more on top of the game, nor more suitable to the role' than McCririck. Channel 4 and IMG Media deny age discrimination. The hearing continues.","Horse racing pundit McCririck, 73, is demanding £3million compensation after being axed by Channel 4 .

A young man who stabbed his step-grandmother to death in a ‘sexually motivated’ attack after watching hard-core  pornography online was facing life in jail last night. Retired nurse Janis Dundas, 62, was murdered by homeless Jack Huxley, then 20, just hours after she gave him a place to stay. In the middle of the night, Huxley, who was high on drugs and vodka, logged onto her laptop and spent three hours viewing explicit pornography, showing sexual activity between young men and mature women. Killer: Jack Huxley, left, pleaded guilty to killing step-grandmother Janis Dundas, right, at her home in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire . Huxley, whom Mrs Dundas treated as a blood relative, cut her throat and stabbed her up to 30 times as she slept in bed. It was unclear whether Huxley, who had . never had a girlfriend, sexually assaulted his victim before or after . she died, but she was discovered almost naked and forensic evidence . indicated the killing was sexually motivated. Yesterday Huxley, 21, was warned he faces life in jail after pleading guilty to murder at Liverpool Crown Court. The case comes a day after Culture . Secretary Maria Miller warned about the ‘pernicious effect’ of online . porn, which risks creating a generation of boys who grow up with a . warped idea of how to treat women and girls. She called on teachers, . parents and internet giants to do more to stop children from . accidentally viewing such images, which are giving young people . ‘unrealistic expectations’ of sex. Admission: Huxley initially denied murdering Mrs Dundas, but pleaded guilty to the crime at Liverpool Crown Court, pictured, today . Stuart Lawson Rogers QC, prosecuting, . told the court that the attack happened in the early hours of April 5, . hours after Mrs Dundas ‘out of the goodness of her heart’ agreed for . Huxley to sleep on the living-room floor of her one-bedroom flat, in . Ellesmere Port, Cheshire. Huxley,  the son of Mrs Dundas’s . daughter’s partner, had been ‘wandering the streets’ after moving out of . his grandparents’ home a few weeks earlier because they were unable to . cope with his mood swings and drug and alcohol problems. Immediately after the attack, Huxley, . who had been drinking vodka, smoking cannabis and had taken the party . drug mephedrone during the day, took an overdose of prescription pills, . before fleeing in Mrs Dundas’s car. But he immediately crashed the . vehicle, hitting a wall and another car, and neighbours called the . police. Huxley was arrested and taken to hospital. Mrs Dundas was discovered by police . face down on her bedroom floor with three knives protruding from her . back. A post-mortem investigation revealed she died of severe neck . injuries. The retired nurse also had ‘horrific’ hand injuries and her right index finger had been almost severed where . she had attempted to defend herself. Charles Miskin, QC, defending, said . Huxley, who has no previous convictions, had acted out a ‘sudden and . galvanic explosion of violence, catalysed by some sexual component’. But . he said the youth was ‘very immature’ and had endured a ‘terrible and . troubled childhood’. Mr Miskin said Huxley was clinically depressed and had suffered ‘developmental problems’ all his life. Huxley, of no fixed abode, held his head in his hands throughout the hearing. He is due to be sentenced today. The Daily Mail has been campaigning . for an automatic block on online porn, with over-18s able to access . material only after a strict age verification check.","Jack Huxley pleaded guilty to murdering Janis Dundas in her own home .

A mother has told of her ‘nightmare’ after learning both her teenage identical twins had the same cancer. Sally Hyde was devastated when her son, Harry Parnell, was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma just over a year ago. Then last month, Harry’s twin, George, was also diagnosed with the disease. Harry (left) and George (right) Parnell both have Hodgkin's lymphoma. Harry was diagnosed a year ago and had had months of treatment, George was diagnosed last month. They are pictured with their mother, Sally Hyde . Harry found a lump in his neck after being kicked while doing Taekwondo last August. He went to hospital where he was eventually diagnosed with the cancer. He has had gruelling chemotherapy treatment and his mother had to give up her job to look after him. Mrs Hyde, a cleaner, said: ‘I went into complete shock when I found out his diagnosis. ‘He spent weeks in one room on machines at night for breathing and eventually after many scans he started chemotherapy. ‘Harry spent the next six months having treatment between Bristol and Exeter and that included radiotherapy all over Christmas. Harry (left during chemotherapy) has now been told that his tumour is 'dormant' but he still has to have scans every three months. George (right) has just started treatment . ‘He was extremely brave and even gave the lump in his neck a name, Keith. ‘What was so hard was not knowing the outcome. We had to joke about it or else we’d end up crying.’ She added: ‘While he was in hospital the doctors called him “the dude” as he was so chilled and relaxed about the treatment. ‘When he came out of hospital I wanted to put him in a bubble, but knew I couldn’t.’ When Harry (left) was in hospital the doctors called him 'the dude' because he was so relaxed about his treatment . The family were pleased to be told the tumour is now ‘dormant’ but Harry still has to undergo scans every three months. ‘I’m feeling fine now, but tired,’ said Harry. However, just after Harry finished treatment, George also found a lump. Mrs Hyde (pictured with Harry) said: 'He was extremely brave and even gave the lump in his neck a name, Keith. What was so hard was not knowing the outcome. We had to joke about it or else we'd end up crying' Mrs Hyde said: ‘He came home and pulled his shirt down and I knew straight away it was the same.’ ‘He was taken to hospital by his dad, Matthew. He’s had to have scans and a biopsy,’ said Mrs Hyde. ‘It’s still a massive shock, but I feel more prepared this time as I know what to expect. ‘I’ve cried but I have to carry on with life. I’m proud of my sons with how they cope.’ Hodgkin's lymphoma is cancer of the B lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell found in the lymphatic system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. In lymphoma, these lymphocytes start to multiply abnormally and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes. The most common symptom is a painless swelling in a gland, most commonly in the neck, armpit or groin. The cancer is most common in 15 to 35-year-olds and the over 50s. More men than women are affected. Nearly 1,500 people in the UK are diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma every year. It is one of the most easily treatable forms of cancer - almost all young people with Hodgkin's lymphoma will be cured. For older people, the cure rate is about 80 per cent.

Perry Gardner, 16, suffered a number of migraines in July last year before being diagnosed with an eye infection. It is not clear now how he got the infection. Perry said: ‘I was admitted into . hospital and with the infection becoming embedded in my brain, suddenly I . had brain surgeons talking about having to operate to save my life. Perry Gardner, 16, was diagnosed with an eye infection after he started suffering migraines. He was admitted to hospital when the infection spread to his brain. Surgeons considered carrying out brain surgery to tackle Perry's infection but decided, as it was very risky, to try draining the infection first. This proved to be effective . ‘Suddenly my life was in danger, but you’ve just got to fight haven’t you? All I wanted to do was to get back into the pool, and normality.’ But a decision by the medical team at Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital trying to decide the best way forward proved vital. Perry said: ‘Luckily, one of the professors decided it was too risky for such a complicated procedure with me being so young, so instead opted to drain the infection and hope for the best - fortunately it worked.’ Perry (pictured in hospital) said: 'It came as a real shock when you think it just started out as an eye infection. I was admitted into hospital and with the infection becoming embedded in my brain, suddenly I had brain surgeons talking about having to operate to save my life' Perry’s mother Michelle added: ‘At first he was only let out of hospital for six hours at a time. ‘Most people would just want to go straight home. But Perry? No. He wanted to go straight down to the swimming club, his other family, and see his mates and coaches there. ‘He’s so tough mentally - we were still recovering from being told our boy could die, while he just shrugged it off. ‘That’s one reason why I really believe he’s in such a good position to realise his dream.’ Perry, who hopes to win a place in Team GB, was not allowed to return to the pool until six months after he developed the eye infection but was delighted to get a personal best in his first competition after recovering . Perry said: 'In a strange way the illness has given me even more motivation to get to where I want to be - racing for GB - and that starts with the European Junior Championships next year' While Perry was in the early stages of his battle to return to full health his doctors refused to give him the all-clear to return to the pool. But he threw himself into regaining fitness at the Neptune Centre pool’s small gym for two hours every day. Lisa Bates, Perry’s coach, said: ‘You can’t praise the lad enough. Perry's mother, Michelle (pictured with Perry and his father, Andrew), said: 'He's so tough mentally - we were still recovering from being told our boy could die, while he just shrugged it off' ‘To go through an ordeal like he did would have destroyed a lot of young athletes but as soon as he was able to, he forced himself into a small gym to train when he couldn’t in the pool.’ The hard work and determination paid off in January this year when doctors finally gave him the go-ahead to return to the pool, and full training. Since then Perry hasn’t looked back and despite everything that had happened he returned to competition in July and now has set his sights firmly on making the Great British Junior squad next year. Perry says that after his illness he feels like he has been given a second chance and that it has increased his motivation to become a member of the GB swimming team . Perry said: ‘Obviously setting personal bests in my first meet back was pleasing, but it’s just the start as far as I’m concerned. ‘In a strange way the illness has given me even more motivation to get to where I want to be - racing for GB - and that starts with the European Junior Championships next year.’ Perry added: ‘It feels like I’ve been given a second chance, and I’m going to take it.’","Perry Gardner was diagnosed with an eye infection after getting migraines .

Andrew Howard, 46, was found not guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child under the age of 16. Jurors took just 55 minutes to return their verdict. Mr Howard, was suspended from his post at Velmead Junior School, in Fleet, Hampshire, following the allegations. Prosecutors claimed Mr Howard fondled a teenage boy, told him he was gay and offered him hundreds of pounds if their ‘relationship changed’. They argued he showered the child with presents and outings and asked the schoolboy to say he loved him, Winchester Crown Court heard. But Mr Howard told jurors he believed the teenager had made the accusations to 'humiliate and punish' him. He denied fondling the boy over his clothing in houses and in his car and said the incidents never took place. Katherine Kelleher, defending, said in her final submissions: 'Andrew Howard is not Oscar Wilde. He’s not on trial for his homosexuality. 'What I suggest should be your common sense conclusion is that it has been used against him to bring a great man down by a very disturbed young man.' Mr Howard had a 'stratospheric' rise as a teacher and was ‘married’ to a job in which he had responsibilities for the welfare of children, Ms Kelleher said.

The mother-of-two said she was shopping with her baby when she approached a senior member of staff. Shocked: Mother-of-two Michelle Garner, 31, was asked by a Morrisons' staff member to breastfeed her six-week old daughter, Lois, both pictured, in the disabled toilets . After asking if there was somewhere suitable to feed her baby she was advised by a staff member to use the disabled toilet. When she got there, albeit reluctantly, Mrs Garner found there was not even a toilet seat in the 'grubby' and 'dirty' cubicle and stormed out of the store in tears. She said she was left feeling like an outcast following the 'humiliating' incident and stormed out of the store. She said: 'I was really upset. I felt like an outcast and really embarrassed.

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 18:06 EST, 3 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 4 October 2013 . Around 20,000 mothers with young children have begun ‘direct selling’ jobs over the last year, with many saying they needed to earn money after the loss of their child benefit. The Direct Selling Association said it has witnessed a 20 per cent jump in the number of working mothers over the last year, to a total of around 120,000. The work has been taken with companies such as Avon, Amway, Betterware and Kleeneze which sell to people directly, rather than using a shop. Following a cut in child benefit more mothers are taking to direct selling as a way maintain their lifestyles . For example, mothers might hold parties to sell the products, and receive a commission depending on how much they manage to sell. Others use catalogues or door-to-door selling. When asked why they had decided to take the jobs, many said they urgently needed extra money to cope with the rising cost of living, made worse by the loss of child benefit. New rules, which came into effect in January, mean couples no longer receive child benefit if one of them earns more than £60,000, and it begins to be cut once their salary is over £50,000. Even for families who continue to receive the benefit, it has been frozen since 2010 at £20.30 per week for the first child and £13.40 for each subsequent child. Andy Smith, general manager of Amway UK, which makes everything from cosmetics to washing powder, said: ‘The recent changes to child benefit have affected thousands of mums, while the rising cost of living continues to impact on families all over the county. ‘Families are under increasing pressure at the moment. ‘We are continuing to see mums being attracted to direct selling as an alternative, and flexible way to generate an income in these difficult times.’ A total 120,000 mothers are now using direct selling as a way of boosting stretched home budgets . Direct selling is highly attractive to women, who represent around three-quarters of its workforce, because they can control when they work. Many choose to work only while their children are at school, or only in the evenings when their children are asleep, allowing them to avoid the crippling cost of paying for childcare. Lynda Mills, director of the Direct Selling Association, said: ‘Parents are often faced with an impossible choice. ‘They can return to work, often under difficult circumstances and face astronomical childcare costs, or they can stay at home resulting in no income.’ Official figures from the Office for National Statistics show how the number of working women is rising rapidly. More than seven in ten mothers who are married or living with a partner are working, the highest percentage since records began. Over the last two years, around 200,000 women who are married or living with a partner and have young children have joined the workforce. This was larger than the total increase in working mothers which took place during the previous 15 years, according to the figures from the ONS. Mothers can find an office job difficult after childbirth and relish the flexibility of door-to-door sales . The Direct Selling Association said many mothers turn to direct selling due to the problems that they face after returning from maternity leave. Many find flexible or part-time work is not available, or can only find part-time work which is badly paid and far below their skill level. Many do go back to their job but find it is entirely incompatible with family life due to the rigidity of the hours that they are required to work, forcing them to miss important events, such as their children’s nativity play or sports day. Dame Stella Rimington, former director general of MI5 highlighted this problem for mothers this week. She said: ‘I had so many moments where I would worry about being late for the sports day or late for the meeting because I was at sports day. ‘It was perpetual really - you take a day off because your child is in the school play and then some drama will happen at the office. ‘I still had to go home and explain to my child why I didn’t make it. ‘There were a number of things I missed - I wish I could go back too. When they were growing up I relied hugely on nannies and grannies.’","Total of 120,000 mothers now working in direct selling .

The victims were ambushed in secluded alleyways before arriving at addresses in Wickford, Essex, and Stratford. They were threatened with a six-inch kitchen knife and stripped of their mobile phones, banks cards, keys and even clothing. Daniel Beeson (left) and Tyrone Webb (right) have been jailed for six years each after posing as a girl to lure young men to secluded areas where they robbed them . Beeson’s girlfriend Lorna Yeates, 21, joined the con by luring one victim into a dark alleyway where he was jumped by Beeson and Webb who told him: 'Shut up or I’m going to stab you and you’re going to die and no one will know you’re here.' When police searched Yeates’ home in Wickford stolen items from a number of victims were discovered. The gang had posed as a fictitious girl called ‘Jess’ and used stolen phones to lure in new victims through the instant messaging service available on Blackberry mobile phones. Lorna Yeates was jailed for 14 months after admitting one count of robbery and four counts of handling goods stolen . All three appeared in the dock at Basildon Crown Court yesterday facing charges relating to the robberies carried out in March and April.

Piled high with rubbish, this is the house of squalor where the mummified body of a four-year-old boy was found in his cot. It is barely believable that a family in 21st century Britain could live in such horrific conditions. Almost every room was littered with plastic bags of household rubbish, bottles, filthy nappies, newspapers, vomit and mouldy food. In the living room it was waist-high; the kitchen was in a similar state, and even the bath had cat faeces in it. This is the home in which little Hamzah spent his short life before mother Hutton let him starve to death . Shocking: Hamzah's decomposed body was found in his mother's home two years after he died in 2009 . Somehow jobless Amanda Hutton, 43, lived in this terrace  house in Heaton, Bradford, with her eight children. The only room which was not in this truly horrific condition was Hutton’s bedroom. But for almost two years that room contained a terrible secret. Hidden in a travel cot, beneath clothes, shoes and bedding, was the body of Hamzah Khan. The little boy had been starved to death by his cruel alcoholic and cannabis-addicted mother. He wasted away to such an extent that when he died he was wearing baby clothes of a six to nine-month-old baby. Fed on just a banana and some milk a day, he scavenged around for scraps. So horrid were the facts of this case that the original jury at Bradford Crown Court were discharged because one juror was overwhelmed with emotion after a few minutes. Bathroom: Authorities do not know how long the toilet has been covered in excrement, tissues and rubbish . Kitchen: Rubbish was piled high all over Hutton's home. Bottles of spirits cover every inch of the kitchen top . Hallway: Dr Pepper bottles, food packets, alcohol, clothes, moth-eaten toys and stains cover the floor and walls . Judge Roger Thomas, QC, told the trial that when police walked into the house and found the body in September 2011 they opened a ‘terrible Pandora’s box’. The smell was gut-wrenching and dead flies were seen all over the windowsill. When Hutton answered the door, there were flies buzzing around her head. A hardened police officer who searched the house had to walk outside in revulsion. There were five children aged between five and 13 living there and the youngest ones were crawling through the waste in dirty nappies. Hutton told police how she had gone to the supermarket in December 2009, and received a call from her oldest son Tariq, 24, that Hamzah’s eyes were ‘rolling to the back of his head’. She returned home to find Hamzah dead. Hutton said she held her son for hours before placing him back in his travel cot. Astonishingly she didn’t call the emergency services and carried on with her life as if nothing had happened – even continuing to claim Hamzah’s child benefit. Tariq, too, kept the secret. Burial: Hutton and her 24-year-old son Tariq Khan have been convicted of failing to bury the neglected little boy . Abusive: Social services and police saw Hutton as an abuse victim. They failed to notice her own actions . Hutton spent her days drinking bottles of vodka, rarely venturing out. Her young children had to fend for themselves while she drank ‘more vodka than water’. They were told that if anyone asked, they were to say Hamzah had moved to live with relatives in Portsmouth. As the months passed no one reported Hamzah missing or feared for his safety. It was as if this waif-like boy had never existed. People in the neighbourhood were oblivious to what was happening inside the house. Some had never seen Hamzah and didn’t realise some of the children existed. Malnourished and neglected: This is the babygrow Hamzah was found in after he died aged 24 months . Living room: The floors were covered in rubbish and mouldy food that the children were forced to crawl through . But Hutton was also so cut off from relatives that her father didn’t know Hamzah had been born. Alan Hutton, a phone installation engineer living in the Scottish Borders, said he was ashamed of his wayward daughter and they lost touch a decade ago. 'What she has done is evil,’ he said. 'What kind of mother starves her own child to death? Can she even be a part of the human race? He died all on his own, a painful death. 'Social services should have taken him away. They should have intervened. There was an apathy there. 'It is better to do too much than too little. They let him down. 'She had been living like that for years, this was not something that happened overnight. That poor little boy could have been saved, but nobody did anything to help him.' Abusive relationship: Hutton was 16 when she met 18-year-old Aftab Khan outside a nightclub in Bradford . Mr Hutton’s marriage broke down when his daughter was a rebellious teenager who regular smoked cannabis and she was soon living independently. At 16, Hutton met 18-year-old Aftab Khan outside a nightclub in Bradford. She became pregnant in her teens with Tariq. Khan worked as a mechanic and taxi driver. Hutton briefly worked as a care assistant, but primarily she looked after her children. The court heard she was beaten by Khan throughout the 20-year relationship. Her personal problems worsened dramatically a few months after Hamzah was born when Hutton’s mother Ann died from breast cancer in December 2005, leaving her heartbroken. She was on anti-depressants for post-natal depression and turned increasingly to alcohol. Police were regularly called to the house, but Hutton refused to make a complaint against her violent partner. She changed her mind and they finally split up in December 2008 after Khan attacked Tariq. Khan was later convicted of beating Hutton. During police interviews, he told officers: 'She’s a bitter and twisted woman and there’s something seriously wrong with her. She don’t brush her teeth, she don’t clean herself, she don’t look after herself. She’s an alcoholic.'","The only room in good condition was convicted Amanda Hutton's room .

Michael Gove today condemned thousands of teachers who have taken to the streets during a strike in protest at changes to pay and pensions. The Education Secretary accused 'militant teaching unions' of putting their own ideology before the interests of the children in their care. 'They are the people who are the enemies of promise,' he said. The one-day walk-out by members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) and the NASUWT affected schools in 49 local authorities in the East Midlands, East of England, West Midlands, and Yorkshire and Humberside. Under fire: Striking teachers have expressed their unhappiness at Michael Gove's policies . Protest: Members of NUT and NASUWT at Victoria Square, Birmingham, during the one day strike . Rallies in Birmingham, Sheffield and . Cambridge attracted the support of teachers from across the strike-hit . areas, with many carrying banners calling for Mr Gove to be removed from . his post. Speaking at the Tory party conference in Manchester, Mr Gove said: 'While we gather here today the leaders of the militant teaching unions have called a strike. 'And the reason they have gone out on strike - in a new example of the twisted militant logic - is they want to stop good teachers being paid more money.' He said he recently challenged a union leader over the strike plans, and was told he should not worry because they were planning 'child-friendly industrial action'. But Mr Gove hit back: 'There is nothing child-friendly about industrial action.' Children lose a day of learning while parents are forced to pay for expensive childcare, he said. 'I have a simple message for the leaders of miltant teaching unions: please, please, please don't put your ideology before our children's interests.' Dismay: The vice-president on the NUT, Max Hyde, said teachers were angry about numerous aspects of the Government's education policy . Max Hyde, vice-president of the NUT, Max Hyde, said teachers were angry about . numerous aspects of the Government's education policy. Acknowledging . that many of those at the rally were angry at what they feel is Mr . Gove's personal ‘disregard’ for their profession, Ms Hyde said: ‘This . strike is about our concerns about what Mr Gove is doing to education, . about teachers' working conditions, about his mission to deregulate pay, . and also to restore our pensions. ‘Teachers are very angry at the moment. ‘We have taken a very, very difficult step to come out on strike because Mr Gove is not listening to us.’ Teachers . had exhausted every other avenue prior to taking strike action, Ms Hyde . claimed, adding: ‘I know it's very, very disruptive for parents but we . want parents to get angry with the man who's causing this - and that's . Mr Gove. ‘It's very difficult to take action when it affects people that you are close to. ‘In . general the public have a high regard for teachers and if we explain . why we are taking this action then I'm sure they will understand and . they will join us in saying 'enough is enough - we want a better future . for our children'. ‘We want . teachers to have fair pay for what they do, and a good education system . for all our children, not just some of our children.’ Widespread action: Members of NUT and NASUWT march through Cambridge . As . well as pay and pension reforms, many teachers voiced concerns at the . decision to permit schools to employ non-qualified teaching staff and . introduce performance-related pay. NUT . member Simon Debenham, who teaches at Birmingham's Heath Mount Primary . School, said: ‘The teaching profession is being massively attacked and . undermined by an education secretary who doesn't listen to the . profession, a man who has a very blinkered vision based on his own . education. ‘He is trying to impose his vision on children without consultation and without listening to genuine concerns.’ The industrial action was condemned by the Government, which defended its plans to reform pay structures.

Air fares could rise by up to £28 after Heathrow and Gatwick were given leave to push up the charges levied on airlines. The Civil Aviation Authority yesterday revealed its final proposals on how much the main London airports can increase fees on carriers using their space until 2019. The regulator said that Heathrow charges should not rise by more than the RPI rate of inflation each year, currently 3.3 per cent. The Gatwick formula for the same period should be RPI plus 0.5 per cent. Rise: Passengers in Gatwick and Heathrow face higher fares after the airports were allowed to raise fees . Anger: easyJet claims that all passengers could have to pay an extra £28 for their flights . It calculated that the extra charge per passenger would be around £14 at Heathrow by 2019 and £3 at Gatwick. But easyJet warned that the extra cost for passengers would be far higher if an extra runway was built at Gatwick as it would need to be paid for. Chief executive Carolyn McCall said: ‘Using Gatwick’s own figures, passengers could be paying £28 more per flight for years in advance of the opening of a new £9 billion runway.’ She claimed ‘the lack of regulatory control of a proposed second runway’ has ‘handed Gatwick a licence to print money’. The move has also ‘significantly . enhanced the value’ of Gatwick to its owners, private infrastructure . fund GIP, in the event of a likely future sale, she added. However, . the row also came as booming budget airline easyJet announced it now . expects annual profits of between £470million and £480million, against . £317million a year earlier, and said revenues per seat were also . expected to grow by around six per cent on the back of strong passenger . demand. Complaint: Bosses at Heathrow, pictured, said they may have to cut back on future investment . Above inflation: The CAA has allowed Gatwick to raise its fees by RPI plus 0.5 per cent every year to 2019 . Virgin Atlantic said: ‘It is deeply disappointing the CAA has bowed to pressure from Heathrow.’ The airline added that the rises would be ‘a hammer blow for UK consumers and overseas visitors’ as well as deterring foreign investment. Fees at Heathrow are triple the level of ten years ago, leaving travellers with ‘some of the highest charges in the world’, it said. It's the bane of travellers crossing continents, but scientists may be a step closer to a cure for jet lag. They . have identified a  hormone thought to master the body’s rhythm and so . stop the brain from rapidly adjusting to new time zones. Mice . which had been genetically modified so the compound vasopressin failed . to work were able to deal much better with time shifts. They almost instantly adjusted to an eight-hour jump whereas normal mice took eight to ten days. The breakthrough at Kobe University, Japan, raises the prospect of a pill to suppress vasopressin after a flight. But . the benefits could be much wider, reported the journal Science. It . could help shift workers cut health risks by adjusting more quickly to . their schedules as well as improving the sleep of the elderly and those . with dementia. British Airways boss Willie Walsh said: ‘It is a bad day for our customers who have been let down by the CAA.’ He claimed the deal allows ‘complacent’ bosses at Heathrow ‘to ignore its inefficiencies and over-reward investors’. Dale Keller, chief executive of BAR UK, which represents more than 75 scheduled airlines, joined the criticism. ‘Airline chief executives will be . reaching for their oxygen masks in the knowledge they will be forced to . pass on excessive charges to customers,’ he said. Carriers want lower charges because of other pressures on fares, such as fuel costs. But the airports said the CAA deal does not go far enough and could jeopardise investment. Heathrow chief executive Colin Matthews wanted a 4.6 per cent rise each year above inflation. He warned the settlement ‘could have serious and far-reaching consequences’. Mr Matthews added: ‘The CAA’s proposals risk not only Heathrow’s competitive position but the attractiveness of the UK  for international investment.’ The plans were given ‘a cautious welcome’ by Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate. Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted are the only airports to have charges regulated. A CAA proposal for Stansted is expected next week. A final ruling on all three airports is due in January. Gatwick chief executive Stewart . Wingate said: ‘The CAA’s proposal to take forward our commitments . framework would deliver an improved future outcome for passengers in . terms of service quality, facilities and price.’ Caution: Virgin urged Heathrow for restraint pointing out that fees have tripled in a decade .","Civil Aviation Authority allows Heathrow to raise fees at the rate of inflation and Gatwick to hike charges at inflation plus 0.5% .

Labour's biggest union donors pay nothing in corporation tax despite making millions on their investments, new figures reveal today. Ten unions affiliated to Labour raked in almost £10 million from their investments last year. In total, the unions concerned have given Labour more than £21 million since the last election. But, despite attacking tax dodging by major companies, none of them paid a penny of corporation tax on their profits. 'Hypocrites': Labour's biggest union donors pay nothing in corporation tax despite making millions on the stock market . Instead they exploited an obscure provision in the law which allows them to offset costs such as sick pay, accident compensation and employment tribunal costs against their income. The giant Unite union, which is Labour’s biggest donor, has stocks and shares worth £54.4 million, which generated an income worth more than £2 million. The GMB, which has given Labour £4.5 million since the election, has investments worth almost £21 million. These generated an income of more than £1.6 million. The Community trade union, another Labour donor, has investments worth £67.2 million, generating an income of £4.1 million. Outspoken: Both Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, left and GMB boss Paul Kenny have spoken out against corporate tax dodging . None of the unions concerned paid any corporation tax on their stock market portfolios. In total, the unions had investment income of £9.7 million. If they had paid 20 per cent corporation tax on the total they would have received a tax bill of just under £2 million. There is no suggestion that any of the unions broke the law. But Tory MP Charlie Elphicke last night accused them of hypocrisy and called on Ed Miliband to challenge them over their tax affairs. ‘Tax avoidance isn’t just a problem with big corporations. It’s also a problem with big unions who bankroll the Labour Party.' Tory MP Charlie Elphicke . Mr Elphicke, a former tax lawyer, said: ‘Tax avoidance isn’t just a problem with big corporations. It’s also a problem with big unions who bankroll the Labour Party. Despite heavy income from stocks and shares, these union bosses have seen no need to contribute.’ The Tory research is based on official figures provided to by the unions to the Certification Officer, who audits their affairs. The big trade unions have been amongst the biggest critics of corporations and wealthy individuals accused of dodging tax. Unite boss Len McCluskey accused Starbucks of ‘daylight robbery’ after figures emerged showing it had paid corporation tax in only one of its 15 years of operations in the UK. Criticism: Len McCluskey accused coffee chain Starbucks of 'daylight robbery' after figures showed it had paid corporation tax only once in its 15 years operating in the UK . GMB boss Paul Kenny called for a Parliamentary inquiry into corporate tax dodging last year following reports that a private sector healthcare provider was based in the Channel Islands to minimise its UK tax bill. Mr Kenny accused firms of ‘sticking up two fingers to hard-pressed UK families while they enjoy tax free profits from our pockets.’ But union sources last night pointed to a provision in the law that allows them to offset so-called ‘provident benefits’ paid to members against their profits from investments. The loophole means that costs ranging from funeral expenses of a member to the costs of representing people at employment tribunals can be set against any potential corporation tax liability. A spokesman for the Community union said: ‘Everything we do is transparent, legal and subject to public scrutiny.’ A Unite spokesman said: ‘Unite and other unions save the state money by providing benefits to their members the cost of which might otherwise fall on the taxpayer. 'This has been recognised by governments of all parties since Victorian times. We are not a profit-making organisation, we have no shareholders and no-one benefits other than our members. ‘If the Tories want to find hypocrisy, let them examine their tax-dodging donors.’","Ten unions affiliated to Labour raked in over £10million from investments .

Danny Dash was jailed for nine years at Canterbury Crown Court after admitting causing grievous bodily harm. A thug who gouged out a love rival's eye after telling him to 'sleep with one eye open' has been jailed for nine years. Mark Clark, 44, was attacked yards from his home in Swalecliffe, Kent, by Danny Dash, 30. The incident, which happened after he intervened in a fight between his former partner and a friend, has left him blind in one eye and has restricted vision in the other. Canterbury Crown Court heard on Friday how there was 'bad' blood between Mr Clark and Dash after Dash started a relationship with Mr Clark's then-girlfriend Emma Long. This had led to a bitter split, and Mr Clark had received threats not to contact his former partner because she was now with him. On the night of the incident, in June, a fight broke out between Emma Long and Michelle Rule, Mr Clark's friend. During the incident the court heard how Mr Clark saw Dash stamp on Miss Rule and decided to intervene, and then Dash pushed his thumbs into Mr Clark's eyes, causing the permanent damage. A witness described seeing Mr Clark curled up in the foetal position with Dash holding him around the neck with his fingers in his eyes. The attack only ended when a neighbour intervened and hit dash with a walking stick, finding Mr Clark screeching in pain with blood dripping from his eye socket. Prosecuting, Lucy Luttman, said: 'The defendant pushed his thumbs into his eyes, in effect gouging the eyes out. Mark Clark, 44, says that his life has been changed forever since the attack by love rival Danny Dash. Mr Clark says that if it wasn't for a neighbour hitting Dash with his walking stick, the attack could have been so much worse . Mark Clark, 44, is now blind in one eye and has restricted vision in the other. Before the June assault he was told by Danny Dash to 'sleep with one eye open' 'Mr Clark began screaming that he had had enough, but dash didn't let go and continued to push his thumbs for approximately 30 seconds' Dash, from Canterbury admitted causing grievous bodily harm, but Mr Clark says that his life has been changed forever. He said after the case: 'I remember everything. I was screaming in pain. 'I thought he was trying to kill me. If a neighbour hadn't stopped him I could have lost both eyes. 'I remember him (Dash) being hit with a walking stick. I get headaches and I can't stop thinking about what he has taken away from me.' He added: 'I don't look how I used to look. Without my sight it has affected my walking, my security. 'He has deformed my face and when I look in the mirror I don't feel confident. It has changed everything and the way I feel about everyone.' On sentencing Dash to nine years in prison Judge Simon James said: 'This was a use of extreme violence and its effects on your victim have been devastating. 'There is also a degree of premeditation in what you did and your self-serving account makes it difficult to accept that your remorse is genuine.'","Victim Mark Clark left blind in one eye, and has limited vision in the other .

But Jason Evans, Head of security at the Bridgend prison which is set to . become the biggest in Wales and England by 2015, has stressed this does . not mean it is going soft on criminals. Mr Evans insisted having phones installed in the 216 new cells, which is also being introduced in other prisons, will not compromise . security or public protection.

He said: 'I know people think that . will be a retrograde step. But once there's a phone in prison it doesn't . really matter where you put it.' He said use of the landlines will . remain restricted and monitored in exactly the same way as traditional . cell-block phones. Inmates can only ring approved numbers and the lines . will be shut off at certain times. Director of the prison, Janet Wallsgrove, 51, insisted that the G4S-run jail operates a . zero-tolerance approach to rule breaking and crime by both prisoners and . visitors, waging a 'war of attrition' on drug smuggling. No change: But staff at the prison, pictured inside, insist that inmates phone calls will still be restricted and monitored in the same way . Mrs Wallsgrove, who took the helm seven years ago, added that Parc achieved a level-4 exceptional score in the Government's prison rating system in August. By early 2015, Parc will house more than 1,700 inmates. She said the £35m expansion - including a plush visitor centre - would help staff manage inmates better and continue to crack down on drug smuggling. 'People would have you believe that everybody here is having a lovely time with their feet up watching Sky TV and that just isn't the case,' she said. Mrs Wallsgrove said a 'humane' ethos is at the heart of the establishment and that staff have found that in most cases, the better you treat a prisoner, the better they behave. But she said this does not mean she gives an inch when it comes to security. The prison operates a modern approach to the treatment of the 6,000 adult and 200 child visitors who come through the gates every month, allowing them to meet inmates in more relaxed surroundings than the traditional visiting rooms. But there are still four drug sniffer dogs, specially-trained officers, CCTV and intelligence links to help stop drugs getting into the prison.","An expansion of Parc Prison in Wales will see phone installed in new cells .

Nearly all are now in good jobs. Pictured is Eton College near Windsor . Nearly half of pupils from poorer backgrounds whose private school fees were paid by the last Tory government are now earning at least £90,000 a year. More than 75,000 children took part in the Assisted Places Scheme, which ran for 17 years from 1980 before it was abolished by Labour. A study revealed ‘virtually all’ have gone into well paid professional and managerial positions, including more than 40 per cent whose annual pay is £90,000 or more – nearly four times the national average salary of £24,000. Two-thirds said the economic crisis had not affected their standard of living. Even those who didn’t go on to university were still found to be in ‘solidly middle-class occupations with a good income’. Most also reported they believed their schools had helped them develop important personal attributes including self-discipline and self-reliance. The Sutton Trust, which campaigns to improve social mobility through education and commissioned the report, said its findings were powerful evidence that a similar scheme should be brought back. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: ‘The new research shows the extent to which able children from less advantaged homes gain from an independent school education. ‘It shows the importance of ensuring that access to the best independent day schools is not restricted to those who can afford to pay full fees.’ The Assisted Places Scheme was launched during Margaret Thatcher’s first term in power and was open to bright pupils from low and middle-income homes in England and Wales whose parents could not afford full independent school fees. The government paid a proportion of the fees, depending on the total income in the household. It was abolished by Tony Blair when he became prime minister in 1997. Researchers have been following two groups of children with similar ability and parental background who qualified for the scheme. Some took up assisted places and others went to state schools. Previous studies have shown those who went to independent schools did better in their public examinations. And a third went on to elite universities, compared to less than one in ten who had studied at state schools. The latest study by researchers at the Wales Institute for Social and Economic Research, found the benefits of the ‘private school premium’ continued into the workplace. Three-quarters of respondents also said they expected to be even better off in ten years’ time and a ‘significant proportion’ expected to be able to retire early. Report author Professor Sally Power said: ‘The relative unimportance the Assisted Place holders attach to factors such as luck and social background suggests that, for these individuals, the scheme alleviated the impact of socio-economic disadvantage.’ The Sutton Trust set up a similar scheme at Belvedere School in Liverpool from 2000 to 2007, with all places based on merit alone. The first pupils to sit exams at the girls’ school in 2005 achieved record results in their GCSEs.","Pupils who went to elite schools thanks to Tory scheme are now high-flyers .

Two burglars who stole £200,000 worth of jewellery, laptops and computer games have been jailed after a suspicious resident took pictures of them as they staked out houses. Stuart Edey, 33, and Jason Sultana, 32, who together committed 100 offences, were jailed for almost seven years between them on Tuesday. The photographs were taken by an anonymous resident in May who saw the pair acting suspiciously outside his home in the village of Llantwit Fardre, near Cardiff. Burglars Jason Sultana, 32, and Stuart Edey, 33, were jailed after an alert resident took these pictures of the men when he saw them acting suspiciously outside his home and told police . South Wales Police were able to . match up the images to CCTV footage from a local supermarket. A South Wales Police spokesman said: 'The high quality of the pictures taken by the resident enabled officers . to make an exact match between trainers found in Sultana's house and . those he is wearing in the photograph - using the pattern on the sole.' Detectives matched the sole of the trainer to one found at Jason Sultana's flat . The burglars targeted homes during the day in the Bridgend, Taff Ely, Cardiff and Neath areas over several weeks. The photographer has been praised by detectives, who said Edey and Sultana could still be offending without his intervention. Detective Chief Inspector Andy . Valentine said: 'I can't praise the photographer enough. 'He took . responsibility and acted on his instincts to report suspicious . behaviour, which is what we asked people to do at the time when the . burglaries were being reported.

Stuart Edey, 33, of Ely, admitted eight offences including burglary, attempted burglary and handling at Cardiff Crown Court. He told the court that he wanted to apologise to victims who had returned to find their homes violated. Edey also claimed he had not entered any of the houses himself and was simply the getaway driver. Jailing . him for four and half years, Recorder Catherine Brown said: 'The driver . is just as guilty as the person who does go in. You get no credit at . all for only being the driver.' Jason Sultana, 32, of Cardiff, was given two years and four months. Stuart Edey, left, and Jason Sultana, right, were jailed after stealing about £200,000 of goods . He admitted being with Edey at two burglaries, in Llanharan on May 13 and Bridgend four days later. A third defendant, Polish-born Rafel Skowyra, 31, of  Ely, also pleaded guilty to being involved at Maes y Piod where a laptop, games and £2,000 worth of jewellery was taken. He was given an 18-month jail sentence. Victims were said to have spoken of the 'massive intrusion'. One man, whose Pontyclun home was targeted while he was away for a few days, has since put it up for sale. The judge said: 'It's not surprising the impact it had on him.

Michael Gove has spent a week at an Austrian ‘fat farm’ to help him show off his Tory leadership credentials at this week’s party conference in Manchester. The Education Secretary, tipped as an heir to David Cameron, padded around the £2,500-a-week spa in his bathrobe and fluffy slippers – and was the only man there. Mr Gove, who ballooned to 15st after the Tories won power with the Lib Dems, has lost 2st since visiting the Mayr health resort, which is popular with celebrities including Liz Hurley and the Duchess of York. Fit for power: A trimmer Mr Gove, right, after his spa visit, and how he looked in May 2012, left . The centre on the shores of Lake Worthersee is not for the fainthearted. Mr Gove was stripped of his two mobile phones and laptop, banned from drinking caffeine or alcohol, and restricted to consuming just 600 calories a day. Treatments at the Mayr clinic include colonic irrigation and blood-letting. One female guest, who visited the spa at the same time as Mr Gove this summer, told The Mail on Sunday the Cabinet Minister was ‘pink-faced, chilled and smiley’. ‘He took advantage of many health and beauty treatments, and chatted to the women over fruit teas,’ she said. ‘Supper was soup and stale bread – stale because it makes you chew it a lot – while the first thing we had to do every morning was drink Epsom salts and magnesium citrate to clear out the system. Strict: Viva Mayr Spa, Austria, where guests eat soup and stale bread in their quest to fight the flab . ‘Breakfast was sheep’s yogurt and a piece of avocado. The hunger gave us terrible headaches. One woman said to Mr Gove, “It’s grim, isn’t it?” and he replied, “It’s worth it. Politics takes it out of you, and conference season’s coming up – this is a good way to recharge the batteries.” ’ The fellow guest admitted that  she felt ‘utterly dreadful’ for a couple of days, but then ‘woke up and felt wonderful’. Friends noted how much trimmer Mr Gove looked on BBC 1’s Question Time on Thursday. Tuck in! Mr Gove was restricted to consuming just 600 calories a day at the clinic . However, sticking to his diet will be tricky at conference as he attends a gut-busting number of dinners and drinks receptions. The disclosure that he has been  to a fat farm will fuel rumours that he is shaping up to make a leadership challenge when Mr Cameron eventually steps down as Prime Minister. Mr Gove  has dismissed the speculation, saying he is ‘too ugly’. He claimed ugly people have to spend more on their appearance than beautiful people to avoid descending ‘into the realms of the godawful’. Mr Gove’s wife, the writer Sarah Vine, dropped a hint about the trip last week. In her Daily Mail column she said that he had just returned from Austria ‘with a pair of swimming trunks in the style  of lederhosen’. The detox regime should ensure he now slips into them with more ease.","Mr Gove ballooned to 15st after the Tories won power with the Lib Dems .

Finally sentenced: Mohammadullah Khan's case was adjourned six times as he employed delaying tactics in a bid to stay in the UK, but he was eventually sentenced today . An asylum seeker who groped a tourist and delayed his court case in a bid to stay in the UK has finally been sentenced and will deported once he has served time in prison. Mohammadullah Khan, 20, who came to Britain from Afghanistan, assaulted a 26-year-old French woman as she got off a night bus in Maida Vale, west London, in July last year. Khan's case cost the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds after the case had to be adjourned six times as the defendant tried to change his plea and refused to co-operate with either the probation service or his own legal team. Southwark Crown Court heard that Khan tried to grab the victim's bottom and kiss her and claimed his hand over her mouth to muffle her screams. He only let his victim go when a resident on the street heard a noise and shouted at Khan. Khan originally pleaded guilty, but initially held up the first court hearing when he tried to retract that plea. He then told the court that he needed a psychiatric report because life in prison had 'driven him mad'. The case was delayed on a third occasion when Khan refused to co-operate with the probation service because he was apparently convinced that they were immigration officers. In April, Khan’s lawyer decided she could no longer act for him, creating further problems. He still refuses to co-operate fully with his legal team and his barrister could offer no mitigation for him. His sentencing finally went ahead today, after further delays caused by Khan’s refusal to be joined in the dock by an interpreter. He finally confirmed his guilty plea today, but still shouted ‘conspiracies’ at the judge as sentence was passed. Prosecutor David Ryan told the court: 'The victim had been out with her boyfriend and friends. She had left them at about 2am, returning by bus to go home. 'When she got off the bus, somebody approached her. Hearing: Khan, who was sentenced at Southwark Crown Court, pictured, will face deportation once he has served time in a young offenders' institute and then an adult jail . 'It seems as if the defendant grabbed her from behind and tried to grab her bottom and kiss her. She tried to get his hand off her face but she could not remove it. 'She was lying on the ground with the defendant on top of her. She kept trying to remove his hand - she couldn’t breath. 'He said something like ""don’t worry, it won’t be long, be nice, don’t scream"".' ‘This is an extremely serious sexual . assault and the ordeal for the complainant has been very grave, despite . the fact that she did not have to go into the witness box.' Judge Peter Testar . Khan then began to rub himself on the defenceless woman, the court heard. Mr Ryan added: 'A resident on that street heard what he thought was a disagreement. 'Her shouts got more serious and the female sounded more distressed and he could see this and he see the back of someone lying on her. 'He shouted and the defendant then got up and ran away.' Khan frequently swore and shouted ‘conspiracies’ throughout the hearing. Sentencing Khan, Judge Peter Testar said: ‘This is an extremely serious sexual assault and the ordeal for the complainant has been very grave, despite the fact that she did not have to go into the witness box. 'It was only on the day of the trial that the defendant pleaded guilty. His attitude metamorphosed into denial of the offence.' Khan, of no fixed address, received five years detention in a young offenders’ institute, with an extension period of three years. He will be transferred to an adult jail when he turns 21 and automatically deported when he serves his sentence.","Mohammadullah Khan's case was adjourned six times before sentencing .

A father-of-three throttled his girlfriend after she objected to him playing the new Grand Theft Auto V game with his friends after midnight. Rachael Lawson complained when Gray Allan Ormandy, 23, arrived home after midnight with the new game, and then started playing it with two friends. Mr Ormandy snapped, and squeezed her neck until she could not breathe as one of her children begged him to stop, Furness Magistrates’ Court in Cumbria, heard. The couple had regular arguments, but the row on September 17 started when Ormandy went to buy the game at its special official midnight launch, said Lisa Hine, prosecuting. Miss Lawson was in bed, but was woken by a barking dog and came down to find Ormandy back home with two friends. She asked the friends to leave around 20 minutes later and Ormandy slept on the sofa. Mrs Hine said Miss Lawson asked Ormandy to help with the children the next morning, but he refused. As the row escalated in the bedroom of their Mount Pleasant home, Ormandy grabbed his girlfriend around the neck and squeezed until she could not breathe. Mrs Hine said the three children - all aged under five - saw what happened and one said: 'Stop it.' Miss Lawson took the children downstairs and called the police at 8.30am. Following his arrest, Ormandy told police 'she hates me having a computer' and said she 'smashed the last one'. He said he came back with some mates and Miss Lawson was 'stressing' and made his mates 'uncomfortable'. A scene from the Grand Theft Auto V game.

Mrs Hine said Miss Lawson wanted to make up and did not wish to pursue a restraining order. Ormandy, who was bailed to Fife Street, Barrow, admitted assault when he appeared in court on Tuesday. Mr Trystan Roberts, defending, said he pleaded guilty on the basis he held her jaw line and argued it was not in front of the children. Mr Roberts said: 'He is bitterly sorry he is now away from them. He is, by all accounts, an extremely good father. 'Unfortunately, things have been very stressful recently and his younger brother, for whom he has cared for much of his life, has become homeless and his mum is on a third drugs conviction and is in prison at the moment.' Sentencing was adjourned until Tuesday for a report to be prepared by the probation service.

Survey: Around 1.5% of the population say they are lesbian or gay, according to a study by the Office for National Statistics . Only one in 100 people say they are exclusively homosexual, an official survey found yesterday.(Thurs) It said that 545,000 adults, 1.1 per cent of the population, say they are lesbian or gay. A further 220,000, 0.4 per cent of adults, say they are bisexual. The count by the Office for National Statistics shows that despite the promotion of same-sex marriage and full gay equality by David Cameron and the Coalition, there has been no increase in the past year in numbers of people who say they are gay. The 1.5 per cent ONS estimate of the lesbian, gay and bisexual population is a quarter of the level of around six per cent claimed by gay lobby groups and accepted in Whitehall. The ONS figures, described as experimental, were produced from questions on sexual identity included in the large-scale Integrated Household Survey. Nearly 170,000 people answered questions on their sexuality. The self-acknowledged gay population, according to the estimates, is the same as last year and slightly up on numbers produced by similar surveys in 2010. According to the findings, 1.5 per cent of men say they are gay and 0.7 per cent of women identify themselves as lesbian. There was no answer to the sexual identity questions from 1.1 per cent of those surveyed; 3.6 per cent refused to answer or said they didn't know; 0.3 per cent described their sexuality as 'other'; and 93.5 per cent described themselves as heterosexual or straight. Younger people were more likely to say they were gay, with 1.7 per cent of those aged between 16 and 24 calling themselves gay or lesbian, and another one per cent of the 16-24 age group said they were bisexual. The ONS report found that London had the highest proportion of people saying they were gay, lesbian or bisexual, but even so they remained a small minority at 2.5 per cent, one in 40 of the population. 'The proportions of adults identifying themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual within the other regions were largely similar in 2012,' the report said, 'ranging from 1.0 per cent in the East of England to 1.7 per cent in the North East.'

Guilty: Aqab Hussain (pictured today) went straight into the victims, who were hurled through the air, before the vehicle sped off and left them for dead . Three pedestrians were struck by a car in a deliberate Grand Theft Auto-style revenge attack, a shocking video revealed today. The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester city centre when the Vauxhall Corsa was used as a lethal weapon to knock them over ‘like skittles’. Aqab Hussain, 21 - who was today convicted of four counts of attempted murder - drove straight into the victims, who were hurled through the air, before he sped off and left them for dead. Eyewitness Corey Gordon, 26, who watched the attack from inside his car, later compared it to a sequence from the violent computer game series in which users play the role of car thieves. He said: ‘It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. I can only describe it as unreal - a computer game like Grand Theft Auto - as he swerved off line to hit the men. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air.’ Hussain even wobbled his vehicle so he could shake off one of the men who was still on the bonnet, Manchester Crown Court was told. It left Michael Ward, 28, - who was already partially sighted - with skull fractures. He spent 20 days in intensive care after emergency brain surgery and is now paralysed on his right side. The incident occurred after father-of-three Mr Ward, of Bolton, and his friends had gone to the Silks lap dancing club in Manchester city centre, just after midnight on August 21 last year. Five minutes after the party arrived at the club, a group of five men, including Hussain, also entered and bought a Grey Goose vodka bottle from the club for £100 to celebrate the Eid festival. Scroll down for video . Approach: The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester . Deliberate attack: The Vauxhall Corsa was used as a lethal weapon to knock over the three men 'like skittles' When the club closed at 2.15am there was a fight in which a cap was taken from one of Hussain’s friends during horseplay but was handed back. A further row erupted outside during which one of the Hussain’s group was heard saying ‘watch, you just watch yourself’. Minutes later Hussain’s silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph as it mowed down Mr Ward and his three friends as they crossed the road. One stepped back on to the pavement in time and was uninjured, but the other three men were hit by the car. Martin Harris suffered minor injuries and Paul Hulme had a broken leg which needed surgery to insert a metal rod. Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet of the Corsa for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road. He is now unable to use his right hand and she said his cognitive functions including speech had been seriously affected and would leave him dependant on others. Mowed down: Hussain's silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph . Awful: Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road .

'It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air' Corey Gordon, witness . ‘The Corsa didn’t stop and the occupants made no attempt to stop or assist. Even at the point of impact with the young men, the driver did nothing to apply his brakes to swerve to avoid the collision - nothing at all to avoid the pedestrians crossing. ‘That vehicle only starts to veer from side to side when it has one of the victims is on the bonnet and veers in an attempt to throw him off the bonnet.’ ‘The only sensible interpretation of the manner the Corsa was driven is the driver, no doubt inflamed by whatever had gone on a couple of minutes before intended to kill. He was deliberately using that vehicle as a lethal weapon.’ Hussain, of Rusholme, Greater Manchester, was arrested on October 11 as he arrived back in Manchester on a flight from Pakistan. Leaving: Hussain had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident . Likeness: An eyewitness compared the attack to a sequence from the violent computer game series Grand Theft Auto, in which users play the role of car thieves (file picture) He denied driving the car and denied all charges. It emerged he had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident. He was remanded in custody to face sentence later.

The Pope has written to the Russian President urging him to tell President Obama and other world leaders at the G20 summit to oppose a strike in Syria. The letter was the latest in a series of moves by Pope Francis to prevent involvement in Syria's bloody civil war. He has sent tweets condemning a potential war and declared today a day of fasting and prayer for peace in the war-torn country, according to Time. Pray for peace: Pope Francis takes part in a vigil after writing to G20 leaders as he calls for a peaceful resolution in Syria . In his letter to Putin and other G20 leaders he wrote: 'I make a heartfelt appeal for them to help find ways to overcome the conflicting positions and to lay aside the futile pursuit of a military solution.' 'Let there be a renewed commitment to seek, with courage and determination, a peaceful solution through dialogue and negotiation of the parties, unanimously supported by the international community.' The Pope's push for a peaceful resolution was echoed by the Catholic Church in the U.S. as Cardinal Dolan and American bishops wrote to Congressmen calling on them to vote against military intervention. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops also wrote to President Obama, saying the Pope had 'made it clear that a military attack will be counterproductive, . will exacerbate an already deadly situation, and will have unintended . negative consequences'. Defense: The Pope has used Twitter to call for world leaders to find an alternative to war . The Pope has also taken to Twitter to push for a peaceful resolution after the Syrian regime was blamed for a chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 people. He started the week with a tweet on Monday that read: 'War never again! Never again war!', followed by: 'How much suffering, how much devastation, how much pain has the use of arms carried in its wake.' On Tuesday, he tweeted: 'We want in our society, torn . apart by divisions and conflict, that peace break out!'. This was followed by: 'With . utmost firmness I condemn the use of chemical weapons.' On Thursday, the 76-year-old's message was: 'With all my strength, I ask each party in the . conflict not to close themselves in solely on their own interests. #prayforpeace.' He has also set aside Saturday, the birth of Mary, as a day of fasting and pray for peace in Syria. A vigil will be held in St Peter's Square from 7pm to midnight. Vigil: Crowds gather in St Peter's Square at the Vatican to pray for peace in Syria . Devastation: Syrians sift through rubble after a car bomb in Raqqa province on August 29 . Deadly: A man weeps over the body of a relative killed in a chemical weapons attack in Syria . Concern for the Christian minority in Syria also led to a meeting between the Vatican's foreign minister and world ambassadors, to discuss the dangers of extremists opposing Assad's regime, according to the Catholic Sun. The Vatican adheres to just war theory, which means military action must meet a strict set of criteria, including damage by the aggressor being lasting and 'the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated'. The Pope's view on Syria follows his predecessors' reactions to conflict. Pope Benedict opposed intervention in Libya, Pope John Paul spoke out against the Iraq war and, during the Panama invasion, Manuel Noriega took refuge in the Vatican embassy.","Vatican sends tweets and prepares prayer vigil and day of fasting .

Disgraced: Gary Baker, 50, who was fired from the Sacramento PD last December, is accused of raping a 75-year-old grandmother on two occassions . A former veteran Sacramento, California, police officer accused of repeatedly raping an elderly stroke victim has claimed that their sexual encounters were consensual. Gary Baker, 50, was fired last December after 22 years on the force when it came to light that he had allegedly sexually assaulted an ailing 75-year-old woman suffering from a severe speech impediment. Detective Eugene Shim testified during a preliminary hearing Wednesday that initially, Baker had denied even touching the victim, identified in the case only as Jane Doe. A day after he learned of the allegations against him, Shim said that his former colleague changed his story, saying that he did have two encounters with the woman - both of them consensual. According to the witness, Baker, now 50, said that at first he unsuccessfully tried to have intercourse with 'Jane Doe,' whom he thought to be only 60 or 65 years old at the time. He later admitted to performing oral sex on the septuagenarian at her senior living apartment complex, The Sacramento Bee reported. When questioned about his paramour's unusual speech, Shim responded that the officer told investigators he thought the woman had a foreign accent and a stutter. Jane Doe suffered a stroke in 2009, which left her with a condition called speech aphasia - a disorder that causes problems with speaking, listening, reading and writing. Change of heart: Baker, seen next to his attorney last month, initially told police he did not have sex with the victim, but later said the two had consensual sex . Crime scene: The alleged incidents took place in November 2010 and September 2012 inside the elderly woman's senior living apartment complex . Due to her condition, the victim, who is now 78 years old, has been declared incompetent to take the stand and offer testimony against her alleged assailant. During a hearing last month, Baker's attorney Linda Parisi attempted to use the victim’s disability to poke holes in the prosecution's version of events, suggesting that there was no way for officers who investigated the alleged rape to know if the woman understood the questions they were posing to her. Officer Paula Gow responded that the elderly woman kept tapping on the police patch on the sleeve of her uniform, apparently indicating that her attacker was a cop, according to a CBS Sacramento report. According to the prosecution, Baker raped the woman the first time November 24, 2010, and again September 20, 2012. Marked: Officer Paula Gow testified last month how the elderly woman kept tapping on the police patch on the sleeve of her uniform, apparently indicating that her attacker was a cop . He was taken into custody that December after getting caught on a surveillance camera set up by Jane Doe's son entering her home. When questioned by police about the allegations, Detective Shim testified that Baker said he and the woman were on good terms, and she even showed him pictures of her family and gave him her phone number. Asked if his encounters with the septuagenarian were consensual, Baker reportedly answered in the affirmative. On the day of his arrest December 20, however, the veteran officer was adamant in his denial of any contact with the victim, telling police that he has not even ‘held her hand.' The prosecution’s case against Baker hinges on DNA and medical evidence suggesting that the woman may have been raped, and also on testimony from the victim’s family. On Tuesday, her son took the stand, telling the court that his elderly mother had no problem communicating that she had been assaulted. 'She was crying and said ""Rape,""' the man recalled. When asked by her family to describe her attacker, the woman allegedly used the words 'police' and 'black.' Baker is African-American. The court also heard from Jane Doe's granddaughter, who recalled that when she asked what happened, her grandmother spelled out ‘r-a-p-e.’ ‘I said, ""Who, who was raped?"" She said ""Me. I was raped.’ She was pointing at herself,""' the relative told the court. When the granddaughter examined the elderly woman's body in the bathroom, she said she noticed bruising to her breasts.","Gary Baker, 50, is accused of raping the septuagenarian suffering from speech aphasia in 2010 and 2012 .

Fraudster: Johnstone ordered pizza and paid for it using somebody else's credit card on four occasions . A morbidly obese man who gorged his way through £120-worth of stolen pizza failed to attend court because he was 'too fat' to leave his house. Liam Johstone, 21, pleaded guilty through his lawyer to ordering takeaway from fast-food chain Domino's Pizza on four separate occasions, which cost £30 a time and was paid for using somebody else's credit card. The cheesy feasts were delivered to his home in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland. At a hearing at Livingston Sheriff Court, Johnstone's lawyer, Alan Jackson, claimed his client had been unable to attend in person because he had 'extreme difficulty getting out of the house'. He added: 'The last information I have is that he can’t physically get out of the house even with assistance. 'I’ve tried to contact him but his phone is switched off so I’m quite happy to undertake to make a home visit.' Mr Jackson admitted that a warrant had been granted on June 20 for police to arrest 21-year-old Johnstone, who weighs 40-stone. The accused failed to appear at two earlier hearings after being ordered to pay compensation to Domino’s Pizza in Bathgate, West Lothian. It was claimed at the time that he was 'too fat' to come to court. Johnston earlier pleaded guilty to obtaining almost £120 worth of goods by fraud by pretending to Zaffer Ahmed, who worked at the fast food outlet, that he was the holder of the card he used to pay for the meals. Because Johnstone has not yet appeared at court, it has not yet been made clear who exactly the card belonged to. He was caught after scoffing four takeaway feasts costing around £30 each which he had delivered to his home. Gorged: Johnstone pleaded guilty to fraud through his lawyer, but did not attend court because he was 'too fat' Mr Jackson said Johnstone had a 'reasonable income' from benefit payments and could afford to make restitution. But he added: 'He’s not been in touch. I know he’s still engaging with certain social services.' Sheriff John Rafferty criticised Johnstone for not contacting Mr Jackson. He said: 'It seems to me he’s not beyond communicating with if he wants to get in touch with you. 'A soul and conscience certificate should have been available for today because this has not come as any great surprise to him. 'It’s only because I can see huge practical difficulties with him being apprehended by the police that I’ll not grant a warrant in this case.'

For almost 100 years, Cadbury’s chocolate has been swathed in a distinctive purple wrapping that made it stand out from rivals. But yesterday it lost the exclusive right to the iconic colour in a court battle with Nestle. Following the ruling by the Court of Appeal, trademark lawyer Fiona McBride said: ‘This is a  massive blow to Cadbury.’ Scroll down for video . Cadbury has lost the exclusive right to use its iconic purple colour on chocolate bars after a bitter court battle with Swiss rival Nestle . Cadbury chocolate has carried its distinctive purple colouring since 1914, when it was adopted as a tribute to Queen Victoria . Today's decision opens up the possibility that rivals could launch a host of copycat products . The firm wanted to trademark the colour . Pantone 2865c – introduced in 1914 as a tribute to Queen Victoria – but . failed in a test case brought by its Swiss rival. While the challenge to Cadbury was brought by Nestle, the impact is that any supermarket or rival could now use ‘Cadbury purple’ on their products. The decision opens up the possibility that rivals could launch a host of copycat products to try and cash in on the success of the Dairy Milk bar and other products, such as Crispello and Heroes. The decision was announced by the Court of Appeal today and came as a shock after Cadbury had won its case at all earlier stages of the legal battle. Following a victory at an earlier stage, a spokesman said: ‘Purple is a colour that has been used by Cadbury for more than 100 years - the colour has always been associated with Cadbury. ‘Purple was Queen Victoria's favourite colour and the Cadbury brothers were loyal supporters of the Queen. We have gone to great lengths to guard our trademark rights and … We have been looking to protect the colour for years.. Workers pictured wrapping the Dairy Milk chocolates at the Cadbury factory at Bournville in 1930 . Advert for Cadbury's Daily Milk bar in 1905, before it had adopted its purple colour . Cadbury was given a royal warrant by Queen Victoria in February 1854 - making the company the official cocoa and chocolate makers for the monarch. Among its adverts from that era is one showing Victoria drinking Cadbury's Cocoa while sitting in a train. The . firm first introduced the purple - her favourite colour - in 1914 as a tribute to her and it . has identified its products on sweet shop shelves ever since. Cadbury Dairy Milk started out in pale mauve with a red script. The full Dairy Milk range became purple and gold in 1920. The Cadbury family were one of the . driving forces of philanthropy in the late stages of the Victorian era, . when society grew more reflective on what had been an age of growing . social and economic division. The . industrial revolution had driven prosperity and attracted millions of . people to the cities in search of work. Yet millions of those workers . lived in abject poverty as characterised in the works of Charles Dickens . and other authors. As Quakers, the Cadbury family . believed tea, coffee and cocoa beverages could serve as an alternative . to alcohol, seen to be a cause of poverty and deprivation among the . working classes. The . Bournville factory was built in 1879 and, in 1893, as part of the . company's altruistic vision, saw the creation of a 120-acre village of . better housing for its workers. However, the company founded in Bournville, Birmingham, and controversially taken over by Kraft of the USA in 2010 in a deal worth £11.5billion will now have to think again. The holding company for the famous British brand is now called Mondelez. The court case turned on a technicality and whether the language used by Cadbury in an application to trademark the colour had been clear. The three Court of Appeal judges decided it had not and therefore denied the confectionary company’s attempt to claim exclusive use of it. In the past, Nestle has been accused of undermining Cadbury products with its Quality Street My Purple chocolate bar, which had a similar wrapper. A spokesman for the firm said: ‘We welcome the Court of Appeal’s decision to uphold Nestlé’s objection against Mondelez’s proposal to trade mark its Dairy Milk ‘Purple’ colour across a broad range of products. We believe this was the right outcome from a legal perspective.’ Cadbury insisted that even if it does not have exclusive use of the particular shade of purple, it will take action against anyone who tries to copy or pass off their products as looking like Dairy Milk. A spokesman said: ‘We are disappointed by this latest decision but it’s important to point out that it does not affect our long held right to protect our distinctive colour purple from others seeking to pass off their products as Cadbury chocolate. ‘Our colour purple has been linked with Cadbury for a century and the British public has grown up understanding its link with our chocolate. ‘We are studying this particular ruling and will consider our next steps which includes the possibility of an appeal.’ Fiona McBride, partner and trademark attorney at Withers & Rogers, said: ‘This is a massive blow to Cadbury and has made it even more difficult for brand owners to obtain trade mark protection for use of a colour. ‘Seeking colour protection has never been easy or straightforward – it is necessary to demonstrate that consistent use of a specific colour over a period of time has led it becoming recognised as synonymous with the brand. 'With a heritage dating back to the 1920s, Cadbury had hoped that it had been using the colour purple for long enough.' Founder John Cadbury . 1824: John Cadbury opened a grocer's shop in . Bull Street, a fashionable part of Birmingham. Goods include cocoa and . drinking chocolate. 1831: John Cadbury moved into manufacturing, . renting a small factory in Crooked Lane, Birmingham, to make cocoa and . drinking chocolate. 1847: With business booming, a larger factory was rented in the centre of Birmingham on Bridge Street. 1861: Richard and George Cadbury took over the business from their father John who was in poor health.

The common cold regularly tops the list of reasons for school absence - no surprise there. But the second most cited cause is irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). One mother who knows only too well how debilitating the condition can be is Claire McKee. Her son Elliott first developed symptoms when he started full-time at school at the age of four. 'He started getting bad tummy aches,' recalls Claire. 'Every night he would be clutching his tummy and crying in agony. I would try to cuddle him to sleep. 'In the mornings Elliott would spend ages in the loo, suffering frequent bouts of diarrhoea. It was awful watching him in pain and not being able to do anything. 'He'd be terrified he wouldn't be able to get to the loo in time at school or that his classmates would notice the smell.' Claire's GP ordered blood tests to rule out serious digestive disorders such as coeliac and Crohn's disease. These came back clear. Elliott was then referred to a dietician, who suggested eliminating various foods to see if the problem was a food allergy or intolerance. Again the results were negative. It was only after talking to a friend, a long-term sufferer of irritable bowel syndrome, that Claire put two and two together. 'It was a lightbulb moment,' says Claire, from Billingshurst, West Sussex. 'Elliott's symptoms matched my friend's almost exactly.' The symptoms of IBS are triggered when muscles in the large intestine become sensitised and contract. The underlying cause is unknown, but stress can be a trigger. 'I realised Elliott's problems had coincided with him starting full-time at school,' says Claire. 'He didn't get on with his new teacher and that's when it began. 'Yet when we'd gone to Portugal in the school holidays, the symptoms disappeared. 'It was a relief to realise that Elliott didn't have some horrible illness, but a shock to find out there was no cure.' While as many as one adult in three will suffer from IBS at some point, many don't realise children can also be affected. Indeed, one study suggested that 20 per cent of children suffer from IBS symptoms. The peak ages are from four to 12. So how can parents tell if their child has a simple tummy ache or IBS? Surprising: The second most cited cause for school absence is IBS . 'Most children will have bowel upsets and tummy aches when they're having a stressful time but it usually goes away,' says Professor Nick Read, a gastroenterologist and adviser to the IBS Network. 'To be diagnosed with IBS requires symptoms going on for a month or two.' Children should first be screened for coeliac and Crohn's. 'Once these have been ruled out, IBS is the usual diagnosis,' he says. 'Children don't suddenly get IBS at 15; they've probably always had it but it was put down to “toddler diarrhoea” or tummy troubles. 'The problem is that IBS is simply a name for a collection of symptoms that have no medical cause.' One theory is that because IBS tends to be more common in the West, our diets, high in refined carbohydrates such as white bread, cakes and pasta, may play a part. There are certain predisposing factors, adds Dr Aminda De Silva, a gastroenterologist at the Royal Berkshire hospital. 'Gastrointestinal infections are one, dietary sensitivities another, but the key thing is stress.' Although there is no cure, there is plenty you can do to help, says Professor Read. 'The doctor must try to understand the child and find out the cause of the stress. This might mean working with the parents.' For adults, guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggest hypnotherapy or counselling, and while they don't specifically refer to children under 18, 'there's good evidence that these are helpful', he adds. 'The key is getting teenagers to understand what's happening in their lives to make the symptoms happen.' Precautions: If you suspect your child might have IBS, have them screened first for coeliac and Crohn's . Children with IBS often dread going to school and live in fear of their friends finding out, says Michael Mahoney, a hypnotherapist with 25 years' experience who specialises in IBS and works with children in the North-West via GP referral. 'One main fear is that they won't be able to get to the loo in time, and that can make them fearful of leaving the house at all. 'It's usually safe to say that the symptoms are learned responses and perhaps began as a result of previous gastro-intestinal upset, but lingered on.' Mr Mahoney adds: 'Sometimes the symptoms could also be a subconscious way for the child to obtain focus on themselves. Parents of younger children, especially, may actually contribute to  symptoms continuing. 'I try to teach children that every thought has a physical response, and that they can learn to get rid of negative thoughts to reduce anxiety and IBS symptoms.' Children with IBS are often advised to change their diet as some foods can trigger an attack, perhaps because they are harder to digest. They should also avoid caffeine, found in some fizzy drinks, which elevates the stress hormone cortisol. Dr Peter Irving, a gastroenterologist at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital and The London Clinic, has had promising results with a diet devised in Australia. The 'Low Fodmap' diet restricts foods containing poorly absorbed sugars called FODMAPs. 'It works on the principle that not all sugars can be absorbed within the small intestine,' says Dr Irving. 'As a result, they are rapidly fermented by bacteria in the bowel which draws in fluid and produces gas. 'This can cause symptoms including bloating, abdominal pain and diarrhoea.' Foods containing FODMAPs include honey, apples, pears, stone fruit such as peaches, onions, garlic, cabbage, beans and sweeteners such as sorbitol. Research at King's College Hospital found that 75 per cent of those on the diet saw their symptoms improve. Elliott, now 12, has learnt to manage his symptoms through trial and error. Certain foods, such as apples, seem to make matters worse, so he avoids these. 'He's doing well,' says Claire. theibsnetwork.org .","The underlying cause of IBS is unknown, but stress can be a trigger .

The errant ball plunged from the sky straight onto the head of a fan standing in the front row, sending him sprawling onto his backside to a collective gasp from all around him. Fore pity's sake! Only the man's legs can be seen in this shot as he falls back into the crowd moments after the errant ball struck him on the head .

David Cameron today claimed Britain had moved 'one step closer' to having a say on the European Union as the Commons backed an in-out referendum. In a landmark parliamentary 304 MPs voted in favour of a referendum, with none voting against as almost all Labour and Lib Dems MPs boycotted Westminster. There was loud cheering on the Commons' green benches as a backbench Bill, spearheaded by Tory MP James Wharton, cleared the first hurdle in its difficult battle to become law. Deal: David Cameron backed the referendum Bill championed by Tory MP James Wharton (right) Choice: The Prime Minister, who earlier met patients Kitty O'leary (left) and Alex Mulford (right) and his mother Mary during a visit to the Evelina London Children's Hospital, ridiculed Labour and Lib Dem opposition to a referendum . The PM has ordered all Tory MPs to back . legislation paving the way for a referendum on European Union membership . by the end of 2017. Last night he hosted a barbecue in the Number 10 gardens to persuade MPs . to stay in London today – rather than go to constituencies – for the landmark Commons vote . Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have dismissed the Bill as a stunt designed to shore up the Prime Minister's position with his rank and file - pointing out that it has virtually no chance of becoming law. But after the result was announced, Mr Cameron wrote on Twitter: 'Referendum Bill passes first Commons stage, bringing us one step closer to giving the British people a say on Europe.' As the Commons debate on legislating for a referendum by 2017 got under, Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs the European Union now lacks democratic legitimacy and must be reformed. Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons that the EU now lacks democratic legitimacy . Mr Hague said: 'The efforts of those . who want to build European integration without bringing the people with . them have been utterly self-defeating. 'The . EU now lacks democratic legitimacy because so many of those most . enthusiastic about ever-closer union have been afraid of asking what . people might think of it. He . added: 'No institution can survive without the people's support and the . EU that will emerge from the eurozone crisis may look very different . from the EU before the crisis.' Earlier Mr Wharton told the Daily Mail that Labour and the Liberal Democrats . are ‘running scared’ of confronting the issue. He said the legislation would mean future governments must change the . law if they want to reverse the plan – which he said is ‘politically . virtually impossible’. Prime steak? Mr Cameron flips burgers at the 10 Downing Street bbq for Conservative MPs . Cheers: Tory MP Dan Byles tweeted this photo (left) of a pint of Hook Norton in the Downing Street garden while MP Andrew Griffiths posed with the PM for a pint . Mr Wharton said the Bill would mean a ‘legal deadline’ for a . referendum to happen before the end of 2017. ‘It has been nearly 40 years since the British people last had . their say on Europe - and most of us have never had a say on Europe at all. I . wasn’t even born at the last referendum,’ he added. ‘In that time, so much has changed - the countries involved . and the powers the EU has, as well as the benefits and costs of membership. People feel that the EU has been heading in a direction they never signed up . to. This question about our membership is already there and ignoring it will . not make it go away. These concerns deserve to be heard and acted upon.’ Dismissing the idea that the legislation is worthless, since . it could simply be ignored by an incoming Labour government, the MP insisted: . ‘If my Bill is passed it would be legally impossible for a future government to . ignore it and, when you think about it, politically virtually impossible to . reverse it too.' Tongs: David Cameron is hosting a barbecue for Tory MPs tonight, in scenes reminiscent of when he grilled meat with US President Barack Obama in the Downing Street gardens . The Prime Minister adopted some hot dog diplomacy last night to persuade his MPs to stay for the Commons debate. Aide Sam Gyimah tweeted a picture of the Prime Minister ‘breaking a sweat as he flips burgers at No 10’ last night. Mr Cameron hunches over a grill, tongue between his teeth, as he chats to Chatham and Aylesford MP Tracey Crouch. The Eurosceptic wing of his party has . been a thorn in Mr Cameron’s side, but he is now courting support for . the Bill, as well as committing to a referendum if he wins the next . election. It has triggered a Coalition row, with the Prime Minister . saying Nick Clegg’s Lib Dems ‘have to get off the fence’. Mr Cameron is an old hand at the barbecue, having had a cook-out with US President Barack Obama. But his attempt to woo his MPs has not . won everyone over. One said: ‘In 2011 I was threatened with death for . voting for an EU referendum, now I’m whipped and invited to a ****ing . BBQ.’ Cuisine: The Prime Minister will be able to call on the services of the custom designed ith a Engelbrecht Grills & Cookers grill given to him by Barack Obama last year . The change of heart means that Britons . may be given their first say on Europe in nearly 40 years. The Bill’s . sponsor says Labour and Lib Dems are ‘running scared’ of the issue as . Tories prepare to back an in/out vote today. In a sign of crumbling Labour . discipline, shadow minister Ian Austin broke ranks to insist: ‘The truth . is the UK needs to decide and I would prefer it to do so more quickly. I . know this isn’t Labour Party policy, but my view is we should have a . referendum next year.’ Lib Dems have refused to accept a . coalition government Bill, but the Prime Minister has imposed a . three-line whip – the strongest possible instruction – for the vote . today, a highly unusual move for backbench legislation. That means . members of the Government who might vote against must resign. The legislation requires a national . referendum by the end of 2017 on the question: ‘Do you think the United . Kingdom should remain a member of the European Union?’ Mr Wharton added: 'The Bill says that the government - any future government - . must by the end of 2016 have set a date for a referendum by the end of 2017. So . any government that dared to try to ignore this law and deny the people a vote . could be taken to court by anyone. ‘Of course, if after the next election there’s a majority in . Parliament against a referendum - and what a tragedy that would be - a . different Government could try to pass a new law to scrap the referendum, but that . is a fundamental rule of our ancient constitution. ‘So, of course, if you want to be sure of having your say on . Britain’s place in Europe, then vote Conservative at the next election. But . even so it would take a Prime Minister and a Government of astonishing . arrogance to vote down a referendum that was already the law of the land.’ Cross-party: Tory MP James Wharton (left) is . pushing the referendum Bill to a vote in the Commons, but Labour MP Ian . Austin today said he thought his party should also back an in-out vote . Mr Wharton said that since the Conservatives do not have a . Commons majority, on the face of it today’s legislation would struggle to pass. ‘But the soundings I have taken suggest we could be on . course to clear the first hurdle towards putting the referendum on the statute . books. We have the backing of the Democratic Unionist Party,’ he said. ‘We just need a few Labour or Liberal Democrat MPs to . support the Bill. This isn’t about playing politics - it’s about letting the . British people have their say on one of the most important issues of today. I . would encourage them all to ignore the dictat of their leaderships, listen to . their constituents and vote for the Bill. 'I know there are MPs in other parties who want to. They need . not fear their leaderships. Ed Miliband and Lib Dem high command are running . scared - why else would they have told their MPs to stay away from Parliament . today? ‘Today marks the beginning of our attempt to make Britain’s . first referendum on Europe for 38 years happen. With a bit of help from MPs . from all Parties, my Bill could write an in-out referendum into law by the end . of 2017, the chance to finally let the British people have their say and decide . our future,’ he added. The Bill cleared the Commons tonight, but Labour . believes it will not succeed in reaching the statute book by the cut-off date . of May 2014, when the Parliamentary session comes to an end. The Bill is . likely to run into trouble in the House of Lords, where Conservatives are not . the largest party. A Labour source said: ‘It is our view that it is quite wrong . to legislate for an in/out referendum in 2017 which would create four years of . uncertainty, putting at risk the national interest and damaging British jobs . and the economy.’ Labour leader Ed Miliband urged MPs to dodge the Commons vote, calling it ‘a Tory gimmick’.","Prime Minister hosts Conservative get together to soothe relations .

Eating five meals a day - breakfast, lunch, dinner and two snacks - protects children against obesity, according to new research. A study of more than 4,000 Finnish youngsters found those who skipped breakfast were more likely to be overweight. The regular eating pattern also reduced the BMI (body mass index) increasing effect of eight gene mutations that cause obesity. Study of more than 4,000 Finnish youngsters found those who skipped breakfast were more likely to be overweight. Doctors claim the UK has the highest rate of child obesity in Western Europe . It means when eating five meals a day even those with a genetic predisposition to obesity were no heavier than their classroom peers. Doctors claim the UK has the highest rate of child obesity in Western Europe. Obesity has been linked with serious illnesses during childhood and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, asthma and breathing difficulties during sleep. National surveys in England suggest about three in ten children aged between two and 15 are overweight, while up to a fifth are obese. Boys and girls who stuck to a regular five meal a day regime were at less risk of being overweight and obese . The latest study followed participants from before birth up until the age of 16 and aimed to identify early life risk factors for obesity. It also investigated any association between the condition and meal frequency. Both boys and girls who stuck to a regular five meal a day regime were at less risk of being overweight and obese. The researchers also noted a particular reduction in excessive belly fat, or abdominal obesity, in boys which is most likely to trigger metabolic syndrome, a range of conditions that lead to diabetes and heart disease. Moreover, the eating pattern zapped the effect of the common fat causing genetic variants whereas missing breakfast was associated with greater BMI and waist circumference. Obesity has been linked with serious illnesses during childhood and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, asthma and breathing difficulties during sleep . The study also found mothers who gained more than seven kilograms (15.4lb) during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy increased the risk of obesity in the offspring. But maternal obesity before pregnancy was a greater risk factor than this, with the father being obese almost as important. The risk of obesity was strikingly high in adolescents whose parents were both overweight with a BMI of 25 or more throughout the 16 year follow up period. Anne Jaaskelainen, of the University of Eastern Finland, said: 'These findings emphasise the importance of taking an early whole family approach to childhood obesity prevention. 'Furthermore, it is important to be aware the effects of predisposing genotypes can be modified by lifestyle habits such as regular meal frequency.' The findings were published in International Journal of Obesity, International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases, and PLOS One.","Belly fat in boys was notably less when they ate five small meals a day .

A new government survey suggests the number of people seeking emergency treatment after consuming energy drinks has doubled nationwide during the past four years, the same period in which the supercharged drink industry has surged in popularity in convenience stores, bars and on college campuses. From 2007 to 2011, the government estimates the number of emergency room visits involving the neon-labeled beverages shot up from about 10,000 to more than 20,000. Most of those cases involved teens or young adults, according to a survey of the nation's hospitals released late last week by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Troubling spike: Dr. Steve Sun looks over a heart monitor display in the ER at St. Mary's Medical Center in San Francisco after seeing a first-hand increase in energy-drink related cases . The report doesn't specify which symptoms brought people to the emergency room but calls energy drink consumption a 'rising public health problem' that can cause insomnia, nervousness, headache, fast heartbeat and seizures that are severe enough to require emergency care. Several emergency physicians said they had seen a clear uptick in the number of patients suffering from irregular heartbeats, anxiety and heart attacks who said they had recently downed an energy drink. More than half of the patients considered in the survey who wound up in the emergency room told doctors they had downed only energy drinks. In 2011, about 42 percent of the cases involved energy drinks in combination with alcohol or drugs, such as the stimulants Adderall or Ritalin. 'A lot of people don't realize the strength of these things. I had someone come in recently who had drunk three energy drinks in an hour, which is the equivalent of 15 cups of coffee,' said Howard Mell, an emergency physician in the suburbs of Cleveland, who serves as a spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians. Suppliers: From 2007 to 2011, the U.S. government estimates the number of emergency room visits involving the energy drinks, a few brands shown, shot up from about 10,000 to more than 20,000 . 'Essentially he gave himself a stress test and thankfully he passed. But if he had a weak heart or suffered from coronary disease and didn't know it, this could have precipitated very bad things.' The findings came as concerns over energy drinks have intensified following reports last fall of 18 deaths possibly tied to the drinks — including a 14-year-old Maryland girl who died after drinking two large cans of Monster Energy drinks. Monster does not believe its products were responsible for the death. Two senators are calling for the Food and Drug Administration to investigate safety concerns about energy drinks and their ingredients. The energy drink industry says its drinks are safe and there is no proof linking its products to the adverse reactions. Late last year, the FDA asked the U.S. Health and Human Services to update the figures its substance abuse research arm compiles about emergency room visits tied to energy drinks. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health . Services Administration's survey was based on responses it receives from . about 230 hospitals each year, a representative sample of about 5 . percent of emergency departments nationwide. The agency then uses those . responses to estimate the number of energy drink-related emergency . department visits nationwide. Results: Dr Sun is seen in his hospital days after a report called energy drink consumption a 'rising public health problem' that can cause insomnia, nervousness, headache, fast heartbeat and seizures that are severe enough to require emergency care . The more than 20,000 cases estimated for 2011 represent a small portion of the annual 136 million emergency room visits tracked by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The FDA said it was considering the findings and pressing for more details as it undertakes a broad review of the safety of energy drinks and related ingredients this spring. 'We will examine this additional information ... as a part of our ongoing investigation into potential safety issues surrounding the use of energy-drink products,' FDA spokeswoman Shelly Burgess said in a statement. Beverage manufacturers fired back at the survey, saying the statistics were misleading and taken out of context. 'This report does not share information about the overall health of those who may have consumed energy drinks, or what symptoms brought them to the ER in the first place,' the American Beverage Association said in a statement. 'There is no basis by which to understand the overall caffeine intake of any of these individuals — from all sources.' Energy drinks remain a small part of the . carbonated soft drinks market, representing only 3.3 percent of sales . volume, according to the industry tracker Beverage Digest. Even as soda . consumption has flagged in recent years, energy drinks sales are growing . rapidly. Ratio: The more than 20,000 energy drink-related emergency visits estimated for 2011 represent a small portion of the annual 136 million emergency room visits tracked by the CDC . In 2011, sales volume for energy drinks rose by almost 17 percent, with the top three companies — Monster, Red Bull and Rockstar — each logging double-digit gains, Beverage Digest found. The drinks are often marketed at sporting events that are popular among younger people such as surfing and skateboarding. From 2007 to 2011, the most recent year for which data was available, people from 18 to 25 were the most common age group seeking emergency treatment for energy drink-related reactions, the report found. 'We were really concerned to find that in four years the number of emergency department visits almost doubled, and these drinks are largely marketed to younger people,' said Al Woodward, a senior statistical analyst with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration who worked on the report. Emergency physician Steve Sun said he had seen an increase in such cases at the Catholic hospital where he works on the edge of San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. 'I saw one young man who had mixed energy drinks with alcohol and we had to admit him to the hospital because he was so dehydrated he had renal failure,' Sun said. 'Because he was young he did well in the hospital, but if another patient had had underlying coronary artery disease, it could have led to a heart attack.'","Survey by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration: ER visits involving energy drinks doubled from 10,000 to more than 20,000 .

She doesn't realize how important it is,' her mother Nicole told Click Orlando after Ireland's latest fitting. Ireland will have to return to Orlando Prosthetics Associates every three to four months until she stops growing, but the accident has failed to stop the ambitious toddler. On a support Facebook page, set up to help raise funds for Ireland's medical bills, the toddler has been pictured playing on a trampoline and learning to walk again. Her mother has also talked of Ireland's excitement at being able to start ballet lessons. Fitting: Ireland helps hospital staff make a dressing for her leg .

Her bright attitude is helping the family come to terms with the freak accident and long road to recovery. 'We take it day by day and as long as she's happy were happy,' Mrs Nugent said. Her daughter recently celebrated her third birthday, with a princess themed party. 'It's just not her birthday to us, it's just a celebration of being here,' Mrs Nugent told the Tampa Bay Times.

And at £69.99, the Ear Force PX22 comes in at the cheaper end of the spectrum. Thankfully, although aesthetically it's not the prettiest headset out there, it packs a solid punch in the sound department. Take its engine room, the 50mm speakers coupled with comfortable memory foam ear cushions to block out sound. Or the inline amp, that allows you to adjust bass and treble levels. Sound of success: However, few will warm to the PX22's looks and the memory foam is not particularly comfy . That's not forgetting independent volume controls for chat and the ability to connect your mobile phone and take calls and stream music while playing. There's no Dolby Surround found in higher-end models, but it's USB-powered, so there is no need for batteries and features Dynamic Chat Boost, that automatically raises chat volume during more intense gaming battles. There's no denying then, that the PX22 sounds like a bit of bargain, packing plenty of low-end thump, crisp pitches and minimal distortion. Sadly, all this performance comes at the expense of its design. They're too light, feel flimsy and give the impression they'd break easily. The memory foam, too, looks rather 'stuck on' compared with more top-end models, such as the XP Seven. This is likely to not bother many looking to use the headset at home, however, given the PX22's mobile phone compatibility, it's a shame stave off more multi-purpose use. With all gaming headsets, comfort is key. And while the memory foam and adjustable band fits snugly around many-a-head, most will find the need to give their ears a breather every hour or so. Upgrade: For more serious gamers, the XP Seven headset, retailing for around £180 ($279), is the way to go . However, take nothing away from the PX22. It's a fine piece of kit and a worthy entry-level offering for those taking their first steps into more immersive gaming. The PX22 and XP Seven are available from Amazon, Lime and GAME.

After five years of trying for a baby, Julie Cummings was beginning to wonder if it would ever happen. She had taken fertility drugs for two years, to no avail. Eventually, she and her husband David decided to resort to IVF. But weeks before the treatment was due to begin, Mrs Cummings became pregnant – after giving up bread. Julie Cummings was told IVF was her only chance of conceiving a child following five years of trying with no success . The result was the couple’s daughter Maisie, now two, who was born two weeks late in January 2011 after a healthy pregnancy. Mrs Cummings, a 37-year-old engineer, stopped eating foods containing high levels of yeast on the advice of a nutritionist, who she went to see because she wanted to adopt a healthier lifestyle before starting IVF. She explained: ‘I cut out potatoes, bread, garlic bread, toast from my diet, and mainly ate just vegetables and fruit. I also took some health supplements. ‘Two months later – that was the only change I had made for five and a half years – and I was pregnant. ‘Now we are just very happy, especially after everything we went through, that Maisie’s come into our life.’ She and David, 50, met in Germany in 2004, when they were both in the military, and started trying for a baby a year later. After nine months with no luck, Mrs Cummings went to see an army medic and was eventually diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, which stops eggs being released. Mrs Cummings, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said: ‘They said I’d need extra help to get pregnant and that it wouldn’t go away on its own. ‘They recommended I go to a fertility clinic in Hertfordshire, where I started on a course of treatment.’ Julie was pregnant with her daughter Maisie within two months and she was born in 2011 after a healthy pregnancy . Mrs Cummings took clomid, a fertility drug used to help re-balance the body’s hormones to increase the chance of ovulation, for more than two years – without success. Doctors told her the next step would be IVF. But when she visited Caroline Sproule, a nutrition and fertility consultant at Bromsgrove Allergy and Nutrition Centre, she was told she was suffering from an infection caused by an overgrowth of a fungus called Candida albicans. This is encouraged by eating foods that contain yeast, such as bread. One of its side effects is menstrual problems, including the stopping of periods altogether, which in turn prevents pregnancy. In March 2010, Mrs Cummings had her first period in six months and by April the same year she was pregnant. She added: ‘I didn’t really go to  the centre to get pregnant, just to stand me in good stead for IVF but thankfully we didn’t have to go down that route. ‘It just shows what years of abuse – drinking too much and eating the wrong things – can do to your body.’","Julie Cummings, 37, met her husband in 2004 while in the military .

The morning found me with a slight champagne hangover and the smudged remains of the previous evening's carefully applied make-up on an unfamiliar pillow. It was the morning after the night I'd been fretting about for the previous two-and-a half weeks, and the prospect of which had terrified me for the past three years. I had just spent the night with Stephen - the first man I'd been intimate with since the break-up of my 15-year marriage. This was the first time in 20 years that I'd found myself lying beside a sleeping form with whom I'd shared none of life's major milestones: not children, not mortgage, not wedding. Karen Glaser says the thought of being intimate with another man sent me into a mild panic . All we'd shared were a few jolly nights out, where we'd tentatively opened up to each other. As I mulled this over in this strange bedroom, I was overwhelmed with confusion. Here I was sharing a bed with a man about whom I knew so little, he didn't even know whether to offer me tea or coffee. The encounter had left me experiencing such a torrent of emotion, what did it say about the new, unfettered me? But at the same time I still fizzed with the euphoria I'd revelled in the night before. I'd done it. I had returned to a strange land where I hadn't thought I belonged any more. A club to which I - a 45-year-old with a body battle-scarred by time and childbirth - thought my membership had expired. It's a place more and more middle-aged women like me find themselves nowadays, as marriages break down and society now fully expects - indeed encourages - us to embrace the dating scene again with the same gusto we displayed in our youth. Not so long ago, a newly single woman in her 40s, with two children, would have been expected by society to put on a brave face, say nothing of the pain caused by her divorce and resign herself to celibacy. But today, in a society where 42 per cent of marriages end, leaving thousands of women in their 40s like me, bruised and lonely, there is a belief that middle-aged women can and should find new love. I was not of that mind, though, when my husband and I split up three years ago. I didn't expect to find love again, and, besides, the thought of being intimate with another man sent me into a mild panic. The creeping waistline, the not-so-perky breasts... how on earth could I ever undress in front of someone again? To a man who has been with you through two pregnancies, stretchmarks are one thing. The thought of a new lover appraising them on your naked form is quite another. Add to that the fact that I hadn't even properly disrobed in front of my ex in the dying years of our relationship and you can imagine the fear sex with a new partner instilled in me. My ex and I had become more like brother and sister than Mr and Mrs, and, like many siblings, we fought like cat and dog. But the things we argued about were far from familial. They were the classic gripes of long-haul coupledom: housework, childcare and money. In the end, the brawls became so unpleasant, so frequent and so personal that I asked for a separation. On May 1, 2010, my husband left the family home, leaving me alone with our two children, then aged nine and two. 'To a man who has been with you through two pregnancies, stretchmarks are one thing,' she says . In the event, it was, thank goodness, a relatively cordial separation - when my ex visits the children, he often stays with us. After the split I felt sad for my daughter and son. When I had planned my family, this was not how I imagined life would turn out. But I also felt tremendous relief. It was so wonderful to be single again. To have no one to argue with. To go to bed on my own. To not find dirty socks under the bed, and stubble in the sink. But, inevitably, this euphoria didn't last. After a couple of months, I was utterly exhausted. Every working mother with young children knows how difficult it is to do two jobs. Well, if you are a single working mother, it is twice as hard. It left me with little inclination and no energy for another relationship. I wasn't even thinking about dating, let alone sex, at all. That part of me had shut down. My sexuality was in a Snow White-sleep, from which I had neither the courage nor the desire to wake. The wild, sensual woman I'd been in my 20s felt like a person I'd once known but no longer had anything in common with. So, two years later, I all but ignored the flirtatious man who had recently moved into my mansion block. Well, I say flirtatious, but if I'm honest, I felt so off the sexual map that when we bumped into each other on the stairs and he complimented me on an item of clothing, or a new haircut, I thought he was just being friendly. Or gay. I mean, how many red-blooded men in their 50s can recognise kitten heels? 'Very Audrey Hepburn,' he quipped approvingly as I waited in the lobby in a pair one evening. But Steve persisted. For a few weeks that spring, the door to our building kept sticking. One day, he buzzed my intercom at dawn to be let in. Karen worried about her the not-so-perky breasts and creeping waistline . He came up to thank me and when, bleary-eyed, I opened the door to my flat, he joked to the male friend with him: 'Shame. I was hoping we might catch her in her nightie.' I blushed furiously. A fortnight later, I rushed in after the school run wearing scruffy Ugg boots, jeans and - worst of all - no make-up, and there he was again, in the hallway, flicking through his post. 'I'm taking the morning off to play 18 holes,' he said, patting the bulging golf bag next to him. 'Fancy playing with me?' I declined and bounded up the stairs, my face brick-red. But the penny was slowly dropping. I realised that I'd started caring about my appearance again. I started going to the gym, determined to lose a stone. Meanwhile, Steve's admiring glances and gentle compliments were gradually becoming part of my life. Could it be that my long somnolent sexuality was finally re-awakening? 'There's a new man in our block,' I giggled to a friend over a bottle of wine one evening. 'I think he might be flirting with me. And I really like him.' In the end, our Edwardian mansion block, gave us an excuse to get to know each other slowly. An antiques restorer by trade, when the building's grand wooden staircase needed work, Steve was the obvious man for the job. This led to several weeks of after-hours conversations at my kitchen table, discussing mahogany banisters. Fervent conversations that were ostensibly about work but which were really thinly-disguised dates. Finally, he asked me on a proper one, two weeks hence. Sex is like riding a bike: no matter how long since you have been on the saddle, you never forget how . That was when the thought first struck me: what if things progressed and I had to peel off? For although I was feeling fitter and more attractive than at any time since having my daughter 11 years before, disrobing was still a terrifying thought. As it happened, the date itself was a total blast. We went to London's Soho, rode in a rickshaw and had dinner in a lovely Chinese restaurant where Steve ordered ginger lobster with scallions. As we ate, Steve's hand gently caressed my knee. We were quite clearly building up to the First Kiss. It finally happened on a furious main road at 1.30 am while we were waiting for a cab to take us back to North London. Not the most intimate of locations for my first post-marriage kiss, but no matter. It was long and emotional, and I knew I had reached a milestone. Later that night, an even bigger milestone beckoned. Sex. On the journey home, we kissed again and, after alighting from the taxi, enjoyed a passionate embrace on the pavement outside our block. The next step was obvious - even to out-of-practice me. In the event, my fears and insecurities dwindled to nothing. Sex, I can report, is like riding a bike: no matter how long it is since you have been on the saddle, you never forget how to cycle. Equally pleasing is that in the heat of the moment, men don't actually notice your cellulite, meaty upper arms or other imperfections. Nor did I sit back and critically appraise Steve's 50-something body either. Our sexuality and taste had matured with us. Today, I am enjoying the most rewarding relationship of my life thanks to the chemistry which exists between us. Between the sheets, Steve and I simply click. Yes, my body is less pert than it once was, but, despite all those hang-ups before Steve and I became lovers, I suddenly feel happier in my own skin. I would say to any divorced, middle-aged woman terrified of contemplating sex with a man other than her husband, to put those fears to one side and embrace an exciting new chapter in her life.After all, I'm  happy proof that when it comes to sex, life can indeed begin in your post-divorce 40s.","Karen Glaser, 45, found herself single after a 15-year marriage .

Mentally ill: Leatrice Brewer admitted she drowned the children in the bathtub of her apartment in New Cassel, on Long Island about 20 miles east of New York City, in February 2008 . A mentally disturbed woman who drowned her three young children in a bathtub is going to court to ask a judge for a cut of their $350,000 estate. Leatrice Brewer will be taken from an upstate psychiatric facility to testify about her request next month, Nassau County Surrogate's Court Judge Edward McCarty ruled Thursday. Brewer, 33, was found not guilty because of mental disease or defect in the deaths of her children, Jewell, six, Michael, five, and Innocent, one, so her attorneys say she shouldn't be subject to laws that bar convicts from profiting from their crimes. Brewer admitted she drowned the children in the bathtub of her apartment in New Cassel, on Long Island about 20 miles east of New York City, in February 2008. She later placed the children's bodies on a bed and tried to kill herself by swallowing a concoction of household cleaning chemicals. When that suicide bid failed, she jumped out her second-story window but again survived. Instead of facing trial on three murder counts in the children's deaths, Brewer pleaded not responsible by reason of mental disease or defect. Psychiatrists had determined she suffered a major depressive disorder and believed she killed the children to save them from the potentially fatal effects of voodoo. Brewer is being kept at a state psychiatric hospital until psychiatrists determine she's no longer mentally ill. Although the case would establish a precedent in New York if Brewer succeeds, she's not expected to see any money because of a $1.2 million lien against her for psychiatric counseling and other services she has received since her arrest, attorneys said. New York's Son of Sam Law, named for the 1970s serial killer and amended in 2001, was designed to prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes, such as by selling their stories to book publishers or moviemakers. The judge in Brewer's case, though, has noted the unique aspect — that Brewer wasn't convicted. Happy children: Brewer drowned Jewell Ward (left), six, and Michael Demesyeux (right), five, as well as their one-year-old brother Innocent (not pictured) The case drew attention to Nassau County's social services agency, whose caseworkers visited Brewer's apartment two days before the killings and found no one home but neglected to schedule an immediate follow-up visit. Two social workers were later suspended. Lawsuits against the county filed by the father of Brewer's 1-year-old son, Innocent Demesyeux, and 5-year-old son, Michael Demesyeux, were settled for $250,000. A lawsuit filed by the father of Brewer's 6-year-old daughter, Jewell Ward, was recently settled for $100,000.","Leatrice Brewer drowned children, aged 1, 5 and 6, at home on Long Island .

Students at Oxford University have been branded 'unpatriotic hypocrites' after they refused to hang a portrait of the Queen - because she was 'born into privilege'. Undergraduates at Keble College wanted to spend £200 on a picture of Her Majesty to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee. But college members - whose alumni include the Duke of Kent’s grandson Edward Windsor - voted against the portrait because it promoted elitism. Student representative Basil Vincent defended the decision. He said: 'I think that some saw the portrait as potentially divisive. 'The general feeling was that enough is already being done to commemorate Her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee.' Another Keble student added: 'Nearly £200 to support someone who was born into a certain family is not really economical use of money. 'The Royal family do nothing but sit on their backsides and wave at people. 'They have never had to work in their lives and just live off their ancestor’s money. 'Also, we have a lot of international students and it is not fair to show some kind of political allegiance they do not agree with.' Only 17 students voted for the patriotic painting to be bought while 54 voted against. But the decision has angered student Alexander King, who proposed the patriotic motion. Oxford: A student at another college called Keble members 'hypocrites' for criticising the 'elitist' monarchy . He said: 'I proposed the motion as I felt in this Jubilee year it was important to recognise the glorious service the Queen has given this country. 'It was voted down mainly on the spurious contention that it would be divisive. 'I feel very sad that on this issue Keble has shown itself to be woefully out of touch with the rest of the British population, 80 percent of whom currently support the monarchy.” Another student, from nearby Worcester College, said: 'I couldn’t believe it when I heard they had decided not to put up a portrait of the Queen. 'They have become a laughing stock of the university. 'How they can have the audacity to say it was rejected because she is born into a privileged family is beyond me. 'It is totally unpatriotic and very hypocritical considering the intake at Keble. 'I’d say 90 percent of the students at that college are born into rich families and have spent their lives living off their parents.'

The New York City Marathon's finish area will again fill with spectators, some carrying bags. More bomb-sniffing dogs also will be roaming around. Less than seven months after the attack on the Boston Marathon, runners and fans will pack the streets of New York's five boroughs next month. The increased security will be unmistakable, from barriers around Central Park to added checkpoints. Marathon organizer New York Road Runners, though, decided it would be impractical to ban bags from the finish area. Spectators are encouraged to bring no more than one per person, no larger than the size of a purse. Safeguards: Organizers of the New York City Marathon have announced they will be upping security at finish line come November 3. Above, a picture of the finish line at 2009's race . When NYRR President Mary Wittenberg describes the race-day scene the group wants to celebrate, it's the same qualities that make the massive event vulnerable. 'It is that intersection of spectator and neighbor and volunteer and the runners of New York and from around the world, and everybody coming out cheering for each other, inspiring each other, that makes it the marathon,' Wittenberg said Thursday, a month before the November 3 race. For a major marathon in the Northeast, those images are, for now, distant memories. Last year's NYC Marathon never happened. The damage from Superstorm Sandy forced its cancellation, but not before many New Yorkers decried city and race officials' initial plans to go on with the event. And not before thousands of entrants from around the world flew to the city, encouraged by those first assurances that the race was on. Back on the road: Last year the marathon was cancelled due to the damage caused by Superstorm Sandy. Above, marathoners cross the Verrazano-Narrows bridge into Brooklyn . Then on April 15 in Boston, two bombs exploded near the finish line, killing three people and injuring more than 260. Less than 24 hours after the bombings, NYRR staffers met. They vowed not to scale down the size and spectacle of their race that so appeal to fans and runners alike. NYRR's operations team later spent two days huddling with its counterparts at the Boston and Chicago marathons (Chicago's race is October 13). The organization also hired an outside consulting firm to audit its security practices and shifted some personnel from general logistics to security matters, said Peter Ciaccia, the race's technical director. Key staffers and volunteers will receive new training in emergency management. The 2001 marathon took place less than two months after the September 11 attacks, so security has been heightened ever since. Now it will be tightened even more. Never again: The increased security is being put in place in light of the bombings at the Boston Marathon finish line last April . Securing the start at Staten Island is straightforward because of its location — Fort Wadsworth. The bridges on the race course are similarly restrictive. But the finish is in Central Park, a sprawling public space. Barriers will be erected around it, and people can enter only through a few designated checkpoints where bags will be searched. There will be additional checkpoints to reach the marathon course. Wittenberg said banning bags from the bleachers around the finish area was considered, but organizers decided spectators needed to carry clothing and provisions for themselves and the runners they plan to meet afterward. Runners will be prohibited from wearing hydration vests. Brothers in crime: Above, surveillance footage near the finish line of last year's Boston Marathon shows alleged bombers Dzokhar, left, and Tamerlan, right,  Tsarnaev. Investigators say they hid their IEDs in their backpacks . Security along the course will be handled by the police. NYPD spokesman John McCarthy didn't want to go into details Thursday. 'We will advise of traffic conditions, road closures and security measures at the appropriate time, closer to the event,' he said. Wittenberg said NYRR had heard little . concern from entrants about security risks.

"British and Russia refused to release key documents at his inquest . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:36 EST, 5 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 5 October 2013 . Truth: Marina Litvinenko has made a passionate plea for cash to fund a public inquiry into her husband's death . The tearful widow of poisoned Russian Spy Alexander Litvinenko yesterday tearfully appealed for donations to fund a legal challenge to probe his death. Mr Litvinenko died after he drank tea that had been spiked with radioactive polonium-210 with two former KGB colleagues at a hotel in London in 2006. Claims have been made that he was recruited by MI6 after fleeing Russia and the Government has ‘established’ Moscow has a ‘prima facie case’ to answer for his assassination. An inquest had been looking into his death with both the British and Russian governments refusing to release key documents. Coroner Sir Robert Owen asked for a public inquiry, saying that he could not hear evidence in public at a normal inquest linked to the alleged involvement of the Russian state in Mr Litvinenko’s death. Despite his request, Home Secretary Theresa May decided in May the inquest should proceed, and the question whether to hold a public inquiry or other form of further investigation should be decided after a verdict was returned. But Marina Litvinenko has applied for a judicial review to reverse Mrs May’s decision. However, she lost a ‘protected costs’ order at the High Court on Thursday. This means that despite her lawyers working for free, if Mrs Litvinenko loses the legal challenge she will have to pay the Government’s costs of £40,000. Mrs Litvinenko burst into tears while speaking to journalists yesterday where she said without financial help she would lose ‘almost everything’. She said: ‘This is a very important . time for me and I have to make a serious decision. I only want to get to . the truth. I have 48 hours to decide. ‘This is the only chance to get to the truth and justice. I absolutely just cannot give up. This is no ordinary case. ‘Sacha . (Mr Litvinenko) was a British citizen and he was killed in Britain.’ The inquest has been given written arguments by the Met Police to allow . two officers to give evidence anonymously. Poisoned: Alexander Litvinenko lies in his hospital bed three weeks after drinking tea spiked with radioactive polonium-210 with two former KGB colleagues at a hotel in London . Legal arguments made by the Press – including the Daily Mail – argued for full disclosure and open hearings despite not being allowed to see the police’s argument. Counsel for the inquiry, Hugh Davies QC, told the court that the Met Police’s own risk management for the safety of witnesses from attacks by ‘Foreign Intelligence Services’ had been downgraded from ‘possibly’ to ‘unlikely’. Sir Robert Owen said: ‘It remains my . concern that there will be the greatest amount of public disclosure.’ Further arguments on the anonymity of witnesses were held in secret in . which both the Press and public were not allowed to attend. The . death of 43-year-old Mr Litvinenko, a fugitive from the Putin regime, . in 2006 plunged Anglo-Russian relations into a deep freeze. The former KGB agent became violently sick after visiting former colleagues in a hotel in Mayfair, central London.

Mrs Litvinenko believes MI6 failed to protect her husband from the Russians. Former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry Kovtun, who met him at the Millennium Hotel, are prime suspects in the murder. Both deny involvement.

Ellie Sandywell wears the Help for Heroes band in honour of her cousin and brother, who are both in the military. But teachers confiscated it because they said she might injure herself by getting the wristband caught on a door handle.

Outrage: Ellie's mother Elizabeth Hassall, left, was shocked when her daughter's wristband was confiscated . 11-year-old Ellie decided to start wearing the wristband, which raises money for injured troops, to support her cousin Ethan Millard, 17, who serves in the RAF, and her brother Joshua, 20, who is training to join the Royal Marines. 'I was given a choice of handing over my band or getting a red letter, which is something you get for bad behaviour,' she said. 'I was told off in front of all the class and I just wish I could have been quietly spoken to about it and I could have explained that I wear it in support of my cousin and brother.

Charity: Proceeds from the sale of the Help for Heroes wristband go to help wounded troops . 'I know that things like earrings and nail varnish are not part of the uniform, but I think a charity wristband is a bit different,' she said. 'I went into school and spoke to the teacher about it, and was told they would continue to confiscate it because she's breaking health and safety rules. 'I was stunned when they sent a newsletter to all parents on Thursday saying that they could get them snared of door handles and get injured. 'They are made of rubber, in all likelihood they would snap if that happened. And what about watches and blazers that can get caught on things - are they going to ban them now? 'In my eyes, wearing a wristband is exactly the same as wearing a poppy, so what are they going to do when it comes to Remembrance Day? 'I can't remember a day where Ellie hasn't worn her wristband and I think it's quite nice that she's so young and understands the importance of wearing it all the time.' School: Ellie is a pupil at University Primary Academy in Stoke-on-Trent . Letter: The school wrote to all parents warning them not to allow children to wear wristbands to class . Another parent at the school, who did not want to be named, added: 'To ban a charity wristband is wrong anyway - but banning them because they are dangerous is just ludicrous.' Headteacher Sara Stevenson said that only the official school uniform could be worn due to safety concerns. 'While the Academy fully supports many charities, we also have to maintain high standards in health and safety and in presentation,' she said. 'Rubber and plastic wristbands are not permitted in school because, not only do they not form part of our school uniform, but if they were to get caught on items such as door handles they may cause injury. 'Pupils are allowed to attach their wristbands or other decorations to school bags to show their support for their chosen charities. Any wrist bands worn at school will be kept safe by the class teacher until the end of the school day.' Last month the school became an academy for 202 pupils between the ages of four and eleven after the University of Chester Academies Trust took over failing Maryhill Primary School, which was placed into special measures by Ofsted in June last year.","Ellie Sandywell, 11, wears the wristband to support her brother and cousin .

Some people claim to be unable to function properly early in the morning, while others are most productive at the crack of dawn and now German researchers believe they understand why. Scientists have discovered for the first time that there are structural brain differences between early risers and people who naturally find themselves staying up late. They believe these differences could help unlock why some night owls are more prone to depression and can suffer from a form of chronic jet lag. German scientists have discovered for the first time that there are structural brain differences between early risers (pictured) and people known as night owls who naturally stay up late . Researchers from Aachen University in Germany believe approximately 10 per cent of people can be catagorised as 'morning people,' while around 20 per cent are true night owls and find themselves staying up late without any effort. They think all remaining humans have relatively normal body clocks, which are determined by chronotypes, New Scientist reported. The scientists have built on previous research that indicates people who naturally tend to stay up late sleep less well and are more tired during the day and can have what some people describe as a type of chronic jet lag. Other studies also found that night owls tend to consume more alcohol and tobacco than people with better adjusted body clocks. The scientists have built on previous research that indicates people who naturally tend to stay up late (pictured) sleep less well and are more tired during the day, and have what some people describe as a type of chronic jet lag . The scientists found a reduction in the integrity of the night owl's white matter in areas of the human brain associated with depression. A coloured CT scan is pictured . Jessica Rosenberg at the university, used diffusion tensor imaging to scan the brains of 20 intermediate chronotypes as well as 16 early-birds and 23 night owls. Her team found a reduction in the integrity of the night owl's white matter in areas of the human brain associated with depression. She told New Scientist: 'We think this could be caused by the fact that late chronotypes suffer from this permanent jet lag.' The team believes it could be possible that the gene variants responsible for pushing body clocks towards nocturnal living could affect the physical structure of the brain - although they are not sure if any changes impact on a person's health. Commenting on the study, Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the Surrey Sleep Research Centre in Guildford, UK, said: 'It's interesting that there are individual differences, but we need to . understand what is causing them and find ways of creating environments . in which those differences can be attenuated.' Dr Rosenberg believes that in an ideal word, people's work schedules should complement their natural sleep patterns. However, Mr Dijk said another piece of research suggests that night owls can reduce their exposure to artificial light and spend as much time in the sunlight as possible to force their body clock to shift to a more normal rhythm.","Researchers from Aachen University in Germany believe just 10 per cent of people can be catagorised as 'morning people'

More reservists: Proposals by Secretary of State for Defence, Philip Hammond (pictured) proposals could see a massive increase in the number of troops seeking help for severe psychological trauma . Controversial plans to replace thousands of full-time soldiers with reservists risks creating a new wave of veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), campaigners warn today. Experts said Defence Secretary Philip Hammond's proposals could see a massive increase in the number of troops seeking help for severe psychological trauma. Andrew Cameron, chief executive of military mental health charity Combat Stress, said members of the Territorial Army who served on the frontline were at greater risk of developing the condition than ordinary troops. Mr Cameron has repeatedly warned that the UK faces a 'ticking timebomb' of cases involving serving and former military personnel suffering potentially life-changing mental health issues following a decade of relentless conflict. But in an interview with Sky news he expressed grave concerns that the problem could worsen under cost-cutting plans outlined by the Ministry of Defence. The aim is to reduce the number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 - an army small enough to fit inside Wembley Stadium - while doubling the number of reservists to 30,000. Mr Cameron said reservists returning home from conflicts did not have access to the same level of support afforded to full-time soldiers. A recent study by King's College, London, of thousands of servicemen and women in Iraq and Afghanistan found more reservists suffered from PTSD compared to regular troops. Reservists were more likely to feel people at home did not understand what they had been through overseas, less likely to feel supported by the military and have more difficulty resuming normal social activities, according to research. Those who believed they lacked support after leaving their regiments were most vulnerable to PTSD, anxiety, depression or alcohol and drug abuse. Mr Cameron said: 'The preponderance of post-traumatic stress disorder amongst veterans who are reservists is 50 per cent higher than that for the regular servicemen. 'The reason for that is they don’t get the level of support from their regiment, their ship or their squadron that they might have done if they were a regular. 'If we double or treble the number and if we continue with high-intensity warfare then I think society has got a big challenge because we will see a lot more reservists who need help who disappear into their banks or their building societies or their building site who will need to found and helped and that is going to be a challenge.' Reservists’ families, friends, colleagues and employers need to be more aware of what they have gone through, Mr Cameron said. Combat Stress say they have seen a 50 per cent increase in the number of veterans returning from Afghanistan who seek their help every year since 2009. In 2008-09 the charity were approached by 56 Afghan veterans. This had risen to 271 in the last year, a fivefold increase. Jake Wood,  40, an investment bank analyst, was a Lance Sergeant in the TA in Afghanistan from April to October 2007. Problems: Military mental health charity Combat Stress, said members of the Territorial Army were at greater risk of developing the condition than ordinary troops (file picture) He told Sky News he suffers from what he calls 'Survivor Guilt' and 'Killer Guilt' – leading to nightmares and sleepless nights - after discovering a member of the Taliban had died in a firefight he had been involved in. He said: 'I didn't feel anything at the time. I couldn't. I was immersed in the normality of Afghanistan. But it's when you come home and you're re-immersed in the different normality of home, the cosiness of home life that you can remember things differently. 'And I just remember playing my part in killing an extremely terrified, dying man. 'It's basically a hangover from the past, which in my experience does not go away. And now I'm not expecting it to either. This isn't defeatism. 'I've had years of intensive treatment and I've no doubt that it has helped me, and the reason I know it has helped me is that I haven't killed myself.' An MoD spokesman said: ‘We are committed to giving everyone . who serves in our Armed Forces all the help and support they need. ‘That is why the Government has invested £7.4million to . improve the mental health services available and ensure help is available for . everyone who needs it, whether they are a reservist, regular or veteran. ‘Since 2006 all reservists have had access to the Reserves . Mental Health Programme and this year we launched plans to give reservists . access to occupational health services so they can get routine mental health . support when they are in their civilian role. ‘We are also working to raise awareness amongst employers of . the unique challenges facing reservists.’","Aim is to reduce number of regular soldiers from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2018 .

A British soldier was killed by a Taliban bomb after blundering US troops failed to discover the 80kg device buried in a road. Sergeant . Lee Davidson’s unit was given the green light to travel down a . ‘high-risk’ route in Afghanistan after American forces insisted one hour . earlier it was clear of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). But the US Army squad which used hi-tech detector vehicles to check the dirt track had missed the huge bomb. Hero: Sgt Lee Davidson was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan last, leaving behind widow Samantha Davies, right,  who was heavily pregnant at the time . Mother: Wife Samantha was left with the couple's children after her husband's death . Sgt Davidson – who had been looking . out of the vehicle’s hatch – died when his armoured truck hit the huge . IED and flipped onto its roof. His wife Samantha was seven months pregnant with their third child at the time. An inquest criticised the  specialist US engineers for giving ‘inappropriate’ advice to UK commanders. Coroner Nicola Mundy said there had been a ‘clear failure’ by the Americans to warn of the risks. Sgt Davidson, of the Light Dragoons, was on patrol in Nahr-e Saraj, a Taliban hotspot in Helmand, on September 9 last year. He was part of a mission to push insurgents from an area of land between two military bases. The convoy set off down a dirt road when an IED exploded under his 19-tonne Ridgback armoured vehicle. Sgt Davidson, 32, received severe  injuries and died despite immediate medical assistance. The . blast had been activated by insurgents using a command wire buried at . least four inches below the ground and the cable stretched about 200 . metres from the bomb crater to a firing point. In . a written statement, a US Army officer – identified only as Soldier 5 – . said engineers drove along the route in vehicles with sensitive . electronic equipment designed to detect buried IEDs. Crucially, . he admitted US troops did not get out of their vehicles to carry out . visual searches for disturbed ground or other signs insurgents had been . there. Lieutenant Colonel . Carl Frankland, a British Army IED expert, said the bomb had been hidden . at a ‘vulnerable position’ in the road. He . said it would have been ‘prudent’ for the US bomb detectors to dismount . from their vehicles to search for wires and other danger signs. Superior: Major Chris Sargeant gave evidence at the inquest today and said he made the decision to take the road in a vehicle based on intelligence, but would not have done if he knew what he does now . Lt . Col Frankland told the coroner he would have recommended a ‘methodical . approach’ to checking the road, involving soldiers on foot searching for . buried bombs using hand-held detectors or sniffer dogs. He said: ‘The route itself was sufficiently risky. They should have stopped and dismounted the vehicle. ‘If they had discovered the command wire and cut it they may have been able to remove that IED.’ He acknowledged searching for bombs on foot was ‘very time-consuming’ and could have ‘delayed the mission’. He added that  the Americans had a ‘different mindset’ towards discovering IEDs. Happy couple: Sgt Davidson and his wife, Samantha, on their wedding day held in  2011, the year before he died . Magic moment: The couple kiss at the moment it was confirmed they were married at St Nicholas Church in Thorne, South Yorkshire . Major . Christopher Sargent, Sgt Davidson’s commanding officer, said: ‘I chose . that route at the time because I thought it was the safest route, based . on intelligence [provided by the US]. ‘The . advice I got was to follow the route. I would have gone in on foot if I . had known what I know now. I made the call wrongly, but I made it in . good faith.’ Comrades of Sgt Davidson, of  Thorne, South Yorkshire, described how ‘it went dark’ in the Ridgback when the IED exploded. Sgt Davidson was barely breathing and died before reaching Camp Bastion hospital. Miss . Mundy said the US team had failed to provide proper risk advice. ‘There . was a clear failure to enter into dialogue about how best to manage . this risk,’ she said. Since the tragedy, British troops have been issued . with new guidance on assessing routes. Blast: Sergeant Lee Paul Davidson died after his Ridgeback vehicle, similar to the one pictured, was hit while patrolling with the Afghan Uniformed Police in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand province . Recording . a verdict of unlawful killing, Miss Mundy also said the route had not . been monitored around the clock by Danish troops – giving insurgents . time to plant devices. After . the inquest in Doncaster, Mrs Davidson said she and her three young . children, Jayden, Jamie and Amelia Amber-Lee, were ‘so very proud’ of . the soldier – who was helping to train Afghan police. In . a statement she said: ‘The questions that our family had have been . answered. We are satisfied that everything possible was done to try and . save Lee’s life. 'We all miss Lee and are so very proud of him. He lives on in his family but especially in his three children he leaves behind.’ Sgt Davidson was the 427th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001.

The UK's first fully solar-powered home, which removes the need to ever receive a gas or electricity bill again, has gone on sale - but it will set you back £1.2 million. The timber-framed home in Great Glen, Leicestershire, contains a number of 'zero-carbon features', including solar electric energy, triple glazing and rainwater storage. It is entirely heated by underground water-filled tubes that are warmed by solar energy from rooftop panels. The UK's first fully solar-powered home has gone on sale - but it will set you back £1.2million. The timber-framed home in Great Glen, Leicestershire, pictured, has a number of 'zero-carbon features', including solar electric energy, triple glazing and rainwater storage . The five-bedroom house, pictured, was designed and built by Caplin Homes and comes with two acres of land. It is entirely heated by underground water-filled tubes that are warmed by solar energy from rooftop panels . The Government has set a target for all new homes to be zero-carbon by 2016. Zero-carbon, also known as carbon neutral, applies to materials and processes where the amount of carbon footprint that is created is offset by the energy produced. For example, although solar panels use carbon-based energy to be built, constructed and shipped, they offset this by using solar-based energy to power household and other items. Buried pipes heat the earth beneath the foundations during the summer and the ground retains the heat in winter, warming the house. The five-bedroom house was designed and built by Caplin Homes and comes with two acres of land. Director Michael Goddard said: 'The design and construction, down to the materials, were used specifically for their low footprint.' The Government has set a target for all new homes to be zero-carbon by 2016. 'We want to prove Government targets are achievable and genuine zero-carbon homes are a viable investment for UK house builders,' said Mr Goddard. 'The solar house shows how existing technologies can be used for a large family home but we plan to offer solutions for all house sizes.' Dr Andrew Wright, expert in building engineering physics at De Montfort University, has been working with the developer to study the rate at which the earth will lose heat over the winter. The solar panels on the roof of the house, pictured, are called hybrids because they collect both electrical and thermal energy. Solar walls preheat incoming ventilation air, and an Earth Energy Bank (EEB) and heat pump can store heart, and retrieve it for use when temperatures drop . All the technologies are controlled by a control system, which monitors the inside and outside temperatures, how much energy is being captured by the solar panels, and the heat levels. The south-facing triple-glazed windows, pictured, are said to also enhance the house's energy management during the winter . He said: 'The earth's low conductivity means it should retain the heat rather well. 'We will have a better idea next spring, but we estimate there's going to be more heat than you'll need. We don't know how much, though.' The solar panels on the roof of the house are called hybrids because they collect both . electrical and thermal energy.

The south-facing triple-glazed windows are said to also enhance . the house’s energy management during the winter. Due to its low energy design, the Solar House is expected to only require heat from the EEB for about 10 weeks of the year. For £1.2million, buyers also get two garages, pictured .

Estate agent Anthony Fox said the possibility of no utility bills was a big draw for potential owners: 'The idea is your bills pretty much disappear and the house is self-sustaining and self-sufficient. That was a big aspect for most of the people who came to have a look around. 'We had a lot of interest on the open day. There were some strong considerations to buy there and then. Everyone was very keen to learn how the house worked.'","Timber-framed eco home situated on two acres of land in Leicestershire .

The controversial high-speed rail project was plunged into further turmoil last night as the minister responsible for the scheme resigned to run for the post of deputy speaker. Rail Minister Simon Burns quit ahead of David Cameron’s ministerial reshuffle next week in order to fight for the post vacated by Tory MP Nigel Evans – who was in court yesterday to answer rape charges. His is the second major departure from the troubled scheme in as many months. New role? Rail minister Simon Burns, left, is to run for the post of deputy speaker, vacated by MP Nigel Evans, right, who faces rape charges . Last month the man responsible for promoting the scheme, HS2 chairman Douglas Oakervee, was replaced by Sir David Higgins – the former boss of Network Rail who masterminded the construction of the Olympic Park. He will start in January on a £600,000 salary. Mr Burns’ decision to walk out comes amid growing political opposition to the troubled project. The future of the scheme is looking increasingly doubtful following predictions that the cost of the project, officially £50billion, could spiral to more than £80billion. Quitting: Mr Burns did not mention HS2 in his resignation letter to David Cameron yesterday . Mr Burns did not mention HS2 in his resignation letter to David Cameron yesterday, but the Prime Minister replied: ‘It is no easy ask overseeing the roll-out of one of the Government’s flagship infrastructure projects, HS2 – one of our country’s most significant infrastructure projects for decades. ‘Your stewardship of our proposals has helped set the foundations of a project that will last for decades to come, a lasting legacy to your role as minister.’ MPs were last night relishing the prospect of voting for Mr Burns to spite Speaker John Bercow, with whom he has found himself clashing repeatedly.

At least there the end would have been swift. Now it is drawn out and agonising. Dumped without food and water by their owners, thousands of horses which would have been sold for meat are instead being condemned to a living hell. Their plight is highlighted in a report by charities and animal sanctuaries, which are struggling with an influx of horses in appalling condition after unscrupulous dealers, hit by a slump in demand following the horsemeat scandal, abandoned them. Take Nemo. She was so emaciated when animal welfare charity workers rescued her that her ribs poked through her coat. She was also lame. Nemo was just a skeleton when she was rescued but has now made a full recovery . Around her in her muddy field lay the corpses of other horses which had not made it. Rescuers got there just in time for Nemo. With veterinary treatment, she made a full recovery at a sanctuary and eight months on from being taken from that field in Caerphilly, south Wales, she is today a popular addition to HorseWorld’s visitor centre in Bristol. But others have not been so lucky. Watson was being ‘flygrazed’ – a practice where owners, often from the travelling community, leave horses to graze on other people’s land without permission – on a patch of scrub. In his desperation for food he ate something toxic, leading to a skin condition that left him with burnt-raw pink patches. He was neglected for so long that he also had maggots eating away at his body. Vets battled to save the nine-month-old but three days after he was found in a Bristol field in June, he suffered massive kidney and liver failure and died. In total, some 7,000 horses are considered ‘at risk’, according to the report by leading charities including the RSPCA and Blue Cross, with the horsemeat scandal a significant factor, but with over-breeding and the recession also playing a part. Rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in January that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse. Experts say there are owners who let their horses breed indiscriminately then become overwhelmed with the numbers produced. Watson was left to die after developing a skin condition when he ate something toxic. Sadly he died of kidney and liver failure three days after being found . But whereas the unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade, now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £100 a week to care for and feed them. The Animal Sanctuary, in Dorney, Buckinghamshire, is caring for a third more horses than this time last year and is spending more than ever on vets’ bills as many arrive in a horrific condition. Head trustee Diana Coad said: ‘Before the horsemeat scare there was, sadly, a trade in horses for meat but now there’s no market for them. ‘People don’t want to pay to feed them or pay to have them put down, so unscrupulous owners are hiding them away in pockets of land and leaving them to starve very slowly and painfully to death.’ She said so many horses were arriving on the doorstep they were having to turn them away. ‘In just one day last week we had calls about six separate horses, two skeletal horses were brought to us that we took in, and one horse arrived on a trailer in such a bad state that it collapsed and had to be put down,’ she said. Diana Coad head trustee of The Animal Sanctuary in Dorney, Berkshire, says unwanted animals are being hidden and allowed to starve to death by owners who don't want to pay to have them put down . ‘We try to take the worst ones that we can give a chance to and hope the better ones will survive a bit longer. You feel like an executioner having to choose which ones to take, I don’t think anyone would like to make that life or death decision.’ Before the recession, the sanctuary was able to rehome a horse every month but in the last two years it has found a new home for just one pony, as families are choosing cheaper pets. Other animal charities have also seen a huge rise in the number of abandoned horses. World Horse Welfare, in Blackpool, took in 40 per cent more in the first quarter of 2013 than in the same period last year and investigated 22 per cent more complaints about horse welfare. Blue Cross admitted 16 per cent more horses between January and March this year than the year before, with four in ten being admitted for welfare concerns, compared with  less than a third last year.","Nemo was found in south Wales with ribs poking through skin .

When a pensioner arrived at school to take his six-year-old granddaughter to the GP, teachers fetched a girl from class and off they went. Only it wasn’t his granddaughter – and because the 74-year-old has very poor sight, he did not notice. The man, who has not been named,  then took her on a mile-long bus journey to the GP, where she was prescribed Calpol, and dropped her off back at school. Mistake: The Napier Primary School in Gillingham, Kent, sent the wrong six-year-old to the GP with a pensioner who had come to collect his granddaughter . It was not until the youngster went home and showed the medicine to her puzzled parents that the mistake was discovered. Yesterday Napier Primary School in Gillingham, Kent, launched an investigation into how such a blunder could have happened. The mistake took place on Tuesday after the girl’s parents telephoned the school to say her grandfather would arrive to take her to the doctors’ because she was ill. But the girl handed over to him was not his granddaughter – although she is in the same class, shares the same first name, has similar blonde hair and is around the same height. And when she was asked if it was her grandfather, she nodded. GP: . The grandfather took the girl to the Gillingham Medical Centre, Kent, . (pictured) where the doctor didn't realise he had seen the wrong girl. The girl's father realised it was down to several 'honest mistakes' Last night the girl’s father, a  36-year-old systems tester for an IT company, said he thought his ‘shy’ daughter may have thought the man was her dead grandfather. ‘A little bit of pressure was put on her and she felt like it was the right thing to do to agree it was her grandfather,’ he said. ‘We have pictures of him up in our home so I think she got confused.’ The father, who asked not to be named, realised something was wrong when his daughter said at home, ‘here is my medicine’. On the bottle were the name and details of a different girl in her class. He added: ‘My daughter’s been known to tell a tale or two so I took her to the surgery and the doctor said, “I saw her this morning with her grandfather”. ‘It could have been worse. The doctor could have given her an insulin injection if that was what the appointment was for.’ He said he now realises the confusion arose after ‘several honest mistakes’. ‘It is very strange that a grandfather would not know his granddaughter, but I understand he has poor sight,’ he said. ‘Thank God it was an innocent thing done by a confused old gentleman.’ He added: ‘The first thing I thought was the worst. I had to ask my daughter the sort of questions no parent ever wants to ask, “did he do this, did he do that”. When your daughter has been walked round town and taken on a bus by a strange man it makes you sick to the stomach.’ Map: .

The girl’s parents believe the receptionist wrote down her first and second name rather than the correct surname. Both girls are six, in the same class, are the same height and have blonde hair. The . mistaken girl lives with her father, NHS manager mother, 37, and . younger brother in Gillingham, Kent, has not suffered an ill-effects . from the incident.

The doctor could have given her an insulin injection if that was what the appointment was for. 'The practice manager of the surgery said she’s been there for 25 years and she’s never seen anything like it.' The school is now reviewing its safeguarding policies. Headteacher . Zerina Slade, who called staff into a crisis meeting after the . incident, said the safety of pupils is 'of the utmost importance'. Mrs . Slade said: 'The safety and care of all of our children is of the . utmost importance to us and we are treating this matter extremely . seriously.

Prince Andrew’s continued royal globe-trotting is expected to come under . fresh scrutiny as he returns from a three-week, 21,258-mile ‘official’ trip. The Queen’s son, who was forced to give up his formal role as a . UK trade ambassador after a string of scandals, has visited Indonesia, . Vietnam, Hong Kong, Japan and New York. The trip came just weeks after a separate trip to Qatar, another of his favourite destinations. The . first leg of his tour of the Far East was funded in full by taxpayers, . Buckingham Palace admitted last night. A one-way-business class ticket . would cost at least £5,000. In both Tokyo and New York his expenses – . including travel and accommodation – were in part subsidised by a . private defence think tank which has appointed him to its board of . ‘International Advisors’, the Mail has learnt. Founded in 1831 by the . Duke of Wellington, the Royal United Services Institute is a respected . independent, not-for-profit research body offering expert opinion on . defence, security and terrorism. But questions are sure to be asked . as to how Andrew can reconcile his royal role and duties with . representing an organisation, however independent, that is funded by . private individuals, governments and corporations which include defence . manufacturers. Andrew flew out of the UK – accompanied by a team of . round-the-clock, publicly-funded police bodyguards – on September 16 to . Jakarta, where he stayed for three days. The visit was, apparently, . designed to promote ‘UK bilateral relations including in trade and . investment, science and innovation as well as education’. He attended . a dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, opened the new British Embassy and . attended a launch of a Government-backed tourism initiative. Details . of the trip were not released until after his arrival, however, as . Andrew is the only member of the royal family who refuses to publicise . his foreign travel in advance. Palace officials confirmed last night . that this leg of his journey was approved by the Royal Visits Committee . at the request of the Foreign Office, which means that all his travel . costs, hotels and expenses are met by taxpayers out of the Queen’s . Sovereign Grant. One-way business class flights to Jakarta are just under £5,000. His last official engagement was on the evening of September 19, after which Andrew disappeared for a three-day weekend. Scrutiny: The Prince is the only member of the Royal Family who refuses to publish his travel detail in advance . Buckingham Palace said only that he spent the time ‘privately’. He then reappeared in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi on September 23 for a two-day stay. Most . notable in a series of engagements, was a high-level RUSI conference . discussing UK-Vietnam defence co-operation and strategic issues in . South-east Asia. Palace officials say the prince covered the cost of . this part of his trip personally. His final engagement was on September . 24 – after which the prince apparently took himself off on holiday again . for five days. Again, palace officials have declined to discuss his . movements. Andrew then turned up in Tokyo on Monday this week for . another public, yet privately-funded, series of engagements. The main . thrust of the prince’s visit was to attend a RUSI conference on . British-Japanese security co-operation, where he shared the stage with . Sir John Scarlett, former Director of the Security Intelligence Service . (MI6), and Japanese premier, Shinzo Abe. Japan is looking to spend . billions on its defence as tensions rise with China and pressure comes . from the US for the country to become more pro-active globally. As a . result huge defence contracts are up for grabs. According to . well-placed sources, the prince also took the opportunity to spend some . time privately with the Japanese royal family. After initially . refusing to discuss who was paying for the prince to be there, . Buckingham Palace eventually admitted – after being challenged by the . Mail – that RUSI had ‘made a proportionate contribution towards his . costs’. The think-tank also funded him to fly on to New York on . Wednesday this week, ostensibly to take part in further high-level . discussions on its behalf. His arrival in Manhattan coincided with . that of his youngest daughter, Princess Eugenie, who moved to the city . to work for a year for an online auction company. Andrew took Eugenie, . 23, out for dinner on Wednesday night at ABC Kitchen. Buckingham Palace . have refused to say when the prince is returning to the UK. A spokesman for the prince said he was a ‘great admirer of the RUSI’s work’. Sources . stressed Andrew did not receive a salary as a member of its . International Advisory Board and pointed out it ‘already has . well-established links with the Royal Family, in the form of the Queen, . who is its patron, and the Duke of Kent, its president’. They also . claimed that the prince – nicknamed Air Miles Andy for his love of . travel – was taking scheduled flights throughout his trip. A . spokesman for RUSI said they had been keen to invite Andrew to join . their advisory board as he ‘endorsed and consolidated RUSI’s status as a . leading independent international think tank’. However the latest revelations will, once again, shine an unwelcome spotlight on his activities. In . 2001 he became the UK’s Special Representative for Trade and . Investment. But he was repeatedly accused of wasting taxpayers’ money. The final nail in the coffin was the furore over his friendship with . Jeffrey Epstein, a US financier who has been jailed for soliciting . prostitution from underage girls. In July 2011 Andrew announced he was . standing down. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: . ‘Taxpayers will wonder why they are paying for the Prince’s gallivanting . across the globe, given that he is no longer a UK trade envoy. It is . imperative that the Prince is open and transparent about exactly how he . has spent taxpayers’ cash.’","Think tank Royal United Services Institute subsidised Prince's expenses .

But that could all be about to change. Australian retailer Taking Shape arrived this summer, offering 'curvy customers' a new type of style boasting a 'sassy Aussie vibe'. A huge hit down under where it has 130 shops, the brand aims to open 14 UK stores by the end of October, with boutiques opening in Newcastle and Liverpool this week. Stylish: Taking Shape aims to provide an alternative source of fashion for larger ladies . By February the brand hopes to have 21 UK stores, including branches in Leamington Spa, Horsham, Newbury, Kingston, Solihull and Worcester. 'We're excited to have arrived on the UK high street,' said Taking Shape managing director Alla Buinowicz. 'We believe that there is a great need here for both our garments and commitment to providing a unique and caring shopping experience. 'Everything we do is about you, the customer, what makes you look good and what makes you feel great. 'We're more than just a chain of shops; our goal is for women to enter as customers and leave as friends!' Expanding: The Australian brand already has 130 stores down under and is now opening one a week in the UK . Convenient: Taking Shape is also employing in-store stylists to encourage curvy women to be more daring . Other innovations introduced by . Taking Shape include turning the fitting rooms into a 'retreat' that's . larger than the average changing spot, and employing shop assistant stylists with a brief to ensure customers leave looking and . feeling as good as possible. The . newly launched shops and website represent the brand's first foray . into international markets, with the UK chosen because Taking Shape has a 'greater affinity' with local British buyers. Nevertheless, . with only 30 stores planned so far, it's still a fraction of the size of .

'I've lost . count of the number of times I’ve heard a customer say ""Ooh no I never . wear that colour"" but then I get her into the fitting room and trying on . all kinds of colours she wouldn't normally wear.

'Many . of us have parts of our body that we aren't fond of - an ample derriere . or a pudding tummy are complaints I come across often.

The Eurasian beaver, European bison and White-tailed eagle are among the animals that have made a remarkable comeback in Europe over the past 50 years, zoologists said. A total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts, according to the first ever report of its kind. Scientists from the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), BirdLife International and the European Bird Census Council (EBCC) worked with experts from across Europe to gather relevant data about the distribution and abundance of selected species. The European bison (pictured) became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss. But a large-scale breeding and reintroduction programme has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern Europe . The report, ‘Wildlife Comeback in Europe’, investigates how and why the doomed species bounced back and provides important lessons for the conservation of these and other species. Of the 18 mammals surveyed, all of them are making a comeback apart from the Iberian Ibex, whose population has declined by 84 per cent since 1965. Now there are just 279 living in the wild. A total of 19 birds were surveyed, with the biggest increase in population belonging to the barnacle goose. Numbers of the bird have risen 7,650 per cent since 1947 thanks to a decline in hunting and increased protection of the birds' nesting sites. Of the 18 mammals surveyed for the report, all of them are making a comeback apart from the Iberian Ibex (pictured), whose population has declined by 84 per cent since 1965 . Professor Jonathan Baillie, ZSL’s director of conservation said: 'It is essential that we both celebrate and learn from major successes in conservation. 'This study helps us understand the interventions and conditions necessary for a broad range of species to experience similar recoveries.' Among the species to reverse their fortunes, is the White-tailed eagle, which is one of the world's largest birds of prey. Populations of large carnivores declined as farmers sought to protect their livestock from attack.  A Eurasian brown bear found in Finland is pictured left, as well as a wild boar, right . Following a dramatic decline in its numbers and extinction in some countries between 1800 and 1970, the bird has made an impressive recovery. Thanks . to legal protection, the European population grew from fewer than 2,500 . pairs in 1970 to 9,600 pairs in 2010 and the species has recently . recolonised parts of its former range in northern and central Europe. Populations of the Spanish imperial eagle rose by 734 per cent. The Iberian lynx (pictured) was limited to the southwestern part of the Iberian peninsula by the mid-1960s. There are fewer than 200 animals in the wild. They have suffered due to hunting, habitat loss and road accidents, but the most critical threat today is the reduced numbers of wild Rabbits within the lynx's range . The European bison, which is the largest herbivore in Europe, became extinct in the early 20th century due to severe hunting pressure and habitat loss. However, a large-scale breeding and reintroduction programme based on individuals remaining in captivity has led to wild populations being re-established in areas of central and eastern Europe. Poland and Belarus are the stronghold for the rekindled species, which now has a population of almost 3,000 individuals. The Eurasian spoonbill (pictured) declined dramatically after the 19th century as a result of habitat loss, caused mainly by drainage of wetlands. With the establishment of international treaties and conventions, the majority of breeding sites are now protected across its range in Europe . Numbers of Pyrenean ibex have risen by 855 per cent since 1960, while populations of grey wolves are up 303 per cent since 1970. Frans Schepers, managing director of Rewilding Europe, said: 'Wildlife will bounce back if we allow it to – this report shows that. 'With continued and strong legal protection, active boosting of existing wildlife populations and reintroductions to bring back lost species, combined with an increasing tolerance towards wildlife, more species will surely follow.' Following a dramatic decline in its numbers and extinction in some countries between 1800 and 1970, the white-tailed eagle has made an impressive recovery thanks to legal protection . While the study focuses on 27 species of mammals and birds, ZSL said the comeback is not limited to these animals as there are many more that are showing similar patterns of recovery. However, they warn that despite a fightback from certain European species, biodiversity is still being lost and the findings of the report must be viewed in the context of large historical declines. For carnivores like the Eurasian lynx . and Grey wolf and many bird species including the Red kite, . distributions and numbers had already declined dramatically from . their historical levels by the mid-20th century. At 16 kilos and with a 3 metre wing span, the Dalmatian pelican is one of the world's heaviest flying birds. It has made a very successful comeback in the last 30 years, thanks mainly to nature protection measures. Lake Kerkini is one of the most productive fish waters in Europe, and supports thousands of the birds . The scientists said wildlife . resurgence should be assessed cautiously, as many species have . not yet reached the level necessary to secure sustainable populations. Member of the European Parliament,Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, said: 'This report shows first of all the amazing resilience of nature. 'The rewilding of Europe exceeds nature protection, because these iconic species create unique opportunities for rural development.'","A total of 27 mammal and bird species recovered over the past 50 years thanks to legislative measures and conservation efforts .

Dawn Barry was loved on Come Dine With Me for her eccentric personality - but behind her bubbly image, she hid a sadness that led this week to her suicide. For over a decade, she had been seeking celebrity stardom on a string of reality television shows. After appearing on Blind Date and Club Reps the glamorous salon owner from Lancashire finally shot to fame as a contestant on the TV cookery programme in January 2009. Miss Barry, 38, was named on fan sites as the Channel 4 show's ‘best ever contestant’, causing endless amusement after becoming raucous and then suddenly falling asleep. She drew gasps from viewers when she became tipsy on her own competition night and went to bed - leaving one of the other contestants to cook her meal. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Dawn Barry, who shot to fame on Come Dine With Me, has died at the age of 38 . Popular: Miss Barry was a fan favourite thanks to her bubbly personality and unusual behaviour . During the week-long show, Miss Barry collapse at the table with her hair falling into a dish filled with avocado dip, and another night she left a dinner party unannounced after she felt sleepy. The sudden bouts of sleepiness caused some viewers to debate whether she was suffering from narcolepsy. But the beautician had in fact been dealing with alcohol and mental health problems for a number of years and had spent time in rehab. And in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Miss Barry apparently killed herself after a long battle with alcoholism and depression. Friends paid tribute to Miss Barry, describing her as ‘talented’ and the ‘life and soul of a party’. Reality star: Miss Barry had appeared on a variety of TV programmes before Come Dine With Me . Drunk: It has emerged that Miss Barry was battling alcohol addiction and mental health problems . Lindsay McCann, 27, who worked with Miss Barry for six years, said: ‘She was a very bubbly person and incredibly loveable. ‘She had a wonderful character and she enjoyed making people laugh and I have so many good memories of her. ‘We have been so shocked by what has happened but she had been poorly for some time. Yesterday was a dreadful day.’ Miss Barry, who owned the Naughty Nails Salon in Preston, was so ill that she had stopped working at the beginning of the year. As a result, last week her father Raymond sold her beauty business to her long-standing friend and colleague, Samantha Eastham. Miss Eastham, 30, said: ‘I had known Dawn for 12 years and it was fantastic working with her. ‘Everything about her stood out because she had such a big personality and she would really make you laugh. In her heyday she was a brilliant businesswoman who travelled the world and was incredibly successful. ‘She had been poorly since the beginning of the year and she had not really been herself for a long time. It has been very upsetting and sad and we will all miss her.’ Illness: Miss Barry's problems forced her to give up her job as owner of a beauty salon . Meanwhile, her friends also took to social networking site Facebook to pay their respects. Anna Holden wrote: ‘Goodnight and godbless - Lots of love - don’t terrorise the old people up there!’ Another friend, Delicia Mick Day, said: 'RIP Dawn, thoughts with the family.’ In April 2009, Miss Barry hit the headlines after she was convicted of drink-driving. She was three and a half times over the drink drive limit when she ploughed her Audi into two parked cars outside a nursery yards from her home. She was handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and banned from driving for five years. She also had a previous drink-driving conviction dating back to 2000. At the time her solicitor Barry David Scully said she was suffering from alcohol and mental health problems and her family were ‘concerned for her emotional well-being.’ In June 2011, her former partner Carl Anthony Britton, 40, was spared jail for domestic abuse. A court heard he hit Miss Barry in the face during a drinking session, gashing her forehead. A police spokesman confirmed that Miss Barry had been taken to the Royal Preston Hospital at around 5am on October 1 and died later the same day. Her death is not being treated as suspicious.","Dawn Barry, 38, appeared on Channel 4 cooking show in January 2009 .

Disaster map: This map of the south coast shows where the 24-year-old has got into trouble in recent weeks . Tim Freeman's 21ft yacht was . impounded after five incidents off West Sussex in early September, but . undeterred he just got a new one, which he has now lost control of on four more occasions. The 24-year-old rivals Britain's worst sailor Glenn Crawley, who was nicknamed Captain Calamity after being rescued by the RNLI 15 times in a decade off the coast of Cornwall. Mr Freeman's troubles started in the first week of September, when he repeatedly ran aground or got lost off the south coast. On one occasion he had to swim to safety when his yacht developed a hole in the hull and was in danger of sinking. It was later seized by The Maritime and Coastguard Agency. But he then got a new 24ft boat, before getting into trouble four times in the past four days. His nine emergency callouts by lifeboat and harbour master crews has cost more than £20,000, as every call out costs £2,500. Mr Freeman first came to the coastguards' attention earlier this month when he was rescued five times in a week at locations between Seaford, East Sussex, and Littlehampton, West Sussex. Safe keeping: This is his first ship impounded at Littlehampton - the coastguard wants Freeman to take more training . Freeman, pictured last month after an earlier rescue by the coastguards, was taken into police custody yesterday . Billy Johnson, the Littlehampton Harbour Master, said: 'He caused problems along the coast by grounding his yacht or running it up the beach. Warning: Billy Johnson, the Littlehampton Harbour Master, says: 'He caused problems along the coast by grounding his yacht or running it up the beach' 'On the last occasion the yacht was towed into Littlehampton it was impounded by the MCA and lifted out because it was holed and was going to sink. 'The also grounded it on the grounds of crew competency. To get his boat released from detention he had to fix the damage and obtain some training. 'But he just left without talking to us and the boat is still here. 'He has demonstrated a lack of competence and is a drain on resources. 'The idea of him getting out in the English Channel doesn't bear thinking about.' After getting a new boat, he got into trouble again on four occasions since last Thursday. The Sidmouth lifeboat in Devon was called out after concerned members of the public observed him try to run the new boat, called Reginald, up the beach to get ashore. He then sailed to Swanage, Dorset, where the local lifeboat had to be scrambled when the yacht was seen to drift dangerously close to the shoreline. Officers tried to assist Mr Freeman who rejected the offer and managed to attach the craft to a mooring buoy, with the boat facing the wrong way. In training: Mr Freeman says he has taken some sailing lessons, but his boat is being closely watched . Two days later the lifeboat was called again after the same sailor got a rope caught around his propeller off Swanage. The volunteer crew decided to escort the solo sailor, who has no navigational charts, into nearby Poole Harbour only for him to get lost soon after they left his side. Mr Freeman was intending to moor at Wareham Quay but steered down the wrong channel of water and ended up running aground again. He dialled 999 and a jet-skier managed to tow him free before pointing him in the right direction. The Poole Harbour Master boat then towed the troubled yacht into Wareham yesterday. Coastguards are now closely watching Mr Freeman's next move but are urging him to stay on land and not go to sea again. Captain Calamity: Glenn Crawley has been dubbed Britain's worst sailor after being rescued 15 times off the coast of Cornwall . Oops: Mr Crawley has become renowned for flipping his catamaran, sparking the RNLI into action . Roz Evans, watch manager at Portland coastguard, said: 'Our enforcement officers are watching the situation. 'We wish he would moor up for a while and get the right equipment and training, like navigational charts. 'He knows how to call for help, that's for sure. 'His situation has been a daily issue for us now and we have been monitoring him since he turned up at Sidmouth last week. 'Our concern is that he is going to come to harm sooner or later and that he is taking up far too much of our time and resources.' Mr Freeman has claimed that he has undertaken sailing lessons in Plymouth since his first boat was impounded in Littlehampton but would not comment further. A spokesman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: 'Portland coastguard have coordinated four incidents involving the same vessel off the Devon and Dorset coast since last Thursday. 'Incidents have included grounding a vessel and issues with navigation. 'We have provided the skipper with guidance about maritime safety - and are willing to discuss this further with him. 'We respond to all emergency calls, deploying appropriate search and rescue resources. 'We recommend that people undertake training for leisure boat activities, as they will be far less likely to be involved in a maritime accident.'","Tim Freeman was seen struggling to hold his yacht off Studland yesterday .

A Nato commander yesterday told of his agony following the disappearance of his 14-year-old daughter nine days ago. Mark Smith said he was ‘worried sick’ about daughter Esme, who vanished after telling friends she was going to a party near her Surrey home. She was last seen getting off a train at London’s Waterloo station about an hour from her address.  Mr Smith, who works at Nato’s Joint Warfare Centre in Stavanger, Norway, said: ‘We are worried sick. She’s just gone to ground. CCTV: Farnham teenager Esme Smith is seen at Charing Cross station around 5.30pm on the day she disappeared . Missing: Esme Smith (far right) with mother Dinah (left) sister Sian (above) and an unnamed woman in a Facebook photo . ‘We’re baffled. We are working very closely with the police and doing everything through them.

Since March last year, he has been at the Norwegian Nato base where he is commander of medical planning. The family spoke out after detectives yesterday released new CCTV footage of Esme near Charing Cross station – across the Thames from Waterloo. Last sighting: Esme Smith is seen walking through a door at Waterloo train station, central London, last Thursday after getting changed into a dress . Baffled: Father Mark Smith is out of ideas as to where his daughter could be . Taken from the back, it shows her heading towards Villiers Street in central London at around 5.30pm on Thursday last week wearing the white flowery dress and denim jacket she had earlier changed into from her school uniform. Police are growing increasingly worried about the safety of the teenager, who is described by her sister as an ‘extrovert and ‘vivacious’. She left All Hallows Catholic School in Farnham, Surrey, at about 3.15pm on September 12 and has not been seen or heard from by her family or friends since. The schoolgirl took a train from Aldershot to Waterloo at 4.04pm, after telling school friends she was going to Woking and then on to a party. She was spotted on CCTV at Waterloo at about 5pm, carrying a black school bag and a black floral bag with chain straps. It is believed she also took with her a black dress with a sheer mesh top. Neighbours at the detached home in Farnham where she lives with her father and mother Dinah, 50, spoke of their shock at her disappearance. Paul Gray, 48, said: ‘She’s a smashing kid, really bubbly and very chatty, the kind of kid who would stop and say hello and chat, not like most other teenagers.’ The business development manager added: ‘You just think, what the hell has driven a child to do this?’ Detective Inspector Martin Stables, of Surrey Police’s missing persons unit, urged Esme to get in touch. He added: ‘It’s now over a week since Esme went missing and it is an anxious time for the family as they wait for news.’ Her 19-year-old sister, Sian, has already made an emotional appeal to Esme, saying: ‘We are all really worried about you and we just want to make sure you are OK.’ Anyone with information should call Surrey Police on 101, quoting reference M/13/900.

A woman attacked a fellow mother and love rival in an 'ugly' brawl outside a primary school at home time. Horrified children and parents watched on as Maryam Hussein, 24, launched into a fight with Maryam Mohammed, 32, Manchester Crown Court heard. The fight occurred at the end of the day at St Philip's Church of England Primary School in Hulme, Manchester. Maryam Hussein (above), from Hulme, Manchester, attacked Maryam Mohammed at their children's school gates . The women ended up rolling about on the ground as the victim's 10-year-old son tried to help his mother, the court heard. Hussein was in a relationship with the victim’s ex-partner, and had warned her that she would ‘break her legs’ if she didn’t stay away from him. Violence erupted after the women went to the school to pick up their children, with Hussein kicking Miss Mohammed’s car and damaging the wing mirror. Hussein’s 22-year-old brother Abdullah joined the bust-up, kicking the victim when she was on the ground and ‘aggressively’ restraining her little boy when he tried to help. Mum-of-three Hussein, and her brother, were both given community punishments. Hussein, of Clarendon Street, Hulme, admitted common assault and criminal damage. Her brother, of Walmer Street, Rusholme, admitted common assault. Hussein had earlier threatened to break the legs of the victim before they met at the school gates . Prosecuting, Steven Wild said: 'Miss [Mohammed] received a phone call at 10 o’clock in the morning in which Miss Hussein said: ""Listen bitch, you don’t know me, but you will know me now. If you and your kids don’t stop talking to Abie [her partner] I’m going to have to come and break your legs."" 'Miss Mohammed said she would need to speak to Abie because he was the father of her children.' Miss Mohammed ‘thought nothing of it’, and later that day went to collect her children from St Philip’s. But at the school gates she saw Hussein, who repeated the threat. The court heard that when the victim asked Abdullah Hussein to tell his sister to leave her alone, he said: 'This is my sister - if you don’t stop what you’re doing I’ll break your legs myself.' At that point Maryam Hussein lunged and the two women began to struggle. Miss Mohammed was later seen by a police officer ‘clearly distressed with visible injuries’, including with scratch marks on her face. Robert Golinski, defending Maryam Hussein, said: 'The prospects of repetition are extremely remote.' The court heard Hussein is no longer with the man at the centre of the row. Her brother was said to be ‘deeply ashamed’. Sentencing, Judge Robert Atherton described the incident as ‘ugly’. Maryam Hussein was given a 12-month supervision order with a requirement to attend a probation service programme - and given a retraining order which bars her from contacting the victim. Abdullah Hussein was given 56 hours of unpaid work.","Woman attacked fellow mother in front of horrified children and parents .

"By . Katy Winter . PUBLISHED: . 09:30 EST, 3 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:55 EST, 3 October 2013 . Hundreds of brides were left devastated yesterday following the collapse of a wedding company. Jenna Batty, 26, is among up to 170 brides who had their wedding plans thrown into disarray after booking A Little Bit of Bling to put the finishing touches to their venues. Some only realised the firm was not going to deliver on the morning of their wedding day while others claim they are owed thousands of pounds. Devastated: Jenna Batty and Ian King from Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, saw their wedding plans left in tatters as a company they had paid to organise decorations folded on their big day - and left them to find out via a Facebook post . Scores of brides have now joined forces to report the company to police, trading standards and Action Fraud. Bride-to-be Jenna paid the company £1,400 to provide the decorations for her wedding on October 12 at the Buchan Braes Hotel in Peterhead, Scotland. She and fiance Ian King selected bouquets, centrepieces, chair covers, a chocolate fountain, starlit backdrop and Mr and Mrs signs. But Jenna was devastated when she saw a post on Facebook from the company stating that it had ceased trading, leaving her with a frantic scramble to make alternative plans. Her disappointment turned to anger when she realised how many other couples had been let down by A Little Bit of Bling, which is based in Dudley, West Midlands. No refund: Sarah Broadley was left in tears when decorations she had paid for didn't turn her wedding day. She and husband Ben paid their venue £300 to help fix the mess. A Little Bit Of Bling is yet to reimburse the couple . Jenna, of Peterhead, said: 'Some of the money is not that much but it is promises and dreams that have been smashed by this. 'It was a one-stop shop to get everything. It looked like it was a beautiful business. 'We paid £1,400. We had literally invested everything on thinking she was going to come and do our wedding. It’s been really stressful.' Mother-of-two Jenna, who has been with Ian, 29, for three years, asked for a refund and has contacted police to report what happened. 'Floods of tears': Caren Larkman-Ayre and Jonathan Ayre from North Yorkshire were devastated to find at 8.30am on the day of their wedding that they would not receive their candy cart, chocolate fountain, chair covers and sashes after paying £484 to A Little Bit Of Bling . She said she was 'very lucky' that her local community has rallied round to help her source replacement decorations. Devastated Caren Larkman-Ayre was told at 8.30am on the morning of her dream wedding that A Little Bit of Bling had left a message with a night porter to cancel. She had paid £484 for centrepieces, a candy cart, chocolate fountain and chair covers and sashes in her navy blue colour scheme for her wedding at Hazlewood Castle in North Yorkshire. But she was left in floods of tears after being left in the lurch, and had to make do with mismatched decorations sourced on the day of the wedding to her groom Jonathan Ayre. Excuses: Some of the brides were told by Sarah Cawthorne, the owner of A Little Bit of Bling, that she was struggling to cope with her business commitments due to ill health . The mother-of-one said: 'I was devastated, heartbroken. I lost a good couple of hours on my wedding day crying and in my pyjamas trying to get everything organised. 'I ended up with a mish-mash of centrepieces. The sashes didn’t match.' Bride Sarah Broadley was also left in tears on the morning of her wedding on September 20 after A Little Bit of Bling failed to turn up with the decorations she had chosen. She eventually received a message from the company blaming a 'family emergency' for its failure to make it to her wedding venue in Dudley, West Mids. The hotel made last minute arrangements to make sure her 4pm wedding to fiance . Ben, 32, went smoothly, but she had to pay an extra £300 for their help. Office administrator Sarah, 31, said: 'I was just a mess on the morning. It was just awful. 'To look at it from somebody else’s point of view they would not have known, but I knew what I had ordered and what should have been there. 'The staff at the hotel were brilliant. Although the morning was awful, my wedding was wonderful.' Three days after the wedding, Sarah received an apologetic message stating that the company had filed for bankruptcy. She has not been refunded the £180 she paid. She has joined more than 100 angry brides on a Facebook group set up to fight for refunds and organise complaints to the police and trading standards. Let down: A Little Bit of Bling failed to provide the finishing touches such as flowers and centrepieces to hundreds of brides . Some of the brides were told by Sarah Cawthorne, the owner of A Little Bit of Bling, that she was struggling to cope with her business commitments due to ill health. Yesterday Mrs Cawthorne admitted failing to honour bookings but said she had refunded five brides. Mrs Cawthorne denied that up to 170 couples have been let down, and said bookings for 102 receptions will be honoured by another company, Paradise Weddings of Solihull, West Mids. She said: 'I have had to retire from business due to ill health on the advice of my doctor. 'I have depression and anxiety arising from business pressures and family matters. I had to close my Facebook page down after receiving death threats to myself and my children. 'Now I just want to get better and look after my family.' Dudley Metropolitan Council’s Trading Standards division confirmed it is investigating a number of complaints. Councillor Tracy Wood, cabinet member for environment and culture, said: 'We have to date received 14 complaints against the company relating to customers who did not receive the wedding services they had paid for. 'Officers have worked closely with the company to arrange refunds for a number of individuals. Anyone with concerns should contact Dudley Trading Standards on 08454 040506.'","Over 170 brides let down when A Little Bit of Bling failed to deliver goods .

The owner of the scandal-hit Godolphin stable has ordered a new investigation after banned equine drugs were discovered on a Dubai government private jet when it was searched at Stansted airport. Officers from the UK Border Agency, along with the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, seized the unlicensed products from a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight earlier this year, it has been reported. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, monarch of the gulf emirate, has now ordered his junior wife Her Highness Princess Haya, president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, to carry out an investigation into the incident. The inquiry comes just weeks after a separate raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, which is owned by Godolphin’s Darley Management operation. According to The Guardian, the shipment, apparently labelled as 'horse tack', did not include anabolic steroids. It is believed the seizure did however contain products used on endurance horses. A spokesman for Princess Haya told the Guardian: 'Nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where. That’s one of the reforms that they want in place.' The spokesman said Sheik Mohammed had been unaware of the products on the flight as well as the raid at Moorley Farm. The spokesman also said Sheikh Mohammed's operation had not been spoken to by the VMD since the seizure and blamed the presence of the drugs on 'an internal reporting error'. Sheikh Mohammed's senior wife is Shaikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma Al Maktoum, a member of Dubai's ruling family Al Maktoum, who he married in 1979. His most famous junior wife is Princess Haya, who he married on April 10, 2004. Statement: A spokesman for Princess Haya (right) has said Sheikh Mohammed's (left) operation had not been spoken to by the VMD since the seizure . The British Horseracing Authority has . said it has been told by Defra there was no link between the seizure . and the racing industry. Adam . Brickell, the BHA's director of integrity, legal and risk, said: 'This . issue is a matter for Defra and the VMD, the agency responsible for . issues concerning the use and manufacture of veterinary medicines in . Britain. 'On account of our existing working . relationship with Defra and the VMD, as fellow regulatory authorities . with responsibilities for animals and their welfare, the BHA was . notified of the seizure of veterinary care products, some of which are . not licensed for use in the UK. 'Defra . have confirmed to the BHA that they consider there to be no link . between the seizure and the racing industry and that the products were . not intended for use on thoroughbreds.' A Border Force spokesman said the products seized at Stansted had now been destroyed. The spokesman told MailOnline: 'On May 3 Border Force officers at Stansted identified a quantity of veterinary products on a private plane that arrived at the airport. 'The products, which were unlicensed, had been listed as horse tack and were seized by officers. Illegal drug use: Former Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years after anabolic steroids were used on 22 horses in the stable . 'DEFRA (the Department for Environment, . Food and Rural Affairs) was contacted and confirmed Border Force . officers' identification of the medicines, which were subsequently . removed and destroyed. 'Border Force officers are on constant . alert to keep unlicensed, fake and illegal items from entering the . country — including veterinary products.' In April, former Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years after anabolic steroids were used on 22 horses in the stable. Earlier this month it was reported Sheikh Mohammed was embroiled in another drugs controversy after 124 unauthorised veterinary products were seized at Moorley Farm East in Newmarket. The farm, which is owned by Darley Stud, the banner company of his breeding operation, was the subject of a swoop in August by DEFRA (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs) and is a base for endurance horses owned by the Sheik’s family. It is unknown whether the seizure at Stansted and the raid at Moorley Farm are connected.","Banned equine drugs discovered at Stansted on flight from Dubai .

A peckish crook was caught by police after he took a bite out of a cucumber and left it at the scene of the crime. Billy Joe Donnelly, 22, burgled a greenhouse and sampled the owner’s home-grown produce - leaving his DNA all over it. Sentencing him to two and a half years in jail at Hull Crown Court, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'You were caught by a cucumber.' Burglar Billy Joe Donnelly was caught after he took a bite out of a cucumber and left it at the scene . Donnelly ate a variety of produce and then burgled the home on August 21. Prosecuting, Jharna Jobes said: 'The owner was going to sell the items he was growing in the greenhouse, but someone had been in there and eaten most of the vegetables and a cucumber. 'A cucumber was found with his DNA on it. 'The occupants were in bed asleep at the time and there must have been some planning involved in this.' Donnelly then broke into the house next to the greenhouse in the village of Preston by breaking a window. He ransacked the house, stealing treasured possessions including the retirement watch of the owner. His wife woke up to discover her car was missing. In a victim impact statement, the couple said they now felt they needed to sell their home of more than 20 years because they no longer felt safe. They said: 'It has been very distressing. 'He stole two keyrings, which were of sentimental value given to me by my mother after my father died in 1972.' Donnelly, of Wimbourne Close, Bransholme, Hull, also stole £77 of meat from a shop. When the police arrested him on August 25, two cannabis plants were found in his airing cupboard. He pleaded guilty at Hull Crown Court to two burglaries, theft and to producing cannabis. His barrister Stephen Robinson said: 'The burglary has had a profound effect on the complainants. 'He was just not thinking about that at the time. 'He is sorry for what has happened and he bitterly regrets his actions. 'He had been drinking heavily at the time and was riding around on his bike when he entered the greenhouse and he ate some of the produce from there. 'It was foolish behaviour and he was identified by a cucumber.' Donnelly has previous convictions for a burglary and shop thefts. Donnelly was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in jail by Judge Michael Mettyear at Hull Crown Court . The judge told him: 'Burglaries are regarded as serious by the courts because, often, people who are the victims sometimes never fully recover from what happens to them and they have been in this case. 'They have been left so upset by what has happened they are going to have to move. 'It is absolutely ghastly and why courts regard it as so serious. 'I have absolutely no doubt you were out looking for something to do and the consequences have been ghastly.' He added: 'Only custody can be justified the only question is how long the sentence should be. 'The only real mitigation was your plea of guilty.'","Billy Joe Donnelly burgled greenhouse and home in August .

Airlines made multi-billion pound profits last year, charging passengers for an array of extra services, from on-flight food to paying tickets by credit card. Travel companies charged their customers almost £18billion in 2012, a sum which has doubled in just three years. The worst - or most clever - airline, Australian long-haul flight-company Qantas, charged an average of £37 per passenger in extras alone, industry figures reveal. High-flying firm: Australian long-haul flight-company Quantas, charged an average of £37 per passenger in extras alone in 2012 . Contrary to its reputation as an airline which charges extra for all things possible, Ryanair only made £11 per customer last year, and it is in fact the big-name companies that rake in the cash. Although many airlines now charge to reserve a seat or print a boarding pass, a majority of the revenue comes from the big up-sells such as selling extra miles or upgrades to frequent fliers and commission on car rentals and hotels. The figures comes from the annual research by analysts IdeaWorks who study the revenue records of the 53 airlines which disclose how much they make from ancilliary revenue. In some cases the airlines publish every detail about what they make and where, in others they simply put in the final figure without explaining where it all comes from. Flying high: A majority of airlines now charge extra for what was previously included in the price, such as in-flight meals and seat reservations, to keep prices down in competition with budget airlines . Worldwide, the biggest earners are Qantas which earns nearly £37 per passenger in extras alone. The European league, with its shorter flights, make slightly less, with the highest earner, budget airline Jet2Com making £30 per person, followed by Virgin Atlantic with £20 a passenger.

Chance has retained a lawyer and is expected to turn himself into cops on Friday. Alexian Lien was dragged from his Range Rover and beaten so badly he had to be hospitalized after he enraged dozens of members of a biker club after a confrontation on a New York City highway. Caught: NYPD detectives believe they have identified the man (left) who is thought to have inflicted most of the damage to Alexian Lien .

Fearful: Alexian Lien and his wife Roslyn Ng have revealed how they were just trying to protect their family when their car plowed down a group of bikers that had cornered them in New York City . Chance is described as working at a sandwich shop, where is his both a driver and a manager. The Post reports that he is from Guyana. Lien was driving his wife, Rosyln Ng, . and their two-year-old daughter as the couple celebrated their first . wedding anniversary, when one biker braked in front of them, causing . Lien to hit him and sparking the chase through the streets of New York. At . one point, the 20 to 30 bikers cornered their car, causing a panicked . Lien to plow through the crowd, seriously injuring one rider. He sped . off but when he came to a standstill in Manhattan traffic, bikers . smashed his window, pulled him from the car and beat him. 'Our plan last Sunday was to . celebrate our wedding anniversary by having a nice family day out with . our two-year-old daughter,' Lien's family wrote in a statement released . through their lawyers.

"By . Will Stewart In Moscow . UPDATED: . 02:00 EST, 3 March 2012 . Suspect: Nikolai Rakossi, nicknamed the 'Russian Rambo', fled the U.S. before the bodies of his lover and her daughter were found stabbed to death . A suspected double murderer nicknamed 'Russian Rambo' has been allowed to cheat justice and start a new life because of chronic red tape between Washington and Moscow, the victims' closest relative says. Nurse Tatyana Prikhodko, 56, and her glamorous daughter Larisa, 28, were stabbed to death in their New York home in April last year in a case that shocked America. Before their blood-soaked bodies were discovered, Tatyana's bearded husband Nikolai Rakossi, 58, a former Soviet paratrooper, fled the US on an Aeroflot plane to Moscow. Now her other daughter Svetlana . Prikhodko, 31, has spoken exclusively to Mail Online to express her . despair that nothing is being done to detain Rakossi - seen as the only . suspect - as surprising new details have emerged of the case. She . believes he is being hidden by family and friends in Russia, possibly . in the grim industrial city of Novomoskovsk, where he owns an apartment . and where one neighbour claims to have seen him since the double . killing. 'I . have no doubt it was him, none at all,' said the neighbour, asking to . remain anonymous for her own safety. 'He looked worried and tense.' The . fear is Rakossi has now totally vanished and will never be found by the . time an Interpol request for Russia to arrest him is finally issued. Releasing . new family pictures in a bid to keep attention on the case, she said: . 'As you can see, ten months have not yielded any action in regards to . arresting Rakossi. 'We have tried through multiple sources to expedite the processing of the evidence but it is still being evaluated. Together: Larisa Prikhodko, left, and her mother Tatiana, . centre, were killed in New York last April. Larisa's sister . Svetlana, right, has said nothing is being done to detain the man she . believes is responsible . 'The US needs to have a complete case in . order to send it to Russia and there is absolutely no timeline on when . it could be happening. 'I speak with the District Attorney's . office almost on a weekly bases and they keep insisting that so much . work has been completed already but once again, until they have the . results for absolutely everything, they will not take the case to the . grand jury for indictment. 'We are just told to wait and as mad as that makes me, there is nothing that could be done.' Without an indictment, she has been told, the US cannot issue an Interpol demand for Rakossi to be arrested. Meanwhile new details have emerged which make the family doubt that it was simple family brawl that developed into an ugly killing. 'The facts point to something far . darker and more sinister than anyone could have imagined,' said a source . close to the family and concerned at the lack of progress. Concerns . have even been voiced that his entire life in the US may have been a . cover story for other, perhaps criminal, activities. Stunning: It is believed that Larisa Prikhodko, pictured, walked in on her mother and Rakossi arguing . Victim: Sources suggested Rakossi had a secret life that was discovered by the two women. Larisa is pictured . It is claimed that on the day of the murders Rakossi was repeatedly on the phone to Russia, both before and after the killings. It is assumed that the police have the numbers. 'Rakossi made almost 20 phone calls to Russia, starting at 5:30 am, though typically he seldom called anyone,' said the source. 'The calls were only briefly interrupted at 2:40 pm for ten minutes when he committed the first murder. He then resumed calling until 3:40 pm when Larisa walked in, resulting in, another ten minute interruption in the calls. 'Afterwards, he continued dialling until he boarded the flight the following evening. Who was he calling and why? Doting: Tatyana and Larisa leave behind Larisa's daughter Ryan, 3, who was with her father at the time . 'What secret, besides the two bodies of his ""family"" did he take with him when he boarded Aeroflot at 7 pm on April 17?' One theory is that Tatyana may have stumbled on some secret about him, and that a worried Rakossi had called Moscow for orders on how to react. 'The quiet, subdued Rakossi was living a double life ever since the moment he landed in the US, or this is now how it seems,' said the source. 'Arriving on a tourist visa, he charmed Tatyana who was already a US citizen after arriving to live the American dream, and soon asked her to marry him and became part of the family. 'The family did not have a clear . picture of what Rakossi was doing during these 11 years. He never held a . regular job and claimed that he did construction work on the side. Yet he annually went back to Russia where he had an apartment and a car.' Unanswered: Sources say Rakossi was on his phone for hours before and after the killings - and question why . The killings were carried out clinically, without a single scream to alert neighbours in the block. 'Who was this Rakossi that he allegedly knew how to handle a knife so expertly and kill an adult without even a cry from the victim? 'And what animal must he be to murder a young mother as she opened the door to her mother's apartment an hour later? What possible monstrous force and deed could have caused such an act of violence? 'No one deserves the horrible end that Larisa and Tatyana met.' Secrets: Svetlana believes Rakossi, pictured with his daughter Yevgenia in 2007, is being hidden by his family .

Derwent Island is a beautiful secluded seven acre retreat that has an 18th century home hidden among the woodland but though impressive, it wasn't a hit . with all the locals - it is said that celebrated poet William . Wordsworth was offended by the design of the house and thought it spoilt . the view. The island sits just 150 yards from the shoreline of the Lake District’s Derwent Water and just half-a-mile from the bustling market town of Keswick offering residents a rare chance to be both part of a thriving local community and live in picturesque isolation. Derwent Island is a secluded seven acre retreat that has an 18th century home hidden among the woodland . Spectacular views: Free from cars the island feels completely cut off from civilisation and even the milk is delivered daily by canoe . Opulent: The new tenants get to enjoy buy must enjoy but also care for the opulent home and furniture . The unique location is owned by the National Trust which rents out the the grade II listed property on a long term let in excess of 40,000 pounds a year. The lease on the stunning six-bed home has become available for the first time in 10 years and already the agents handling the tenancy are preparing themselves to be inundated with applications. The lucky tenants will get two motorboat launches for the five minute trip to the mainland and a quad bike to get around the isle. Once on the island the feeling of total isolation is complete but a milkman delivering a daily pint from a canoe should be enough to keep visitors civilised. The property on the island, which was . formerly known as Vicar’s Island, was built by eccentric banker Joseph . Pocklington in the 18th century. There is also a large garage in the lakeside village of Portinscale where a car can be stashed for excusions to the mainland. But this dreamy island idle does come with certain restrictions in the tenancy. Training: New residents will be trained by the National Trust to look after all the valuable art works, antiques and furniture at Derwent House . The house is situated on Derwent Island, one of four in the lake including Lord's Island, St Herbert's Island, and Rampsholme Island. The new tenants will be able to take one of the two motor boats to the nearby market town of Keswick if they can tear themselves away from the gorgeous interior . The property has to be manned all year round and must be opened up to visitors for five days of the year. The occupiers will also be trained in how to look after important antiques, art works and furniture in the Georgian house and must also prove that they are 'fairly robust.' Helen Lancaster, of letting agents Carter Jonas, said: 'It has been the principal residency for 10 years of the outgoing tenants. 'The husband has got a business in the north west that he travels to but he has been lucky enough to have been able to work from home. Room with a view: wherever you are in the house, the huge windows mean you never miss out on the incredible surroundings . Home sweet home: the last tenants used the mansion for 10 years but have finally decided to move out, though it is hard to imagine why . 'The property is new to the market but we have already had wide-ranging interest from private individuals to CEOs of companies. 'Obviously this appeals to people who want to get away from it all and live a secluded lifestyle. It is easy to get romantic about this beautiful isle in the middle of a lake. 'But from another point of view, the practicalities involved of things like lugging bags of shopping onto a boat is less romantic. 'There is an application process that . will involve an interview. People must be financially robust to take it . on as well as show they can take on the mantle of custodian of a . historic property for the National Trust. House share: whoever rents the house will have to get used to guests as the property must be opened to the public for at least five days a year .

Mrs Lancaster said: 'There are no cars allowed in the island but it comes with a garage and parking area on the mainland. 'There is an agreement for the milkman to store his canoe in the garage in return for him making a daily delivery to the island. 'Of the two boats, one is shallow-hulled because the lake level rises and falls quite significantly.

The British woman known was the White Widow is believed to have paid for three fake passports for herself and her two children, it has been alleged.

Lewthwaite was named last week by Interpol as the world's most wanted woman following the Nairobi mall massacre and it has now been claimed she may have worked with a second jihadist from Britain in plotting the attack. A copy of Samantha Lewthwaite's fake South African passport. Forger Ehmed Chisty claims she paid him £1,200 for false passports for herself and two of her children . Lewthwaite is pictured, right, in the South African passport photograph and, left, in a picture from a personal computer found by police at the house she was renting in Mombasa . Umar Arshad fled Britain six years ago and has now reportedly risen up the Al Qaeda ranks and has been named in connection with the Westgate atrocity. Six Britons were among at least 67 people murdered by Al Shabaab terrorists at the upmarket mall. Muslim convert Lewthwaite, 29, is the widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay. She fled her home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in 2009, and is on the run in East Africa. Yesterday, a manager at a real estate company in northern Johannesburg said Lewthwaite had rented a home there between 2009 and 2010. She used a fake passport under the name Natalie Faye Webb to apparently set up home in the country and weeks before the mall atrocity was allegedly spotted spying city on foreign embassies in the city. Former Manchester University student Umar Arshad has been linked to the White Widow . Chisty, 60, who is currently serving a 37-year jail sentence for arranging thousands of fake documents, says Lewthwaite came to him for a forged passport. He was quoted by The Mirror as saying: 'I think if I hadn't helped her, none of these people would have been killed.' Lewthwaite is the world’s most wanted woman after Interpol issued a worldwide arrest warrant last week. Security . measures in South Africa have come under scrutiny after the reports . Lewthwaite was able to fraudulently obtain her passport. Gwede Mantashe, secretary general of the ruling African National Congress, said: 'This . attack has highlighted the need for tighter immigration laws and . processes, strengthening of the security features of the South African . identity documents and the monitoring of the movement of people in . general and suspicious movements in particular.' Nine people have been arrested in . connection with the attacks and five militants were killed during the . four-day siege that began on September 21. Besides . more than 50 innocent Kenyans, citizens from Britain, France, China, . Ghana, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Peru and the Netherlands were . also murdered in the atrocity. However, . there has been a lack of information about the identity of the . attackers, fuelling speculation that radicalised Somalis from the U.S. and Europe may have been involved. Lewthwaite was named by Interpol as the world's most wanted women following the Nairobi mall attack . There are fears 'White Widow' Lewthwaite has linked up with a second British jihadist Umar Arshad . Security officials have been quoted as saying that Arshad, originally from Manchester, who is known to have travelled to Kenya, may have linked up with Lewthwaite. An unnamed security intelligence source told The Sun: 'We believe [Arshad] played a significant role in the Nairobi mall atrocity.' Toaha Qureshi, a security expert, told the newspaper Arshad is in the highest ranks of al-Qaeda and known for his computer abilities. He was put on a control order in 2007 and told to give up his passport but instead fled the country. Arshad is currently on Interpol's 'no fly' list. His family have previously said that the former Manchester University pharmacy student was converted by local extremists over a short space of time. Arshad's family contacted the police over fears for his safety but despite being under surveillance he was able to leave the country.","Ehmed Chisty claims he organised fake documents for Samantha Lewthwaite .

The wife of a convicted drugs baron spent  thousands of pounds on Botox, designer handbags and sports cars while claiming benefits, a court heard. Diane Brookhouse, 41, applied for the state handouts after her husband Richard, 45, was jailed for smuggling cocaine and heroin. But rather than living on the breadline, the mother of two enjoyed a lavish lifestyle by  helping him run his illegal  business from behind bars, it is alleged. Trial: Diane Brookhouse (left) collected her husband Richard (right) - who masterminded the operation from his prison cell - on day release from Kirkham open prison and drove him to drugs meetings, the court heard . Warrington Crown Court was told that . Brookhouse was a key player in a drugs ring that imported more than . £15million of heroin and cocaine into the UK via ‘fishing trips’ from . France. Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, claimed . she took her husband, who was nearing the end of his 22-year sentence, . to meetings with drug dealing associates while on day release from . prison. He said: ‘She did so, in part at least, in order to obtain the . funds required to maintain a lifestyle that she could not afford to . enjoy through legitimate means.’ Brookhouse also claimed  benefits, he . said, while making a ‘substantial cash deposit’ on her rented property . as well as rental payments that ‘exceeded the amount that she received . by way of housing benefit’. She also ran two luxury cars – a Mercedes CLC 180 Sport and a Volkswagen Golf convertible. Mr Flewitt told jurors that . Brookhouse, of Warrington, Cheshire, spent almost £1,300 at the . hairdressers’, making 16  visits to a Toni and Guy salon in just over a . year. Fists up: Former amateur boxing champion Carl Wall, 36, was described as a 'wholesaler' for whom Mr Brookhouse arranged importations. He admitted conspiracy to supply controlled drugs . And between June 2010 and June 2013, . she also allegedly spent £2,635 on Botox and filler treatments at a . private clinic, which she mostly paid for in cash, and had two . top-of-the range iPhones on £80 contracts. When Brookhouse was arrested, police . also found a £1,215 receipt for a handbag by the designer brand Chloe . and £440 cash in her purse. The brunette is in the dock alongside . co-accused Stephen Crane, 55, of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and Ikhlaq . Hussain, 25, of Bury. All three deny conspiracy to supply cocaine and . heroin. Brookhouse also denies conspiracy to supply the party drug . mephedrone or M-cat. The court heard that the drugs were trafficked into . Britain by a 19-strong gang using chartered fishing breaks to the . continent as cover. The plot unravelled after a trip to . northern France in April last year when officers in Essex collared two . men loading a van with a haul including cocaine with a street value of . £15million and £400,000 worth of heroin.

An ancient trade which has sustained workmen in the North since the 7th century has come to an end thanks to council health and safety rules. The last 19 'sea-coalers', who gather coal washed up on Seaton Carew beach in Hartlepool, County Durham, have been denied access to the beach after the local authority erected bollards and dug a deep hole overnight to keep them away. They are now unable to bring their modified Land Rover on to the beach, which allowed them to bring their painstakingly-harvested coal scraps back to land for sale. Black gold: Tony Reed, pictured, is a 'sea-colaer' who spends all day scraping coal off of a beach in Hartlepool, County Durham . Fuel: Mr Reed and the 18 other sea-coalers harvest thousands of tonnes of coal a year, which is burned for energy . Sea-coaling has been a part of life in Hartlepool for centuries, and is made possible by the tides, which erode coal from the bed of the North Sea, which is then washed up on the beach every day. Each man can harvest more than a tonne of coal each day, which is then sold on to power plants to produce energy. Tony Reed, 51, was a sea-coaler for 30 years before he found his livelihood cut off last Saturday by the building work. 'It just absolutely shocked me,' he said. 'I did not have a clue it was going to happen and my first thought was, they [Hartlepool Council] have gone behind our backs again – they have been trying for ages to get rid of the sea-coalers.' Collection: This back-breaking labour allows Mr hall and his colleagues to collect around a tonne of coal each every day . Transport: Mr Hall uses an adapted Land Rover to transport the coal, but bollards erected by the local council mean he can no longer get it on the beach . Stoic: The work is incredibly arduous and the men must move quickly to harvest the coal . He was confronted with the bollards and hole on September 28, just hours after he finished his previous shift at 4am. He said: ''It’s all well and good for them, but I’m 51-years-old, have three children and I’m self-employed so all my living has gone and I’m stuck – they have dumped it straight on me.' 'No reasons have been given for the closure and when I went to try and get to the bottom of it, I was not allowed on the site because I was not wearing a hard hat. Ridiculous.' Heft: The seawater makes the coal particles very heavy, and the only way to lift the dust onto the Land Rover is by hand . Dispute: Hartlepool Council says sea-coaling must stop as the beach is for pedestrians only . Hartlepool Borough Council defended its decision by saying the beach was only for pedestrians. It said: 'The access to this particular area is for pedestrians only but sea coalers have been using it to transport coal in motorised wheelbarrows from the beach up to the promenade. 'This is compromising public safety, defacing the promenade and causing noise nuisance which is why we have taken action to install the bollards.' Ancient: The coal was first gathered by monks in the 7th Century . Uncertainty: Coal-fired plants are under threat, throwing doubt onto the future of sea-coaling's future . Scraping together: An average load on the Land Rovers is two tonnes . But Mr Reed said that local people approve of the work he does as it keeps the beach clean, and that nobody complains. He said: 'All we ever get is compliments from the pubic - we’re doing everyone a huge service clearing up the coal and as for the cars, the horses that are allowed on the beach are more of a threat to it! 'It just seems like they’re making up excuses to finally get rid of us after years of trying.'","'Sea-coaling' has taken place in Hartlepool, County Durham, for centuries .

Two 'useless' dogs who were abandoned by their owners are now saving some of Britain's most historic homes after being hired by the National Trust to sniff out dry rot. Labradors Sam and Wilson have been specially trained to alert surveyors to damage which is invisible to the human eye in stately homes. The so-called 'rot hounds' have already saved conservationists hundreds of thousands of pounds by leading them to the early signs of dry rot at National Trust properties. Specialist: Wilson goes to work sniffing out dry rot which even an experienced building surveyor such as Tim Hutton, above, may not be able to spot . Yellow labrador Sam and his black counterpart spent 12 months training for their new role after their previous owners gave them away. Sam's former owners were fed-up with him being too boisterous while Wilson was retired as a shooting dog because he was afraid of guns. They now sniff their way around historic houses and are trained to sit down when they detect a whiff of the fungus. The labradors are the only two professional dry rot sniffers in Britain and happily carry out their work in return for chocolate rewards. Sam and Wilson have been taken on by Hutton and Rostron Environmental Ltd, a Surrey-based historic building restoration firm which specialises in the environmentally friendly control of dry rot and decay. Managing director James Hutton said: 'The dogs enjoy their jobs. It is a game for them. Star employees: Wilson, left used to be a gun dog who was scared of guns and Sam was abandoned by his previous owners for being too boisterous . 'They run in circles of decreasing size and hone into the area. Then they sit down.' Both dogs were given away by their owners to Blue Cross animal rescue homes where they were then adopted by Hutton and Rostron. Sam, seven, is based in Guilford, Surrey, and looks after properties in the south of Britain. His latest assignment was finding dry rot in the 300-year-old basement of 17th Century National Trust property, Wimpole Hall, near Cambridge. Cheap labour: The labradors are the only two . professional dry rot sniffers in Britain and happily carry out their . work in return for chocolate rewards . Collections manager, Lisa Voden-Decker, said: 'Sam's sniffing skills allowed him to sweep spaces and locate rot within concealed timber and masonry.' Wilson, eight, lives near Kendal, Cumbria, with surveyor Peter Monaghan, 60, and hunts rot in the north. Mr Monaghan said: 'A boisterous working dog is exactly what's needed for sniffing out anything, whether it's drugs, firearms or fungus. 'You need a very focused, single-minded animal determined to find something that usually can't be seen. Top job: The labradors showed their worth when they helped to survey the 17th Century National Trust property, Wimpole Hall, near Cambridge, above . 'Sam lives for the joy of working, praise from me - and the occasional doughnut.' Serpula lacrymans, known as dry rot, flourishes where there is moisture, and leads to decay and deterioration of timber, but can be treated if caught early. Hutton and Rostron have previously had Rot-dogs called into Windsor Castle, following the fire in 1992.","Sam and Wilson are the only two professional rot sniffer dogs in the UK .

An Egyptian police chief was shot dead today as security forces tried to regain control of an area where gunmen killed 11 policemen last month and mutilated their bodies. Police had earlier fired tear gas and exchanged gunfire with armed men in Kerdasa, on the outskirts of Cairo, state TV reported.

Egyptian security forces help the lifeless body of Giza Police Chief General Nabil Farag, who was killed after unidentified militants opened fire . Police Chief General Farag had been on an operation with security forces deployed early morning to the town of Kirdasa to drive off suspected Islamists taking control of the town near Giza Pyramids, Egypt . Security troops backed up by helicopters, had stormed into the area, an Islamist stronghold, to carry out arrests after the torching of a number of police stations and the killing of an estimated 11 officers in clashes that followed the removal of President Mohamed Morsi in July. Kerdasa police station was abandoned after it was hit with rocket propelled grenades and gunfire on August 14 - the same day security forces moved against protests by supporters of the deposed president, killing hundreds. Police forces had not been allowed in Kerdasa since then. General Nabil Farrag, the assistant security director of the Giza Province, is dragged from a car after he was shot during an operation against gunmen . General Nabil Farrag died shortly after being brought to a hospital. Security forces captured 14 Islamist fugitives wanted for alleged involvement in violence in the village and at the six-week long Islamist sit-in outside Cairo University in support of ousted president Mohammed Morsi . The Egyptian Interior Ministry said the police chief was shot by gunmen positioned on the roofs of schools and mosques which the militants had taken over. At least one other police officer was injured in Thursday's violence, state TV reported. It said police forces took control of the area and imposed a curfew.

Violence between his supporters and security forces included massive attacks on police stations, security officers and churches. At least 1,000 people have died in the violence with most deaths coming during the security forces' dispersal of two pro-Morsi sit-ins in Cairo on August 14. About 100 police officers also died in the clashes. Nearly 2,000 Islamist activists and politicians have been arrested since Morsi's removal.

There is no doubt that the 27-year-old Liverpudlian has been showcasing a super slim figure of late. And now, Wayne Rooney's wife has revealed the secret weapon she used to shift her 'mummy tummy'. Slimmer frame: Coleen Rooney has been displaying a more svelte figure lately and now she has revealed the secret behind it . The mother-of-two is currently using Technoshape - a fat-blitzing stomach belt - to rid her post baby stomach after giving birth to baby Klay back in May, which can be worn whilst working out on a treadmill or bike. Coleen has signed up for a course of sessions using the machine, which has been dubbed a 'non-surgical tummy tuck', after it was recommended to her by her personal trainer, Elise Lindsay. A spokesman for the exercise machine, which costs £37 per session, said: 'Alongside her usual aerobic workout, Coleen Rooney is using Technoshape to enhance the fat-burning process around her tummy. 'Coleen was introduced to Technoshape by Elise Lindsay. She is using the machine for her mummy tummy, which is exactly the kind . of thing it was designed for.

"By . Kathryn Knight . PUBLISHED: . 09:23 EST, 4 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:32 EST, 4 October 2013 . I am lying in a crisp white bathrobe on a vast and comfortable bed, channel flicking through the flat-screen television and nibbling on a bowl of nuts and olives while awaiting my dinner. A glass of chilled white wine is on its way, along with a beer for my husband Duncan. The environment screams chic boutique hotel, right down to the feature wallpaper and expensive toiletries in the bathroom - except, that is, for the custom-made crib and changing station parked beside my bed. They're for our three-month-old baby Connie - not that she's with us at the moment: instead she is on the other side of the robustly soundproofed door, being looked after by a calm and cheerful nanny. Kathryn Knight and baby Constance in the main suite at the Mermaid Maternity Retreat, where rooms cost £595 per night . With a 'sun room', yoga studio and airy dining room served by a top-notch chef, I feel like I'm on a baby-free spa minibreak, and in some ways I am, were it not for the fact that my daughter is kicking away in her cot just down the hall. Then again, it would be hard to put an exact label on this experience: the Mermaid Maternity Retreat is such a new concept that it doesn't really fall into any obvious category. One part hotel spa and two parts nursery and clinic, the Mermaid bills itself as a unique new service aiming to bridge the gap between hospital and home for bewildered new mums, as well as offering on-going services for the first few months of your baby's life. It's the first of its kind in the UK, and if it's a success the owners hope to roll the model out nationwide. The idea is the brainchild of Nick Balfour, a London businessman and father of four  - who also happens to be the son of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, which in turn makes him second cousin once removed to Prince Charles. He came up with the idea six years ago following the birth of his third daughter at The Portland, the private maternity hospital in London beloved of celebrities and high rollers  - and where a standard birth package costs around £15,000, with extra nights coming in at £1,000-plus. Kathryn having lunch in the dining area with Constance in crib . 'The figures didn't add up,' Nick recalls now. 'It's a great hospital, but what you get for your thousand pounds a night is just a hospital room – with everything else costing extra. 'I realised that once the professionals have done their job and helped you bring your baby into the world there was nothing between hospital and home, a place where new mums could be nurtured in an environment by qualified people who understood their needs.' The result, four years in the planning, is a fourteen-bedroom venue, complete with nursery, yoga studio and treatment rooms situated in the heart of London, above a department store on Chelsea's Kings Road. If you sign up for the Mermaid package, you get a private transfer from hospital, all meals in your heavily fortified room, breastfeeding support, a daily midwife visit and babysitting facilities, should you fancy popping to the spa room for a pedicure. Husbands are welcome too. There's also a blue-chip support team onside, some with royal links of their own. Among them are Vicki Edgson, one of the country's foremost nutritional therapists who has worked with Sarah Ferguson, who offers pre and post birth nutrition advice, and Maggie Howell, who is rumoured to have provided the hypnotherapy birthing CDs used by the Duchess of Cambridge to prepare for the birth of baby George (not, of course, that she will possibly comment on this). Of course, none of this comes cheap. A night here costs from £595 -  a lot of money for the average new mum who is eking out maternity pay, furnishing the nursery through Ebay and buying budget moisturiser to save money for nappies. For these women, I suggest, the idea of spending nearly two thousand pounds on a three-night maternity minibreak seems about as likely as doing fifty star jumps moments after giving birth - especially when most have such a strong nesting urge that they want nothing more than to go home, pull the duvet over their head and summon their mums. The women who can afford it meanwhile, are already staffed up the eyeballs. That, Nick tells me, is missing the point.  'Of course some women want to go home, wherever home is  - but we are here for the ones who don't.  The reality is that NHS discharges women routinely six hours after a normal birth and one or two nights following a caesarean. 'It's medically safe to do so but that doesn't mean that a woman doesn't need to be supported rather than just sent home and left to her own devices. We're here to offer that support in a peaceful and calm environment, to allow you to recover,' he says. 'The reality is that a room here is cheaper than the cheapest room at a private maternity hospital in London and far nicer than a private hospital room in an NHS hospital, which can also cost hundreds of pounds.' I find it hard to argue with that. Knowing I was to give birth by elective caesarean I had enquired about a private room at my hospital, London's St Thomas, because it would have enabled my husband to stay the night, something that isn't allowed on the general maternity ward.  One was indeed available -  but only if I was prepared to stump up an eye-popping  £900 a night. Many hospitals do offer cheaper private rooms, but most come in around £200-£300 a night – and for that you get little more than a room with a hospital bed and functional bathroom. Against that backdrop the Mermaid costings feel more palatable, although there will of course still be many women who think that if you have that kind of money to spend you would be better of hiring a maternity nurse who can look after you in your own bedroom. Kathryn being pampered in the Wellbeing Centre at the Mermaid, where a night costs from £595 . Then there's the singularly emotional business of having a baby itself. While any new mum is welcome the Mermaid is, largely, aimed at us first-timers – and the fact is that no-one really knows how they will feel after they've had a baby until - well, they've had a baby. I had a lovely time during my two-night stay, catching a snooze in my pristine white room  while the mother and baby team fussed over Connie and indulging in the food from their undeniably delicious menu. Duncan and I even hoofed off to the pub one evening leaving Connie in the capable hands of the night nanny - but then I was three months into motherhood and not as emotional and fearful as I was after I had just given birth. For the same reasons I was able to fully benefit from all the other services on offer, from an indulgent pedicure to a nutrition consultation and a cranial osteopathy session with the Mermaid's team of experts. Winding the clock back to when I had given birth, it's hard to know whether I would have been able to fully appreciate everything on offer – and whether I might  have found myself yearning for my own bed, even if the sheets don't come with a thousand thread count. Still, it seems plenty are willing to give it a try:  as I leave, the Mermaid team are preparing for the imminent arrival of four new mums with their tiny charges. And Nick, as ever, is ready with an answer. 'We're here for whatever stage you are at, whether it is total newborn or a few weeks down the road. Your needs change of course but we are there for every bit of it. If you just want to sleep you can do so knowing someone is looking after your baby if that is what you would like. If you want support with breastfeeding then we can help you with that too. New mums can have very different needs but we like to think we have thought of them all.' mermaid.co.uk .

"By . Sarah Vine . PUBLISHED: . 17:25 EST, 2 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:25 EST, 2 October 2013 . Sarah Vine puts Poundland's make-up under the microscope . Poundland in Portobello Road is one of the last bastions of normality in Notting Hill, an area of London that has all been colonised by German bankers, their rail-thin wives and an assortment of international celebrity/ supermodel types. Old Sloanes like me are practically an endangered species, along with the jovial drunks and the old Rasta entertaining passing tourists with his steel drums. The shop, which occupies the site of the old Woolworth's, is a stone's throw from the likes of swanky stores such as Oka, Graham & Greene and Cath Kidston; in socio-economic terms, however, it's a million postcodes away. And yet, as I peruse the beauty aisle, I find I'm not the only one with a Radio 4 accent. 'Excuse me,' says a middle-aged lady, her reading specs perched on the edge of her nose, reaching for a nail polish. 'Not at all,' I reply, and we do a funny little politeness dance with our baskets. On my left, a young Polish girl pops a couple of nail art pens in hers. I am here because Poundland's profits are up, way up; and according to the company's chief executive, Jim McCarthy, it's due to an influx of middle-class customers like me stocking up on cheap cosmetics. I'll be honest: I'm not a Poundland regular. I am, however, addicted to cheapie fashion store TK Maxx, so I'm no stranger to discount shopping. But while I love a bargain dress, I'm more cautious when it comes to cosmetics. Quality, not price, drives my purchases. First on my Poundland list is foundation. Not much choice (and nothing for darker skins). Since there are no testers, I choose the shade that looks closest to my skin tone, 'biscuit'. The brand is Chit Chat, not one I'm familiar with. I find a black mascara in the same vein. A brand called Catwalk Collection yields three eyeshadows, a plum, a purple and a dark grey (good colours) as well as a neutral pinky nude lipstick. The ingredients are listed on the back: Mica, talc, paraffin liquidum magnesium, ethylhexyl stearate, and many more. Not one for lovers of natural cosmetics. Still, at least they're being honest. 'The ingredients are listed on the back: Mica, talc, paraffin liquidum magnesium, ethylhexyl stearate, and many more. Not one for lovers of natural cosmetics. Still, at least they're being honest' I spot a pot of Calvin Klein eyeshadow, so I bag that too. Lastly a powder compact ('Wet 'n' Wild Ultimate Touch'; nothing untoward, I can assure you), some make-up brushes, a Revlon nail polish and a make-up bag. No eyeliner, sadly. Total cost: £10. The brushes are exactly what you would expect for £1: plastic, nasty and they shed little synthetic hairs everywhere. The foundation is a different story. It's good. It goes on evenly, covers shadows and surface blemishes with a luminous, lightweight finish. The smell is quite strong, but it's not unpleasant, just a little soapy. The concealer is a tad waxy, but it blends well and does the job. The powder is yuk: chalky and horrid. The pot of CK eyeshadow turns out to be a disappointment, too: it looks like it's already been opened, and there is a distinct brush mark in it. I don't mind buying my china as seconds, but eyeshadow? Not so sure. 'Am I a convert? No. But I did pick up some great Hallowe'en tat for the children, a new dustpan and brush and something to unblock the bathroom drain with' The mascara is just about okay. Watery, mainly, and definitely not 'lash building', as advertised. As for the eyeshadows, they go on well but last only a few hours. The nail polish, meanwhile, has clearly seen better days. The colours have separated and the consistency is too thick. Maybe a spell in the fridge will revive it. Am I a convert? No. But I did pick up some great Hallowe'en tat for the children, a new dustpan and brush and something to unblock the bathroom drain  with. Not a complete waste of  time, then. It may have escaped your attention, but as well as apparently rejecting both bras and buttons (see Kim Kardashian, Miranda Kerr et al), the fashion crowd are also eschewing make-up. Go nude (facially) like Rosie . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Georgia May Jagger, even Holly Willoughby have been venturing out bare-faced. Well, sort of. The thing about the no make-up make-up look is that it actually requires more make-up than the make-up look, if you get my drift. Unless you happen to be a dewy-skinned 21-year-old with supermodel genes, that flawless oh-look-I-just-fell-down-from-heaven angel vibe is hard to pull off without a little help. It depends first and foremost on skin tone. This isn't just about finding a good foundation; its about keeping your skin in top condition. The Clarisonic (£125, from clarisonic.co.uk) may seem like just another fancy gadget, but it works wonders on all skin types. Use it regularly, and you will see real improvement, not just in terms of breakouts, but also skin tone and softness. Next, you'll need a really good day cream. Make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury's Magic Cream has just launched in Selfridges and on her website, www.charlottetilbury.com. This is the stuff she uses to prep the skins of fag- and jet-ravaged models, and it is truly fabulous. A tiny bit goes a very long way, which is just as well because it's £70 a pot. The best and most natural-looking foundations are the ones that gloss over imperfections without stifling the skin beneath.  Not easy. I find that using a light foundation with concealer where necessary is always better than going all-over heavy. Bourjois Radiance Reveal Healthy Mix foundation is really good in this respect (£7.99 from Boots); if you're feeling flush, try Giorgio Armani's sublime Maestro foundation (£38 from House  of Fraser).  All that's left then is to add a pop of healthy colour to cheeks and a couple of layers of mascara. Bobbi Brown's Pot Rouge for Lips & Cheeks is ideal for this, but to be honest you can just dab a bit of your favourite lip colour on the apples of your cheeks. Trust me, you and Rosie will be like two peas in a pod.","Poundland's profits are up, reportedly due to their cheap cosmetics .

The Pop Idol winner has previously spoken about taking anti-baldness medication Propecia as a preventive measure. Now a West End star, Young is sensitive about his thinning locks and an insider on his touring production of Cabaret says he fears that harsh theatre lights highlight his receding hairline. Young has said  of going bald: ‘It’s a horrible thing – it’s emasculating. You just feel you aren’t sexy any more.’ He can take heart from the experience of actor James Nesbitt, who says that his hair transplant in 2010 won him a new legion of male fans. ‘A lot of men have come up to me and said it inspired them,’ says the Cold Feet star. ‘I have no embarrassment about what I did.’ The painstaking process involves extracting hairs from the back of the head and implanting them follicle by follicle into the thinning areas. Sun creams may provide excellent protection against harmful UVB rays but they are less effective against UVA – yet these rays trigger the release of iron and free radicals, which can cause cancer. Now scientists at the University of Bath have created an innovative, light-sensitive ingredient that is activated by UVA and then releases antioxidants to neutralise free radicals. The product also frees molecules known as ‘caged-iron chelators’ to capture excess iron in the skin. The release of iron has been shown to play a key role in skin ageing. It is hoped  the new product may be commercially available within three years. Yonanas! No, it’s not another slang term used by teenagers but the new must-have device among celebrities.

Michelle Garner, 31, was stunned when staff at her local store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts., told her she should feed her six-week-old daughter Lois in the supermarket washroom. The mother-of-two said she was shopping with her baby on Wednesday afternoon when she approached a senior member of staff. Supermarket giant Morrisons has been forced to apologise to Michelle Garner after asking her to breastfeed her baby in their 'grubby' disabled toilets . After asking if there was somewhere she could feed her baby she was advised by the Morrisons worker to use the disabled toilet. But when she reluctantly got there, Michelle found there was not even a toilet seat in the 'grubby and dirty' cubicle and stormed out of the store in tears. Today Michelle said she was left feeling like an outcast following the 'humiliating' incident. She said: 'I was really upset. I felt like an outcast and really embarrassed. 'There wasn’t even a lid on the toilet, it was dirty and very grubby. 'I would have breastfed in the cafe, but the chairs are welded to the tables and there just wasn’t enough room. 'The staff were short with me, and it really made me feel upset. Morrisons have apologised for breastfeeding options not being 'good enough' 'So I went and sat in the car. It really upset me and I felt completely humiliated.' Michelle, who also has a 12-year-old son, said she could not understand why Morrisons could not offer breast feeding facilities while other supermarkets did. Her husband Bryan, 34, added: 'Post-natal depression is one thing I’m very aware of and it’s incidents like this which can trigger bad feelings in mums.' To vent her frustration she took to Facebook and complained about what had happened to her on a local breastfeeding mothers' network page. She received so much support that a group of a dozen mothers visited the store yesterday afternoon to publicly breastfeed their children in protest. One mother Claire Bradford, 37, of Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Notts., who fed her two-and-a-half-year old son Charlie Moore at the store, said: 'It’s disgraceful what has happened to Michelle, and we shouldn’t stand for it. 'They were in the wrong and they need to change their policy.' A Morrisons spokesperson said: 'We’re sorry for what happened yesterday - the options offered to the customer to breastfeed her baby were not good enough. 'We welcome mums and their babies in our store and we know that it’s important to offer every assistance to make them comfortable. 'We will be ensuring that all colleagues at the store understand what support we expect them to offer breastfeeding mums.'","Michelle Garner, 31, visited local store in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Notts.

Two brothers with a rare degenerative disease that causes their urine and bones to turn black have been given hope after their father gave up his job to look for a cure. Daniel and Julien Sireau, aged 10 and 12, have black bone disease – also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU) – which will cause them to develop severe early-onset osteoarthritis unless a cure can be found. The genetic disease causes the bones, cartilage, urine and earwax to turn black. It also results in brittle bones and heart disease. Julien (left) and Daniel (right) Sireau both have a genetic condition called Back Done Disease which causes their bones and urine to turn black. It also causes early-onset osteoarthritis and, possibly, heart disease . Currently there is no treatment for the disease and Daniel and Julien could start to develop symptoms at any age from their mid-teens to their 40s. However, their father, Nick Sireau, 40, has given up his job as CEO of a charity called SolarAid - which aims to offer solar solutions to poverty - to help organise a clinical trial for a drug which he believes will offer a life-saving treatment for his children and all other AKU sufferers. Mr Sireau, from Cambridge, told MailOnline: ‘My hope is that my children never have to feel the pain of the symptoms – that they just won’t have to worry about it.’ Just after Julien was born, Mr Sireau and his wife, Sonya, noticed that his nappies were turning black. They called an emergency doctor who thought the problem was caused by his mother eating red cabbage and then breastfeeding him. However, his parents were not convinced so took him to a GP who sent a range of tests to Great Ormond Street Children’s Hospital. The boys' father, Nick (pictured with Daniel), gave up his job in 2010 to help find a cure for the condition. He believes a treatment has now been identified and is helping to organise a clinical trial . Currently Julien (right) and Daniel (left) are healthy but they will start to develop symptoms in early adulthood unless a treatment is found . When the tests were analysed, they revealed that Julien has Black Bone Disease which is a genetic disorder caused by a recessive gene. Mr Sireau said: ‘It took a lot of time to sink in. Doctors told us there was nothing we could do – that was very disempowering. ‘It took us a while to start realising that we could do something.’ Black Bone Disease causes bone and cartilage to become discoloured. Image shows the elbow joint of an anonymous sufferer . When the couple had their second child, Daniel, they knew there was a 25 per cent chance that he would also have the condition. Mr Sireau explained that after he was born, they kept checking his nappies for fear they too would go black. He said: ‘We were checking Daniel’s nappies again and again. It was so sad when it happened but we try to be positive. ‘We are given a chance to find a cure because the disease doesn’t affect them as children.’ The boys are currently healthy but without treatment will eventually start to develop symptoms such as joint problems and back pain – the early symptoms of osteoarthritis. The osteoarthritis is caused by a toxic acid called homogentisic acid (HGA) attacking their bones and cartilage, turning them black and brittle. In people with Black Bone Disease, the acid accumulates at 2,000 times the normal rate. This also causes discolouration of the ears and black spots in the eyes. There is also a growing link between AKU and heart disease. This is because toxic acid called homogentisic acid HGA causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden, turning them black, brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body. Although this is still believed to be an uncommon symptom of AKU, it is a potentially fatal consequence of the disease. Julien was diagnosed as a baby when his parents noticed his nappies were black - until then they did not realise they carried the gene mutation. There was a 25 per cent chance Daniel would also be affected . AKU can also cause several other symptoms, such as kidney, prostate and bladder stones, black or dark sweat or a blue speckled discolouration of the skin. However, there is hope that all sufferers of Black Bone Disease will soon be able to live a normal life without developing any symptoms. In 2010 Mr Sireau gave up his job to join the AKU Society and help their search for a cure. He believes that a drug called Nitisinone could prevent HGA building up in patients and, therefore, prevent symptoms developing. Mr Sireau (pictured with Julien) believes the drug Nitisinone could prevent acid building up in patients and, therefore, prevent symptoms developing. The drug is already used to treat another rare disease . The drug is already used to treat another rare disease and some Black Bone Disease patients have been able to access it in England. However, it is not currently licenced for use in people with Black Bone Disease meaning they fear it could become unavailable at any time – many patients can also currently not access it at all. Therefore, the AKU Society is organising a clinical trial involving 140 patients from across Europe in the hope of getting the drug licenced. The trial will take four years and will operate out of centres in Liverpool, Paris and Slovakia. Mr Sireau (pictured with Daniel) said: 'Personally, this means hope for my kids and for all of the patients. We hear the most horrible stories of people having to stop work and becoming depressed because of the symptoms. For me, it is important my kids don't suffer this pain' The medical side of the trial, which is expected to start at the end of the year, is being funded by the European Commission but the organisers need to raise $98,000 to pay for patient transport, carers for the more disabled patients and to provide support for patients. To date they have raised just over $40,000 and they only have 14 days left to raise the rest of the money. If the trial is successful, the treatment could be made available on the NHS within the next five years.

Black Bone Disease, also known as Alkaptonuria (AKU), is a rare genetic disease which causes early-onset osteoarthritis. It is causes by the lack of an enzyme called homogentisic dioxygenase which means that patients cannot fully breakdown a toxic acid called homogentisic acid. As a result, the acid builds up in the body at 2,000 times the normal rate. The first symptom is usually black urine. Other symptoms do not usually develop until the patient is in their 20s. At this stage, the patients tend to develop joint problems and back pain which is the start of osteoarthritis. This eventually causes the bones to become brittle and can be very disabling. The condition can also cause the eyeballs, sweat and earwax to turn black. It is thought there is also a link between AKU and potentially fatal heart disease. This is because HGA causes the blood vessels and valves in the heart to harden, turning them black, brittle and less effective at managing the flow of blood around the body. AKU is caused by a genetic mutation - it is a recessive disorder meaning the AKU gene must be carried by both of the patient's parents. If both parents are carriers, there is a 25 per cent chance of their child developing the condition. The condition is thought to occur in about one in every 250,000 to 500,000 people.

Indian police are questioning a school bus cleaner on suspicion of raping a four-year-old after luring her to the back of the vehicle near Mumbai earlier this month. The 26-year-old was arrested at the weekend after the girl told her parents of the incident more than a week after it occurred on September 6, police said. News of the assault comes days after four men were sentenced to death last week over the fatal gang-rape of a student in the capital New Delhi in December, a brutal attack that led to weeks of protests and outrage over the treatment of women and girls in India. Demanding justice: Demonstrators have come out in force since the horrific fatal gang rape in December of a student on a bus. Four men have been sentenced to death, but their punishment has done little to act as a deterrence for the rapist of a four-year-old on a bus near Mumbai . Financial hub Mumbai, long considered safer for women than New Delhi, has also been recently rocked by the gang-rape of a photographer in August while she was out on assignment in the city with a male colleague. According to the police complaint filed by the four-year-old's parents, she and her friend were the first to climb on to the bus after classes in the Thane district neighbouring Mumbai. 'The cleaner called her to the back seat on the pretext of showing her some tricks. He then caught the girl and raped her,' said inspector S.K. Mohite at the local Badlapur police station. The girl screamed and her friend went to help her, but the man threatened to kill them if they reported the matter to the school, the inspector said. 'There was no woman attendant on the bus at that time,' he added. Thane, the Indian district neighbouring Mumbai where the four-year-old girl and her classmate boarded the bus after school . Mohite said the girl has undergone medical examination and doctors confirmed she was sexually assaulted. 'Medical details and investigations into the cleaner's past are being gathered,' he added. The outcry over the Delhi gang-rape led to a tougher law in India against rapists, but cases of sexual violence have continued throughout the country. Five suspects have been arrested over the Mumbai photographer's gang-rape and are expected to be formally charged later this week. On average, a case of rape in India is reported every 21 minutes, but it was only after the horrific fatal gang rape and torture of Jyoti Singh last December received global media attention, that the government has has stepped up its efforts to deal with the crime. The victim, who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus, became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country. After violent protests in several cities the government, initially caught off guard, introduced tougher rape laws in March, and for the first time opened conversation about gender crime in television debates, social media and even Bollywood. Still, sex crimes remain commonplace in India, and social commentators say patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a decade of rapid economic growth. Rights campaigners have staged protest rallies across Pakistan over the rape of a five-year-old girl in the eastern city of Lahore. Police still have no clue who carried out the attack despite detaining several suspects and releasing most of them after questioning. Police say the child was found outside a Lahore hospital on Friday night, a day after she went missing from a poor neighbourhood in the city. 'Her condition is relatively stable but still she is in the intensive care unit,' doctor Farzand Ali, medical superintendent at the Services Hospital, told AFP. Senior police officer Zulfiqar Hameed said investigators have questioned several suspects but had yet to arrest anyone. 'We are investigating and we hope steady progress (is being made) but no one has yet been identified nor anyone formally arrested,"" Hameed told AFP. Doctors earlier said the child was raped several times. Rights campaigners and workers from NGOs on Saturday and Sunday staged protest rallies across Pakistan and demanded the arrest of the culprits. Widespread outrage has dominated social media while private TV channels prominently broadcast reports on the girl and her ordeal. Rape is notoriously difficult to prosecute in Pakistan, where women are often treated as second-class citizens. In neighbouring India, a judge on Friday sentenced to death four men convicted of the fatal gang rape of a student on a New Delhi bus last December, fulfilling the last wish of the 23-year-old victim who died of her injuries.","Police in Mumbai arrested a 26-year-old man on suspicion of raping the girl .

Neil Kinnock’s triumphalist  chant of ‘we’re all right’ at a Labour Party rally left him a laughing stock when he lost the General Election days later. Fast forward 21 years and it seems he hasn’t learnt his lesson. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock's celebrations prompted him to be moved so he could sit with other Cardiff supporters, after his cheers annoyed home fans at Craven Cottage (previous photos) The former Labour leader was spotted at a Premier League football match celebrating wildly when his beloved Cardiff City scored first, 12 minutes into the game. Unfortunately he was seated in the home stands of the rival team Fulham, where his premature boasting was given short shrift. He was promptly escorted from his seat by stewards, along with two of his grandchildren who were with him, and moved to another part of the ground. Lord Kinnock’s exuberance provoked ‘angry responses’ from Fulham fans for ‘spoiling’ their enjoyment of the game, according to an official for the home team. After the match, a Cardiff City supporter wrote on the club’s fan forum: ‘Pleased to see Mr Kinnock sitting two rows in front of me. ‘I am not sure if Neil has as much experience as me of sitting with the home fans but his celebration of our first goal led to him being escorted from the stand.’ Cardiff, who Lord Kinnock has supported since boyhood, won the game 2-1 . Cardiff fans had been allocated seats in the home stands after their official allocation sold out. London resident Lord Kinnock was later spotted going ‘bonkers’ in another part of the Craven Cottage ground when Cardiff scored in injury time, handing them a 2-1 victory. It was newly-promoted Cardiff’s first away win in the top flight since 1962, when Lord Kinnock was a student in Wales. ‘I don’t think I went wild but I did express great joy, standing up, there’s no doubt at all about that.' Lord Kinnock . Yesterday Sarah Brookes, from Fulham FC, said: ‘Mr Kinnock was located in the home stand on Saturday and caused some angry responses when he and his family celebrated the Cardiff City goal. ‘He was relocated in the Putney end – the away stand – where there were a number of spare seats. ‘Mr Kinnock was asked very politely by one of the stewards if he would like to sit with the away fans. We would do that with any fan who celebrates a goal because the home area is for home fans.’ A spokesman for the Labour peer claimed it was just a coincidence that he was moved. But Lord Kinnock later confessed: ‘I didn’t give it a second thought, sitting in the front row by the corner flag and everybody was very pleasant. ‘Then in the 12th minute I did what I’ve done for 65 years of supporting the city and leapt up, and so did the kids.’ Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, he continued: ‘I don’t think I went wild but I did express great joy, standing up, there’s no doubt at all about that. ‘Within a minute or so the Fulham stewards, who were a model of courtesy, said, “Mr Kinnock we think you might be more comfortable in the Cardiff stand”. ‘So I said, “OK, where would that be?” And they pointed to some seats and I said that would be fine. ‘The stewards acted quite quickly and the last thing I wanted to do was cause them any trouble or offend anyone’s sensibilities. I thought I was just in a mixed section.’ Lord Kinnock said he and his family walked the 25 yards into the Cardiff section where they were ‘greeted with some warmth’ and ‘had a much better view of the game’. ‘Everyone was very good natured and good humoured,’ he added.","Lord Kinnock watched Cardiff City play Fulham at Craven Cottage, London .

But then 27-year-old Alex Owumi had just joined the official team of Libyan dictator Colonel Gadaffi. In an incredible turn of events, Owumi found himself caught up in the early days of the country's civil war before managing to flee to Egypt, where he joined up with a local basketball team and went on to lead them to championship glory. Hoop dreams: Journeyman basketball player Alex Owumi in action for the Worcester Wolves after surviving a stint as point guard for Colonel Gadaffi .

The Journeyman point guard started to . realise things were a little odd the moment he got off the plane in Libya to a . rapturous welcome from fans. It got weirder when he arrived at his apartment to see pictures of Gadaffi and his family on the shelves before being told he would be playing for the Libyan leader's team. But things really got crazy when he visited the homes of his teammates - living in some of the city's most impoverished areas - and saw them gathering guns and ammunition, preparing for revolution. Smoke fills the air above the city of Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan civil war . Youngsters show their support for rebel troops on the streets of . Benghazi. As tensions mounted basketball player Alex Owumi took shelter in his flat and survived by eating insects . In an interview with the website Buzzfeed he recalls: 'I was thinking, Man, y’all are not about to beat the army. 'Like, there is no way that is going to happen. And it ended up that they took over the second-biggest city in Libya.' One day, when the driver who normally took him to practice failed to show up, Owumi called his coach who told him to look outside his window. He climbed onto the roof of his apartment building and looked down on a crowd of protesters marching on a line of Libyan soldiers. 'I figured the soldiers were just trying to disperse the protestors,' Owumi told ESPN, 'I went downstairs to get some water, came up the steps and all of a sudden the soldiers were shooting at the crowds. 'I dropped the water, ducked down, and it was like ants scattering. People were dropping everywhere.' He raced back into his apartment to send an email to his family but couldn't get a connection. He tried the phone but that was out of order too. When he went to leave the apartment his neighbours called him back inside. Alex Owumi has told his incredible story in a new book published this week . 'They told me to stay inside, that it wasn't safe,' Owumi said. 'I had one of those big steel doors, so I just slammed it and locked the door.' Owumi was stranded in his apartment without food or water for two weeks. He saw his neighbour being assaulted and raped and feared he'd never get out of the country alive. 'I basically ran out of food, water, . and electricity. After two or three days I was saying to myself, ""OK, . the Libya army is going to shut this sh*t down and these people are . going to clear the streets.

But it wasn't - after surviving on insects and whatever else he could find, one his teammates managed to fixe him a place on a bus leaving to Egypt. The journey was fraught with difficulties, they passed numerous checkpoints manned by menacing-looking soldiers brandishing AK47's. Eventually they reached the town of Salloum on the Egyptian border, where the two teammates were handed a drink and a box of crackers each. They had hoped to make it to Cairo but ended up sleeping on the streets of the border town for several days. Owumi tried to contact the American embassy for help but his calls went unanswered. Without the necessary immagration stamps in his passport he had to bribe a bus driver with $200 American to take him to Cairo. Shortly after arriving and quite out of the blue, Owumi got a call from his coach in Libya who told him the El-Olympi team in Alexandria was looking for a player. Although he was desperate to get home, the offer seemed interesting, he could do with the money and it would only mean staying in Egypt only another two months. El-Olympi went on to win the championship and Owumi was named their most valuable player. He added: 'For some reason, I thought of Egypt as a safe haven. The pictures I have in Egypt are just me being happy. I never would have thought that staying in the Middle East would bring me some happiness, kind of give me some mental rehab, but it did.

Owumi, who now plays in relative sanctuary of England for the Worcester Wolves, has told his incredible story in a new book Qaddafi’s Point Guard, which came out this week. Born in Nigeria, he moved to The UK at age 11 before finally settling in Boston where he dreamed of becoming a professional basketball player. After a successful college career at Alcorn State, he played for teams in France and Macedonia before finally ending up in Libya. Owumi was offered a new contract in Egypt, but he never got on the plane from America to fly back and sign it. Instead he took a year off from the sport, working a $10-an-hour job at a community centre in Atlanta and slowly readjusting of normality. In Atlanta he watched the news reports of Gaddafi's capture . and killing with amazement. Now happily settled in England he is still in touch with some of his old teammates in Libya. He added: 'Because this book isn’t really for me; it’s just for the world to see that there are good people out there. It doesn’t matter what religion, what race, there are good people out there who are doing good.'","Journeyman point guard from Boston was caught up in 2011 revolution .

Trapped in their overturned tank, just metres from the German trenches, Captain Donald Richardson and his crew already faced an impossible situation. But, after three days of attack from their enemies, the brave men in charge of the Mark IV tank were plunged into even greater danger when their British allies started bombarding them as well, to destroy the tank before the Germans could get it. Astonishingly, though, all but one of the soldiers survived the impossible odds, armed with just pistols and a single rifle, managing to escape the death trap to become the First World War's most decorated tank crew. War machine: The crew was stuck inside the early tanks, which helped turn the tide of the First World War by smashing through enemy fortifications (file photo) Impression: This sketch illustrates the overwhelming odds faced by the Fray Bentos crew . The heroes aboard the tank nicknamed Fray Bentos made scattered headlines months after the struggle in July 1917, but their story then languished untold for decades. But it has now been revealed by family historians at findmypast.co.uk, who dredged up records of the heroic struggle. They were able to uncover Captain Donald Richardson, Second Lieutenant George Hill and the rest of their crew had rushed towards the enemy lines when their tank got stuck in a bomb crater and fell on its side. The fall rendered the tank's on-board guns useless, and the injured men were trapped inside while the tank's metal armour endured constant assault from machine guns, sniper rifles, grenades, heavy artillery and even dynamite. High technology: The early tanks, seen here advancing, were powerful but unreliable . In one particularly deadly moment, a German soldier managed to climb on the overturned tank and drop a grenade inside, but a crew member managed to hurl it back out before it exploded. The men survived by sharing their meagre rations and drinking water from the tank's radiator. They were also faced with extremes of temperature ranging from 30 degrees Celsius in the day to below freezing point at night. Decorated: The battle was described in the Nottingham Post in 1918 . After their first night under fire, a flare sent up by British forces showed the men that they were surrounded by German soldiers, eager to take over the stranded tank. Realising they had little chance of survival if they stayed inside, the men managed to make their escape by crawling through the mud one-by-one to make it back to their own lines. A report on the battle from the Nottingham Evening Post in January 1918 said: 'For three days and . nights, Captain Richardson along with another officer and the crew, . continued to hold the enemy at bay. 'They . were heavily sniped, and the Germans actually got on top of the tank, . but could not get inside, nor did the bringing up of a machine gun . subdue the defenders, one of whom was killed and all the rest wounded.' Debra Chatfield, a family historian from findmypast.co.uk said: “At this point in the First World War, tank technology and warfare was incredibly new. 'Captain Richardson and Second Lieutenant Hill led a charge of eight tanks and theirs was the only one that survived attack by German artillery. 'It is astonishing that they managed to survive the initial attack, let alone 72 hours of attacks from German troops, especially when you consider that they only had basic weapons to defend themselves. 'The tank crew became the most decorated of the whole First World War, and it would seem, rightly so. Crippled: The Fray Bentos had been turned on its side, so could not use the tank's on-board weaponry (file photo) Victory: Tanks took pride of place in parades to celebrate the end of the war, including this 1919 procession down Whitehall . 'There’s a story waiting to be told in every family, and old newspapers are a great way of unearthing them.' The Fray Bentos crew was awarded two Military Crosses, two Distinguished Conduct Medals, and four Military Medals – the most awarded to one tank crew during any action of the war. Captain Richardson and Second Lieutenant George Hill were both awarded the Military Cross for their role in leading the defence of the tank and for bringing most of their crew back safely.","The crew of the Fray Bentos were trapped after their tank fell on its side .

With Apple's new handsets going on sale Friday, experts are warning customers against buying fake and knock-off iPhones by highlighting some of the techniques criminals use to dupe them. The Counterfeit Report explains what to look for when buying an Apple product, including the Designed by Apple in California stamp, and how to check the product is an official design using Apple's services and warranty checker. Fake iPhones and chargers have recently been linked with a spate of accidents as well as a death in China, where counterfeit Apple products are rife. Scroll down for video . According to The Counterfeit Report, customers who think they have a fake handset should compare it with a friend's iPhone. The site adds that some fake handsets are sold in authentic iPhone boxes, pictured, so the serial number on the box should be checked on Apple's official support site . In the left-hand image, a fake iPhone is shown pictured left, next to an official device, right. In the right-hand image, the official iPhone, bottom, is much thinner than the fake handset, top, and has a join in the casing . Official handsets will come with a serial number printed on the rear of the device. This serial number can be entered into Apple's Service and Support Checker to confirm a phone's authenticity. An official box is not an indication of an official phone - boxes can be recycled. Check for the Designed by Apple in California stamp. Only buy from official retailers. According to the Counterfeit Report : 'When you buy from a internet site, and not from an authentic Apple dealer, you risk buying a cheap Chinese knockoff. 'If you think you have a fake, just compare it to your friend's iPhone. 'The processor speed, touchscreen and feel should be identical.' The site continues that an authentic-looking iPhone box is 'not an indication of an authentic Apple iPhone 4' and explains some counterfeiters will package fake phones in official packaging to convince buyers of its authenticity. Elsewhere, the site states that each iPhone has a unique serial number. To check whether a serial number has been forged, repeated, or if an old box with an old serial number has been used with the knock-off handset, customers can type the number into Apple's support site. The Service and Support Checker will confirm if a handset is the real-deal or not. A serial number is found on the rear of the phone's box, on an official receipt, or on the rear of the device. Earlier this year, Apple in China posted . instructions on how to tell an official power adapter from a fake one, . after a number of iPhone owners claimed to have been electrocuted by their handsets. The . page showed images of chargers for each Apple device, including the . iPhone 5 and the iPad 2, with the official, relevant safety notices underneath. As well as recycling official packaging, counterfeiters will also recycle official serial numbers.

A coroner's officer has been suspended over claims she accused the parents of children who died in a maternity hospital scandal of a ‘witch-hunt’. Liz Gaskell, 40, is under investigation by police after making the accusation in Facebook messages. The families have spent years trying to discover the truth behind their babies’ deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, where up to 14 are thought to have died needlessly. Liz Gaskell, 40, was handling cases of babies who died at Furness General Hospital on behalf of coroner. She is alleged to have sent them Facebook messages telling them to rethink their 'witch-hunt' They were shocked when Mrs Gaskell, who has handled their cases on behalf of the coroner, sent them messages warning against continuing their campaign. One, sent earlier this week, tells them to ‘be careful’ what they tell the Press and urges them rethink their ‘witch-hunt’. It also appears to defend a staff member who is currently under investigation at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital. The incident calls into question Mrs Gaskell’s impartiality. Last night, a source close to the case said: ‘She’s been friendly towards the families throughout all the proceedings. They thought she was trying to help them, but now they’re not so sure.’ Mrs Gaskell is employed by Cumbria Police and works for the Barrow Coroner Ian Smith. She is believed to have helped organise the inquests of babies Joshua Titcombe, Elleanor  Bennett, Alex Davey-Brady and Chester Hendrickson, as well  as Chester’s mother Nittaya, 35, who all died at the hospital. Her  comments came after the Trust’s head of legal services, Ranu Rowan, was suspended over allegations she tried to block Alex’s inquest. The families have spent years campaigning to find out how their children died at this hospital in Cumbria . It emerged last week that Mrs Rowan wrote an email in 2009 suggesting the coroner might be ‘nudged’ away from holding the hearing. The revelation provoked an outcry from the families, whom Mrs Gaskell then contacted on Facebook, writing: ‘You guys know how much I care about you and all that you have been through BUT I promise you that Ranu Rowan hasn’t and wouldn’t do anything to cover up or influence a coroner’s inquiry. ‘A crusade for truth and change is turning into a witch-hunt. Please be careful how much you share with the Press … once it’s out there it can’t be undone. I fully support appropriate actions but what’s happening now is awful and wrong.’ Mrs Gaskell has acted as a coroner’s officer for eight years. Yesterday, she said it ‘wouldn’t be appropriate to comment, but I am extremely distressed’. Cumbria Police said she was under investigation for making the ‘inappropriate’ remarks. The Trust, which in 2011 had  the highest baby mortality rate in England, will be the subject of an  official inquiry later this year and  up to 30 families are understood to  be taking legal action. A criminal investigation is still being held  into the death in 2008 of Joshua Titcombe, who had an infection that could easily have been treated with antibiotics. Earlier this year, the Care Quality Commission was accused of a cover-up after emerged that an internal report about the Trust may have been suppressed.","Liz Gaskell employed by Cumbria Police and was handling cases for coroner .

"By . Catherine Ostler . PUBLISHED: . 18:50 EST, 4 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:54 EST, 4 October 2013 . A fashionable young woman in socks, platform sandals and a mini-skirt tosses a waterfall of straight dark hair over her shoulder and eyes up an £850 golden handbag in the shape of an apple, sitting alone in a perspex cabinet. Nearby, a middle-aged woman with a bored, silent husband, stares at a £2,000 Celine handbag, intermittently snapping pictures of the object of her desire on her iPhone. The distinctive strains of Mandarin chatter fill the air as an immaculate woman clad all in black wafts past in a cloud of scent, trying to convince a young couple of the merits of the latest designer perfume. Bling rush: Hordes of Chinese shoppers are to flock to the West End's designer stores during a national holiday . Meanwhile, a man hands over his credit card to a female shop assistant, who clutches it carefully between both hands as if holding a gift, lowers her head reverentially and makes an elaborate show of averting her eyes out of respect. His parcel neatly beribboned in a yellow carrier bag, he leaves the shop and follows the droves of customers heading into a nearby shop, enticed by large Chinese language signs proclaiming 75 per cent off sales. It could be an ordinary day on any luxury shopping street in Shanghai — but this is the heart of London’s West End. And the Chinese signs, Mandarin-speaking shop assistants and extra deliveries of sought-after designer goods — in especially small sizes — are all part of making the high-spending visitors who have travelled here this week from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou feel at home. Wave upon wave of Chinese visitors, in small groups and coach parties, alone and in pairs, pack the pavements and malls. They are surprisingly young and rich. And they are here to splash their cash. The reason for this sudden influx is that it’s Golden Week in China, a week-long holiday that kicked off with National Day on October 1 — the day the People’s Republic was founded in 1949. Browsing: The reason for this sudden influx is that it¿s Golden Week in China, a week-long holiday that kicked off with National Day on October 1 ¿ the day the People¿s Republic was founded in 1949 . It’s the time when the country’s wealthiest and most adventurous hop on long-haul flights and come to London. Top of their shopping lists are luxury goods — the handbags, shoes, watches and expensive knick-knacks which, because of stringent Chinese taxes, are about 30 per cent more expensive back home. No wonder British retailers leap with excitement. Quite simply, the Chinese spend unbelievable amounts of money; an average of £8,000 each on shopping alone, according to one recent survey. It is not just the clientele of London’s busiest shopping streets which is transformed during Golden Week — the staff in luxury stores are supplemented by droves of Chinese speakers, signs directing shoppers around the store are in Mandarin, and even the customs when it comes to paying for goods are different. With so much money up for grabs, competition between stores is fierce. Popular: Selfridges won an early battle for the Chinese; their livery is yellow, the imperial colour of China. According to them, their image is ¿young and dynamic¿, like their Chinese visitors . Selfridges won an early battle for the Chinese; their livery is yellow, the imperial colour of China. According to them, their image is ‘young and dynamic’, like their Chinese visitors. As if on cue, hordes of waif-like Chinese girls with long, impossibly shiny dark hair and tiny mini-skirts charge through Selfridges’ rotating doors and head straight for the Prada handbags. One girl snaps up a £1,500 black tote — then decides she really needs it in grey, too. It’s not hard to see why shops bend over backwards to keep their high-spending Chinese customers happy. In addition to accepting China’s most popular credit card, CUP (Credit Union Pay), the store has 40 Mandarin interpreters on call this week. And it’s not just Selfridges; Harrods has over 100 interpreters, who helped each Chinese customer spend an average of £3,500 per visit last year. Prepared: Harrods has 100 interpreters on hand to help Chinese shoppers . Even non-Mandarin speaking assistants are taught how to tend to the high-rolling Chinese customers — including holding credit cards with two hands, according to Chinese etiquette. Chinese men, apparently, will buy many watches from the most evocative brands such as Rolex and Omega, but they want information; as they do about wine in France. They might be incredibly rich, but unlike the Middle Easterns who block up Knightsbridge with their clamped Ferraris during the ‘Ramadan Rush’, the Chinese are quiet, discreet and polite. They often take their booty back on the Tube, and yes, they’ll offer up their seat to a more deserving traveller. They often stay in unflashy hotels you’ve never heard of (those willing to provide a Chinese breakfast, often consisting of congee, a watery rice porridge and deep-fried dough) while spending thousands of pounds on clothes, bags and jewellery. Indeed, to the Chinese one thing is sacrosanct — the designer label. These goods are badges of arrival and belonging. Life of luxury? Although Chinese shoppers spend big on labels, they don't necessarily stay in London's poshest hotels . Numbers of Chinese visitors have been steadily growing over the past few years; 20 years ago there were hardly any, a legacy of Chairman Mao’s belief that travel for pleasure was anti-socialist. Now they are making up for lost time. Three years ago, just over 100,000 Chinese came to Britain; last year, 150,000 came. Given that only three per cent of the one billion population have left mainland China so far, and that their wealth is increasing, numbers can only explode further. Most come here seeking out the obvious brands: Louis Vuitton, Prada, Gucci, and the ‘heritage’ brands, which means anything with a quotable history, like Burberry, Mulberry or Westwood. Chen Lei, 26, who works for an oil company, and her boyfriend Gu Xiaoyin, also 26 and working in finance, travelled here from Beijing. 'We love being in London, and everything about Britain.' Chen Lei, 26 . Dressed in jeans and trainers they look about 19, and you wouldn’t guess they were about to splash out on designer clobber, although on closer inspection she already has a £900 Louis Vuitton bag. ‘We love being in London, and everything about Britain,’ Lei enthuses. Although she says she is on the hunt for her favourite brands, Mulberry and Burberry, she’s also fond of TopShop. Eva Tu, 31, from Beijing, says she has only bought one pink Prada handbag so far — ‘not the newest model,’ she says in disappointment, though her friend has ‘bought the whole of Burberry’. The more fashion savvy girls are keen on modern designers like Stella McCartney and Christopher Kane — in the tiniest sizes. Big business: As well as designer brands, Chinese shoppers also love high street brands such as Topshop . And they have no problems fitting into the slimmest-cut dresses — our sizes 6, 8 and 10 equate to their small, medium and large, meaning a British size 12 would be extra large. During Golden Week, the visitors come with huge shopping lists for friends and family (as well as their own wish lists), because Chinese culture is a gift culture. Almost every occasion necessitates a gift, and the compliment must always be repaid. So exacting are their requirements that I met one couple whose shopping list was a computerised spreadsheet, covering colleagues, friends and relations. It looked long enough to take all week. So strong is the tide of shoppers that as of this Golden Week, they even have their own glossy magazine; an edition of Conde Nast Traveller launched for the Chinese in London. Editor Melinda Stevens has a clear idea of her audience: ‘They are extremely focused; and come with huge lists for labels like Chanel and Burberry. Everybody wants them, of course, as they spend phenomenal amounts of money.’ Spend, spend, spend: Chinese shoppers with Selfridges bags on London's Oxford Street . Once they have snapped up the best London labels, the most determined shoppers fly up to Edinburgh to sample the cashmere and tartan for which Scotland is known. In Westfield shopping centre, West London, there is a standard look among the young Chinese women. Poker-straight, long hair with a side parting, painted nails in bright colours, jeans, a Louis Vuitton bag in the company’s brown ‘LV’ monogram print — and an iPhone glued to their hand. In The Village, the luxury section of the centre, assistants admit that they deliberately shift stock around to attract Chinese eyes — and who can blame them? Gucci has rolled out precious skin handbags — crocodile and python are favourites — beloved of the Chinese. Tateossian, the jewellery and cufflink brand, have made a dragon necklace and cufflinks. Montblanc even have a ‘Genghis Khan Limited Edition Writing Instrument.’ They all tell the same story; a growing market of high-spending under 35s in search of big names. As they are newly-affluent, they will also travel out of town to secure a bargain; hence the popularity of Bicester Village, the discount retail park in Oxfordshire where the Chinese arrive in coachloads. For the young Chinese, this is a bigger draw than the Royal Family. When David Cameron asked the Chinese Ambassador how to get more visitors here, he was told to build more Bicesters. It’s not all smiles, though. Back at Selfridges a couple called the Shens are in search of something to eat. They leave the shop anxiously in search of a Chinese restaurant. Burberry and Mulberry handbags are one thing — the heritage of British food, apparently, quite another.","Chinese shoppers are in the UK during the Golden Week national holiday .

Tesco has been found selling pork chops labelled as British that are actually likely to have come from Holland. The discovery represents a major embarrassment for the supermarket as it comes after claims that the sourcing of meat had been cleaned up following the horsemeat scandal. Earlier this year, Tesco and others were found to have sold beef burgers that actually contained high levels of cheap horse meat from eastern Europe. Genetic tests: Examination of Tesco pork chops labelled as British show they came from Holland (file picture) At the time, the company promised a major overhaul of its supply system with a shift to support British farmers and carry out stringent checks on the origin of its meat. However, tests carried out on one pack of fresh pork chops carrying the Red Tractor logo, which is designed to identify British food, showed it was imported, most likely from Holland. The discovery was made by a BBC investigation for the Farming Today and You & Yours programmes, where a researcher bought packs of chops from a Tesco in Salford. The samples were sent to laboratories in Germany as part of a joint exercise with the British Pig Executive (BPEX), which promotes UK pork farming. These tests, known as Stable Isotope Ratio Analysis, are able to identify the country of origin of meat based on its composition. The results suggested there was less than a 1per cent chance that the two pork chops actually came from Britain. Apology: Tesco said they were extremely disappointed to discover a pork loin product bought by a researcher probably came from a Dutch farm, rather than a British farm as labelled (file picture) Tesco, Britain’s largest supermarket, said: ‘We are extremely disappointed to discover a pork loin product probably came from a Dutch farm, not a British farm. ‘When we specify that we want British pork, we expect to be supplied with British pork. We have spoken with our supplier to make clear that this mistake is unacceptable.’ The supplier, Cranswick Country Foods, said it had reviewed its systems and had told its customers they can be confident its products are correctly labelled. It said the meat involved came from another supplier, FA Gill Ltd, a family-owned meat company in Wolverhampton. However, the firm denied responsibility, saying it does not deal with Dutch meat. ‘We correctly label the products we sell to our customers and we have the documentation to prove this,’ it said. The BPEX director, Mick Sloyan, described the false label as an isolated case. ‘Human error can occur. This is not going to happen on a regular basis,’ he said. ‘I think we have shown that this technology works and it provides an extra level of reassurance for consumers in the traceability systems that we adopt.’","The product with a Red Tractor symbol on it was bought by a researcher .

Thanks to China's infamous one-child policy, official figures show that by 2020, the country will have more than 24 million men unable to find a wife. And it isn't just Chinese men who are having trouble finding a partner. Census figures show that one in five women between 25 and 29 are unmarried - a phenomenon that Chinese commentators have dubbed 'sheng nu' or 'leftover' women. According to experts, the problem is caused by the Chinese preference for men to marry down - both in age and status. Gargantuan: Jiayuan.com has a staggering 100 million users and is the biggest dating site in China . Marriage: Gong set the site up at the age of 27 and met her scientist husband via his Jiayuan profile . As a result, Huang Yuanyuan, a 29-year-old Chinese journalist and researcher, told the BBC, there is a pool of 'A-quality' women with high intelligence and social value for whom getting married just isn't happening. This is where Jiayuan.com steps in. Gong, who met her own husband, a scientist studying fruit flies, on the site, says most of their users are looking for lifetime partners. 'Our users are looking for life partners, not a bit of fun,' she revealed, adding that the site steps into the gap left by traditional village matchmakers or 'Red Mothers'. 'For migrants from the countryside like me, it is next to impossible to rely on the old social networks to find a husband,' she explains. 'When I got to Shanghai I had no friends or family there.' And finding the right person alone, she adds, isn't easy. 'There is an information asymmetry - the person you are looking for does exist but you don't know where to find them. 'On the other hand, because you are aiming for such an ideal partner, the person who does have the qualities you are looking for might not love you back in reality.' So what advice does she give lonely hearts? In an earlier interview with CNN Travel, Gong had this tip for women: 'Don't passively wait to be contacted. Taking the initiative by sending potential mates messages shows you are serious about finding love. In a country like China with typically shy women, you will immediately stand out.' Booming: Gong's successful site signs up new users every second and has been floated on the stock market . While, for men, China's number one matchmaker recommended the following: 'In your initial message, make a specific reference to what you find attractive or interesting about the woman you are contacting. 'When she is browsing messages, yours will immediately stick out, and compliments make a great conversation starter.' And with 4.5 million marriages already under her belt and new users signing up to her website every second of every day, Gong Haiyan is one romantic mentor worth paying attention to. According to the most recent census figures, one in five Chinese women between 25 and 29 are unmarried. Dubbed 'sheng nu' or 'leftover women' in the Chinese media, is currently causing a real headache for the government because most are what journalist Huang Yuanyuan describes as 'A-quality' women. 'There is an opinion that A-quality guys will find B-quality women, B-quality guys will find C-quality women, and C-quality men will find D-quality women,' she told the BBC. 'The people left are A-quality women and D-quality men. So if you are a leftover woman, you are A-quality.' Nevertheless, according to the National Marriage Survey undertaken by the Chinese government in 2010, just one per cent of men thought it was acceptable for women to marry between the ages of 31 and 35, with the overwhelming majority - 60 per cent - saying a woman should marry before the age of 27.","Gong Haiyan, 37, is the Shanghai entrepreneur behind Jiayuan.com .

Enda Kenny, Ireland's Prime Minister, lead the campaign to abolish the upper house of Parliament and defeat in the referendum today will be seen as a personal embarrassment . Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny has admitted he is personally disappointed after his Government suffered 'a wallop' in a referendum to abolish the country's upper house of parliament. Almost 52% of the public voted to keep the Seanad, in what was an embarrassing and damaging blow to Mr Kenny, who spearheaded a campaign to scrap it. The No side emerged victorious with a margin of just 42,500 votes. Mr Kenny said: 'Sometimes in politics you get a wallop in the electoral process. I accept the verdict of the people.' The Taoiseach added that he welcomed the clarity of the public in what was the ultimate exercise of democracy. 'Naturally I am personally disappointed but I fully accept and respect the outcome,' said Mr Kenny. The Taoiseach said the Government would now reflect on how to reform the upper house to make sure it can contribute to Irish politics in 'a meaningful way'. He insisted he had stuck with a promise he made four years ago to put the question of abolishing the Seanad to the people. 'The Seanad question was one element of a process of change and reform to politics that Government has been pursuing,' Mr Kenny added. 'Now that the people have made their decision and that they have decided and confirmed that the Seanad is retained as part of our constitution intuitions, I must now reflect upon what the best way that that can be made an effective contributor to the change in politics which I intend to continue within the Dail and in the wider sphere.' Elsewhere, Mr Kenny welcomed the outcome of a second referendum, in which 65.29% of the Irish public voted to create a Court of Appeal. Kenny first announced his intention to scrap the second chamber in 2009 when he was the leader of the opposition. During his campaign, he insisted the public is faced with only two choices - abolishing the Seanad, or retaining it. The Irish Parliament is currently made up of the upper Seanad and the Dail (pictured). The referendum would have abolished the upper house and handed all power to the lower . He argued that abolition would create a leaner, more effective and more accountable political system. He called the 75-year-old institution elitist, undemocractic and promised its abolition would save money. Advocates for the senate, including the main opposition party Fianna Fail, accused the government of a power grab. Kenny's party, Fine Gael, and junior coalition partner Labour were supported by opposition party Sinn Fein in their campaign. Opponents, led by the largest opposition party, Fianna Fail, successfully argued that  the Seanad is necessary to serve as a watchdog and to hold the ruling Cabinet ministers to account. The Irish parliament, the Oireachtas, is currently made up of the lower house, the Dail, from which Government operates, and the upper house, the Seanad - where poet William Butler Yeats once sat. The 60 members of the Senate, many of whom have jobs outside of politics, have only limited powers such as the ability to temporarily delay legislation, much like England's House of Lords. The country's last referendum on children's rights, held in late 2012, saw a turnout of just 33%.","Enda Kenny accused upper house of being elitist and undemocratic .

A woman who tracked down her beloved choir teacher 35 years after leaving her class has taken her in after discovering she had dementia. The extraordinary show of kindness came after Carolyn Denson James, 62, sought out Marty Hayes so she could thank her for her lessons - and for inspiring James into also becoming a teacher. Hayes had served as the choir director at Kimball High School in Dallas, Texas when James attended the school, and she said the teacher's support had boosted her confidence during her teen years. 'She meant the world to me,' James . told TODAY.com. 'She made everyone feel special, that they brought . something to the table.' Reunited: Carolyn James (standing) and her husband Daryl (left) have been looking after her former choir teacher Marty Hayes (seated right) after tracking her down and learning she had dementia . James moved back to the area from Scottsdale, Arizona in 2004 and tracked down Hayes - but quickly noticed that there was something wrong with her former teacher. She said that Hayes, now 74, would often call her or her husband when she became disorientated or lost, or would drive her car off the road. The couple began visiting Hayes more regularly to help her with paperwork and paying bills, and they eventually decided to take her to the doctors. Old days: Carolyn James is pictured in high school, where Hayes inspired her to want to teach . She was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, the second most common dementia after Alzheimer's. It causes cognitive abilities to fail and can cause stiff muscles, slowed movement and tremors.

'She . was someone who was always in charge, the one to look to for all the . ideas, and all of a sudden the table turns,' James said. Hayes had joined the school in 1966 and left the school just three years later to become the Dallas Independent School District’s fine arts coordinator - but in that short time, she left her mark. 'My . message to them was always that they were given a very special . potential and they should keep learning and laughing with each other and . enjoying it.' she said. In . the school yearbook in 1969, the students dedicated a page to Hayes, . writing: 'Not all teachers care about their students as much as you do' and 'Some people are made for happiness; you are one of them.' Speaking . to the Dallas Morning News, James added: 'I can never thank her enough . for what she did to give me confidence and let me know that education . was what I wanted to do. Inspirational: A yearbook spread from Kimball High School in 1969, featuring Hayes when she was the choir teacher. She has no husband or children and said James is 'truly a gift from God' 'She mentored me in the early years. Now I'm helping her in time.' James is now a counselor after 30 years of teaching. Hayes, who has started using a wheelchair, now lives at the home with James, her husband - himself a former choir master - and her father. The family started a 'We Are Her Kids' fund to raise money for Hayes' care. 'They are truly a gift from God,' Hayes said about the couple.

Two decades later, never-before-seen footage has been released of the operation that was depicted in the 2001 film Black Hawk Down. The footage was obtained by CBS' 60 Minutes and will air this Sunday as part of a special segment on the mission that went awry in the capital of Somalia. From 1993 to 1995, the United Nations had an operation in Somalia to create enough peace to continue humanitarian operations for civilians. Scroll down for video . Declassified: CBS' 60 Minutes will air never-before-seen footage from the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu this Sunday. The video shows the moment a black hawk helicopter is shot down in enemy territory, stranding U.S. soldiers for hours . Witness: Norm Hooten, above, was a Special Operations team leader during the mission on October 3, 1993, and called the helicopter crash 'catastrophic' It was a part of this operation that on October 3, 1993, that 160 soldiers, consisting mostly of U.S. army rangers, conducted a raid in Mogadishu to capture two high-level lieutenants working for the warlord and president-to-be Mohamed Farrah Aidid. Norm Hooten, who was a Special Operations team leader on the mission, told 60 Minutes that the mission was 'flawless' until the moment they were ready to be airlifted out of the city. The video shows a black hawk helicopter 'Super 61' pass across the screen to land in the street when it's hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Special operation: Soldiers were flown into the city for a mission to kidnap two high-level Somali lieutenants. Above, helicopters land in Mogadishu to drop off the soldiers as the raid starts . Taking a turn: Mr Hooten said the mission was 'flawless' until the black hawks returned to the city to transport the soldiers back to base. Above, enemy combatants stationed on a rooftop . Strike: The Somali militia aimed well and were able to shoot down two black hawk helicopters, stranding soldiers in the city overnight. Above, the helicopter called Super 61 moments before it crashes . Black hawk down: A cloud of dust shows the site where Super 61 crashes after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade and spiraling out of control . 'It took a direct hit to the tail boom and started a slow rotation,' Hooten said. 'It was a catastrophic impact. That's the only way I can describe it.' The video continues to follow Super 61 as it slowly rotates to the ground and crashes right in the heart of enemy territory. What was meant to be an hour-long raid turned into an over-night fight with combatants of the Somali National Alliance that eventually ended with the deaths of 19 U.S. soldiers. On screen: A movie was made about the mission in 2001, based on the book by journalist Mark Bowden . In 1999, journalist Mark Bowden published a book about the mission based on a series of articles he wrote for the Philadelphia Inquirer, which was in turn adapted into a film in 2001 starring Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana and Ewan McGregor. Many have considered the fight to be the first battle between the United States and al Qaeda. The United Nations operation in Somalia did not bring lasting peace to the area. Today, the country is as dangerous as ever - now being run mostly by Islamic militant group al Shabab. 60 Minutes will also show one former Army intelligence officer's efforts to recover the  wreckage of Super 61 and transport them back the the U.S. David Snelson and his wife Alisha Ryu have been living in Mogadishu for the past three years and decided to save the wrecked helicopter when they heard that new construction was planned for the crash site. 'Above anything else, you think about the men...what they went through,' Mr Snelson said. 'We didn't do this for anybody else but them.' In the end, Mr Snelson and his wife were able to save some the wreckage and now Super 61's rotor blade and foot pedals are in the Airborne and Special Operations Museum in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Army Rangers: Many of the men involved in the mission were from Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment - pictured above .

Archaeologists have discovered a leopard trap used by hunters 5,000-years-ago in Israel. Israeli researchers originally thought the trap, which was found in the Negev Desert, was just a few hundred years old, as almost identical devices were used by Bedouins living in the region in the last century. Scientists believe the type of trap, which to non-experts might look like a pile of stones, was used to catch carnivores, possibly by people living in the area who first kept herds of goats and sheep. Israeli researchers originally thought the trap (pictured), which was found in the Negev Desert, was just a few hundred years old. Archaeologists believe it could have been used to catch carnivores since people living in the area first kept herds of goats and sheep . Naomi Porat, a geochronologist with the Geological Survey of Israel, said: 'The most exciting thing is the antiquity of these carnivore traps, which is totally unexpected.' The trap was found alongside a younger, 1,600-year-old construction and the findings published in the journal Antiquity. There are thought to be at least 50 similar traps in the Negev Desert, which merge into the rocky landscape, Live Science reported. Dr Porat said: 'They look like a pile of stones, like a cairn, and you need a good eye and also some digging around to realise what it is.' The trap from the 'closed side' in the desert. It works by a person attaching a piece of meat to the end of a rope to entice a leopard into the stoney box, tripping the heavy door shut and trapping the animal inside . The basic trap works by a person attaching a piece of meat to the end of a rope to entice a leopard into the stoney box, tripping the heavy door shut and trapping the fierce animal inside. There is a deliberate opening on one side of the trap and large slabs of stone form the roof of the chamber, which is around 60 centimetres high. The archaeologists optically dated the most recently discovered traps and compared the amount of radiation absorbed over the millennia to determine their ages. The age range of the traps, that were 5,000 and 1,600 year's old, suggests that the method of trapping the animal has been used for thousands of years and must be fairly effective. Scientists believe no leopards live in the Negev Desert now as habitat loss decimated their populations. The last one was spotted around a decade ago . Both were found near sites of ancient enclosures use by early goat and sheep herders living 6,000-years-ago who were presumably concerned with protecting their flocks. The site is close to the Uvda Valley, where numerous Chalcolithic and Early Bronze sites were found. It is thought the traps also managed to entice other predators living in the Middle East, including wolves, hyenas and long-eared cats.

The ultimate luxury British car firm is planning to break with more than a century of tradition by allowing the legendary Spirit of Ecstasy 'Flying Lady' mascot to adorn a ‘Chelsea tractor’. The biggest hint yet that the firm renowned for the ‘waftability’ and engineering excellence of its limousines is to press ahead with a  sports utility vehicle (SUV) was dropped by Rolls-Royce chief executive chief executive officer Torsten Mueller-Oetvoes in an interview with leading motoring magazine Auto Express. Glimpse to the future: This is how a planned 4X4 vehicle by Rolls Royce, the car company's first, could look . When asked directly if a Rolls-Royce 4X4 was to go ahead, he replied: ’I have not ruled it out.’ And teasingly, when asked if a gambler might bet on the project getting the green light, he replied: ’Make that bet. Do it.’ It is understood detailed design plans have been drawn up and are being studied by top executives in Britain and at the Munich headquarters of the firm’s German parent company BMW . They accept the controversial idea may divide opinion but are aware that luxury rivals such as Bentley and others including Aston Martin, Lamborghini and Maserati are preparing their own 4X4s which are expected to be a huge hit in lucrative markets such as China and the Middle East. Rolls-Royce said has previously described talk of a 4X4 as 'speculation' but has not denied reports that detailed plans have been drawn up. Auto Express has created its own exclusive images showing how such a vehicle could look based on the ‘design language’ of existing models such as the Phanton, Ghost and Wraith. Still stylish: Bosses say the new off-roader would retain all the features of a classic Rolls Royce, as this picture shows. The new model could be on the road by 2017 . Mr Mueller-Oetvoes told Auto Express: ‘There’s growth in the SUV sector and such a vehicle is thinkable. I’m open to that. Our design director Giles Taylor is already doing the first sketches. ‘But I can tell you that it will not look like a Hummer’, he said referring to the massive gas-guzzling military-derived American off-roader. Separately, bosses insist privately that the main challenge is to produce a car which rides and handles like a Rolls-Royce and does not sacrifice quality. Rolls-Royce, whose boutique factory is based at Goodwood in Sussex in the grounds of the Earl of March's estate, has most recently launched a new  sporty £235,0000 two-door ‘sportback’ coupe called the Wraith powered by a 6.7 litre engine. A cabriolet version is set to follow. It already builds four versions of its range-topping Phantom and two versions of its smaller 'baby' Ghost. But now executives are planning the next chapter of the range from 2017 and beyond with an SUV on the drawing board. Auto Express said Rolls-Royce design chief  Mr Taylor has been shuttling frequently between the firm’s Goodwood home  and BMW headquarters in Munich: ’It is understood the main purpose  of Taylor’s frequent visits is to present a variety of SUV designs to BMW’s top brass.’ It noted: ’It’s a project that’s been rumoured for years and denied several times. But the top man at Rolls-Royce has given the clearest indication yet that we will see an SUV from the brand. And our amazing images show how this amazing model could look.’ It notes: ‘They show how Rolls’ latest design language - as seen in the Ghost and the Wraith - could translate into a higher-riding SUV. Sleek: Rolls Royce recently unveiled its latest model, the Wraith, which is worth more than £200,000 . ‘The traditional chrome grille sits proud at the front, topped off by the signature Spirit of Ecstacy. Meanwhile the graceful lines and rear-hinged doors both provide plenty of  Rolls-Royce class.’ With a price of around £250,000, it says power will most likely be provided by the Wraith’s 6.7 twin turbo V12 which give acceleration from rest to 62mph in around 4.5 seconds. Top speed is likely to be electronically limited to 155mph. Auto Express said Rolls-Royce was keen to target ‘an increasingly important fresher, younger breed of super-rich buyers from high-profile sports, music and film stars to dot com millionaires.’ It said: ’Despite their wealth, many are in their thirties or even twenties, could well be Chinese and have a desire to own a Rolls – but not necessarily a ‘traditional’ limousine.’ In February BMW board member and Rolls-Royce chairman Harald Krüger was asked by CAR magazine about the prospect of a 4X$ and replied:‘We’re monitoring the competition’s activities, and we’re regularly debating whether to take action. This applies to all brand-relevant segments and technologies.’ He added:'The BMW Group is confidently investing into the long-term future of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars.’ Porsche broke the 4X4 mould when it launched its Cayenne sports utility vehicle. And Bentley – owned by Germany’s giant Volkswagen Group - is currently giving a facelift to a prototype super-luxury Bentley off-roader which it announced recently will be built in Britain at its factory in Crewe. Rolls-Royce was founded after sales and marketing genius the Honourable Charles Stewart Rolls met legendary engineer Henry Royce at the Midland Hotel in Manchester on May 4, 1904 with the aim of creating the world's finest motor car. German car giant BMW bought Rolls-Royce Motor Cars from Vickers PLC in 1998 following a bidding war with rivals Volkswagen which secured Bentley - with the first BMW-produced Rolls-Royce Phantom launched in 2003. Rolls-Royce says the new Wraith ‘sportback’, reviving an ethereal spirit name first used in 1938, is 'the most dynamic and powerful Rolls-Royce in history.'","Detailed plans have been drawn up based on existing RR models .

A probation officer could be in trouble with bosses after he failed to get permission to appear on a TV show - where he has sex in a box. Des Lashimba, a probation officer based at Manchester Magistrates’ Court, took part in the Channel 4 show Sex Box with partner Lynette Ellis. He could now face disciplinary action as he did not ask bosses’ permission to take part - and promotional material made it clear he worked as a probation officer.

Sex Box presenter Mariella Frostrup, front, with panellists Phillip Hodson, Tracey Cox and Dan Savage . Bosses at Greater Manchester Probation Trust will watch the show, being broadcast on Monday night, to see if it has an impact on the reputation of the probation service. In the show couples have 35 minutes to have sex in a large box on stage. They then discuss the act afterwards with presenter Mariella Frostrup and a panel of experts in front of a studio audience. The audience do not see the couples having sex in the box. Channel 4 has billed the show as ‘a sex talk show with a difference’. Channel 4 has defended the controversial new show, which airs on Monday and will feature three couples having sex in an opaque box before discussing the act with a studio panel. It forms part of the channel's Real Sex season. Channel 4's head of factual programming Ralph Lee told MailOnline: 'The idea of the box is that it will facilitate a conversation that's more immediate, more honest and more truthful than if we didn't have it. 'It's not about the technicalities of sex but more about discussing what it means to them as a couple. 'There has been a massive explosion of pornography but what there hasn't been is a conversation about real sex in people's lives today. 'This will add context to pornography.' Colleagues at the Probation Trust are also understood to feel the show is an embarrassment - as Mr Lashimba is seen as ‘the face’ of the probation service at Manchester Magistrates Court. When approached Mr Lashimba, 41, who lives in Manchester, declined to comment. But in promotional material his partner Ms Ellis, 39, insisted they are not exhibitionists, adding: 'Des was terrified he wouldn’t be able to do what was needed. But I wore some sexy underwear and that seemed to do the trick. 'We have sex as part of a normal, healthy and loving relationship. I hope people will look at the programme in a positive light.' Part of Channel 4’s Campaign for Real Sex season, Sex Box is described by the channel as ‘a panel discussion about the real sex lives of people’. Bosses at Greater Manchester Probation Trust say they have yet to see the programme and will review whether Mr Lashimba has breached employee guidelines after it is shown. A spokesman said: 'We did not know a GMPT employee was going to be appearing in the programme. As we have not seen the programme, we don’t yet know if it will have a reputational impact on either the Trust or on the employee, and we will review the situation after it has been televised. 'In the meantime, no disciplinary action has been taken against the employee.'","Manchester Magistrates' Court employee Des Lashimba, 41, in trouble .

Novelist Joanna Trollope said children should return to reading classics such as Austen and the Bronte sisters . Joanna Trollope says children should be taught literary classics in school because they spend too much time reading fantasy books, such as The Twilight Saga. The novelist said fantasy teen fiction, such as the hugely popular Hunger Games series, fails to give children an insight into reality or guidance in moral dilemmas. The Rector's Wife author said youngsters should be encouraged to read the likes of Jane Austen, George Eliot and the Bronte sisters. However, she admitted her 12-year-old grandson loves The Hunger Games, about a post-apocalyptic nation in which two children are selected to compete to the death in an annual televised battle. Trollope told The Sunday Times: 'I feel children are missing out on an enormous amount. 'The consolation to be found in the classics is absolutely infinite and greater than fantasy novels. Fantasy doesn't relate to the real world.' The author, who used to be a teacher, said using popular culture can be a useful tool to lead children towards the classics. She said she gave her class The Beatles lyrics to study in one English poetry class before giving them Robert Frost to read. Last year, the three Hunger Games books were in the top 10 bestsellers list with more than 2.1million sold. Trollope said classic British novels can provide guidance to children and help them with decisions. Trollope is one of six authors invited by the Austen Project to rewrite her works for a modern audience. Trollope said books like The Hunger Games (Jennifer Lawrence, pictured left, as Katniss Everdeen) and The Twilight Saga (Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson in the film version, right) do not 'relate to the real world' Trollope has rewritten Sense and Sensibility (pictured Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet in the 1995 film) for a modern audience. She said the book's themes are still relevant today . She is working on Sense and Sensibility and said issues the book tackles, such as class and money, are still important today. In her updated version, Elinor Dashwood is an architecture student while her creative sister Marianne goes to art school. It includes social media, iPods and fast cars. Other contemporary writers involved in the project are Alexander McCall Smith (Emma), Val McDermid (Northanger Abbey), U.S. writer Curtis Sittenfeld (Pride and Prejudice). Two other writers will be named later this year.","Trollope says fantasy novels like Twilight do not 'relate to the real world'

On trial: Sylvia Mitchell, pictured, bilked the Singaporean businesswoman out of $128,000 and the Florida-based dance instructor out of more than $10,000, prosecutors said . When a heartbroken ballroom-dancing instructor who had just lost a job and a businesswoman with an unrequited workplace crush wandered into a fortune-teller's Greenwich Village shop, the psychic foresaw lucrative opportunities — for herself, prosecutors said. Conjuring past lives, divining 'negative energy' and promising to banish problems through techniques such as stuffing thousands of customers' dollars in a jar, Sylvia Mitchell bilked the Singaporean businesswoman out of $128,000 and the Florida-based dance instructor out of more than $10,000, prosecutors said as Mitchell's grand larceny trial opened Thursday. 'It's one of the most humiliating things that's ever happened to me,' dance instructor Debra Saalfield said in recounting how she tapped a credit line on her Naples, Florida, home to hand over $27,000 to a psychic who said Saalfield had been an Egyptian princess in a previous existence. The case, one of several prosecutions of fortune-tellers in recent years, probes at the line between selling a service, however unusual, and preying on hopes. 'This case is not about whether you believe in psychics,' Mitchell's lawyer, William Aronwald, told jurors in an opening statement. The two women hired Mitchell to help them try to change their lives, and there's no evidence 'that she did not provide the services that she was contracted to provide,' he said. But prosecutors say Mitchell, 39, seized on despair to peddle false promises of personal transformation. She could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the top charge against her. 'The defendant is not in the business of cleansing spirits. She's in the business of cleaning out bank accounts,' Manhattan Assistant District Attorney James Bergamo said. Saalfield, who runs a marketing business and competes in ballroom dancing, said she had never been to a psychic before she went into Mitchell's chandelier-lit parlor, where she was billed as Zena the Clairvoyant. Embarrassing: 'It's one of the most humiliating things that's ever happened to me,' dance instructor Debra Saalfield, pictured, said in recounting how she tapped a credit line on her Naples, Florida, home to hand over $27,000 to Mitchell . After both a breakup and a layoff within . a day in July 2008, 'I needed some direction and guidance, and she said . that she was pretty confident that she could help me,' Saalfield told . jurors. 'I don't know that I thoroughly trusted her, but I wanted to . listen to words of comfort.' After a $75 initial psychic reading, she returned the next week for a $1,000 version — and was told her problems stemmed from being too attached to money in her royal life in ancient Egypt, Saalfield said. She knows of no Egyptian heritage in her family. Mitchell's solution: Give her $27,000, just to hold, as an exercise in parting with money, Saalfield recalled. She gave Mitchell the sum, quickly regretted it and asked for a refund. Mitchell said the money wasn't available, Saalfield said. After trying unsuccessfully to stop payment on the check, she called police, had a lawyer write letters and hired a private investigator to try to retrieve her money. Mitchell ultimately gave back about $9,500, Saalfield testified. Telling the future: The Zena Psychic Parlor where Sylvia Mitchell, a former Greenwich Village practitioner, performed psychic readings, in New York . Lee Choong, a Singapore native who earned a master's degree in business in New York, turned to Mitchell in 2007. Choong was grappling with professional demands and a personal problem: She was romantically interested in a co-worker, who didn't reciprocate, according to prosecutors and Mitchell's lawyer. Choong hasn't yet testified. Mitchell said Choong was surrounded by 'negative energy' and could exorcise it by putting $18,000 in a jar that Mitchell would hold, Bergamo said. Choong ultimately gave Mitchell about $128,000 over two years, prosecutors and the defense said. Mitchell repeatedly offered to repay Choong if she was dissatisfied, Aronwald said. Psychic scams often go unreported, prosecutors said. Still, a number of fortune-tellers have faced criminal charges. Janet Miller, a Manhattanite accused of swindling $600,000 from a woman by promising to rout evil spirits, pleaded guilty in May to grand larceny. She was sentenced to a year in jail. Manhattan fortune-teller Tammy Mitchell served prison time after pleading guilty to grand larceny in 2010. The allegations included conning a woman out of $40,000 by pledging to rid her of a curse. Tammy Mitchell is no apparent relation to Sylvia Mitchell. A Palmdale, California, soothsayer was arrested for investigation of extortion in 2011 after allegedly persuading a 12-year-old girl to steal more than $10,000 in jewelry from her family and throw it into a cauldron to lift a curse.","Sylvia Mitchell bilked a Singaporean .

Rihanna today won a permanent ban on Topshop selling T-shirts using her image - and an order that Sir Philip Green’s high street fashion chain must pay her estimated legal costs of almost £1million. Topshop owners Arcadia Group were ordered by Mr Justice Birss at the High Court to pay £200,000 of this within 14 days, even though he found the size of her bill ‘startling’ and ‘somewhat surprising’. The Chancery Division judge ruled in July that fans of the 25-year-old singer from Barbados, who was not in court, might have been deceived into thinking that she had endorsed the T-shirt. Victory: Rihanna (left) won a permanent ban on Topshop selling T-shirts using her image - and an order that Sir Philip Green’s (right) high street fashion chain pay her estimated legal costs of almost £1million . Topshop had sold the garment - which bore an image of her taken from a photograph - between March and August 2012. The judge said sale of the T-shirt without her permission was ‘passing off’. Today, in the latest hearing, Mr Justice Birss ruled that it was ‘right and fair’ that ‘style icon’ Rihanna should be granted an injunction to prevent any future similar wrong use of the 'unflattering' image. Controversial: Topshop had sold the garment - which bore an image of her taken from a photograph - between March and August 2012 . He said Topshop could appeal to the Court of Appeal against his ruling. But if his decision is upheld, he will then assess the amount of damages due to the singer - and how much is due in legal costs. The judge said Rihanna's lawyers gave an estimated legal bill of £919,000 - ‘figures I find startling’. He said he could not safely use those figures to decide what interim payment should be made today to Rihanna pending a full damages assessment. He eventually settled on a ‘reasonable’ £200,000. Rihanna also sought the return of any unsold T-shirts, but the court in Central London heard that all 12,000 had been sold - and only five were left and kept for the legal action. The judge had originally found that ‘a substantial number of purchasers are likely to be deceived into buying the T-shirt because of false belief that it has been authorised by Rihanna herself.’ Given her current tie-up with high street rivals River Island, the judge ruled that the Topshop T-shirt would be damaging to the style icon's goodwill and a loss to her merchandising business. ‘It also represents a loss of control over her reputation in the fashion sphere,’ ruled the judge. The judge said it was ‘right and fair’ to grant her a permanent injunction after being told that Topshop had failed to promise not to use her image on T-shirts in the future. Nobody at Arcadia or Topshop was available for comment when contacted by MailOnline tonight.","Rihanna, 25, also wins permanent ban on Topshop selling T-shirts of her .

A baby boy was born in mid-air aboard a Royal Navy helicopter as an emergency team rushed his mother to hospital. Marcus Daniel McLachlan, who arrived somewhere between the Isles of Scilly and Truro, is the second child ever delivered on one of the Queen's emergency vessels. Doctors are still unsure what location to put on the birth certificate. The unusual incident happened when heavily pregnant Ella McLachlan unexpectedly went into labour at her local hospital in Helston, Cornwall, at 5.05 yesterday afternoon. Delighted: Ella and Barney McLachlan with new baby Marcus who was born on a Royal Navy rescue chopper . Without the facilities to deliver a child, doctors were forced to summon a Search and Rescue R193 helicopter from 771 Naval Air Squadron at RNAS Culdrose. Mrs McLachlan tried to hold on, with a medical team and husband Barney on board for support. But just minutes into the flight, there was a change of plan and midwife Sue Watkins had to deliver the child in the back of the vessel. The astounded Navy pilot, Flight Lieutenant Jon Owen, had been planning to land early on a make-shift landing strip due to fog. But a call from the back meant he had to stay airborne. He said: 'I gave the crew a ""10 minutes left to run"" heads up so they could prepare for arrival. 'However, the midwife shouted back that baby was preparing for his own immediate arrival and that we needed to get ready to deliver in the air. Location: Doctors are still unsure what to put on the birth certificate. He was born two miles south east of Truro .

'I simply looked at the other pilot, Lieutenant Paul Smalley, and we continued to fly as mother nature took over.' They kept flying until baby Marcus was born weighing 5lb 3oz at 7.24pm, approximately two miles south east of Truro. Once landed, the family were taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital, where they are all doing well. Mr Lachlan, a baker, said: 'We thought we’d have a relaxing day. Then at the end of the afternoon Ella started feeling some cramps. 'We went to see the midwife for an examination and she confirmed Ella was in labour and that she needed to call Culdrose to pick us up. 'The Culdrose boys were immense, absolutely phenomenal. At one point they had to shine a light for Sue. The Royal Navy Sea King on which baby Marcus McLachlan was born. He weighed 5lb 3oz and is now doing well . 'They were hugely caring and did us brilliantly. They always deliver and always look after us.' Lieutenant Commander Chuck Norris, the observer on board added: 'It was an exciting evening. 'We planned to transfer the mum direct to Treliske Hospital in Truro but baby had other ideas.' He assisted the midwife, along with Petty Officer Aircrewman Gary Kneesh, for the birth. 'It’s pretty uncommon to announce to the Coast Guard that you had launched with seven persons on board, but were preparing to land with eight,' he said. The Sea King helicopters of 771 NAS are summoned to emergencies more than 200 times a year.","Marcus Daniel McLachlan was born weighing 5lb 3oz on a R193 chopper somewhere between the Isles of Scilly and Truro at 7.24pm yesterday .

Beauty spot: Mr Kelly was found by members of the public not far from the shores of Lake Windermere, pictured . His stepmother, Mary Pope, gave evidence at South Lakeland Magistrates Court about the days leading up to Mr Kelly’s death. She said: 'He came to visit on the February 17 and stayed with us until the 23rd. 'He never spoke about anything that was troubling him apart from that he was unable to see his son as the boy’s mother would not let him. 'He left on the Saturday night and I got a text from him at about ten to 11 saying that everything is sorted. I thought that meant he was back home in Hemel Hempstead.' The inquest heard that Mr Kelly, a marble craftsman who worked cutting marble worktops for kitchens, gave his tools to his stepmother's new partner shortly before his death, saying he would no longer need them. He left his stepmother's house on February 23 and just before 8.30am the next day, Windermere police received a call from two members of the public who had found a body in a field just off the A592, not far from the shores of Lake Windermere.

An investigation has been launched after £2million of taxpayers' cash was wasted on Beatles' memorabilia that was worth just £300,000. A publicly funded travel firm in Liverpool handed over the huge sum for a pair of John Lennon's glasses and George Harrison's first guitar, plus nine other items in 2008. Despite concerns over the valuation at the time, the board of Merseytravel agreed to the payment as part of a deal to buy the city's Beatles' Story museum from a group of London-based investors for £8million. The collection, bought by publicly-funded Mersey-travel in 2008, includes these wire glasses worn by John Lennon during the recording of Imagine and the guitar George Harrison learned to play on . But - following an internal audit - it has since emerged that the memorabilia was, in fact, worth £1.7million less. The . wire-rimmed glasses , which were apparently worn by Lennon when he . wrote his most famous song, Imagine, in 1970, were valued as being worth . £1million alone. Harrison's guitar, a brown six-string acoustic, which he learned to play on, was priced at £500,000. Other . items in the Fab Four cache of memorabilia included studio notes . written by their producer George Martin, believed to relate to the . recording of 1965's In My Life, from the Rubber Soul album. It . is understood lawyers instructed at the time of the sale had warned of a . potential 'conflict of interest' because the valuation had been made by . a business partner of the person who wanted to sell the memorabilia. However, . such information was not passed on to councillors sitting on the board . of Merseytravel and instead staff told the lawyers to proceed with the . purchase. Official documents state that 'both issues represent a serious failure in corporate governance'. Former . Beatles Story managing director Jerry Goldman said: 'There did not seem . to be any discomfort from the Merseytravel lawyers at the time.' This guitar and the spectacles alone were said to be worth £1.5million but the whole collection has now be revalued at just £300,000 . Auditors . for Merseytravel have since recommended 'a full investigation into the . Beatles memorabilia valuation' and advised the authority to take . 'appropriate action.' Merseytravel . chairman Cllr Liam Robinson said: 'We will look to take action if we . establish that we were let down by those we were relying on at the time . and that the interests of the taxpayer were not well served in the . original negotiation. 'From . initial enquiries it does appear that elements of due process were not . followed. This could not happen now. Our new governance and scrutiny . processes would not allow it. 'It is a reflection of where Merseytravel was and not where it is now.' Cllr . Robinson added: 'It is important to note that The Beatles Story is . unaffected by this revaluation.

Kaitlyn Dobrow was struck down with the often-fatal bacterial infection meningococcemia in February and though she survived, she had both arms and legs removed. The 19-year-old has undergone 20 surgeries since receiving the initial diagnosis- where doctors said she had only a week to live.

Actor John Stamos visited Dobrow at the Orange County hospital in August after being recruited by her friend.

'I’ve been trying to eat a lot more over the past few weeks. I mean I eat a lot anyway,' she says. 'There’s some myth that I starve myself, but I really don’t.

"By . Cherry Maslen . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 5 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:00 EST, 5 October 2013 . Mario Bassi knew the old Methodist chapel near Cinderford in Gloucestershire was the home for him as soon as he walked through the door: he is 6ft 6in tall and it was a huge relief to have room above his head for once. The spacious interior, large windows bringing in masses of light  and the potential to create a unique home big enough for a family sold the Victorian chapel to both Mario and his wife Caroline when they first saw it in 2004. It had already been converted into a house, but the Bassis had their own ideas. Seeing the light: Caroline and baby Mariella sit in the suspended bubble chair above the glass floor - beneath them are Mario, Angelina and Valentino in the hallway . While it remains virtually the same from the outside as when it was built in 1869, Mario, 45, and Caroline, 38, have transformed the chapel’s interior into a fantastic contemporary family home, with shiny red kitchen, glass floor and brightly coloured windows. It’s an upside-down house, with the bedrooms – seven of them – on the ground and lower-ground floors, while the first floor, once a smaller mezzanine, is now a stunning open-plan living space with high ceilings, original timber floors and windows on all four sides flooding the area with light all day. As you come through the wide glass and wood front door into the hall, a strikingly impressive staircase leads you up to the first floor. The staircase was made locally, to Mario’s own design, from oak and steel with clear glass balustrades. Although he has no training as a designer, Mario, who used to be a management consultant and now runs a group of Subway sandwich shop franchises, is fascinated by design and is not short on ideas. He did the drawings using PowerPoint, adjusting the dimensions so that even the oak handrail was the right fit for his larger-than-normal grip. Half-a-million home: The old Methodist chapel near Cinderford in Gloucestershire, built in 1869, boasts seven bedrooms and is on the market for £495,000 . Open plan: The stairs, designed by Mario, which leads up to the lounge and kitchen . At the top of the stairs, the 38ft by 28ft living space certainly has the wow factor. There are more than  ten windows, including a deep porthole in the kitchen area and three dramatic arched windows at the staircase end. Two of these have been covered with different, brightly coloured film, creating rainbow patterns when the sun is at a certain angle. It was Mario who painstakingly applied the coloured film. In front of the coloured windows, the old mezzanine floor was extended to fill the space above the hall with thick glass – a clever way of maximising the floor space upstairs without having to lose the sense of height and space as you come into the chapel. Above the glass floor is a bubble swing chair suspended from the ceiling – the perfect place to curl up and read a book, says Caroline. ‘We didn’t know what to do with that space at first,’ she says. ‘Then I thought of the bubble chair. Now it’s my favourite spot in the house.’ What helps give the chapel interior its contemporary edge is the stylish and original lighting. Above the stairwell hangs a spectacular bespoke light fitting made up of a series of different sized spheres in vibrant colours, reflecting the colours in the arched windows. ‘It looks great at night,’ says Mario. ‘People stop us in the street and say how much they love looking up at our balloon lights.’ Modern eating: The kitchen in the seven-bedroom home, transformed from late 19th century chapel to family residence . Comfortable leather sofas, bright rugs and a contemporary log burner set into the wall create a stylish sitting area, while bronze-coloured glass blocks separate the kitchen without dividing up the room. The hob is inset into the large granite island so that the cook can socialise with whoever else is in the room, with the bright red bar stools a magnet for guests, says Mario. Where the altar used to be on the ground floor is now the couple’s bedroom. There are four more  bedrooms on this floor, two of which are used by children Angelina, six, and Valentino, five – with a third ready for baby Mariella who’s just  a few months old. The fourth is used as a playroom. Mario and Caroline have an  en suite and there’s also a luxurious marble family bathroom with walk-in power shower, a super-sized bath and a sink set in granite. The lower ground floor is where Mario has his office. Caroline, an ex-teacher, helps him run the business. There are two more bedrooms for guests, another bathroom, Mario’s gym and a garage. While there is no shortage of bedrooms, some of them are quite small and the Bassis are now thinking forward to when their children are older, and have put the chapel on the market at £495,000. ‘Their bedrooms are fine for them now but they’ll need bigger ones when they’re teenagers,’ says Mario. ‘We will miss the chapel terribly, though – we’ve put so much of ourselves into it.’ fineandcountry.com, 01600 713030 .","Methodist chapel in Cinderford in Gloucestershire on the market for £500,000 .

Ricky Preddie, 26, posed outside court with a piece of paper which read: ‘Real Justice for Damiola Taylor’ – misspelling the schoolboy’s name. The stunt followed an appearance before West London magistrates where he denied a string of driving offences.

Pope Francis encouraged Catholic doctors to refuse to perform abortions today in a bizarre U-turn on comments yesterday that condemned the church's obsession with such 'small-minded things'. Francis appeared to be offering an olive branch to the more doctrine-minded, conservative wings of the church today with a staunchly pro-life message during an audience on Friday with Catholic gynecologists. It seemed to directly contradict his warning yesterday that the Catholic . Church could fall 'like a house of cards' if it continues in its preoccupation with abortion, gay marriage and contraception. 'Even an unborn baby has the face of Jesus': Pope Francis denounced today's 'throw-away culture' that justifies disposing of lives . But today he seemed a different man, telling gynecologists: 'Every child that isn't born, but is unjustly condemned to be aborted, has the face of Jesus Christ, has the face of the Lord.' The medical profession, he added, is a paradox because 'while we allow people new rights, we do not always protect life as a primary value and a basic right of every man.' 'One cannot worship God and money': He also talked fervently about the impact of greed . Thousands of devotees turned out for Pope Francis' mass in Saint Peter square at the Vatican earlier this month . He also talked fervently about the impact of money and greed on society. 'The widespread . preoccupation with profits and today's throw-away culture, that enslave . the hearts and minds of us all, come at a high cost: they serve to . destroy the human race, above all the weak.' 'Greed,' he said, 'is a sin against the First Commandment. One cannot worship God and money. The extraordinarily frank interview was published simultaneously by 16 of the order¿s newspapers around the world . 'Here is why. Money becomes idolatry. And Jesus tells us that you cannot serve money and God. It must be one or the other. 'What happens with money? Money gives you a certain sense of wellbeing initially, sure. But you feel increasingly important [as it grows] and then comes vanity.' Pope Francis said he was resolved to reform the church which had a tendency to get caught up in 'small minded things' Describing money as 'a seduction that makes you to slide slowly into perdition', he added: 'Money corrupts thought, it corrupts faith and it sends you down the wrong track. The path of money always ends in corruption.' The speech seemed a U-turn on comments he had made the previous day in which he said the Catholic Church could fall ‘like a house of cards’ if it continues in its obsession with abortion, gay marriage and contraception, the pope has warned. In a remarkable 12,000 word interview published on Thursday, Francis said he was resolved to reform the church, which had a tendency to get caught up in 'small minded things'. He said: 'We need to find a new balance otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall into a house of cards.' ‘It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time,’ he said. ‘We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods.’ The extraordinarily frank interview, conducted by a Jesuit priest in Rome, was published simultaneously by 16 of the order’s newspapers around the world. In a typically humble stance Francis declared himself a sinner. ‘This is the most accurate definition,’ he said, when asked what sort of man he was. ‘It is not a figure of speech or a literary genre. I am a sinner.’ He also claimed he had made mistakes earlier on during his career as Archbishop of Buenos Aires and had a propensity to become ‘authoritarian.’","He was speaking to a congregation of Catholic gynecologists in Rome .

Fall from grace: William Simmons, 51, of Woodbury Heights, pleaded guilty in July to possession with intent to distribute cocaine in South Jersey . Apologetic: Five-time Wing Bowl Champion William 'El Wingador Simmons was today sentenced Friday to seven years in prison for admitting to distributing cocaine . The father of three said he was struggling to make ends meet and had no choice but to deal drugs. The sentence came on the eve of Simmons' beloved gluttony contest, traditionally held on the Friday preceding the Super Bowl. 'I'm here to accept whatever you feel I deserve,' a tearful Simmons told Superior Court Judge Christine Allen-Jackson in front of about six supporters. 'I'm willing to accept my punishment as a man.' Philly.com reported Simmons may be eligible for less time if he completes an intensive supervision program and could be released in several months. Before sentencing, Assistant Gloucester County Prosecutor Alec Gutierrez said: 'Mr Simmons may not be a bad person. He made a bad decision.' Simmons said he began selling drugs . after several business ventures failed and he could not find a decent . job to support his wife, Debbie Martinelli Simmons, and three children.

Brave: Hero Melia, 14, has revealed what it was like to witness her parents go through a messy divorce . She was brought up by a single mother from the age of five after her drug-addicted convict father ran off with another woman. Hero Melia, however, is not one of the thousands of children from broken homes on council estates, but the privileged granddaughter of the Marquess of Queensberry. The aristocratic schoolgirl has become an unlikely poster girl for Broken Britain after she was chosen to speak at a conference about the ‘war zone’ that was her parents’ marriage. ‘I felt utterly at fault. It’s natural because you see your parents in love and suddenly they’re not.

It meant that up until that point home was sometimes like a war zone. ‘I don’t think there’s a lot of support for children and parents during a divorce.’ Hero’s mother, Lady Alice Douglas, is the daughter of David Harrington Angus Douglas, the 12th Marquess of Queensberry. It is a dynasty with a long and distinctly chequered history. John Douglas, the ninth Marquess of Queensberry, is notorious for his legal battle with Oscar Wilde, which led to the writer being bankrupted and charged with gross indecency. Wilde had been in a relationship with his son, Alfred. The official rules of boxing are also named after the ninth Marquess, who publicly endorsed changes to the sport in 1867 which largely put an end to bare knuckle fighting. In a scandal which stunned her family, Lady Alice decided to marry an armed robber whom she met while volunteering at a prison in the mid-Nineties. Simon Melia, who was serving a nine-year sentence, wooed her during an acting workshop at Blundeston Prison in Suffolk. Lady Alice moved from her Notting Hill apartment to live with him in a disused church in Capel Curig, Snowdonia, and they had two children – Hero and her younger brother Tybalt, now 13. The relationship fell apart in 2003 when she discovered her husband was addicted to drugs and was having an affair with the au pair. Battle: Hero described the marriage of her parents, Lady Alice Douglas, daughter of the 12th Marquess of Queensbury, and former convict Simon Melia, pictured together in 1999, as a 'war zone' Lonely: Hero told a legal conference she felt she was to blame for the breakdown of her parents' relationship .

Hero, a keen horse rider who attends Chetham’s School of . Music in Manchester, said she blamed herself for the breakdown of her . parents’ marriage. ‘It’s what a lot of children feel,’ she added. ‘I . have got so many ideas having gone through it myself and I thought it . would be good to help other people.’ Unlikely match: Hero's mother, the daughter of David Harrington Angus Douglas, the 12th Marquess of Queensberry, met her father Simon Melia while volunteering at a prison where he was serving time for robbery. The couple are pictured together in 2002 shortly after Hero was born . Falling apart: But their relationship ran into difficulties when Lady Alice discovered her husband, pictured together in 2002, was addicted to drugs . Lady Alice, whose own parents . split when she was four, said her divorce had been an ‘absolutely . horrific’ experience. ‘I was a Marquess’s daughter with a privileged . upbringing, an acting career and a flat in Notting Hill. Simon was an . armed robber serving nine years who’d grown up on a council estate,’ she . said. ‘As part of the acting workshop I ran in the prison, he played . a handsome Macbeth to my Lady Macbeth. Despite family and friends . decrying the match, after a 15-month romance, we married. It could have . been idyllic. The problems came when I discovered Simon’s drug habit, . then his affair. ‘Simon and the au pair left together that same evening.’ Lady . Alice said it was important parents spent more time thinking about . their children when fighting divorce cases in the courts. ‘Just because . divorce is more common these days it doesn’t mean it isn’t a . catastrophic car crash for the children involved – the fairy tale . absolutely shatters for them when parents split up,’ she added.

Calls: Tory MPs have demanded Ed Miliband fire Andy Burnham amidst claims he tried to block a report into hospital neglect . Former health secretary Andy Burnham is facing calls to quit after claims he tried to block the publication of a devastating report into hospital neglect before the last election. Tory MPs demanded Ed Miliband fire Mr Burnham as shadow health secretary after the Mail published damning emails which show the health watchdog was asked to stop the release of a report on Basildon and Thurrock hospital in Essex where patients were left to die. Britain’s most powerful civil servant Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood was last night examining whether he needs to set up a Whitehall investigation into whether civil servants breached their code of conduct. Emails released under the Freedom of Information Act have revealed that the Department of Health stopped the watchdog Care Quality Commission from releasing the report just hours before it was due to be published in November 2009. The report revealed that death rates in A&E were a third above average while catheters were strewn on the floor and blood was spattered on the walls and curtains. Mr Burnham was ‘furious’ when news of the poor standards of care was leaked, the emails reveal. In a second controversy, the commission was due to publish its ‘state of care report’ into hospitals and care homes in February 2010, three months before the election. Yet an email sent round by a senior CQC boss following a meeting with one of Mr Burnham’s junior ministers instructs them that, ‘given the political environment’, the report should be ‘largely positive’. In July, in a House of Commons debate on hospital scandals,  Mr Burnham rounded on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt after he  was accused of covering up poor care. Mr Burnham said at the time: ‘The Secretary of State claims that we were covering up...it is outrageous for [him] to come to the House and repeat those concerns without a shred of evidence to back them up’. Mr Burnham is now accused of misleading MPs about his role in the affair and is facing calls to make a statement to Parliament next week. Tory MP Stephen Barclay, who obtained the emails, said: ‘Labour tried to cover up failing hospitals before the last general election. Andy Burnham told the House of Commons in July there was no shred of evidence of political interference with the health regulator. ‘But these emails show a clear paper trail of political meddling – leading back to him. ‘He owes a big apology to the patients and families who suffered, and he should resign. No one will ever trust Labour with our hospitals again.’ He added that he had written to Ed Miliband demanding Mr Burnham be sacked. Denial: Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham denied a cover up as recently as three months ago . '[Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt] claims that we were covering  up ... it is outrageous for  him to come  to the House  and repeat those concerns without a shred of evidence to back them up.' As recently as July 16, Andy Burnham insisted the CQC had not been pressured by Labour. Appearing in the Commons he said: ‘The Secretary of State claims that we were covering up, so let me answer on the question of ministers’ integrity... Let me quote to him from a letter sent by [ex CQC chairman] Baroness Young to the Prime Minister yesterday: “CQC was not pressurised by the previous government to tone down its regulatory judgments or to hide quality failures”.’ However, as the Mail reported yesterday, emails show he was ‘furious’ when a report on poor care at Basildon and Thurrock was issued to the media. They also showed his junior minister, Mike O’Brien, warning the CQC close to the election that ‘at this sort of time everything you do is going to be political’. Another message from February 2010, when the CQC was due to publish its ‘state of care report’, said it should be ‘largely positive’. Martin Marshall, the CQC’s director of clinical quality, wrote: ‘It is really important that we get the tone absolutely right.’ Baroness Young has indicated she was forced out of the CQC by political pressure by the last Labour government. Roger Davidson, the former CQC head of media said: ‘The message that “we don’t want bad news” infected the whole organisation. There was no compass.’ Former CQC head of media, Roger Davidson, has previously said the watchdog was told by Labour before the general election that ‘we don’t want bad news’. Baroness Young, the former chairman of the CQC, told the Francis inquiry into deaths at Mid Staffordshire Hospital Trust, under oath, that the CQC was ‘under more pressure...when Andy Burnham became minister’. Professor Sir Brian Jarman, the country’s foremost expert on hospital death rates, has said Labour ran an NHS ‘denial machine’, which ignored issues in the NHS when they were politically inconvenient. After the publication of the emails yesterday, Tory MP Stephen Metcalfe wrote to Sir Jeremy Heywood asking him to investigate whether the civil service code was breached. He wrote: ‘The evidence presented this morning suggests that Andy Burnham, then health secretary, and his team, attempted to manipulate the release of CQC reports for political gain. ‘I am deeply concerned civil servants came under undue political pressure from the front bench Labour team and those associated with them, who were nervous about the proximity of the general election.’ Tweet: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was 'shocked' by the revelation . Health Secretary Mr Hunt tweeted: ‘Shocking revelations on Andy Burnham’s attempts to cover up failing hospitals.’ He added: ‘What it looks like … is that the last government wanted the NHS to be a good news factory, really, in the run-up to the last election – to the extent that they were prepared to lean on the regulator not to publish a report about poor care at one hospital, and I think that’s wrong. ‘That’s why I announced this week that we will make the CQC, the regulator, completely independent in the way the Bank of England is.’ Mr Burnham demanded an apology from the Tories and threatened to sue Mr Hunt. He claimed he was only ‘furious about the release of the information on the hospital because the leak of the report into Basildon hospital broke Department of Health rules’. In a letter to Mr Hunt he said: ‘The unauthorised briefing by a CQC press officer, which broke the CQC/DH rules, was not agreed with the senior leadership of the CQC. ‘I ordered a press release, in accordance with proper process, be issued later that day. It is impossible to see how you can claim this amounted to a cover-up.’ He asked for evidence ‘to substantiate your assertion. If you fail to provide such evidence, I will require a full retraction and public apology. If that is not forthcoming I will consider further action’. Labour said it had asked Mr Hunt to ‘substantiate his comments or withdraw them’.","Tories demand Andy Burnham be fired for 'blocking' devastating report .

Murdered: Jamie McMahon, 26, was found dead after stopping to eat a takeaway in a churchyard . A man found murdered in a church graveyard after stopping to eat a takeaway may have been killed in a robbery which went wrong, police claimed last night. Jamie McMahon, 26, from Northampton, was found by a member of the public near St Giles Church in the town centre at around 7.45am on Wednesday morning. Mr McMahon, who had spent the night playing snooker with friends suffered a violent attack that left him with head and facial injuries. He was last seen alive shortly after 2am and is believed to have gone to the churchyard to eat some food. Assistant chief constable Russ Foster, of Northamptonshire Police, said: 'We are pursuing a number of lines of enquiry. We cannot rule out robbery as a motive and that is a line of inquiry at the moment. 'We are awaiting further test results to confirm his exact cause of death. 'This does appear to be an isolated incident. We have a team of detectives across the region working with us to try and piece together the events leading up to Jamie’s death and also to identify any suspects.' Detective inspector Louise Hemingway, who is working on the investigation, said: 'We know that Jamie was enjoying a night out with some friends and had been playing snooker earlier on, on Tuesday evening. 'We think that maybe Jamie came into the churchyard to eat food that he purchased but from that point onwards we really don’t know what happened and that’s why we need help from members of the public.'

Nick Clegg backed Tory plans to strip the under-25s of benefits if they refuse to take a job or training yesterday saying young people should not be allowed to simply ‘cross their arms and sit on the sofa’. The Deputy Prime Minister said he would block any ‘blanket removal’ of handouts based simply on age. Amid signs that the issue could flare into new tensions between the coalition partners, Mr Clegg said he would not support the withdrawal of handouts from all under 25s. Scroll down for video . Support: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg gave David Cameron's plans to scale back on benefits for the under 25s his backing on LBC radio yesterday . Mr Clegg also voiced support for proposals by David Cameron to extend ‘conditionality’ to welfare payments. The Prime Minister used his speech to the Tory conference to say that everyone under 25 should be ‘earning or learning’. Aides said that would mean taking away JobSeeker’s Allowance and Housing Benefit from those who refuse a job, a training place, an apprenticeship or a further education place. At the moment, JSA can be slashed if the jobless refuse to take work, but the Tories want to extend that to include Housing Benefit too. Crackdown: Mr Cameron layed out his plans in his keynote speech at the Conservative Party conference this week . Mr Clegg told London radio station LBC: ‘I think everybody agrees that if you can help it, you don’t want youngsters on benefits, you want them either being active or earning or learning. ‘So I’m all for making sure there’s better conditionality so that the incentive to just rely on benefits is minimised.’ Concessions: Mr Clegg said that he would not accept a blanket ban on handouts because of age . He added: ‘Here’s the big thing - and this is already in the rules by the way and I’m a big supporter of this - if you don’t take those opportunities up, don’t expect you can go back home and just sit on benefits. 'You can’t just say: “I’m going to cross my arms, sit on my sofa and not try”, let’s look at that.’ Mr Clegg said he would need to examine the detail of the Conservative proposals and he rejected a previous Tory plan to simply strip Housing Benefit from everyone under the age of 25. He said: ‘I’m not in favour of just blanket removal of people just because they happen to be a certain age. ‘What if you’re a youngster from Lincoln who’s trying to make his or her way in Manchester and you’re trying really hard and then suddenly you’re having the rug pulled from under your feet.’ Treasury minister Sajid Javid sowed further confusion about what the plans would actually entail when he said the benefits crackdown would apply to ‘all under-25s’. He said: ‘It will affect all under-25s. This is Conservative policy, something we plan to put into our Conservative manifesto. ‘For under-25s, there’ll be two options, which is earning or learning. 'And that’s not just because it’s the right thing to do for those individuals concerned, but it’s also right for hardworking taxpayers that are paying for these benefits through their taxes.’ Trouble ahead? But amid signs that the issue could flare into new tensions between the coalition partners, Mr Clegg said he would not support the withdrawal of handouts from all under 25s . A senior Tory source said: ‘We’re not talking about a blanket ban. We’re talking about conditionality if people refuse to take a job or a training place. 'We’ve said there will be exemptions for people emerging from care and for the disabled. We are also examining what to do about single mothers with young children.’ Mr Javid admitted: ‘There’s a lot of detail to work out. This is something we’ll flesh out over the coming months to get it ready for our manifesto. ‘But our intention is clear - that young people, too many of them, thousands each year slide into a life on benefits when they leave compulsory education. 'That’s not acceptable - it’s not good for them, and it’s not good for taxpayers.’","Mr Clegg said that young people shouldn't be allowed to 'simply cross their arms and sit on the sofa'

But what it is doing totally contradicts that. I was shocked. I don’t understand why it is doing it when there is a glut of British lamb on the market. What hope have British farmers got if this is the attitude of our biggest supermarket?’ Farmers’ leaders have accused Tesco boss Philip Clarke of breaking a pledge made during the horsemeat scandal to sell more British meat. Phil Stocker, leader of the National Sheep Association, has asked for an urgent meeting with the retailer. He said: ‘For Mrs Allan to be told lamb is out of season is astonishing, and either purposefully misleading or a case of Tesco being completely unaware of reality.

A policeman stands guard as the refugees vowed to stay put until they are sent to Britain . Some have also climbed on a roof and threatened to jump off unless their demand to be taken to England is met. ‘We are treated like dogs in France and do not want to stay here,’ said one migrant, who said his name was Majid. ‘Britain is a fair country, and that is why we want to go there – we will be treated will by the British government.’ Placards held up by the 60 plus refugees include slogans including ‘Take us to the UK’ and ‘We want to talk to David Cameron’.

Syria has close historical links with France, which has promised to speed up asylum claims from those who have escaped the Civil War. But the process is notoriously slow in France, with few benefits made available while migrants are waiting. French President Francois Hollande had led the calls for military action against Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad’s regime, but is doing very little for Syrian refugees. Those sleeping rough are quickly moved on by the police, leaving them to rely on homeless charities. The brutal war in Syria has claimed more than 100,000 lives since it started in early 2011 .

One woman, who said she originally came from ‘near Damascus’, said: ‘The procedures for us to claim asylum are far simpler and quicker in Britain. ‘Once there we will be well treated, and can bring our families too. We can start new lives in Britain.’ Calais is notorious magnate for migrants from all over the world, many of whom try to get into Britain illegally, either in the back of lorries crossing the Channel by ferry, or by hiding in trains.

Treasury Minister Sajid Javid, the son of a bus driver, will be given a senior ministerial job at ‘the door of the Cabinet’ by David Cameron, as the Prime Minister hands out promotions to the brightest members of the 2010 intake of Tory MPs. Comprehensive-educated Mr Javid, 43, has only been in the Commons since 2010. But the Muslim former banker, who is politically close to George Osborne, has impressed colleagues as a junior Treasury Minister and is seen as a safe pair of hands both in the Commons and in media interviews. One of five sons, Mr Javid was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, but brought up in a crime-ridden area of Bristol. He became a vice-president of Chase Manhattan Bank at just 25 and later a director of Deutsche Bank. But, inspired by Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, Mr Javid, who is married with four children, gave up banking to focus on politics. His wife Laura is a Christian, sparking Mr Javid to say last year: ‘She goes to church more often than I go to mosque.’ The Prime Minister is being urged by advisers to promote women, ethnic minority MPs, northern MPs and those from less affluent backgrounds. The drive follows findings by focus groups that the party is still regarded as a bastion for white, middle-class, southern males. Speculation that a reshuffle was imminent heightened on Friday when Rail Minister Simon Burns quit – to fight for the vacant post of Commons Deputy Speaker – and was not immediately replaced. Labour leader Ed Miliband is also expected to carry out a reshuffle this week, with Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rachel Reeves backed to replace Liam Byrne as Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary. Douglas Alexander is expected to keep his job as Shadow Foreign Secretary, but also be handed the job of the party’s campaign co-ordinator, succeeding Tom Watson.

Each year around 82,500 men in the UK lose their lives to cancer, making it the leading cause of death in the male population.

According to a survey of 12,000 over-50s, almost half do not know the signs of prostate  or bowel cancer, while women are better informed. A similar number do not visit their GP about health problems, with one in four refusing to do so even if they are in severe pain. More than a fifth need to be chivvied into seeing their doctor by  worried family members. The survey also shows almost two-thirds of men do not eat the recommended five-a-day of fruit and vegetables, compared with half of women, and one in five does not exercise. The findings come after figures revealed cancer death rates in the UK are more than a third higher in men than in women. Confidence: A posthumous advert featuring Bob Monkhouse, who died from prostate cancer, inspired men to be more vigilant with the disease . Although the difference is partly due to men developing hard-to-treat cancers such as those affecting the bladder, oesophagus and liver, doctors and charities also blame men for not paying attention to their health. The death of entertainer Bob Monkhouse from prostate cancer ten years ago led to a posthumous TV advert five years later which used special effects to show him urging men to be vigilant. But only 59 per cent know the symptoms of prostate cancer, which is predicted to be the most common cancer by 2030. Signs include trouble urinating and blood in the urine. By contrast, 82 per cent of women can identify breast cancer signs. Men are also less likely to recognise bowel cancer, with 55 per cent saying they would know the symptoms compared with almost three-quarters of women. Meanwhile, just over a third of men know how to spot lung cancer – the biggest cancer killer of both sexes – compared with half of women. Slightly more are aware of skin cancer, with 54 per cent of men knowing the signs compared with  71 per cent of women. Mark Flannagan, of Beating Bowel Cancer, said men can be too embarrassed to talk and leave it too late before visiting GPs. ‘Bowel cancer is more treatable if spotted and diagnosed early,’ he said. The survey, by Saga Health Insurance, found the eventual  rate of prostate cancer in boys born today will triple compared with the current rate, of  around 41,000 men a year. Owen Sharp, of Prostate Cancer UK, said: ‘We all need to generate more open conversations about men’s health and we hope that with the likes of Billy Connolly [who has been treated for prostate cancer] speaking out about their personal experiences, more men will be inspired to seek advice. ‘Prostate cancer kills one man every hour but it can be treated if caught early enough.’","Experts warn of little improvement in men’s  knowledge of the disease .

Identical twins could hold the key to solving Britain’s kidney donor shortage after a ground-breaking transplant ‘deal’. In the first case of  its kind, Roger and Andrew Corke both offered a kidney to a stranger – in the knowledge that should one of them need a replacement in the future, the other will  be a compatible donor because they share the same genetic footprint. ‘I only volunteered to be a donor because I knew I had an identical twin and therefore had back-up,’ says Roger, 58. He was eventually chosen as the donor due to his proximity to the London teaching hospital where the operation took place ten days ago. Double up: Identical twins Roger, left and Andrew Corke, 58, both offered a kidney to a stranger knowing that they had a genetic backup should one of them need a replacement in the future . ‘Everyone kept asking me “What  if you need your other kidney?” but Andrew has agreed to give me his  if I do. And if one of his fails, he  still has another. It seems to be the perfect solution.’ There are currently 7,180 patients waiting for an organ transplant in Britain, according to NHS Blood and Transplant. Of those, almost 6,000 need a new kidney. While the majority of the 1,220 kidney transplants last year were from deceased donors, 387 came from those still living – and a growing number are so-called ‘altruistic’ donations – when the donor does  not know the recipient. This first altruistic kidney donation took place in 2007 and there have been 73 so far this year. Roger was moved to donate after discovering the plight of people needing dialysis, while Andrew, a vicar from Dorset, has a friend who needed two liver transplants. Friends and family were initially horrified by the risks and Roger’s wife Lynn, a retired solicitor, was worried that he had opted for a serious operation he did not need. But Roger was unconcerned. ‘Now I know how safe kidney donation is, I’d give one even if I wasn’t a twin,’ says Roger, a documentary film-maker from North London. Peas in a pod: Roger, right, and Andrew, left, pictured at the age of six . ‘People can function well on one kidney and the chances of me needing Andrew’s are lower than average, as you’re only allowed to give a kidney if you’re very healthy. ‘There was a 3,000-to-one chance of me dying during the operation, but that is much better odds than the one-in-800 chance of me dying  in the next 12 months from cancer or a heart attack.’ After ten hospital visits and a vast array of tests, including a psychological assessment, Roger was accepted as a donor in August. He  is now recovering at home after the five-hour operation. Andrew is equally unperturbed  by the health risks. ‘I’m the insurance policy and I’m not worried about me. I’m a Christian and feel I’m looked after. You’re meant to put others before yourself. We hope it will encourage others.’ The success of transplants between twins is well documented – 28 UK operations have involved a twin donating an organ directly to a sibling. But this is the first known case where twins have offered a kidney without knowing the recipient. Medical experts are watching with interest and are now keen to enlist other identical twins to help cut waiting lists. With 250,000 pairs of identical twins in Britain, the potential is dramatic. ‘Targeting twins could be a very useful way to boost organ donations,’ says Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology who heads the Twins Research Centre at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. ‘There are plenty of twins in Britain and they each have a ready-made personal organ donor. We shall be informing those on our register and hopefully this will lead to more recruitment nationwide.’ At present, three people a day die while waiting for an organ transplant and it can take as long as four years to identify a suitable donor – or even longer for patients with a rare blood group. Roger will be absent from work until the New Year, though the NHS will reimburse his loss of earnings. The twins are not allowed to know the full outcome of the transplant  or who received the kidney, but they have been told that the organ has started working. However, Roger is keen to meet the patient in future. ‘We’d love to meet the person, but it’s very much their choice – that’s the rule. I told the hospital I want to know the outcome. I really hope it will be a success, but if it isn’t I can still say I took a chance and tried to help.’","Groundbreaking 'donor deal' of identical twins could solve shortage .

Since news of Pope Francis' profile hit the headlines his number of Instagram followers has shot up, and currently stands at 5417. Pope-ular: Pope Francis' Instagram page already has over 5,400 followers and features photographs of His Holiness greeting children and intimate prayer shots . The Vatican itself is also on the Instagram site and its @newsva feed has around 1,700 followers. Posts on the feed include shots of the Vatican itself, and crowds waiting to see the Pope.

Cash registers emptied. Alcohol stocks plundered. For the second time in two months, poorly paid Kenyan security forces that moved in to control an emergency are being accused of robbing the very property they were supposed to protect. First the troops were accused of looting during a huge fire in August at Nairobi's main airport. Now shop owners at Westgate Mall are returning to their stores after last week's devastating terrorist attack to find displays ransacked and valuables stolen. One witness told The Associated Press that he saw a Kenyan soldier take cigarettes out of a dead man's pocket. Scroll down for video... Chaos: The FoneXpress computer store is littered with debris, and its cabinets are bare, showing signs of looting reported by businesses throughout the mall . Dormans coffee shop on the ground floor of the mall: Abandoned trolleys, dropped shopping bags and coffee cups left on the tables show the chaos as people fled for their lives before the gunfire . The shock revelation that looting businesses and robbing bodies took place comes a day after the first pictures . from inside the mall were revealed. Shopping . trolleys abandoned, bags dropped on the floor and beer bottles left . where they stand, these haunting images show the shops which were . deserted in the aftermath of the Nairobi mall massacre which left 67 . people dead and dozens more missing. Carts . full of goods were left standing in Westgate Mall as shoppers fled for . their lives when jihadi terrorists rushed the building and started . gunning down customers. The . photographs show how people apparently dropped bags on the ground as . they made their escape, forming a disturbing portrait of the moment . chaos broke out. Shopkeepers . spent Monday carting merchandise and other valuables out of their . stores and restaurants to prevent any more thefts. No one can say for . sure who is responsible, but Kenya's security forces are strongly . suspected. Soon after . the attack began on September 21, Kenyan officials put a cordon around . the mall, allowing only security forces and a few government personnel . to pass through. Since . then, alcohol stocks from the restaurants have been depleted. One . business owner at the mall said money and mobile phones were taken from . bags and purses left behind in the mayhem. The owner insisted on . anonymity to avoid retribution from Kenya's government. Attack: Bags, beers and personal belongings were left behind in the Artcaffe. As the gunmen walked through the mall, shooting anyone in sight, shoppers ran, hid or died . Empty: The Artcaffe restaurant and coffee shop is situated on the ground floor of Westgate. Little damage can be seen here compared to the devastation in other areas of the mall . Employees . of a book shop on the mall's second floor returned to find registers . yanked open and cash gone. The store's laptops were also stolen. All the . shop's books remained in place, said owner Paku Tsavani. Perhaps reluctant to blame Kenyan security forces, Tsavani said he doesn't know who took his goods. 'Obviously the terrorists wouldn't steal those things, so we just don't know,' Tsavani said. Sandeep . Vidyarthi went into the mall Sunday to help a relative retrieve . equipment from his dental practice. Inside he said he passed shop after . shop that had been looted, including the Rado store that sells high-end . Swiss watches. As he . was leaving the mall, Vidyarthi passed a jewellery shop near the front . entrance. The owner, he said, was presenting security officials with a . long list of missing precious stones and high-end necklaces. 'The jeweller had written down this very long list,' he said. It . is ironic, said the management team of one Westgate business, that . store owners must now make reports of stolen goods to the same security . forces suspected of doing the thieving. Interior .

Paresh Shah, a volunteer who . helped evacuate the injured and recover the dead during the first day, . said he carried out the body of Aleem Jamal. Shah frowned at the memory and said he saw a Kenyan soldier take Jamal's cigarettes while in the ambulance. 'I could never do that, take a dead man's cigarettes,' Shah said. Forensics: Investigators work in the mall passageways scouring the building for clues which may lead to other terrorists involved in the attack . Jamal's family retrieved the body at the morgue, where his wife, Taz Jamal, said her husband's wallet was missing. A . team of terrorists entered Westgate Mall shortly after noon on a busy . Saturday, firing guns and throwing grenades. The attackers - the Somali . extremist group al-Shabab claimed responsibility - held off Kenya's . military and controlled at least parts of the mall for four days. The attack killed at least 67 people. The mall now has a gaping three-story hole in it from the siege. Almost . a week after the attack ended, more than three dozen people remain . unaccounted for, the head of the Kenyan Red Cross said Monday. The government contends there are no remaining missing people. 'The . only way to verify this is when the government declares the Westgate . Mall 100 per cent cleared.

Explosion: Burnt-out vehicles have been abandoned outside Westgate as the work of clearing up the mall continues . Five . terrorists are believed to be under the rubble but no dead hostages, .

A council spent £338,000 on private education for just one disabled boy in the last academic year, it can be revealed. Authorities paid £525million to teach nearly 11,500 youngsters with special needs in independent schools nationwide - which works out at nearly £46,000 per child. Disabled children educated privately have either severe physical disabilities, behavioural problems, emotional difficulties or suffer from severe autism. Private sector: Councils paid £525million to educate 11,500 children in independent schools in the last academic year. While some authorities were able to educate the majority of pupils in their own schools, others racked up large bills putting children in private schools . But while some authorities are able to teach youngsters in their own state-run special schools, others hand thousands of pounds over to the private sector instead. Critics have said this is often not in the child's or the parents' best interests because the special schools can be a long way from home. Campaign groups also questioned whether local authorities are getting good value because of the huge annual bills. Wiltshire Council paid £338,000 to educate one disabled boy in a secondary school last year, according to the figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act. The money pays for the child's education, transport and day-to-day healthcare costs. Responses from 124 local education authorities revealed 11,459 special needs pupils were educated privately last year. Reading Borough Council paid £307,183 to educate one male pupil in a secondary school while Merton Council, in London, spent £304,272 on secondary education for a child. In contrast, Wolverhampton City Council managed to educate 31 pupils privately at a cost of £1,730,965. Specialist care: Disabled children educated privately have either severe physical disabilities, behavioural problems, emotional difficulties or suffer from severe autism (picture posed by models) The most they paid for education was £90,241 to teach a secondary school boy - less than a third of the bills elsewhere. The huge disparity in the cost of private . school places for disabled children was seized upon by critics as . evidence that some authorities are not getting good value for money. Chris McGovern, chairman for the . Campaign for Real Education, said the figures show some local education . authorities are overspending on private schools for children with . special needs. ‘There are . some children who need 24-hour care, some of whom are autistic children, . and it is right that resources are devoted to looking after these . people,’ he said. ‘The . figures suggest that while some authorities can look after . children “in house” others are having to outsource to the private . sector. ‘Huge discrepancies . between the amount of money local authorities are spending on education . for children with special needs would suggest some are relying too heavily . on private providers. 'This is obviously going to be more expensive for the taxpayer. ‘These . discrepancies should not exist – local authorities need to get value . for money. Councils have to weigh up getting good value for money and . providing the best possible care.’ Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of . the Taxpayers' Alliance said: 'It’s important that pupils with special . education needs have access to teaching that caters for their . requirements. 'But carting a . select few pupils off to private school is neither good value for . taxpayers’ money nor does it improve special education provisions in . mainstream schools. 'Local . schools should be able to cater for all pupils rather just those who . don’t meet requirements that mean they get sent elsewhere. A spokesman for Wiltshire Council defended sending children with special needs to private school and said they were working to reduce the cost to the taxpayer. 'Since 2006 the number of placements of children in independent schools has fallen from well over 140 to between 80 and 90 depending on the time of the year,' he said. 'This has resulted in savings of over £2million being made from the Dedicated Schools Grant, which has been re-invested in local schools to improve the special educational needs provision available. 'The needs of some children are so complex and specialised that we will never be in a position to meet them completely within the county, and a single specialist school would not cover the needs of every child. 'However, we have developed robust procedures to monitor all  plans to ensure these children and their families receive the best possible support.' A spokesman from the Department for Education said it was for individual councils to decide how best to educate disabled children. 'Children with special educational needs should be educated in a school which can meet their needs. It is for councils to make decisions about placements based on the individual needs of the child,' he said. 'Special free schools and academies are giving parents of children with SEN more choice within the state sector, with open and approved special free schools providing more than 1,100 places.'","£46,000 per child to educate 11,500 disabled youngsters privately .

Women with breast cancer get as much benefit from three weeks of radiotherapy treatment as from the international standard five-week course, research has found. And fewer trips to hospital mean patients suffer less fatigue. The ‘less is more’ regime can generate cost savings for the NHS and paves the way for research that could see treatment time fall further to just one week’s radiotherapy. While relapse rates for women on the shorter course were the same as those on the longer one, the damage caused to healthy tissue was far less . The shorter course of 15 treatments was adopted by many British hospitals in 2008, but doubts remained about longer-term benefits. Two out of five bowel cancers could be prevented if older people had colonoscopy screening every ten years, say researchers. The procedure allows a doctor to look inside the colon, or large bowel, for cancerous growths using a long flexible tube. A new study suggests it is the most effective preventive measure against a cancer that is diagnosed in 41,000 Britons each year and which kills 16,000. The research by Harvard School of Public Health studied 1,815 cases of colorectal cancer and 474 deaths from the disease, as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine. It found that both colonoscopy and the similar sigmoidoscopy (which uses a smaller tube) were associated with a lower risk of getting colorectal cancer or dying from it. But only colonoscopy cut the risk for cancers in the proximal or upper part of the colon. The researchers estimated that if all participants in the study had undergone colonoscopies, 40 per cent of colorectal cancers would have been prevented. The latest findings, published in The Lancet Oncology journal, build on results from a five-year trial of radiotherapy given to 4,500 British women after surgery for early breast cancer. The ten-year follow-up confirms the benefits from the earlier trial, including an unexpected small improvement in survival for those on the short course. It shows the relapse rates of cancer within the same breast are similar to the international standard course, but with significantly less harm to healthy tissue. ‘We’ve shown conclusively that less can be more in breast cancer radiotherapy,’ said chief investigator John Yarnold, professor of clinical oncology at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and honorary consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust. ‘Both breast cancer recurrence and the side-effects of radiotherapy can occur many years after treatment, so these long-term results provide an important reassurance that the shorter treatment course is the best option for patients.’ The same team is now setting out to investigate whether even fewer doses of radiotherapy could be just as effective, as part of a new trial of 4,000 women called Fast-Forward. The trial will compare the new standard 15-dose course of radiotherapy treatment, delivered over three weeks, with an even shorter five-dose course, over one week. Kate Law, director of clinical trials at Cancer Research UK, which funded the latest research, said: ‘What’s really exciting is that as a result of this trial women are already benefiting from the added physical and emotional wellbeing of needing fewer hospital visits for their treatment. Four out of five women who find a lump and have surgery also undergo radiotherapy treatment . ‘Minimising the long-term side effects of treatment is becoming increasingly important as more cancer patients live longer.’ At present, radiotherapy is offered to all women who have breast conserving surgery – around 30,000 a year – where just the lump is removed rather than the whole breast. Four out of five have treatment which kills any remaining tumour cells in the breast. Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer charity, said: ‘Many UK hospitals have already adopted this shorter regime, and this study confirms that the NHS is providing the best possible care to UK patients.’","Research builds on study of 4,500 British women who had surgery .

Brandon McMillan has trained as many as 10,000 dogs for television, movies, commercials, videos and people. Then he started saving dogs from animal shelters, training them and finding homes for them. When Litton Entertainment needed a dog trainer who would rescue, train and place 22 dogs in 22 weeks for a show called Lucky Dog for CBS, they didn't have to look far. He will start each week spending several . hours at a shelter, evaluating dogs. That may be the hardest part, . especially given that at least 9,000 dogs and cats are euthanized each . day because homes can't be found for them. Scroll down for video . Beloved pet: Animal expert Brandon McMillan, host and animal trainer of the show Lucky Dog, cuddles up to a pooch at an animal shelter . Although he looked at an army of dogs in a shelter to find candidates for Lucky Dog, he could choose just 22 . In all, McMillan has saved and trained around 10,000 dogs using his expertise . Mr McMillan, who owns a dog shelter in southern California, pets the dog he is bringing home to train . 'I can only take one out. That means I have to walk by 99 I can't take. All 100 are very trainable, very place-able and just as smart as the next dog. Often the one I choose just comes down to one I make a connection with,' McMillan said. McMillan, 36 and single, said the dogs will be proficient in the seven common commands — sit, stay, down, come, off, heel and no. 'My theory of training is a lot like martial arts. You learn the technique one day and you perfect it for years to come. With the dogs, I teach them technique when I am training them. I teach the family to perfect the technique over the years to come.' His dogs are really good at seven commands instead of being just average at 20 commands, he said. 'Less is more when it comes to dog training.' McMillan will choose the family by evaluating emails he receives at his Southern California ranch — aptly named the Lucky Dog Ranch - and checking out the house and yard where the new dog will live. At the end of the show, the dog and family meet. McMillan spends a couple of hours training the family. Most of the dogs chosen for the show will be under 5 because that's what the families have asked for. The commands the dogs learn include come, down, heel, no, off, sit and stay . At the end of the show, the dog and family meet. McMillan spends a couple of hours training the family . Adorable: The show Lucky Dog airs on Saturday morning across the US . Abuse will not be part of their past. McMillan can tell which dogs have been abused in the first 30 seconds he spends with them. 'And I can tell you how they were abused in the first few minutes,' he said. Those dogs are a passion for McMillan off-camera, but they will not appear on Lucky Dog. 'The viewers that watch this show are not going to want to see a dog that's been in a fight. This is a family show,' he explained. Lucky Dog is targeted to teens 13 to 16 years old, but McMillan is guessing a lot of moms will be watching. Lucky Dog airs on Saturday morning (check local listings for time), followed by another Litton show called Dr Chris Pet Vet, which follows Australian veterinarian Chris Brown as he treats a wide variety of animals. The two shows premiered Saturday. Along with four other Litton shows, they replace Saturday morning cartoons, abandoned by CBS because of increased competition. The new shows also fulfill the network's requirement for educational television. McMillan, who used to have a show on Animal Planet called Night, in which he studied the nocturnal behavior of animals in the wild, won't choose dogs that can't get along with children, he said. 'But if you have a shadow of a doubt that your dog will bite a kid or if a dog has in the past bitten a kid, I would say that is a dog that should not be around kids. I think that's the responsible way to look at it,' he said.","Trainer Brandon McMillan, who is single and lives in California, has rescued and trained thousands of dogs .
