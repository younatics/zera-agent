"Joplin, Missouri (CNN) -- Calling the students an inspiration ""to me (and) the world,"" President Barack Obama urged Joplin High School graduates Monday to heed the lessons they've learned and spirit they've shown to rebuild not only their tornado-ravaged Missouri city, but also their nation. ""America only succeeds when we all pitch in and pull together -- and I'm counting on you to be leaders in that effort,"" said Obama. ""Because you are from Joplin. And you've already defied the odds."" Minutes after 450 seniors from the same Missouri school got their diplomas last May 22, a monster twister tore through the community. More than 161 people were killed -- the worst death toll for such a tornado since modern record-keeping began in 1950 -- while dozens of buildings were torn to shreds by winds as strong as 200 mph. One of them was Joplin High School itself, with the damage so severe that students ended up attending classes in a vacant section of the city's Northpark Mall. Joplin 'on the mend' one year later . Monday night's graduation ceremony was personal, with students reflecting with humor and perspective on their tumultuous school days and one administrator leading them in a chant to show their ""Eagle pride."" ""No matter where you are or what you do, your Joplin family loves you and believes in you,"" said school district Superintendent C.J. Huff, fighting back tears. ""We are so very proud of you."" Obama alluded to students' unique struggles during his own commencement address, which was held on the campus of Missouri Southern State University. He referred, too, to broader challenges facing they their townsfolk to work together, dream big and remain positive in adopting a new slogan of ""Remember. Rejoice. And rebuild."" ""We can define our own lives not by what happens to us, but by how we respond,"" said the president, who returned to Joplin for the first time since attending a memorial service a week after the disaster. ""We can choose to carry on, we can choose to make a difference in the world. And in doing so, we can make true what's written in scripture: that 'tribulation produces perseverance, and perseverance (produces) character, and character, hope.'"" After devastating tornado, Missouri hospital to be demolished . The story of Joplin also showed there are ""so many good people in this world,"" something that he insisted the students never forget. While Joplin has worked fast to rebuild, many of the hundreds of businesses destroyed by the tornado have not been able to get back to full speed. Some 332 households still live in Federal Emergency Management Agency trailers and are unable to rebuild their homes. But they've gotten some help. The White House released a statement Monday noting the federal government has approved $21 million for directly affected Missouri residents, not including $97 million to the state of Missouri to support rebuilding projects and $41.3 million in low-interest disaster loans via the U.S. Small Business Administration for individuals, businesses and non-profit groups. And the city of Joplin -- which is calling Tuesday's anniversary a Day of Unity, with events including a commemorative walk through the city -- estimates that almost 130,000 volunteers have logged hundreds of thousands of hours since the tornado. It was during his remarks about community and unity that Obama shifted from discussing Joplin more exclusively, to talking about the nation in general. ""We need God. We need each other. We are important to each other. And we're stronger together than we are on our own,"" he said. ""That's the spirit that's allowing all of you to rebuild this city. It's the same spirit we need right now to help rebuild America."" The Joplin High graduates are particularly qualified to do so, according to Obama. They have walked the walk -- by pitching in to assist their neighbors, pursuing their education despite the chaos around them and learning from other city citizens and total strangers about what people can do, against the odds, when they work together. ""Some of life's strongest bonds are the ones we forge when everything around us seems broken,"" the president said. ""And even though I expect some of you will ultimately end up leaving Joplin, I'm convinced that Joplin will never leave you.""","NEW: ""Your Joplin family loves you and believes in you,"" the superintendent says .

"(CNN) -- Qatar's government says it's investigating complaints that sprinklers and alarms weren't working during a fire at an upscale Doha shopping mall that killed 19 people, most of them children in a nursery. The fatalities at the Villaggio shopping mall included seven girls, six boys, four teachers, and two other adults, the Persian Gulf monarchy's interior ministry said Monday. Rescuers were unable to reach the nursery from the inside and had to break into it from the rooftop, Health Minister Abdullah bin Khalid Al Qahtani told the state news agency QNA. The government has set up a committee to investigate ""the causes and circumstances"" of the blaze, QNA announced Monday night. The agency quoted Brig. Gen. Othman al-Duhaimi, the operations chief for Qatar's civil defense agency, as saying alarms went off in some shops, and that some of the pipes that carried water for the sprinklers may have been leaking -- and that those issues would be addressed in the investigation. Christine Wigton, an American living in Doha, told CNN she heard ""a buzzer, not very loud"" as she walked into the mall, but heard no loud alarms as smoke built up inside. Elementary school-age children were eating at some of the restaurants and no one was trying to escape, she said. ""When I got a little bit closer, I realized the smoke was just increasing and people were still shopping. And the smoke kept getting heavier and heavier,"" Wigton said. She said she left when the smoke became ""too much."" ""There were no sprinklers, and there was nothing that would tell somebody that something was wrong,"" she said. Built in 2006, the mall advertises itself as ""the newest and the largest entertainment center in Doha."" The Venice-themed complex features gondola rides down an indoor canal, an artificial sky, a 13-screen movie theater, a theme park, skating rink and a bowling alley. Qatar's interior minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, said the civil defense office reviews safety standards for commercial buildings before they grant a license. ""The investigation will clarify all the circumstances of the incident and find out the shortcomings and question those who are responsible in order to tackle the matter in the future,"" he said in remarks carried by QNA. Along with the children and teachers, two would-be rescuers died in the blaze, Interior Minister Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani said in a statement posted on the ministry's Facebook page. Another 17 people were injured, including four children, but most of them were firefighters, he said. Several of the dead were from Qatar's expatriate community. Four were Spanish nationals, a spokeswoman for Spain's Foreign Ministry said Monday. A three-year-old French child died in the blaze, France's foreign affairs ministry said. And New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said it was ""likely"" that three of the dead were triplets, estimated at between two and three years of age, from ""a New Zealand family."" Key said a consular official based in the Saudi capital Riyadh would soon go to Qatar ""to support the family,"" while the children's grandparents were also heading there as well. ""Obviously, there are some very serious questions that will need to be answered,"" said Key, who did not identify the children or their parents. ""But at the moment, we're really just trying to wrap around all the support we can for a family that will be grieving."" Al Thani said everyone was believed to have been accounted for late Monday. CNN's Al Goodman and Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.","NEW: A French child is among the dead .

"(CNN) -- Spain became only the second team to reach three successive major tournament finals after winning a nail-biting penalty shootout against Portugal following a tense goalless draw in Donetsk on Wednesday. The 2010 World Cup and 2008 European champions followed West Germany into the history books as Cesc Fabregas fired the decisive penalty in off a post after Bruno Alves had hit the bar for Portugal. Bizarrely, Portugal's key man Cristiano Ronaldo never even got to take a spot kick as he was saved for Portugal's final penalty, a tactic that backfired horribly. In a game of few chances, Portugal worked hard to edge much of it but their pressing tactics started to backfire in extra-time as tiredness increasingly became a factor. Spain's patience looked to have paid off as they dominated extra-time against an increasingly desperate Portuguese side, but Paulo Bento's side performed heroics to hold on and force a shootout. Goalkeeper Rui Patricio was the central figure, saving spectacularly from Andres Inesta and Jesus Navas in extra time, then brilliantly pushing away Xabi Alonso's penalty as the shootout got under way. But Iker Casillas matched that stop by saving Joao Moutinho's spot-kick and Iniesta, Gerard Pique and Sergio Ramos, with a nerveless chip, all scored in a dramatic shootout. There was little sign of the drama to come early on as Portugal's tactics stifled the champions. Spain came into this Iberian clash as warm favorites, but it was Portugal who looked sharper in the first half. Bento's side hassled and harried from the start and generally looked the hungrier team but Spain, to their credit, remained patient and chances inevitably came their way, fullback Alvaro Arbeloa sidefooting over from the edge of the penalty area. With so much creative talent on the pitch it was remarkable that so few chances were created, but perhaps inevitably it was Ronaldo who had the bulk of them. The Real Madrid striker dipped a trademark free-kick narrowly over the bar as Portugal inched closer and seven minutes from time his effort from similar range was handled in the wall by Arbeloa, only for Ronaldo to fire over again from 10 yards closer in. When Spain were given the chance to threaten from a set-piece in injury-time, it looked as though the holders might have the final word. Instead, it was Portugal who threatened as Alonso's free-kick was cleared and played out by Nani to give Raul Meireles the chance to lead a counterattack. His final pass to Ronaldo was slack, though, and Ronaldo's golden chance of sealing a dramatic win instead saw him lash his shot into the stands. Incredibly, it was Ronaldo's 70th shot from outside the penalty area in major tournaments -- and none of them have resulted in a goal. It was a chance to kill off the previously lackluster Spanish and the timing would have been perfect. Instead, as extra-time progressed, Portugal's earlier pressing caught up with them as Spain's patience started to pay dividends. Jordi Alba pushed further forward and it was his excellent wing play that led to Iniesta being presented with a sidefoot chance from six yards out. Somehow, though, Patricio threw out an arm and diverted the goalbound effort around his post. It was a heroic piece of goalkeeping and Patricio also brilliantly kept out Navas in extra time, then Alonso from the spot before Portugal's resistance finally cracked -- with Ronaldo a frustrated spectator.","Spain become only second team to reach three successive major tournament finals .

"(CNN) -- It was two hours before Friday's concert, and already fans of Jason Aldean were tailgating in the gravel parking lot. Not surprising since Aldean's ""My Kinda Party"" tour has sold out in venues across the country, often in under a couple of hours. Last week, the singer's latest single, ""Fly Over States,"" hit the top of the charts, marking his ninth No. 1 overall and his fifth consecutive No. 1 from the ""My Kinda Party"" album. Aldean's sound is a little bit country and a little bit rock 'n' roll. Introspective songs such as ""Amarillo Sky"" and ""Don't You Wanna Stay"" have earned him big sales numbers, but concert fans clamor for his more upbeat numbers such as ""She's Country."" He's also not afraid to step outside his comfort zone -- ""Dirt Road Anthem"" was a collaboration with Ludacris that had Aldean rapping about jumping barbed wire and lighting bonfires. Still, it surprised more than few people in the audience Friday when Ludacris appeared onstage with Aldean during the encore to perform the hit song. While tour buddy Luke Bryan has an infectious eagerness on stage, Aldean rarely breaks his brooding stare. That doesn't change backstage as his tour manager brings him in. He's friendly, but no overly so. I get the impression that manners are as ingrained in this Georgia homeboy as deep as his music. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . CNN: This show in Atlanta sold out in minutes, so you had to add a second night. What does that tell you about your fans? Jason Aldean: Obviously that's a good sign. We've always made it a point to let fans know that when you come out to our shows, it's going to be fun. You're going to have a good time, and we encourage that -- probably a lot more than other people do. (laughs) But that's what you want. You know, people come to a show to kind of forget about whatever crappy week they had at work or school or whatever it was, and it's our job to make sure that that's what happens. CNN: What's the best thing about touring with Luke Bryan? Aldean: The best thing about touring with Luke is just the fact that he and I are legitimately friends away from the music business. I think that, unlike a lot of other artists in the business, you know, he and I actually pull for each other. We want to see each other succeed and do well. There's not a competition sort of thing there at all. He's one of my best friends. So obviously when he's out on stage and he's doing his thing and you see people going crazy, that's cool. It makes you feel good. And I think he's the same way. And like I said, I legitimately like hanging out with the guy. He's a lot of fun. We come from the same part of the country, we grew up about two hours apart from each other. So even though we didn't know each other until five or six years ago, we have a lot in common. CNN: Atlanta country radio has been touting Georgia as the new capital of country music thanks to artists like you, Jennifer Nettles, the Zac Brown Band and Lady Antebellum. Do you think Nashville can really be ousted? Aldean: I don't know if Nashville will ever be ousted as the Music City. But I also think that here, over the last few years, Georgia has definitely kind of risen to the top as far as the crop of young artists coming out of this area that are kind of making waves, you know? I think for long time it was artists from Texas, then it was artists from Oklahoma. Now it just seems like Georgia is kind of a hotbed for that kind of thing. And it's cool to be part of that fraternity a little bit. CNN: You're elected president of the United States. What's the first thing you do? Aldean: Well, first of all, I wouldn't want to be president. But if I was, the first thing I'd probably do is uh... hm. Let me think about this for a second. I'd probably do away with, try my best to do away with taxes (laughs). But I know every politician says they're going to do that, and they're all liars. But I would actually really try to do that. That would be beneficial to everybody. Or at least give a flat tax across the board -- everybody pays, you know whatever, 20%. CNN: Have to say I'm a bit disappointed -- I was hoping for a big country party. Aldean: Oh, I'd definitely turn the White House into a Redneck Riviera, for sure! There'd be deer heads hanging off the wall, in the Oval Office. It'd be cool. CNN: What do you always bring with you on tour? Aldean: I always bring my bow and arrow. I love to hunt so it's always under the bus. I like to just get out there in the day and just shoot, backstage somewhere, and just practice doing that. Never know when I might luck up and get an invite to go hunting somewhere too ... so I like to prepare for that. So I usually bring that and my golf clubs. CNN: Do you have a good golf score? Aldean: My golf score is really bad. I don't know. I'm definitely not a good golfer. Off the tee box, I can drive it about 275, and I'm in the fairway about 99% of the time. It's my next shot that needs work. CNN: If you had to survive on one meal for the rest of your life what would it be? Aldean: You know what, I'm a steak and potatoes guy. So it would be a thick filet, baked potato and maybe like something else really bad for you, like fried okra. I love fried okra. The fact that it's okra makes me feel like it's good for you -- I forget the fact that it's fried. CNN: It seems everybody these days -- singers, actors, etc. -- has a clothing line, a perfume, a jewelry brand. What are you doing to expand your empire? Aldean: We did a deal with Wrangler where we're kind of the face of their Wrangler retro line of clothing -- jeans, shirts. I got a hat deal with Resistol, where I have my own line of cowboy hats. Luke and I both actually are part owners in a company called Buck Commander, which is a hunting -- it's a show but we also have hunting products, clothes, that kind of stuff. CNN: And do feel that's important for you to do, or is it just something to do with your money? Aldean: I think it's important to do things that you're interested in. I think it's important to have other outlets away from the music industry. You know, for me that's what the hunting side of it is, just kind of a way for me to somewhat get away from the music side of it and have another outlet to kind of decompress. ... Things like that for me are kind of for sanity reasons I think more than anything else. And you know the other thing, with the clothes and that kind of thing -- I think when you wear the brand anyway, why not go out and try to promote it and make it as cool as you can? The fact that I can continue to do what I've always done and kind of become the face of that brand is to me, kind of just makes sense. It doesn't make sense not to do it I guess. CNN: What's left on your dream list? Aldean: There's still a lot of things I'd like to accomplish. There's still a lot of artists I'd like to work with. We're in talks right now of like possibly doing a movie so we're kind of dabbling in on the acting part of it. You know, I think a lot of times you just kind of wait and see what opportunities present themselves. My main focus was to be successful in the music business, which has always been my main focus, and I never really want to get away from that. But at the same time, I think it's cool to branch out and do some other things and see if it's something that you like. One day the music business, the music side of it goes away -- to have some other things that you've kind of dabbled in that you like... you can kind of maybe travel down that route for awhile. CNN: You're new album comes out in October. What should listeners expect to hear that's different? Aldean: When it comes to albums, I think it's important to never get away completely from what got you to this point, and obviously, what's worked for you. That said you don't want to go out and continue to make the same albums over and over -- that's going to be kind of boring too. So you know for me it was about going in and finding the best songs we could find and trying to put together a record that I felt like was you know, just as good if not better than the previous record. I think ""My Kinda Party,"" that album, was so successful, it's going to be really hard to compare any album to that one. Now [I'm] not saying that I don't hope this next record doesn't come out and blow the doors off of that one, but you can't really expect that. You've just kind of got to go in and make what you feel like is a great record and put it out there and hope people dig it.","Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan travel to Atlanta on ""My Kinda Party"" tour .

"(CNN) -- An 18-year-old man was arrested early Saturday in Finland over a shooting spree that left two people dead and eight wounded, police told CNN's Finnish affiliate MTV3. Regional chief inspector Timo Leppälä told the channel the police were alerted to a shooting incident in front of a restaurant on Uusimaa Street shortly before 2 a.m. local time. Officers responded within a minute and heard gunfire, Leppälä said. About four hours later, police got word that a man wearing camouflage clothing had been spotted near the center of the southern Finnish town of Hyvinkaa, Leppälä told MTV3. Police were able to take the man calmly into custody at 7:45 a.m. local time, he said. The suspect is a local man, Leppälä said, and a gun and other materials are now in the hands of police. Regional chief inspector Markku Tuominen told MTV3: ""It is possible that there are more people involved in the case."" He said the suspect did not have permission to have firearms. MTV3 initially reported one death, citing the police. Two of those wounded in the attack were in critical condition, a hospital official earlier told the channel. It is not clear if one of those victims died. No information was released about the motive for the shootings. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto expressed condolences to the family members of the victims.","NEW: The 18-year-old man is in police custody, regional chief inspector Timo Leppälä says .

"(CNN) -- While Fernando Alonso has overcome the shortcomings of his 2012 Ferrari to be an early title contender, the two-time world champion's teammate Felipe Massa is facing an uncertain future after a disappointing start to the Formula One season. Massa was again well off the pace at the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday, despite improvements to the vehicle which helped Alonso finish second and move level on points with championship leader Sebastian Vettel. The Brazilian suffered the embarrassment of being lapped by Alonso and Williams' race winner Pastor Maldonado, coming in 15th to leave him with just two points from the opening five rounds. Ferrari's team principal Stefano Domenicali publicly backed the under-performing 31-year-old in March, but Massa has now been told better results will be expected when the championship resumes in Monaco on May 27. ""Felipe was very unlucky, both in the race and in qualifying,"" read a statement on Ferrari's official website. ""But everyone, he more than anyone, is expecting a change of gear starting right away with the Monaco Grand Prix, his second home race, given that he lives just a few hundred meters from what, as from next Sunday, will be transformed into the paddock for the sixth round of the 2012 championship. "" Massa's most successful year in the elite division of motorsport was in 2008, when he was denied a first world championship crown by McLaren's Lewis Hamilton on the final corner of the final race. But the former Sauber driver has struggled to reach those heights since, partly due to a freak accident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix which left him with a fractured skull. His form has also spiraled since being told to let Alonso pass him while leading a race in Germany in 2010. The last time the first five races were won by five different drivers was in 1983, and Domenicali believes Ferrari can be true contenders despite a lack of early-season pace. ""It takes very little to change the hierarchy among the teams and this rule is even more true when the differences are just a few tenths or even hundredths,"" he said. ""This year, the winner will be whoever manages to bring the best technical updates to the track in the shortest time possible: staying still for just a handful of races could mean finishing out of the points, given that so many teams have proved capable of fighting for the top places. ""We achieved our goal of making a step forward in Spain, but we must continue down this path, especially as the gap to the time that gave Hamilton his pole position is still too big."" Meanwhile, F1 chiefs are still investigating the fire that cast a shadow over Williams' first grand prix victory since 2004 and the first race victory by a Venezuelan driver. The blaze in the British team's garage left seven people in hospital, but a statement released by Williams on Monday confirmed that all but one of those injured have now been released. ""One member of the team remains in hospital in Spain having suffered burns in the incident,"" read the statement. ""He is stable and will return to the UK within the next 48 hours to receive further medical care. ""His family are in constant communication and he is in good spirits. Investigations into the cause of the fire are ongoing in collaboration with the FIA and local authorities. ""The team would like to thank everyone for their good wishes and support over the past 24 hours."" Team principal Frank Williams thanked the other teams for their help and support following the incident. ""While the incident was unexpected and definitely most undesirable, it has demonstrated the genuine cohesiveness, camaraderie and spirit of co-operation that exists within the Formula One paddock,"" he said. ""The astonishing response from the teams and other paddock personnel was immediate, unconditional and overwhelming.""","Ferrari expect Felipe Massa's form to improve at the Monaco Grand Prix .

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Thousands of people are expected to march Tuesday in South Africa to protest a portrait of President Jacob Zuma that shows his genitals. Zuma's supporters in the ruling African National Congress say the portrait is insulting and call it an attack on both the president and his party. About 15,000 people are expected to participate in the march to Johannesburg's Goodman Gallery, where the work was on display, according to the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The painting by artist Brett Murray, called ""The Spear,"" is reminiscent of Soviet-era propaganda posters. Red on one half and black on the other, the painting shows Zuma in a proud stance with his genitals prominently exposed. Attorney weeps as he argues for censoring painting . The painting was defaced last week after a storm of protests and condemnation, the SABC reported. ""We believe all these actions by the gallery are not only a violation of the right to dignity of ... President Jacob Zuma but are a clear and calculated attack on the ANC,"" the party said on its website. ""We therefore again call on all South Africans, members and (supporters) of the ANC and our alliance partners to come and register their outrage at this insult and attack on our president and the ANC,"" it said. The Sunday newspaper City Press removed the image of the portrait from its website after the ANC threatened a boycott, but it complained Monday the ANC still wants the paper to apologize for running it in the first place. Democratic Alliance, the ANC's official opposition, said The Spear ""was brilliant as a work of political satire, which is also why it became an instant icon."" Calls for the painting's censorship, the party said, indicate a dangerous move away from the right to free speech. If he felt insulted, Zuma should have sued the artist rather than calling for the painting's removal, the Democratic Alliance said.","The portrait shows President Jacob Zuma with his genitals exposed .

"(CNN) -- Two-time Formula One champion Fernando Alonso set his sights on a title charge in 2012 Friday as Ferrari unveiled the radical design of their car for the new season. The F2012, Ferrari's 58th F1 car, features a dramatic steeped-nose look in order to conform to new regulations regarding the height of the front chassis. Spain's Alonso finished 2011 fourth in the drivers' standings, 135 points behind Red Bull's double world champion Sebastian Vettel, after claiming just one race win at the British Grand Prix. ""It looks very different from what we have seen in the last two years,"" Alonso said at the launch, which was originally scheduled to take place Thursday but was pushed back 24 hours due to heavy snowfall. Can Senna restore the romance to Formula One? ""My third season at Ferrari and I am going to start with the same strength and determination. I want to do great. ""Of course it will be quite competitive for the whole season, but we want to see red cars on the podium. We start next week in Jerez and we keep working together. I am sure we will do well this year."" Ferrari have won a record 16 constructors' titles and the Italian marque have clinched 15 drivers' championships -- more than any other team. But a disappointing campaign last year saw them finish third in the standings, 122 points adrift of McLaren and a massive 275 points behind double constructors' championship winners Red Bull. ""I believe in the skills we have here in Ferrari,"" former McLaren driver Alonso said. We have two months to get ready before the first competition. New car gives McLaren confidence . ""We have to fight for the title and try and get as many points as possible. We really want to be right at the top of the ranking. ""We have to be as consistent and resolute as possible and I am sure, really, really sure we will be able to get great targets and great responsibility for driving for Ferrari."" Alonso's teammate Felipe Massa also endured a frustrating season, but the Brazilian is confident the new car can fire Ferrari to success. ""Let me tell you that it looks really, really aggressive,"" said Massa. ""This was part of my dreams. I know there was quite a lot of brainstorming when it comes to the new car. ""We always wanted to develop new models so I am impressed with the new car. We start in a few days and I am sure the championship will be stunning and very competitive."" Ferrari were not the only team showing off their new car Friday. Silverstone-based Force India had drivers Paul di Resta and Nico Hulkenberg on hand to reveal the VJM05. Britain's Di Resta, the cousin of IndyCar legend Dario Franchitti, enjoyed a successful rookie season with the Indian-owned team, collecting 27 points to finish 13th in the drivers' championship. ""Seeing the new car built and complete for the first time is always an exciting moment,"" the 25-year-old said. ""I've had a good winter and I've recharged my batteries, but now I'm fully focused on 2012 and looking forward to the start of testing. ""There's a really positive feeling in the team, good stability and hopefully we can pick up where we left off at the end of last year."" German driver Nico Hulkenberg has taken the place of compatriot Adrian Sutil, who was handed an 18-month suspended jail sentence earlier this week for injuring Eric Lux -- the chief executive of Lotus' parent company Genii Capital. ""Preparations for the new season have been full-on with simulator sessions and lots of fitness training,"" said Hulkenberg, who last raced for Williams in 2010. ""I feel ready to get back to racing and I'm excited to find out what the new car feels like next week."" Elsewhere, veteran Indian driver Narain Karthikeyan has returned to Spanish team HRT. The 35-year-old's recruitment means all 24 places on the grid for the 2012 season have now been filled. Karthikeyan took part in the first eight races of 2011 with the Madrid-based team before making way for young Red Bull prospect Daniel Ricciardo. He last raced at the inaugural Indian Grand Prix in October. ""It has taken a lot of hard work to make this happen but I am absolutely elated to feature on the 2012 grid with HRT F1 team,"" the former NASCAR racer said. ""I was pleased with our strong performance at the Indian Grand Prix, in front of my passionate home fans and I look forward to building on this result in 2012. ""I have been training hard since the end of 2011, ensuring I was ready for the rigors of F1 if an opportunity arose.""

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- France's new president, François Hollande, reaffirmed Friday during a visit to Kabul that France will withdraw 2,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2012. He spoke after meeting with French troops stationed there and holding talks with the country's president, Hamid Karzai. Giving a joint news conference with Karzai, Hollande said he had come to tell French troops that ""their task has come to an end in Afghanistan."" But he also stressed France's ongoing cooperation with Afghanistan, saying he and Karzai had discussed details of their nations' strategic partnership agreement. ""After 10 years of European military engagement in Afghanistan, now Afghan security forces are taking the responsibility of their own security, and it is time for us to leave,"" Hollande said. ""But our cooperation and relationship will not end. In January this year, Afghanistan and France signed the strategic partnership agreement, and based on that, we will be increasing our assistance in other fields. ""After the end of this year, our military trainers and mentors will remain to help Afghan security forces. As President Karzai emphasized, we will be focusing on the health sector, education, civil services, agriculture sector, energy and water and many more. We will also be helping in the economic sector."" Karzai praised France as a longstanding ally of his country. ""France has been our friend for a long time now -- we have relations for the past at least 150 years. They helped us before jihad, during jihad and after jihad,"" he said. This visit follows Hollande's announcement at the NATO conference in Chicago that French combat troops would withdraw from Afghanistan by the end of the year. As part of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, French trainers will remain in the country longer. NATO countries are trying to figure out how to meet a 2014 deadline to withdraw from an unpopular war in Afghanistan while shoring up that nation's security forces. Some nations have already pulled out troops. The Netherlands, which had nearly 2,000 troops in Afghanistan at the peak of its commitment, became the first NATO ally to withdraw its combat troops two years ago. Canada, which once headed the ISAF mission, pulled out almost all of its 3,000 soldiers at the end of 2011. Norway also withdrew almost all of its 500 troops during this period. Hollande, who took office this month, visited French troops at the Nijrab forward operating base in the northeastern province of Kapisa, his office said in a statement. He ""paid tribute to the 83 French soldiers killed carrying out their mission"" in Afghanistan, the statement said, as well as the wounded and the families of the victims. Hollande was accompanied by Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian. Hollande's trip to Afghanistan takes place in the same month as President Barack Obama's visit to the country on the anniversary of the killing of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden.

"(CNN) -- Nicole came to the United States from Indonesia on a temporary fiancÃ©e visa, fully expecting that she would enjoy life in a new country with the U.S. citizen she intended to marry. Instead, she found herself trapped as a victim of sex trafficking. Nicole (not her real name), like thousands of other women, was forced to engage in commercial sex acts against her will. We heard about her when she received support from the Salvation Army STOP-IT Program in Illinois, which serves victims who have been harmed by the sex trade. (The Salvation Army is a denominational member of the National Association of Evangelicals.) Eventually, Nicole escaped from her trafficker and assisted law enforcement in the prosecution of the crime committed against her. Though Nicole's fiancÃ©e visa had lapsed, leaving her susceptible to deportation, our nation's anti-trafficking law provided a legal option for her to be granted permanent legal status by helping law enforcement to prosecute her trafficker. With the help of a nonprofit legal service provider and the Salvation Army, Nicole was able to petition on her own for legal status -- and obtain it -- through a special ""U"" visa for immigrant victims of crime, allowing her to get back on her feet and begin rebuilding her life. This week the House of Representatives is considering a proposal to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, first enacted in 1994, but in a new version that would significantly undermine the same U visa program that provided Nicole with safety and permanency in the United States. The U.S. government estimates that as many as 17,500 foreign-born victims are illegally trafficked in from abroad each year, and academic estimates suggest that at least 100,000 victims of human trafficking live in the United States today. By force, fraud or coercion, traffickers keep victims enslaved in prostitution or forced labor. If the House proposal is enacted, thousands like Nicole could remain enslaved, too afraid to speak out because some of their most effective safeguards will have disappeared. The proposal., introduced by Rep. Sandy Adams, R-Florida, would dramatically roll back important protections for battered immigrant women and their children. It could face a vote Wednesday afternoon. Several provisions would leave immigrant victims of human trafficking and domestic abuse no legal way to break the cycle of violence in which they are trapped. Specifically, this version would remove the incentive of permanent safe haven in the United States for women who help bring abusers to justice. By changing the U visa from permanent to temporary, the bill could validate an abuser's threat that a call to police could result in deportation. Many women would keep quiet rather than risk immigration consequences. The bill would also allow abusive partners in domestic violence cases to provide input as to whether their victim should qualify for immigration relief, stripping confidentiality provisions that currently protect victims. Abusive spouses, who are in a position to petition to adjust the status of their immigrant wives through marriage, can choose not to do so as a tool of abuse and fear. Abusers frequently deny guilt and falsely accuse victims of fraud or abuse. We don't want a bill that endangers some of the women and children it purports to help. Overall, this bill's proposed changes to current law would discourage immigrant victims from escaping abuse and reporting crimes, and make all of us less safe. Women -- and, often, their children -- come to our churches for sanctuary and hope. We believe Adams' proposal would put more lives in danger. It would perpetuate abusers' use of immigration status as part of the cycle of exploitation. As evangelical Christians, we are committed to Jesus' great commandment to love God and to love our neighbor, with a particular concern for those who are most vulnerable. Through local churches and ministries, we extend that love when we provide counseling and support for victims of human trafficking and domestic violence. In doing so, we point to the ultimate healing and restoration that we believe is found only in Jesus. We also love our neighbor by speaking up when laws are proposed that could cause harm, intentionally or not. Loving our neighbor not only means reaching out to those in need, but also means addressing systemic problems that harm those in need. That's why we're asking Speaker John Boehner and the House leadership to make sure that the Violence Against Women Act continues to protect vulnerable immigrant women who are victims of human trafficking or domestic violence. They need our protection. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Leith Anderson and Lynne Hybels.","Leith Anderson, Lynn Hybels: House mulling new version of Violence Against Women Act .

"(CNN) -- An Interpol investigation into social networking groups exchanging child abuse material has targeted 55 key suspects in 20 countries, including the United States, and 12 children have been identified and removed from harm, the agency said Tuesday. An unspecified number of the suspects have been arrested, said Interpol, the world's largest international police organization. The international operation, which targeted child sexual abusers trading online images, identified suspects in 19 other countries: Australia, Bosnia, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, England, Finland, France, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, The Netherlands, Tunisia, Turkey, and Venezuela, Interpol said. The covert online investigation began in October 2010 in New Zealand, where authorities alerted Interpol's crimes against children team after discovering Facebook, Socialgo and grou.ps were being used to exchange significant amounts of ""abusive and exploitative pictures,"" Interpol said in a statement. Working with U.S. authorities, the Interpol inquiry found about 80 groups ""engaged in the display or distribution of previously seen and unseen child sexual abuse images,"" Interpol said. Facebook officials assisted the investigation after authorities identified key targets and their associated groups, Interpol said. Maarten Quivooy, general manager of New Zealand's Regulatory Compliance Operations, said the Internet destroys jurisdictional boundaries and that protecting children is now a global responsibility. ""Trading in or viewing these images is ... offending because it involves real children often being abused both in real time and over time, and when these images of children being sexually abused are released onto the Internet, they live on forever,"" Quivooy said in a statement. ""Terms such as kiddiporn and child pornography make the physical sexual abuse of a child appear consenting. No child is capable of consenting to sexual activity â€” therefore all sexual depiction of children is abuse,"" he said. Mick Moran, the head of Interpol's crimes against children unit, said the operation highlighted international cooperation. ""While disrupting these networks is a significant part of the investigation, what is more important is that innocent children and in some cases babies have been rescued from physical abuse,"" Moran said in a statement. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton said his agency will ""work tirelessly with our international law enforcement partners to protect children wherever they live and to bring justice to criminals wherever they operate."" The 55 suspects allegedly created groups that posted images of children under age 13 being abused, Interpol said.

"(CNN) -- Soccer star Fabrice Muamba, who suffered a cardiac arrest on the field playing for Bolton Wanderers on Saturday, is able to breathe without a ventilator and respond to questions, according to the hospital treating him. The 23-year-old collapsed at Tottenham Hotspur's White Hart Lane stadium in London during an English FA Cup quarterfinal game and was treated by paramedics on the pitch. He was subsequently taken to the London Chest Hospital where he has been in a critical condition since Saturday evening. But a joint statement released by the hospital and Bolton on Monday evening said Muamba's condition had marginally improved. Soccer star Muamba still 'critical' after on-pitch collapse . It read: ""Fabrice Muamba is continuing to show signs of improvement this evening. ""He is currently able to breathe independently without the aid of a ventilator. He has also been able to recognize family members and respond to questions appropriately. ""These are all positive signs of progress. However, his condition remains serious and the medical staff in intensive care will continue to monitor and treat him."" Muamba was born in Zaire but was brought up in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He moved to England when he was 11. He represented England at under-21 level and has played for English Premier League side Arsenal, as well as Birmingham City, before moving to Bolton in 2008 for a fee of Â£5 million ($8 million). He collapsed after 41 minutes of the last eight tie against Tottenham, with players from both sides urging medical assistance straight away. Fears for stricken soccer player Muamba's recovery . Stunned supporters looked on as he was treated on the field while reports in the UK press claimed it took two hours for Muamba's heart to start beating normally again. Referee Howard Webb abandoned the match after consultation with players and managers from both sides. Bolton's Premier League game with Aston Villa, scheduled for Tuesday, has also been called off. Muamba's manager Owen Coyle has regularly visited the hospital where he is being treated, as have players from Bolton and other Premier League clubs. Spanish club Real Madrid carried shirts that read ""Get well soon Muamba"" before their draw with Malaga on Sunday, and Coyle said the player's family were grateful for all the support they had received from around the globe. ""The message is the good will, the prayers from everybody, they are so thankful and they want to put that on record -- to say 'keep up the prayers, thanks for all the support,' "" the Scot told reporters. ""They have been inundated as we all have, both in the football community globally and family and friends. People are taking a genuine interest and a real concern with how Fabrice is doing. ""It's a difficult situation but the family are bearing up as well as they can. They themselves are very positive people. Players pray for Muamba's recovery . ""You look at what Fabrice has been through in life already and you can tell that he is a fighter. He has such a fantastic smile and that's what we all want to see again."" Muamba's wife Shauna took to Twitter on Monday to say: ""All your prayers are working people thank u so so much. Every prayer makes him stronger. "" There have been other cases of players collapsing during soccer matches. Motherwell's Phil O'Donnell suffered heart failure during a 2007 game against Scottish rivals Dundee United and died on the way to hospital. The most high-profile tragedy of this kind came when Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed during a Confederations Cup semifinal against Colombia in 2003 and died in hospital. There have been two similar incidents more recently in Spain, involving Sevilla's Antonio Puerta in 2007 and Espanyol's Daniel Jarque in 2009.","Soccer star Fabrice Muamba showing signs of improvement after cardiac arrest .

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Now that the company has a phone, Sony can finally answer opportunity's calls. The Japanese tech company's latest revival efforts are partly hinged on selling customers every type of gadget, all seamlessly integrated. But without a cellular phone division to call its own until recently, Sony was missing the one electronics product that people tend to carry with them most often. Now, a newly acquired division called Sony Mobile Communications is tasked with building smartphones that align with its parent company's strategies and plays well with other types of Sony gadgets. Phones are not only central to how people stay connected. They can also link disparate devices together, by synchronizing over the Internet or acting as a remote control. Sony's Music Unlimited and Video Unlimited services, which offer streaming music and video downloads, are expected to find their way into every Internet-connected gizmo Sony makes, executives said. The PlayStation Network will let users play the same games on their phones and tablets, they said. All of these services will be part of Sony Network, and users will only need to remember one login name and password. Sony Mobile developers are working on a feature that will let people flick a video on their Sony phone's screen to be played instantly on a Sony television set, Sony Mobile head Bert Nordberg said in an interview. This ability is already built into Sony's Tablet S, which, like Sony's phones, runs Google's Android operating system. 'The same elements' as Apple . Sony engineers companywide will be required to work with the new Integrated UX Group, Kazuo Hirai, Sony's executive deputy president, said at a meeting with reporters last week. (UX is an abbreviation for ""user experience,"" meaning how people interact with the products.) Sony Mobile contributed some engineers to the group, Nordberg said. ""I think this is crucial,"" he said of the integration group. The new committee appears to strive for the way Apple runs its businesses. It's not unusual for Apple engineers to work on phone software and then shift to the tablet and then to the Mac. Steve Jobs, the late Apple co-founder, described his company as the world's largest start-up. ""We have the same elements that Steve (Jobs) was talking about,"" Sony CEO Howard Stringer said at the meeting with Hirai and reporters last week. ""We have far more products than anyone else."" The new Sony initiative that prompted the company to purchase a phone manufacturer is called ""the four-screen strategy."" (Sony also has a ""lens to the living room"" strategy, which describes its offerings of video production and consumption tools. Sony apparently likes for its corporate policies to have cute names.) The four pillars of Sony's attack plan are computers, tablets, televisions and phones. Sony has had the first three. The Japanese company entered the tablet market in September, around the time when many other electronics piled in with hopes to challenge Apple's iPad. The decline of Sony Ericsson . Sony's status in phones was complicated. It had a joint venture with Ericsson that had been slowly sinking since the iPhone launched in 2007 and reconfigured the concept of a smartphone. Last year, Sony Ericsson was finally able to build some buzz, especially in the United States, where its market share is practically nonexistent. The Xperia Play was the first PlayStation phone, which had a slide-out controller and let players download classic console games. The Xperia Play didn't turn out to have the impact it promised, and it wasn't a huge hit, despite being available on the two largest U.S. carriers, Verizon Wireless and AT&T. When asked about Sony Ericsson last week, Steve Elfman, Sprint network operations president, said, ""I wouldn't consider them a major hardware company."" The key opportunity for Sony was when the mobile venture posted yet another dismal financial quarter in October, and Ericsson was finally ready to sell. Less than two weeks later, Sony announced that it was purchasing Ericsson's share in the company. Sony Ericsson is not the only cell phone manufacturer to get scooped up by a technology giant last year. Google announced plans to acquire Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion in August. But it was unusual for an electronics Goliath such as Sony not to be fully invested in the mobile industry. And it was perhaps unrealistic for Sony Ericsson to try to float at arm's length from its parents. Without being a part of a larger entity, the joint venture had little hope, said Nordberg, the Sony Mobile head. ""My view since I joined 2 1/2 years ago is that it's always been a Sony company,"" Nordberg said. ""It's very hard, I think, to survive as a mobile hardware-only company."" 'U.S.-first strategy' After the adoption, Sony Mobile is focusing its efforts on the United States. In other words, it has instituted a ""U.S.-first strategy,"" Nordberg said. ""The U.S. has taken back the lead in the mobile industry,"" he said, citing deployment of fourth-generation network technology. ""It's the first LTE country."" Sony announced last week at the International Consumer Electronics Show that the Xperia Ion will debut first in the United States. AT&T Mobility CEO Ralph de la Vega showed the product at his news conference. Relations between the carrier and Sony have improved greatly, AT&T executive Glenn Lurie said in an interview. ""They're making it easier to do business with Sony,"" Lurie said. However, AT&T spent more time at the CES event talking about competitors' phones, and de la Vega practically hugged Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who was there to promote Windows phones. The Xperia Ion will be Sony's flagship phone for the time being, but it is still a Sony Ericsson product, Nordberg said, even though it doesn't have Ericsson's name on it. The first true Sony phone is expected to debut later this year, he said. ""Next year, I'll be up there hugging Ralph,"" Nordberg said with a laugh.","Sony bought Ericsson's stake in their joint venture last year .

"(CNN) -- With seven consecutive titles under his belt, there's no denying Rafael Nadal's title as the 'King of Monte Carlo.' The world number No. 2 has won the Monte Carlo Masters every year since 2005. But he better watch out because World No. 1 Novak Djokovic is gearing up to topple him. The Serb admitted he'll have a battle on his hands beating the reigning champ, but said he felt confident on the clay following his win at the Miami Masters last month. ""We've played already here finals in 2009, good match, but Nadal is the ultimate challenge on clay. He's the king of clay. He's the best tennis player ever to play on this surface and one of the best tennis players ever, so that says enough."" Djokovic said on Monday. But he added that he ""feels good"" about competing on clay for the first time since his defeat to Roger Federer in the semifinals at the Paris Open last year. ""It is the surface I grew up on. In Serbia, up to last couple of years, we only had red clay. I do feel comfortable, I like to slide, and clay allows me to slide. I had a great season on clay last year so I hope to continue this year,"" he said. Djokovic has reason to be confident. Nadal's triumph last year in Monte Carlo came in his absence (due to a knee injury) and in the next two clay-court tournaments -- in Madrid and then Rome -- the Spaniard suffered straight-sets losses to the Serb in the final. ""Obviously, knowing in 2011 I won Rome and Madrid and winning against Rafa in finals back-to-back gives me a lot of confidence for coming into the clay-court season now,"" he said. However, in their long on-court rivalry, Nadal still leads 16-14 in career clashes with Djokovic, despite losing the last seven of their meetings. Djokovic is now aiming to become the first player to win back-to-back ATP Masters 1000 titles in Miami and Monte Carlo, saying he is well prepared for the transition from hard to clay courts. ""I know how to recover well, to be ready, and I've been working hard in my off season and [the week] that I had off after Miami to prepare for clay because clay requires physically much more from a tennis player than other surfaces,"" he said. ""It's a slower surface, your endurance needs to be on a high level. You need to by physically strong to expect long matches and long rallies."" The world's top-ranked tennis stars revealed last week they would also be going head-to-head in a special match for charity at Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium on July 14. World No. 1 Djokovic and his predecessor Nadal hope to draw 80,000 fans -- which would smash the previous record set by Belgian Kim Clijsters and fellow former world No. 1 American Serena Williams in Brussels. The Spanish football club's pitch will be transformed into a tennis court, with the event taking place in the gap between Wimbledon and the London Olympics.","Seven-times Monte Carlo Masters champ Rafael Nadal will be the man to beat .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian subsidiary of a U.S.-based multinational firm pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to illegally sending software to China, which it used in the development of its first advanced attack helicopter, according to the U.S. attorney in Connecticut. Pratt & Whitney Canada -- a subsidiary of Hartford, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corporation -- pleaded guilty to violating the Arms Export Control Act. In a case going back more than a decade, the firm admitted it sold software that was used in the development and testing of the new Z-10 helicopter for China's army. UTC, Pratt & Whitney Canada and another UTC subsidiary -- Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation -- agreed to pay more than $75 million as part of a settlement with the U.S. government because of the arms export violations and for making false statements, according to a statement from U.S. Attorney David B. Fein and other federal officials. The firms are expected to pay $20.7 million to the Justice Department and another $55 million to the State Department ""to resolve outstanding export issues, including those related to the Z-10,"" court documents said. ""This prosecution is one of the largest resolutions of export violations with a major defense contractor in the Justice Department's history,"" Fein said. Federal officials blasted the firm, saying the case ""is a clear example of how the illegal export of sensitive technology reduces the advantages our military currently possesses."" ""American military prowess depends on lawful, controlled exports of sensitive technology by U.S. industries and their subsidiaries,"" added John Morton, director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). According to court documents, an internal e-mail from a senior manager in September 2001 suggested that officials at Pratt & Whitney Canada knew the sales could violate U.S. sanctions. ""We must be very careful that the helicopter programs we are doing with the Chinese are not presented or viewed as military programs,"" the manager's e-mail read, according to the documents. ""As a result of these sanctions, we need to be very careful with the Z10C program. If the first flight will be with a gun ship then we could have problems with the US government."" The contractor was allegedly trying to outflank its European rivals and develop a foothold in the lucrative Chinese civil helicopter market, thought to be worth up to $2 billion in the coming years, the documents added. An internal briefing from September 2002 noted that ""China's civil helicopter market potential is large (estimated at close to 20,000 aircraft by some)."" Chinese officials allegedly ""made it clear that if (Pratt & Whitney Canada) wanted to have its engines considered for the yet-to-be-developed civil version, it would have to provide its engines ... with the understanding that the initial application ... would be military,"" the documents added. But the firm allegedly ""turned a blind eye to the attack helicopter application and went along with the 'sudden appearance' of a parallel civil program."" United Technologies says it accepted responsibility ""for these past violations and we deeply regret they occurred,"" noting that it has ""invested more than $30 million since 2006 to strengthen its compliance infrastructure."" ""Export controls are an integral part of safeguarding U.S. national security and foreign policy interests,"" said CEO Louis Chenevert. ""As a supplier of controlled products and technologies to the Department of Defense and other domestic and international customers, we are committed to conducting business in full compliance with all export laws and regulations."" The United States has imposed sanctions on the sale of military technology to China since 1989, after pro-democracy protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square were crushed in a bloody Chinese crackdown. Congress strengthened sanctions less than a year later, specifically naming helicopters and helicopter parts in the ban. The Z-10 helicopter is in production and started being used by China's armed forces in 2009, according to the Justice Department. It is capable of being equipped with 30 mm cannons, anti-tank and air-to-air missiles, and is primarily intended as an anti-armor attack craft, according to federal officials. Christopher K. Johnson, a senior adviser at the Center for International and Strategic Studies, said the case ""highlights our issues with defense cooperation and competition with China."" ""This is just another signal that those issues and tensions are unlikely to go anywhere,"" he said. CNN's Leigh Remizowski contributed to this report.","Military technology was illegally sold to China by an American multinational firm .

"Chicago (CNN) -- Two suspects who appeared in court in Cook County, Illinois, on Sunday are not believed to be part of an alleged terror plot in Chicago during the NATO summit, prosecutors said Sunday. Instead, charges against the two arose from ""related investigations,"" authorities said. Three men had previously been charged in the NATO plot, with authorities saying they planned to target President Barack Obama's campaign headquarters, the home of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and several other law enforcement and financial sites. On Sunday, the Cook County State's Attorney's Office said it had ""approved charges against two additional individuals in connection with the ongoing NATO investigation."" Obama, Karzai meet at NATO summit . Sebastian Senakiewicz, 24, of Chicago, is charged with falsely making a terrorist threat, prosecutors said in a statement. Mark Neiweem, 28, also believed to be from Chicago, is charged with attempted possession of explosives or incendiary devices. But prosecutors later clarified, ""While the cases that were charged in court today arose from related investigations, the two defendants are not charged with any involvement in the terrorist case from yesterday, and today's cases are separate matters. The two defendants (Senakiewicz and Neiweem) ... each face their own charges arising from separate incidents."" The two appeared in court Sunday. Bond was set at $750,000 for Senakiewicz and $500,000 for Neiweem, and both men are set to next appear in Cook County Circuit Court on Wednesday. It was not immediately known whether the two had attorneys. Court documents allege Senakiewicz, a native of Poland, told associates he had made two homemade explosive devices that could ""blow up half of an overpass for a train"" and was planning to use them during the summit. He said last week that they were stored in a Chicago home in a hollowed-out ""Harry Potter"" book, the documents said. He also claimed to possess a vehicle ""filled with explosives and weapons,"" according to the documents. However, a search warrant found no explosives, and Senakiewicz told investigators that while he had made the statements, he did not actually possess a bomb, the court documents said. Meanwhile, Neiweem allegedly told an associate that he wanted to obtain materials to make a pipe bomb, and that if the associate got the items, he would create it, according to court documents. The three men charged in the NATO plot were identified as Brian Church, 22, of Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Jared Chase, 27, of Keene, New Hampshire; and Brent Betterly, 24, who told police he resides in Massachusetts, authorities said. An Illinois judge set bail at $1.5 million for each. The three were charged with material support for terrorism, conspiracy to commit terrorism, and possession of explosives or incendiary devices, authorities said. The three men were arrested Wednesday, and charges were announced Saturday, according to authorities. A lawyer representing the three has called the accusations against them ""propaganda"" and said authorities ""infiltrated"" a peaceful group and set the men up. A police probe that began early this month revealed the three suspects are ""self-proclaimed anarchists"" and members of the ""Black Bloc"" group who traveled together from Florida to Chicago to commit violence as a protest against the NATO summit, authorities said in a statement. ""Black Bloc"" was the group blamed for violence that occurred in recent ""Occupy"" protests, such as in Rome last year when anarchists in ski masks torched cars and clashed with police and even other Occupy protesters. iReport: Police van drives through crowd . Senakiewicz also claimed to be a member of the ""Black Bloc,"" court documents said, as well as ""an anarchist who is upset with the lack of chaos in Chicago."" The three men were planning to destroy police cars and attack four Chicago police district stations with destructive devices as a way to undermine police response to other planned actions at the NATO summit, according to a statement by Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez and Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy. Downtown Chicago financial institutions were also among the proposed targets, authorities said. ""The individuals that we have charged in this investigation are not peaceful protesters. They are domestic terrorists who came to Chicago with an anarchist agenda to harm our police officers, intimidate our citizens and to attack their politically motivated targets,"" said Alvarez. iReport: Protesters march through the streets of Chicago . According to authorities, Church said he wanted to recruit four groups of four co-conspirators -- or 16 people -- and that reconnaissance had already been done on the Chicago Police Department headquarters. The three men also possessed or built improvised explosive or incendiary devices, a mortar gun, swords, a hunting bow, throwing stars, and knives with brass-knuckle handles, authorities said. In court, prosecutors accused the three men of preparing for ""violence and destruction,"" such as stockpiling Molotov cocktails. A couple dozen of their supporters in the courtroom could be heard faintly scoffing at prosecutor Matthew Thrun, as he called the defendants ""self-proclaimed anarchists ... making preparations for violence and destruction."" Thrun said one of the defendants could be heard planning an attack and quoted him as saying, ""This city does not know what it is in for, and it will never be the same."" According to Thrun, the defendants bought gasoline at a BP station, cut bandanas for fuses and had four empty beer bottles to be used as Molotov cocktails. Thrun told the court that Church made a remark while assembling the Molotov cocktails: ""Ever seen a cop on fire?"" Defense attorney Michael Deutsch accused authorities of ""police misconduct,"" saying undercover agents infiltrated a ""peaceful"" group. ""They even bought the makings of Molotov cocktails and gave it to them,"" Deutsch said in court. Outside of court, he called the case a setup and an example of ""entrapment to the highest degree."" ""It is sensationalism by the police and the state to discredit the protesters that have come here to nonviolently protest,"" the attorney said. The National Lawyers Guild, representing the three defendants, said Chicago police arrested a total of nine activists Wednesday at a house in Chicago's Bridgeport neighborhood and then released six of them. The guild described the three defendants as ""Occupy activists"" and said police provided no evidence of criminal intent or wrongdoing. ""It's outrageous for the city to apply terrorism charges when it's the police who have been terrorizing activists and threatening their right to protest,"" attorney Sarah Gelsomino with the lawyers guild and the People's Law Office, said in a statement.

"(CNN) -- As Qatari officials continue their investigation into whether sprinklers and alarms were working during a fire at an upscale shopping mall in Doha, more information surfaced Tuesday about the nationalities of those who perished in the fire. In all, the fire at the Villaggio shopping mall Monday killed 19 people, most of them at a child care center inside that rescuers had to break into from the rooftop. The victims were seven girls, six boys, four teachers, and two would-be rescuers, Qatari officials said. Most of the victims were expatriates: four Spanish nationals; a set of triplets from New Zealand; South African child and teacher; and a 3-year-old French child, according to the foreign ministries of the respective nations. The nationalities of the remaining nine is still unknown. Seventeen others were injured, including firefighters and four children. State news agency QNA agency quoted Brig. Gen. Othman al-Duhaimi, the operations chief for Qatar's civil defense agency, as saying alarms went off in some shops, and that some of the pipes that carried water for the sprinklers may have been leaking -- and that those issues would be addressed in the investigation. Mall fire: ""Accident waiting to happen?"" Christine Wigton, an American living in Doha, told CNN she heard ""a buzzer, not very loud"" as she walked into the mall, but heard no loud alarms as smoke built up inside. Elementary school-age children were eating at some of the restaurants and no one was trying to escape, she said. ""When I got a little bit closer, I realized the smoke was just increasing and people were still shopping. And the smoke kept getting heavier and heavier,"" Wigton said. She said she left when the smoke became ""too much."" ""There were no sprinklers, and there was nothing that would tell somebody that something was wrong,"" she said. Built in 2006, the mall advertises itself as ""the newest and the largest entertainment center in Doha."" The Venice-themed complex features gondola rides down an indoor canal, an artificial sky, a 13-screen movie theater, a theme park, skating rink and a bowling alley. Qatar's interior minister, Sheikh Abdullah Bin Nasser Bin Khalifa Al Thani, said the civil defense office reviews safety standards for commercial buildings before they grant a license. ""The investigation will clarify all the circumstances of the incident and find out the shortcomings and question those who are responsible in order to tackle the matter in the future,"" he said in remarks carried by QNA.

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Authorities in Argentina's Tierra del Fuego province denied entry Monday to two cruise liners that were seeking to dock in the southern port of Ushuaia, in incidents linked to the political dispute over the Falkland Islands. The government was applying a provincial law barring ships traveling under British colony flags from docking at the port, said the state-run Telam news agency. Both ships were registered in Bermuda, a British territory. One of the ships -- the Star Princess -- departed Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on February 18 on a 14-night South America cruise. ""Because the ship had previously called at Stanley, it was denied entry to Ushuaia,"" said Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Carnival Corp. She was referring to the port city in the Falkland Islands, which are referred to in Argentina as Las Malvinas. ""We are extremely disappointed about this alteration of the cruise itinerary, and are refunding the cost of shore excursions purchased by our passengers,"" she said in an e-mail. The ship is continuing to its next scheduled port of call, Punta Arenas, Chile. The 289-meter (nearly 950-foot) luxury liner, which has a capacity of 2,600 passengers, had docked in Ushuaia several times in recent years, she said. The P&O cruise liner Adonia, which is on a South American tour from Southampton, England, with an almost entirely British contingent of passengers, got a similar reception on Monday. The ship ""was this morning refused permission for its scheduled docking in the Argentinian port of Ushuaia by the local mayor on the grounds that it had visited the Falklands Islands two days before,"" said CNN contributor Robin Oakley, who was aboard the Adonis as a lecturer. Both P&O Cruises and Princess Cruises are Carnival Corporation cruise brands. The law cited was passed last August and refers to ships that carry out ""work related to the exploration and exploitation of natural resources, or to military vessels, within the ambit of the basin of the Malvinas Islands on the Argentinean continental platform,"" Telam reported. The head of the province's port authority, Alejandro Berola, said that the decision to turn away the ships was made following ""express instructions"" from Gov. Fabiana Rios, the news agency said. Ship authorities were informed of the decision Monday morning as they sailed through the Beagle Canal in front of the Chilean city of Port Williams. Last month, the Star Princess was denied entry into the Port of Stanley when 74 passengers and crew out of a total of 3,652 had gotten sick after the liner stopped in Ushuaia. The Falklands' authorities cited the illnesses as the reason for the denial. The president of the tourism board of Usuaia, Marcelo Lieti, said Monday's incident ""had nothing to do with the Malvinas subject,"" according to Telam. ""It's necessary to treat the question with much care,"" he said. ""We all defend Malvinas, but the tourist ships have nothing to do with the request for sovereignty,"" he told Radio Provincia of Ushuaia. In 1982, after Argentina invaded the islands, it fought -- and lost -- a two-month undeclared war with Britain. Still, Argentina continues to press its claim to the islands, which are home to more than 3,000 people, most of them of British descent. In Buenos Aires, a group of intellectuals expressed unhappiness with the way the Argentine government is handling the matter of the sovereignty of the Malvinas. ""The policy that the government is carrying out, in reality, is distancing us from the Malvinas instead of getting us nearer,"" said Jorge Latana, a journalist who has proposed greater cultural integration with the islands' inhabitants. ""Return to before 1982. In Argentina, it is very odd the way one thinks about Malvinas, because the public thinks of it as if no one lived there. It is like a thing of magical thought; that one day we take it and it will be ours. And that is not real."" Santiago Kovadloff, a philosopher, said the incident has nothing to do with sweeping away the British culture that is pervasive in the Falklands. ""They have the right to determine what they want to be. It's not for us to impose a culture they don't want."" Latana said that Argentina was being inconsistent. The country contains ""a mountain of English businesses"" that are exploiting the country's natural resources. ""And they are sending money out of the country. In that sense, the government is speaking out both sides of its mouth. On one hand it is attacking England through the Malvinas and on the other it is favoring some businesses to exploit minerals. It's a policy that is half schizophrenic."" CNN's Tom Watkins and Jose Manuel Rodriguez contributed to this report.","Incidents occurred Monday in Tierra del Fuego province .

"(CNN) -- ""People would say, 'Oh, what's wrong with your golf, what's going on with your golf?' and I thought, it's not golf, it's my head. It's me."" When Lindsey Wright spoke after the opening round of the women's golf season's first major tournament on Thursday, it wasn't just her impressive five-under-par 67 at the Kraft Nabisco Championship that people wanted to talk about. The Australian turned her back on golf last October, struggling with the isolation of life on the LPGA Tour and under the weight of a condition which was driving her to drink. ""People think, 'Depression, just get over it' if you're in a bad mood or whatever. It really impacts you physically,"" the 32-year-old revealed. 'Pink Panther' invests in golf's future . ""Playing on this tour, coming out and trying to play, grinding it out each week when you're not sleeping and you can't concentrate or focus and the other symptoms with it, it just gets you down, and it's a bit of a nightmare."" Wright's battle was depression was at its fiercest during lonely nights on tour, when the only respite she could find was in the bottle. ""But I think the lowest is when you have insomnia and you're waking up at 2 a.m.,"" the four-time LPGA Tour winner said. ""There's no relief from your mind, really, and I mean, the only time I really had any relief is if you had probably two bottles of red wine. ""It helps you sleep, but it's not the way to combat it. That's when I realized I've got a problem here, and I've got to deal with it because I'm getting worse."" Wright's condition was at its worse in 2009, after she had just achieved the most impressive result of her career by coming second at the LPGA Championship -- one of four majors in the women's season. ""I had a great season,"" she said. ""I finished second to Anna Nordqvist at the LPGA Championship, and after that it was kind of on a downhill slope, slippery slope. ""It just kind of happened quickly. You have bouts, and without getting into the psychology and everything, it wasn't a great time, and I just couldn't really get through it. ""I rang home in September last year and said, 'I'm done. I don't want to play anymore.' And my dad had said, 'You know what, that's great if you want to do that, but you need to have something to fall back on.' "" So during her time away from the course, Wright set about taking her first steps on alternative career paths. ""I worked as a media person at the men's New South Wales State Open, and then I worked with the tournament office at the men's Australian Open and did some other things relating to media stuff and sport,"" she said. ""It was really great. I didn't pick up a golf club from the last event I played, which is Taiwan, until January 2."" Wright's break from the sport seems to have worked wonders. She holed a 13-foot birdie putt to clinch the New Zealand Open last month, and after a solid first round she is on track to challenge for her first major title in California. ""If you had said to me before New Zealand, you're going to win, I would have went, 'Oh, yeah, whatever, I'm so unlucky.' But having won that tournament has opened all these doors for me to play in Europe, which I really want to do. ""I'm excited to do that. And I'm really enjoying my golf, which it's not a grind anymore. I'm actually enjoying it, the good and the bad."" Wright was one shot off the lead held by South Korean Amy Yang, who carded a 66. Taiwan's five-time major winner Yani Tseng (68) was one stroke back from Wright, ahead of a clutch of players on three under including 2010 U.S. Open winner Paula Creamer.","Lindsey Wright makes strong start to Kraft Nabisco Championship, one shot off lead .

"(CNN) -- As a serial entrepreneur and dotcom millionaire, Neil Patel can afford to be picky about his choice of luxury residence. But instead of a country mansion, penthouse apartment or gated community in the suburbs, the founder of internet start-ups KISSmetrics and Crazy Egg has set up home in a location he says best suits his hectic work schedule -- the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Seattle. ""I bought a place in a hotel because its convenient for me,"" says the 27-year-old, who often finds himself working more than 70 hours a week. ""I don't know how to cook or clean and I make more money if I focus on work rather than on the other stuff in life. Staying in a hotel where all these things are provided enables me to do that,"" he adds. See also: High-tech hotels a hit with geeky guests . Patel has become accustomed to life on the road in recent years. He says in the later part of the last decade he spent as many as 50 weeks a year traveling to promote his business interests, which meant staying in hotels. But he adds that the complimentary services afforded him in these places enabled him to work longer hours and focus more on growing his companies. So when he moved move to Seattle in early 2009, Patel decided to make his home in a luxury apartment that is part of the Hyatt at Olive 8 complex -- letting him transfer the best aspects of this nomadic lifestyle to his permanent residence. Although situated on a different floor from the hotel's short-term guests, Patel still has access to all the amenities and services provided to the regular guests. ""You can get room service, you can get maid service, there's a restaurant and a bar downstairs, there's even little cafes and coffee shops,"" says Patel. ""In addition to that you've got all the gym stuff, there's a full service spa, steam room saunas and a swimming pool as well,"" he adds. Patel describes his own hotel abode as a compact luxury environment, without being too ostentatious . ""There is a living room, bathroom, bedroom and a kitchen,"" he says, and the place is ""wired-up"" to host the latest electronic devices. There is even a TV in the bathroom, he adds. He declines to say how much the property cost him but reveals there is a penthouse suite not far from his own apartment that is available for between $4 million and $5 million. See also: Marriott mogul on 55 years in hotel business . But whilst enthusiastic about the lifestyle facilities hotel life offers, Patel is equally positive on the hotel's ability to double up as a business base if necessary. He says this enables him to work from home if he chooses, as well as meet and greet clients or business partners on the premises, meaning no valuable time is wasted traveling. ""Let's say I have a lunch meet, I can just do it downstairs,"" says Patel. ""I can do my business meetings there, my coffee meetings there. ""We have meeting rooms for businesses. We have small ones and we have medium ones and we even have grand ballrooms where we can have conferences."" ""Me and my buddies have actually thrown a conference in the hotel and we have fitted 100-plus people in one of their smaller rooms,"" he adds. See also: Why are we still paying for hotel Wi-Fi? But while supremely content with these services, Patel understands that a hotel will never be the perfect home environment for everyone. ""Of course, it's harder to raise a family there as you're not going to get a really huge place (and) if you don't like living in the city there is much more noise,"" he says. For a young millionaire with an unshakeable focus on working life, however, ""there really aren't that many drawbacks,"" he adds. ""For a guy like me, it's ideal.""","Neil Patel is a dotcom millionaire who lives in the Hyatt Hotel in Seattle .

"(CNN) -- Watching Brad Friedel being put through his paces at Tottenham Hotspur's training facility in Chigwell, Essex, you could be forgiven for thinking he was a lot younger than his 40 years. But the veteran American goalkeeper, who is coming to the end of his first season with the English Premier League club, has no plans to hang up his gloves just yet. ""I enjoy playing football so much that I try to keep disciplined. I do yoga -- I've done that for eight or nine years now,"" he told CNN World Sport. Friedel's fitness levels have allowed him to notch up over 450 appearances in England's top division in a career spanning 15 years and four clubs: Liverpool, Blackburn Rovers, Aston Villa and Spurs. He has not missed an EPL game in almost eight seasons. Footballers' health has rarely been out the headlines in recent weeks after Bolton Wanderers' Fabrice Muamba collapsed at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup quarterfinal against Spurs last month. Although he wasn't on the pitch that day, the incident left Friedel in shock and disbelief. ""Here you have a 23-year-old, an incredibly fit footballer that collapses and goes into cardiac arrest and then 72 hours later you start to hear about the miracle, and it gave everyone a lift."" Inevitably, the incident brought the issue of heart-screening of footballers to the fore, but Friedel is confident that procedures in place are already pretty good. ""I think it's going to be better at some clubs than others. When I came here I was fully screened, also at Aston Villa and Blackburn. I think we have to take into consideration as well that these things just happen sometimes,"" Friedel said. ""Take what happened to my good friend Stiliyan Petrov (Aston Villa player who was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia) -- that wasn't something that was openly going to be detected years prior. Hopefully they've caught it really early."" The most heartening aspect of both stories has been the positive response, he said. ""The great thing about football is that it can bring everyone together and help do a lot of good around the world."" It's nearly two decades since Ohio-born Friedel left his homeland in search of a professional career abroad. ""Soccer in the United States has come a million miles from when I started. There wasn't a professional league back then,"" he said. ""We all got scholarships into university if you were good enough and then if you were one of the lucky ones you would get into the youth national team. Then, if you were really fortunate, you got a chance to play overseas."" Friedel will return to the U.S. in mid-year as Tottenham embark upon a preseason tour, with friendlies lined up against LA Galaxy and the New York Red Bulls. ""I think the style of soccer we've played over the years and especially since Harry (Redknapp) took over, has gone down well in the U.S.,"" he says. ""We're one of the teams people really enjoy watching and hopefully with the branding efforts we'll become bigger in the States."" But for now, Friedel and Spurs have more pressing matters to attend to with European Champions League qualification to secure. The club are currently lying fourth in the table, the final qualifying spot in the EPL, having dropped from third place after a poor run of results. ""It's very important that we're in the Champions League next year ... to attract the best players from around the world. It will be a disappointment if we don't. I think the gaffer would say the same.""","Veteran Tottenham goalkeeper Brad Friedel talks to CNN's Pedro Pinto .

"(CNN) -- The King is dead -- or so they say, even though his original crypt is empty. And one person could soon own the place that served as Elvis Presley's first, but not final, resting place, by being the highest bidder. Starting the middle of next month, Julien's Auctions of Beverly Hills, California, will conduct the sale of the crypt, which is part of a large granite and marble mausoleum at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. This is no fleeting prize: The winner or their loved one can be interred for all of eternity exactly where Presley and his mother were for about two months. Unless conspiracy theorists are to be believed -- in which case a 77-year-old Presley may be still snacking on peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwiches on some secluded isle -- the late legendary singer is currently buried in the meditation garden at Graceland, his Memphis estate. Presley purchased that home and its 14 acres in 1957, a few years after his career had taken off. In his career, he sold more than a billion records, starred in 33 films, captured 14 Grammy nominations and earned the moniker ""The King of Rock 'n' Roll,"" not to mention the adoration of hundreds of thousands of rabid fans, according to his official biography. It was in a bathroom of his Graceland mansion that Presley was found dead August 16, 1977, due to what authorities said was an irregular heartbeat. But after 200 friends and relatives attended his funeral there two days later, he had to leave -- his body was moved about five miles south to Forest Hill Cemetery. His father, Vernon, wanted to bury Elvis at Graceland, but needed time for the state of Tennessee to grant permission to bury a person on private grounds, according to the Julien's Auctions website. Until then, the late singer was put in the crypt at the Memphis cemetery, soon joined by his mother -- Vernon's widow, Gladys Presley -- who also was disinterred and put in the same mausoleum vault. The bodies of both son and mother were moved within two months to Graceland, where visitors pay their respects to them to this day. As to Elvis's original crypt, it has remained empty since the King left the mausoleum, marked by a statue commemorating his weeks there. The lot up for auction includes Presley's original crypt, the chance to open and close the vault and crypt for burial, an inscription and the use of a small, abutting chapel for a committal service, Julien's Auctions notes. Those wishing to purchase this eternal piece of music history can't come empty-handed: Bids start at $100,000.","Elvis Presley was found dead in his Graceland mansion in August 1977 .

"(CNN) -- Five people were killed and five others wounded after an airplane dropped bombs Saturday on a town in South Sudan, a military spokesman in that fledgling country said -- though a Sudanese military spokesman denied any such attack. Col. Philip Aguer, a spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army of South Sudan, said that the aerial strike hit a market area in Rubkona, which is part of Unity state, at 1 p.m. Saturday (6 a.m. ET). Abiemnom County in that state, as well as two counties in Warrap state, were also attacked Saturday, Aguer said. But Al-Sawarmi Khalid, a spokesman for the Sudanese Armed Forces, said, ""We have not carried out attacks into South Sudan."" Both military spokesmen referenced Heglig, a key oil installation in South Kordofan state that produces nearly half of Sudan's oil and was seized by South Sudan's military this week. Aguer insisted Heglig is part of South Sudan. Meanwhile, Khalid said that Sudanese military forces were ""approaching Heglig from all sides."" Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations welcomed a U.N. Security Council statement this week demanding ""a complete, immediate and unconditional end to all fighting and a withdrawal of the SPLA from Heglig and an end to aerial bombardments."" ""We will observe closely the behavior and attitude of the reaction of the government of the South to this call and if they don't heed it, we will reserve our right to exercise the right of self-defense and we will chase them out, "" Ambassador Daffa-Alla Elhag Ali Osman said. The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, has called South Sudan's move to occupy Heglig ""completely unacceptable"" and urged forces to withdraw immediately. The African Union similarly has called on forces to pull out and for aerial bombardments to stop. Yet South Sudan's ambassador to the United Nations blamed the Khartoum government for attacks on their forces at the border, which she said provoked their actions at Heglig. ""South Sudan had no choice. It had to defend itself to deter attacks on South Sudanese territory,"" Agnes Oswaha said. ""South Sudan is prepared to withdraw troops as long as a mechanism is put in place that the area cannot be used to launch further attacks."" South Sudan gained independence from the north in July, the result of a referendum overwhelmingly approved by voters last year. The referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of civil war between the two sides that killed about 2 million people. Despite the split, several outstanding issues have yet to be negotiated, including citizenship, border demarcations and oil revenue sharing. When they separated, South Sudan acquired three-quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. The two countries have been locked in negotiations over how much the landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north. In late July, South Sudan halted oil production after accusing Sudan of ""stealing"" $815 million worth of its crude. Sudan said it confiscated the oil to make up for unpaid fees.","An airplane drops bombs on a market in Unity state, a South Sudanese spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of supporters have donated money to outspoken Chinese artist Ai Weiwei in order to pay a 15 million yuan ($2.3 million) tax bill from the Chinese government. The controversial artist has already received more than 6,000,000 yuan ($958,000) from more than 22,200 people. While many have sent money via post and the internet, other have resorted to rather unconventional methods -- folding bank notes into paper planes and throwing them into Ai's garden at night. Speaking to CNN, Ai Weiwei said people were using their donations to make a political statement. ""They would say we support you, we've never had a chance to express. This is such unfairness. It's not a fine to you but to us all,"" he said. How Ai Weiwei became an Internet master . Ai received the $2.3 million tax bill on November 1 and was given 15 days to pay.

""They [the Chinese authorities] said if I pay it means I accept the accusation,"" he said. ""But if you don't pay they can accuse you of another crime. ""Either way you're not going to be out. We can't stop to argue, we can't appeal, we can't go to the court,"" he continued. The outpouring of support and donations has come as a surprise to the artist who said he never asked for money. He has also stressed he will pay back ""every penny."" ""We didn't expect so many people to be involved in it,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Santa Monica, California, fatally shot a mountain lion Tuesday, acting on public safety concerns after it tried to escape from an office building courtyard in the city. Initial efforts to tranquilize the animal failed, and ""police were forced to use lethal force to prevent that animal from escaping the courtyard and endangering the public,"" a police statement said. An officer from the California Department of Fish and Game fired a tranquilizer dart into the animal, which normally takes about 10 minutes to take effect. In the meantime, authorities used water hoses and ""less than lethal"" pepper ball rounds in an effort to contain it. But when the animal tried to escape, authorities say the decision was made to use deadly force. The mountain lion, which was thought to be a juvenile weighing just under 100 pounds, had apparently strayed in the from the wild and was first reported just before 6 a.m. in downtown Santa Monica after a maintenance worker spotted it, the statement said. Mountain lion spottings are common in Southern California this time of year, though typically occur away from densely populated areas, according to Andrew Hughan, a spokesman for the California Department of Fish and Game. Unlike bears, they typically shun human contact, he said.

"(CNN) -- A series of explosions at an ammunition depot killed 123 people and wounded about 2,000 more in Brazzaville, the capital of Africa's Republic of Congo, Congolese officials said. The explosions occurred shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday (2 a.m. ET) when a fire at the depot set off a cache of tank shells, said Betu Bangana, director of protocol for President Denis Sassou-Nguesso. Bangana said 123 people had been confirmed dead by Sunday evening, and many bodies may be ""unfindable."" Ministry of Information press attache Bruno Impene said hospitals were overflowing, with the wounded lying in the corridors. The blasts destroyed numerous homes in the neighborhoods surrounding the installation, Bangana said. The force of the explosions broke windows up to 5 km (3 miles) away in Kinshasa, the capital of the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo. The DRC's military responded by putting tanks and troops on the streets and the banks of the Congo River, which separates the two cities, until it became clear that no attack on the capital was under way.

"Beijing (CNN) -- The wife of Ai Weiwei was taken from the Chinese artist's studio by police Tuesday and was questioned for three hours, the high-profile dissident said. Four policemen took Lu Qing from the Beijing studio to a nearby police station, he said. She was released by police after questioning and is now a ""criminal suspect,"" he said. They have not told her what crimes she is accused of, he added. ""I think the authorities are trying to threaten me through her,"" he said, speculating that Lu's arrest was related to her plans to visit Taiwan for an exhibition of her husband's work. She has now been told to stay in Beijing, he added. Police did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the case. ""Nobody can consider himself safe or innocent in an environment like this,"" said the dissident, who was himself detained by police for 81 days earlier this year. He was ultimately charged with tax evasion, and last week paid $1.3 million so he can contest the charges brought against his company, Fake Cultural Development Ltd. Had he not paid the sum, his wife -- who legally represents the company -- would have been jailed, he said. The government says the company owes 15 million yuan ($2.3 million). The money was raised from 30,000 contributors, he said. His lawyer, Pu Zhiqiang, said last week that Ai intends to return the donations if he wins the case and is refunded the money. His family and human rights advocates believe that the real reason for his imprisonment is his criticism of the Chinese government. Ai was released on bail in June because of his good attitude and medical concerns, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Local authorities held a closed hearing in July on the tax evasion allegations, despite demands for an open hearing from Ai and the company's lawyers. According to the artist, authorities also declined their demand to publish the accounting records and other evidence that lead to the tax evasion charge. Ai said earlier this month he was initially detained and imprisoned on charges of ""subversion of state power,"" but upon his release the charge was changed to tax evasion.","Lu Qing is released after questioning but told she is now a criminal suspect .

"(EW.com) -- Is she a good Twitter girl gone bad? Rihanna has taken to the 140-character site to offer up a steamy image of herself on Wednesday -- in which she strikes a strategically covered-up topless pose with the message, ""Where have you been all my life?!"" The post has sent already-wagging tongues into overdrive, wondering if this is just another part of her alleged feud with Chris Brown's current girlfriend, model Karrueche Tran. Last week, the songstress tweeted a feasibly harmless but potentially offensive picture of a packet of rice cakes dressed up in hoop earrings and shades with the caption, ""Ima make you my b****."" Rihanna's followers made the obvious link to Tran, who is half-Vietnamese. Then, when one of Rihanna's followers asked her to save him some rice cakes, she responded with, ""Kinda DRY."" Was it all a thinly veiled dig? Maybe. Maybe not. On her ""Birthday Cake (Remix)"" single with Brown, she does sing, ""Come and get it / Sweeter than a rice cake / Cake worth sipping."" And anyone who has ever eaten a rice cake knows that yes, they can be dry. While we were busy decoding Rihanna's twitpic game, Tran retaliated with Nicki Minaj lyrics on her Facebook.

"(CNN) -- Tensions often run high in top-level sports, but it is rare to see a team's coach physically attack one of their own players. However, that was the bizarre situation in an Italian soccer match on Wednesday -- and it has cost Fiorentina coach Delio Rossi his job. The 51-year-old has been sacked just six months after being tasked with turning around the fortunes of the top-flight team following an astonishing fight with young midfielder Adem Ljajic during the Serie A match against Novara. Rossi clambered into the dugout and attempted to punch the Serbian after the 20-year-old sarcastically applauded a decision to replace him, with Fiorentina at that stage losing 2-0 against a team that has been relegated to the second division. Fiorentina, which won the last of of its two Italian titles in 1969, fought back to draw 2-2. It left ""La Viola"" hovering above the bottom three and still needing a point from the last two rounds to ensure another season in Serie A. Club president Andrea Della Valle dismissed former Lazio and Palermo coach Rossi immediately after the match, with no successor yet announced. ""(In a) few seconds, months of stress came out. I am sorry, because the manager has never made such actions. I have to take this decision for his goodwill, so he can understand he was wrong. No provocation can justify that reaction,"" Della Valle said on Fiorentina's media website. ""With the due proportions, we will take serious disciplinary measures for Ljajic too. It is not up to me justifying Delio Rossi, but he has never done anything like that."" Rossi's dramatic departure comes just months after he was signed in the hope of turning around the Tuscan team, which finished ninth last season. He replaced the fired Sinisa Mihajlovic in November but has failed to significantly boost results, with the club 15th in the table, six points above the drop zone. ""I am sorry to witness this in my 10th year at the club and I believe the manager's contribution helped us to win in Rome and Milan,"" Della Valle said after the match. ""I believed we would have achieved safety from relegation tonight and, definitely, I was not expecting to take this decision tonight. This team requires more unity if we want to avoid relegation. I know that at this moment Delio Rossi is suffering more than anyone else and I want to respect the work he has done here for us.""","Fiorentina coach Delio Rossi sacked after attacking player Adem Ljajic .

"(CNN) -- Two's company, three's chaos in ""This Means War,"" a high-tech, high-octane gloss on the type of story we've seen a million times in sitcoms and screwball comedies. Taking his cue from Doug Liman's ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"" director McG aims for a kind of macho rom-com, a date movie that appeals to both men and women. The end product is slick, flashy and obnoxious. Reese Witherspoon has top billing, but rising stars Chris Pine and Tom Hardy call the shots as charmingly irresponsible CIA operatives FDR and Tuck. After an embarrassing fracas overseas, these best buds are assigned to office duty. And with homeland security very much on the back burner, it's not long before their thoughts turn to women ... or, as fate would have it, the same woman. Divorced dad Tuck meets Lauren through a dating agency. They hit it off. But within minutes of their first date, she bumps into FDR, a confirmed bachelor and ladies man. She calls him on his transparent lines, but he's persistent, and circumstances throw them back together even as she fixes up a second date with Tuck. (Lauren's a consumer products tester by trade, not someone who'd buy a car without taking it for a spin.) When they realize they're both chasing the same girl, the guys decide to let the lady make her choice -- without coming clean. Of course, neither can resist spying on the other's progress, despite a gentleman's agreement not to. In the movie's breeziest patches, the two hunks eavesdrop on Lauren as she compares their shortcomings with BFF Trish (an authentically abrasive Chelsea Handler). It might help if both men didn't come off so self-involved. We're meant to understand they love each other, as much as -- and probably more than -- Lauren, but that doesn't make their romantic trickery any easier to stomach. Hardy is a terrifically intense actor, who made a strong impression in ""Bronson"" and ""Warrior,"" and will soon be appearing as Bane in ""The Dark Knight Rises."" But he doesn't make as much sense as a sensitive and domesticated superagent. Pine, on the other hand, is all too convincing as a smug and superficial womanizer. Witherspoon has the trickiest job of all, trying to retain our sympathies as she falls for both men. She might have pulled it off, except, it seems, ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG isn't interested in the emotional integrity of the character. He appeared far more invested in showing off the latest spyware gizmos and gadgets. In almost every respect, ""This Means War"" can be seen as the polar opposite of Witherspoon's last rom-com, ""How Do You Know."" Most critics weren't kind to that picture (and it bombed in theaters), but, at the very least, it was an attempt to make sense of sex and romance in a real way. This crass and miscalculated movie might have been engineered by machines.","Director McG aims for a kind of macho rom-com appealing to both sexes .

"(CNN) -- Former French Ligue One champions Bordeaux have confirmed that they have agreed a deal for coach Laurent Blanc to take over as French national coach from Raymond Domenech after the World Cup finals. After initially expressing anger at the French Football Federation (FFF), for their pursuit of Blanc, Bordeaux confirmed in a statement on Thursday that an agreement had finally been reached for the 44-year-old to take over the position. ""The French Football Federation, its president, Jean-Pierre Escalettes and Bordeaux FC, its president and shareholders, have reached an agreement for the recruitment of Laurent Blanc as the coach of the France football team,"" confirmed the statement. It is not clear how much compensation has been paid by the FFF to entice Blanc, but club president Jean-Louis Triaud had earlier stated on Bordeaux's official Web site: ""I have no intention of giving gifts to the FFF."" Triaud also revealed that he believed Blanc's head had been turned by the FFF's advances, resulting in Bordeaux's challenge for a second successive French league title collapsing over the second half of the season. He said: ""Honestly, I am convinced the federation were making plans before the end of the season. The media frenzy around Laurent Blanc is sure to have disturbed the squad. ""The FFF's influence was heavy in the second half of our season. That added to the team's troubles."" As a player, Blanc helped France win the World Cup in 1998 and the European Championships two years later. He retired from playing in 2003 and was appointed Bordeaux coach in 2007, leading the side to second place in his first season before securing a superb League One and League Cup double in the 2008-2009 season.","Laurent Blanc to take over as French coach from Raymond Domenech after the World Cup .

"Miami (CNN) -- A 24-year-old Canadian man will probably face federal charges after allegedly rushing to the front of an American Airlines aircraft after it landed in Miami on Friday, the FBI said. Two passengers on Flight 320 from Montego Bay, Jamaica, helped subdue the man, identified by the FBI as Ryan Snider. No one was injured and there was no damage to the plane, the FBI said. Terrorism is not suspected, the agency said. American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle said the man appeared to be disoriented. ""He did not obey crewmember instructions to sit down and then moved toward the front of the aircraft where he was subdued,"" he said in a statement. Passenger Ronald Webb told CNN affiliate WSVN that the incident was disconcerting. ""We were a little bit worried because we didn't know what it was all about,"" he said. Snider is expected to make an initial court appearance Tuesday in Miami, the FBI said. ""Consular officials in the United States have been informed of the detention of a Canadian citizen and have extended an offer of consular assistance. Canadian consular officials will remain in contact with local authorities and are prepared to provide consular assistance as needed,"" Chris Plunkett, spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington, said in a statement.","FBI identifies the suspect in the Miami airline incident as Ryan Snider of Canada .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Efforts to form a unity government in Greece failed Monday, moving the country closer to a eurozone exit as the president called for another meeting Tuesday to seek a solution. Talks between Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the leaders of three main parties ended Monday night without a resolution, the president's office said. Papoulias then called a meeting for Tuesday to discuss the possibility of a government run by technocrats with support from political parties, according to the leader of the socialist PASOK party, which attended Monday's talks. ""We have no choice"" but to support the idea of a technocracy, PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos said. Papoulias had invited the leaders of the New Democracy, PASOK, Syriza and Democratic Left parties to Monday night's meeting. Syriza was the only one not to attend; the party's leader, Alexis Tsipras, said he wanted to talk with all parties or with just the president, and not with a selected group. The far-left Syriza came in second in parliamentary elections on May 6, and polling since then has suggested it would come in first if the politicians call new elections because they cannot form a government. The debt-wracked country has until Thursday to either form a government or call new elections. Absent a government, Greece could run out of money to pay its debts and might crash out of the euro, the currency used by it and 16 other European Union countries. ""If no government is in place before June when the next installment (of loan money) from the European Union and International Monetary Fund is due, we estimate that Greece will run out of money sometime between the end of June and beginning of July, at which point a return to the drachma would seem inevitable,"" Bank of America/Merrill Lynch wrote in a report released Friday. Syriza campaigned against the wildly unpopular government austerity measures that Greece -- under the now-ousted coalition of New Democracy and PASOK -- agreed to in exchange for loans by international lenders. The Syriza party's goal, Tsipras said Monday, is to remain in the eurozone without those ""catastrophic"" measures. But although his party rode high in opinion polls immediately after the election, survey results released Monday suggested that many voters blame Tsipras for the current political deadlock. About two in five people say he is most at fault, according to the Rass opinion poll of 1,002 people conducted by telephone on May 10-11. About one in five people blamed all political leaders equally. About one in three people said Tsipras had taken the worst position during talks on forming a new government. The meeting called by Papoulias came a week after angry voters punished mainstream parties by backing a range of fringe groups and parties opposed to the government bailout. Seven parties won seats in parliament, but none captured more than 19% of the vote. That led to three failed attempts to form a new government. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis held his own meeting with Papoulias late Sunday. So did Nikolaos Michaloliakos, the head of the far-right Golden Dawn party. Michaloliakos emerged from those talks saying that any new government would need a premier with the international clout to reject the bailout package the previous government had signed, calling the deal ""a crime against our country."" Venizelos said his PASOK party would do everything possible to form a national unity government, but it was ready for new elections, if necessary. The Communist party, meanwhile, called for new elections, saying it will not participate in a coalition government. The gravity of the situation was underscored Sunday by Tsipras, who told leaders, ""I am concerned that if we carry on with implementation of the bailout conditions in Greece, then Greece is at risk of facing a humanitarian crisis."" His remarks were made in a private meeting, a transcript of which was released Monday. In the meeting, Papoulias said the New Democracy party, which has supported him, had two conditions: to ensure that the country remains in the euro and to renegotiate conditions of the bailout. In a poll published Saturday by the newspaper Kathimerini, four of five voters said they would vote the same way in a new election. In a separate poll published Sunday by the newspaper Vima, seven of 10 people said they wanted the parties to form a coalition government. Syriza would come in first if new elections were held, the Vima poll suggested, after coming in second behind New Democracy a week ago with 16.8% of the vote. But the results would still lead to a deeply divided parliament, the poll suggested, with no party getting more than 21% of the vote. In the same poll, six of 10 voters said Syriza's plans against austerity are not realistic. Syriza is opposed to the terms of the bailout agreed to with the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund. The country's lenders have said that if Greece does not comply with the bailout terms, payments will stop. The stakes are potentially huge, with concern stirring that the lack of leadership could jeopardize Greece's bailout agreement. That could lead to a disorderly default by Greece and force the nation out of the eurozone. A default by Greece also could drag down other troubled governments such as Spain and Portugal. Any financial shock of such a magnitude could plunge the region into a deep recession, with ripples being felt across the world.

"(CNN) -- Anti-government fighters found the bodies of 78 people, apparently tortured to death, in a refrigerator at a hospital in Homs, Syria, captured from government forces Monday, opposition activists said. CNN could not independently confirm the activists' claim because the government severely restricts access by international journalists. The Syrian military used the Homs National Hospital as a detention center ""for all those violating the regime's law, meaning opposing the government,"" said activist Tariq al Homsi, who was in the embattled city. ""We know people were captured and taken there to be tortured, and many activists and youths were taken,"" he said. ""The bodies found had marks of torture. Even though they had gunshot wounds, they were in the shoulder or leg. It appears they died of torture, not the gunshots."" About 40 fighters with the Free Syria Army raided the hospital, which is in and area of central Homs controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, he said. ""Clashes ensued,"" and the opposition fighters took control from al-Assad's fighters, he said. Another activist, Abu Bilal al Homsi, said the 78 bodies have not been identified, but it is believed that most of them were people from the Baba Amr neighborhood. Opposition activists have made previous claims that the Syrian government was using hospitals for torture.","Free Syria Army captured Homs hospital from Syrian government forces, activists say .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian man has been arrested, accused of coercing a 12-year-old girl to perform sex acts online by pretending to be pop star Justin Bieber. Toronto resident Lee Moir, 34, was arrested after police posed as a young girl and arranged to meet him. The 12-year-old girl and her family live in New Jersey, where Essex County Assistant Prosecutor John Laurino said the girl believed Moir was Bieber and started a relationship with him, e-mailing back and forth. ""He began making demands that she show herself on camera, that she engage in acts of undress, and acts of sexual activity as well,"" Laurino said. Once Moir persuaded the girl to perform the acts, ""he then extorted her by saying he was going to post these onto pornographic websites,"" said Constable Victor Kwong of the Toronto Police. It was not immediately clear how authorities learned of the girl's case. Working with information from the Essex County Prosecutor's Office, Toronto Police Services became involved and engaged in sexual conversations with Moir while posing as a 14-year-old girl, according to the prosecutor's office. On April 4, after requesting a meeting, Moir arrived at the designated spot and was arrested, the prosecutor's office said. ""This arrest highlights both the danger posed to children online as well as the best efforts of law enforcement authorities throughout the world to apprehend these child predators who exploit the wide reach and perceived anonymity of the Internet to take advantage of vulnerable children,'' said Assistant Prosecutor Deborah Freier, who handled the case. Authorities said they believe Moir has been in contact with numerous girls in the United States, Canada, France, Australia and the Philippines using accounts on Facebook and the video chat site ooVoo, the prosecutor's office said. They said he used the online names Lee Oneel, Lee Moir, YodaYoda01, and Justy.Beber1. Charges against Moir in Canada include luring, manufacturing child pornography and extortion, according to Toronto police.","The man allegedly posed as the pop star and coerced the girl .

"(CNN) -- A day after Pedro Hernandez was charged in the killing of 6-year-old Etan Patz, prosecutors now face the task of corroborating his confession and piecing together a mystery that's confounded investigators for more than three decades. Neighbors say suspect in Patz killing lived a quiet life with his family . Police say the 51-year-old New Jersey resident confessed to strangling Etan and dumping his body in the trash near a Manhattan bodega where he worked as a teenage stock clerk in 1979. Attorney Harvey Fishbein said Hernandez -- who is currently on suicide watch at Bellevue Hospital -- has not entered a plea due to a pending psychiatric evaluation. Fishbein says his client has a ""long psychiatric history"" including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and hallucinations. New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said earlier this week that authorities interviewed other employees of the store Hernandez worked at, but not him. ""I can't tell you why,"" Kelly said. Yet two law enforcement sources said Hernandez was in fact interviewed, albeit briefly. A third source said Hernandez not only talked to police, but he confessed -- though he was ruled out as a suspect, because his claims weren't believed. At a recent news conference announcing Hernandez' arrest, Kelly said Hernandez had no prior contact with the boy, and that investigators have not uncovered any forensic evidence linking Hernandez to the disappearance of the Etan, whose body still has not been found. Former SoHo resident Roberto Monticello, who says he knew Hernandez at the time of Etan's disappearance, called the former stock clerk a ""very strange guy."" ""He was always by himself,"" Monticello recalled to CNN affiliate NY1. ""(I) never saw him with people."" Opinion: Missing children, perception vs. reality . His pastor, George Bowen, described Hernandez as a ""very quiet, unassuming, almost shy man,"" attending church regularly with his wife and daughter, and sitting in the same seat almost every Sunday. ""So every Sunday morning I had a conversation with him,"" Bowen told CNN Saturday. ""But the conversation was more or less a greeting."" One of the suspect's sisters told The New York Times that some family members claimed he had told them about the alleged murder in the early 1980s. ""He confessed that he killed a little boy,"" Norma Hernandez told the Times, saying that the suspect had moved to southern New Jersey shortly after Etan disappeared. But she said that he had never told her directly and never mentioned the boy's name. Norma Hernandez, according to the newspaper, said that her family had been torn over whether to inform authorities after the confession, but ultimately did not. ""They did not want to get involved because it was a brother,"" she told The Times. Lisa Cohen, whose 2009 book, ""After Etan,"" is widely considered the definitive account of the case, said Saturday that she remains skeptical about the man's confession. ""I had never heard of Pedro Hernandez before this week,"" she told CNN. Patz investigation a 33-year-long roller coaster ride . Etan went missing on May 25, 1979, a block from his home in Manhattan after walking to a school bus alone for the first time. His disappearance helped spawn a national movement to raise awareness of missing children, including the then-novel approach of putting an image of the child's face on thousands of milk cartons. The tipster whose information led to Hernandez's arrest contacted authorities last month after news coverage of their renewed search. That contact, at least in part, prompted investigators to question Hernandez. Police Commissioner Kelly said earlier this week described Hernandez's actions as a crime of opportunity and said the suspect was remorseful. ""The detectives thought (the confession) was a feeling of relief on his part,"" Kelly said. After that confession, investigators spent two days talking to witnesses and looking for anyone who could discredit Hernandez and couldn't find any, according to a source with knowledge of the case. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance ultimately gave the green light to file murder charges against Hernandez based largely on his confession, even given the lack of physical evidence and questions about his mental state, the source said. The next major step in the legal process would be for a grand jury to hear prosecutors' evidence against Hernandez for a potential indictment, after the defense waived its right to an expedited indictment on Friday. It is not clear when this might happen. Missing child case 'awakened America' Etan was officially declared dead in 2001 as part of a lawsuit filed by his family against Jose Antonio Ramos, a drifter and convicted child molester acquainted with Etan's babysitter. A judge found Ramos responsible for the boy's death and ordered him to pay the family $2 million, money the Patz family has never received. Although Ramos was considered a key focus of the investigation for years, he has never been charged in the case. He is serving a 20-year prison sentence in Pennsylvania for molesting another boy and is set to be released this year. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","The commissioner say police didn't talk to Hernandez, yet sources say they did .

"(CNN) -- Much like the expressive era that her music defined, Donna Summer danced her way through the 1970s with extraordinary success, posting successive hits that electrified dance floors and prompted her coronation as America's queen of disco. But her own life was marked by the highs and lows of the ballads that she energetically sang, and even at the height of her popularity, she once took steps toward suicide -- only to be stopped by the interruption of hotel maids. She overcame the negative dimensions of relentless public attention, and her legacy as a genre-leading vocalist endures decades later among music enthusiasts, even resulting in an appearance a few years ago on ""American Idol."" Summer died Thursday morning from cancer, her publicist, Brian Edwards, said. She was surrounded by her family in Florida, he said. Said her family in a statement: ""Early this morning, we lost Donna Summer Sudano, a woman of many gifts, the greatest being her faith. While we grieve her passing, we are at peace celebrating her extraordinary life and her continued legacy."" Summer, who was born in Boston and whose father was a butcher and mother a schoolteacher, sang from the moment she learned to talk, and her debut performance came in church at age 10 when the scheduled singer didn't show and the pastor asked Donna to step in. Summer later recalled that the church performance left worshipers in tears. In her singing career, she won five Grammys, and while she is iconic in the disco genre, her Grammy wins were also in the R&B, rock, inspirational and dance categories. This won't be our 'Last Dance' to Donna Summer: A playlist . ""Her talent was a true gift to the music industry,"" said Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the Recording Academy. At the height of her career, she and Casablanca Records created a sex symbol persona for her, and in an October 1977 cover story for Ebony, she remarked about her other nicknames: Queen of Love and Symbol of Eros. ""Well, you have to get people's attention some kind of way,"" Summer told the magazine, ""but I'm not just sex, sex, sex. I would never want to be a one-dimensional person like that. Share your images or memories of Donna Summer . ""I can sing songs like 'Love to Love You, Baby,' but I can also sing ballads, light opera, things from musical comedies, church hymns -- all kinds of things. Plus I can write, act and think."" Summer added that she didn't ""want to be known for just one thing."" In a 2003 interview with CNN, she said the initial absence of a manager led her to do provocative photo shoots. Her public image as a sex symbol and diva conflicted with her religious upbringing, she said. Her grandfather was a minister and her father a church deacon. ""Yes, it was a big complex and the image was sort of created around me,"" Summer said. ""I was sort of there, but not consciously there. And I didn't have anybody sort of on my side at that point, fighting for me, except for me, being in the middle. And then people would say, you know, 'Lay down here and do this.' And you know, whatever,"" Summer said. Her big break came when she was a teenager and auditioned in New York for a European version of ""Hair."" She landed a role and went to Europe. When she achieved success by her mid-20s, she wasn't able to handle it well. ""It was tough,"" Summer said. ""I think success is always a surprise, you know."" She eventually suffered depression and found herself in an abusive relationship. ""If people are in abusive relationships, I think they need to get out of them or at least get help,"" Summer said. She lived in fear during that relationship, she said. ""Thank God this person was from Europe, so they were deported. And then I was able to sort of be free, but I was afraid for years,"" she said. Her hits included ""Hot Stuff,"" ""Bad Girls,"" and ""She Works Hard for the Money."" Summer first rose to fame the mid-1970s, thanks to ""Love to Love You Baby."" The song, with Summer's whispered vocals and orgasmic groans supported by heavily synthesized backing tracks, fueled the decade's disco mania and hit No. 2 in 1976. Summer followed the song with such hits as ""I Feel Love,"" ""Last Dance"" and a disco version of the Richard Harris hit ""MacArthur Park,"" which outdid Harris' version by hitting No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. It was Summer's first of four chart-toppers. But with her 1979 album ""Bad Girls,"" Summer broke out of the disco mold as the genre, stimulated by the success of the Bee Gees' ""Saturday Night Fever"" soundtrack, was feeling a backlash. ""Bad Girls"" demonstrated Summer's vocal and stylistic range and produced two No. 1 hits, ""Hot Stuff"" and ""Bad Girls,"" as well as a Top 10 ballad, ""Dim All the Lights."" Fans, friends react to Summer's death . However, Summer had some trouble adjusting to the changing times. Her next album, ""The Wanderer,"" went for more of a rock feel. It produced a Top 10 hit in the title track but fared relatively poorly on the charts -- especially disappointing after the success of ""Bad Girls,"" a double album that spent five weeks at No. 1. It wasn't until 1983's ""She Works Hard for the Money,"" which became a ubiquitous video as well as a big radio hit, that Summer's fame approached its late '70s zenith. In 2003, she wrote of the demands of being superstar in a memoir, ""Ordinary Girl: The Journey."" She disclosed the pressures associated with being a superstar and revealed that at the peak of her popularity, the disco queen even contemplated suicide. In an interview with CNN that year, she was asked about sticking her foot out of a hotel window to get a feel of whether to jump. ""No, I wasn't getting a feel. I was jumping over. I was attempting to go. I didn't plan it. I just decided, I'm out of here,"" Summer told CNN. Then the maids walked in. She stopped herself. ""Then I sought help. I got help. I realized that I had a serious problem with depression, and I went to a doctor and he gave me some medication,"" Summer said. More recently, she appeared on the finale of the popular show ""American Idol"" in 2008 and performed some of her greatest hits with the show's leading female singers. That year, she released her album ""Crayons,"" and in an interview with CNN, she spoke of her musical ""mission."" ""I don't like to be categorized because I think that I am an instrument, and if you play me, I'll make whatever particular sound is supposed to come out for that color,"" Summer said. ""And so, in the overall spectrum of things, I'm just trying to be true to my, what I feel my mission is.""

"(CNN) -- The European Union imposed a ban Friday on the import of Syrian oil, the latest diplomatic move against Bashar al-Assad's embattled regime. ""The prohibition concerns purchase, import and transport of oil and other petroleum products from Syria. No financial or insurance services may be provided for such transactions,"" the European Council said in a statement issued in Brussels, Belgium. The action was expected. The EU has been a top market for Syrian oil, and the group said it intended to make the move which will have a detrimental impact on the Syrian government's oil revenues. The organization also added four more Syrians and three entities to a list of those targeted by an asset freeze and a travel ban. But there is an exemption to the asset freeze for humanitarian purposes. World powers have been bearing down on the al-Assad regime because of the government's ferocious crackdown against peaceful protesters for nearly six months. Security forces opened fire on demonstrators on Friday and activist groups reported deaths. The Local Coordination Committees of Syria counted 18 deaths. Demonstrations occurred in Daraa, Damascus and Homs provinces. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency said three law-enforcement members and four gunmen were killed in clashes. SANA said ""armed terrorist groups"" killed the security forces in the Damascus and Homs countryside. The gunmen also died in those areas, it said. The government says the armed groups are responsible for the bloodshed, while demonstrators blame the deaths on military and security forces.

"(CNN) -- In the four weeks since his daughter cut her leg in the Tallapoosa River, Andy Copeland has experienced several low points. But nothing was as desperate as a moment in the surgical waiting room on May 4. A doctor called from the operating room at Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton, Georgia, where his daughter was having surgery. ""When your daughter arrived, I was trying to save her leg,"" the doctor said. ""Now I'm trying to save her life.'"" Copeland felt his legs turn to rubber. His head went light. A hospital volunteer put a chair beneath him that caught him from falling. His wife, Donna, came into the room, and Andy repeated what the surgeon had told him. ""We cried and cried in each other's arms,"" Copeland recalled. ""We sobbed uncontrollably for 10 minutes. Then the chaplain came in and I grabbed his hand and I said, 'Let's pray.'

'Aimee Day' milestone arrives for Georgia woman fighting flesh-eating bacteria . On May 1, Aimee Copeland cut her left calf when the zip line she was holding snapped near the Little Tallapoosa River. The cut allowed a flesh-eating bacteria to infect her blood stream. Days later, doctors determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Aimee was in multiple organ failure. A respirator had to breathe for her. Her kidneys didn't work and she was on full-time dialysis. Her heart barely beat -- her ejection fraction, a measure of the heart's ability to pump blood, was 10%, when the normal rate is 55-75%. On May 8, a cardiopulmonologist told her parents that Aimee's chances of survival were ""slim to none."" The next day, they were told Aimee might not survive the night. Now, Aimee's lungs breathe on their own. Her heart is ""strong and normal,"" according to her father. While she's still on dialysis, she's strong enough to sit up for hours at a time. Once unconscious, she can now mouth words and even make jokes. Sunday, she spoke again for the first time, Copeland wrote. Surviving flesh-eating bacteria . ""The words I hear from the medical professionals to describe Aimee's continued recovery are 'astonishing, incredible, confounding, mind boggling, and unbelievable,' "" Copeland wrote on Aimee's Facebook page on May 12. ""My favorite word is miracle."" 'God has worked miracles' Many studies have shown that people who have spiritual or religious lives are healthier than people who do not. For example, a Brazilian study published last year in the journal Explore, examined 28 other studies, found that religious and spiritual people had an 18% lower mortality rate, which represented an 18% reduction in mortality over the course of the study. ""The results suggest that spirituality and religiosity play a considerable role in mortality rate reductions, comparable to fruit and vegetable consumption and statin therapy,"" the authors wrote. Not all studies have shown such dramatic results, and spirituality is not a guarantee of good health. ""There are plenty of religious people who die young and plenty of atheists who live to 103,"" said Dr. Andrew Newberg, director of research at the Myrna Brind Center of Integrative Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University. For some people of faith, the explanation for these findings is simple: God is healing the sick. ""God has worked miracles in Aimee's life,"" her father said. But experts who study faith and healing have different explanations for better health outcomes among the religious. For example, churchgoers might be healthier because they have the social support of their fellow congregants, who can help them when they're sick. Another theory has to do with stress reduction. Increased levels of stress hormones, such as cortisol, hurt the body's immune system. ""If somebody is anxious and upset and stressed, they're just not going to heal as quickly,"" said Dr. Harold Koenig, director of the Center for Spirituality, Theology and Health at Duke University. 'I am joyous' Reporters who've interviewed Andy Copeland have remarked on how upbeat he sounds, considering that his daughter is in critical condition and doctors predict she won't be out of the intensive care unit for another three or four weeks. ""Her life is still on the line,"" Copeland said. ""But I am joyous."" That's different, he said, than being happy. He's not happy about what his daughter has had to endure -- organ failure, an amputation of her left leg, right foot and both her hands -- but he said God's love has filled him with joy and inner peace. ""I just feel confident she's going to be fine. I can't really explain it. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Maybe I need a psychologist to examine me,"" he said. ""But I don't think so."" Copeland, a financial adviser with Edward Jones who attends the First Baptist Church in Snellville, Georgia, said part of his faith means being positive and not dwelling on the past. He does not wonder what might have been if Aimee hadn't gone on that zip line on the Tallapoosa River and cut her leg, allowing bacteria in the water to infect her bloodstream. ""Driving down the road looking through your rear view mirror is going to get you killed,"" he said. ""You have to be calm and collected and live in the moment."" That kind of attitude -- with or without faith in a higher power -- will go a long way toward healing, experts say. ""Stewing and ruminating on doubts can consume what resources one does have on unproductive things,"" said Doug Oman, an associate adjunct professor at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, and an expert on health and spirituality. 'Do not be anxious about anything' When things get tough -- such as this past Wednesday when Aimee was weakened from surgery -- Copeland sits in her hospital room, reading Bible verses online on his cell phone or laptop. ""I really need a pocket Bible,"" he laughed. He has his go-to verses, such as Philippians 4:6: ""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."" One of Aimee's favorite Bible verses is from 1 Corinthians. ""Love is patient, love is kind,"" it reads. ""It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."" The Copelands hope Aimee's strength inspires others. Before her accident, she hoped to get a masters degree in psychology and do wilderness therapy to help people with physical and mental problems. ""As a wilderness therapist she could impact maybe a thousand people,"" her father said. ""Now she can help millions."" CNN's William Hudson contributed to this report.","Parents of Aimee Copeland have coped with uncertainties of daughter's illness .

"(CNN) -- When Iranian officials arrive at the next round of nuclear talks in Baghdad on May 23, they will seek to advance several of their own goals, while only making modest changes to their nuclear program. Tehran's goal is to engage with the United States. Although the meeting will involve six world powers -- Russia, China, France, the UK, Germany and the United States -- it is the only venue it has to speak to American officials. 'Detailed proposal' emerging at Iran nuclear talks . Any breakthrough in talks with Washington might help ease mounting tensions with America's allies in the Middle East, including the Gulf Arab States and even Israel. Furthermore, it will ease voices inside Iran that oppose talks with the United States, without whose consensus Iran will be unable to shift the direction of its nuclear program. Iran wants to get Washington to accept it is a player in Middle East politics. This grants it leverage to negotiate new terms of agreement over its nuclear activities. In return, Tehran will offer solutions to its conflicts with the United States in the region. Unlike the United States, Tehran currently supports the Syrian regime and will aim to ensure that a future Syrian government will protect Iranian regional interests. Iran supports Palestinian Hamas against the U.S.-backed Palestinian Authority. Iran supports Baghdad's Shia government, which makes Iraq the only Arab country in the Persian Gulf to have closer ties with Iran than with America's Arab allies. Iran also aims to keep Israel at arm's length. It likes to portray Israeli hostility as a case of simple regional rivalry rather than one based on the real threat of a nuclear Iran. Ongoing talks allows it to maintain just enough transparency over its nuclear program to make the case that it is not fear of a nuclear Iran which prompts Israeli hostility, but the fact that it is capable of counter-balancing Israeli power in the region. Iran will therefore insist in the talks what Israel refuses to accept, that all states must join the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, eliminate existing nuclear weapons stockpiles and have the right to develop peaceful nuclear energies. Another goal Tehran will pursue is to demand that the tightening sanctions regime be loosened. An Iran-based journal, Iranian Diplomacy, suggests that Iran could cap its uranium enrichment at 3.5 percent -- a grade that can be used for nuclear power but not for nuclear weapons -- in exchange for easing sanctions. Iran could also propose first to dispose of its extra 20 percent enriched uranium, which it claims is produced for medicinal purposes. That is presuming that the Iranian claim to have the capacity to produce in abundance the higher-grade fuel is correct. The article underscored a political reality that U.S. diplomats have already experienced: Iran will never agree to cease enrichment altogether or give its enriched uranium away. In fact, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad never said Iran would, but the message was lost in translation when it was told in New York. That was because the West refused to admit a hard dose of reality when it was injected by Ahamdinejad's controversial figure. Just as it refuses to accept that Iran's nuclear policy is not determined by its presidents but by a higher body of decision-makers, which means that regardless of who leads the country the nature of its nuclear program will not change unless its demands are met. Iran is buying time without altering its questionable behaviors over its nuclear and regional policies. But the signs are clear that Tehran is committed to engagement to meet its desired goals. Iran's goal is to use delay tactics to arrive at some ""soft compromises"" in the talks. These include getting the United States to convince Israel to cease threatening Iran over its nuclear program, which has created tensions inside Iran. It also includes convincing the United States to permanently recognize Iran's enrichment program and to agree to ease the sanctions. In short, Iran is in the mood for what it calls ""resistance diplomacy."" This means, in the process of talks, it will continue to exercise patience to wear out the U.S. resolve to confront it. In the best case, Iran hopes to leave the talks feeling assured that its immediate security concerns have been sufficiently addressed. That explains Iran's recent accommodating stance towards the talks, which, according to former Iranian deputy foreign minister Abbas Maleki, has the full blessing of the supreme leader. In the worst case, Iran will continue using its regional influence and enrichment program to obtain future concessions. Iran will then use the next presidential race in June 2013 to revamp the nuclear talks by instilling in the West the false hope that a new presidential figure might be able to alter the course of Iran's nuclear program, which will not happen, again, unless its security concerns are addressed. The best choice right now is to play the same game with Iran, by engaging it with the same patience. At the same time, Washington must recognize that any change Tehran will introduce will be measured against a host of demands that it will make to ensure regime security. Therefore, in the process of talks, threatening Tehran with military action is counter-productive. And while sanctions are useful tools, they must be adjusted to loosen to any constructive change Iran makes and tighten if Iran is unaccommodating. The alternative is risking entering into a protracted conflict with Iran. Tehran's choice to pick Baghdad as the next venue for the May talks reveals a final goal: to unnerve the world by reminding it that only a decade ago Iraq was invaded on charges of possessing weapons of mass destruction. The current threat of war against Iran for fear that it could possess nuclear weapons may risk repeating the consequences of the Iraqi invasion in 2003. The Iraqi invasion brought about civil strife in the country, and increased the Iranian influence in the region.","Keynoush says Iran wants engagement with the U.S.

"(CNN) -- As many as 5.4 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease. That number includes my mother-in-law, who started showing signs of the disease in 2007. Standing beside all those living with Alzheimer's are more than 15 million family members and friends who provide them with care and everyday support. That includes my husband, his siblings, our kids and me. Together, we face the realities of Alzheimer's disease every day. Last week, the first U.S. National Alzheimer's Plan was unveiled by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. A historic milestone, the National Alzheimer's Plan offers what Americans have never had before -- a path to change the trajectory of a devastating disease that steals people's memories, independence and eventually their lives. The plan covers the spectrum of Alzheimer's issues, including treatment and prevention, clinical care, support for families in their homes and communities as well as public education and engagement. My family is among all those who believe in the promise of the National Alzheimer's Plan to find a way to prevent and effectively treat the disease by 2025 and improve care today. This ambitious goal will require a greater national commitment to Alzheimer's research. We've already seen a demonstration of this in President Barack Obama's Alzheimer's Initiative announced in February. It included $130 million in new resources for medical research in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. Alzheimer's is a progressive, degenerative and fatal brain disease that not only affects the person with the disease, but the entire family. Loved ones who provide care witness, day by day, the progressive and relentless realities of this fatal disease. Alzheimer's caregivers and families go through the agony of losing a loved one twice: first to the ravaging effects of the disease and then, death. In addition, caregivers themselves often experience depression and worsening of health because of the intense care that a person with Alzheimer's eventually requires. To fulfill the promise embodied in the new national Alzheimer's plan, we know it must be aggressively pursued to create a future where Alzheimer's disease is a manageable, treatable, curable or preventable disease. More than 5,000 scientists worldwide are working on solving the complex problem of Alzheimer's. As a neuroscientist by training and a member of the medical and scientific relations team at the Alzheimer's Association, that includes me. We scientists know Alzheimer's is a problem that can be solved. We know that with the right resources, we have the tools and the talent to make real, life-saving and life-enhancing progress already demonstrated in polio, heart disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS. We are already seeing signs of this progress. One important goal in Alzheimer's research is to prevent damage and loss of brain cells by intervening early -- even before outward symptoms are evident -- because many researchers believe that once symptoms appear, slowing or stopping the disease could be too difficult or perhaps impossible. We know that brain changes of Alzheimer's begin years before symptoms surface. Early results from a National Institute on Aging funded project, the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), found that study participants inherited a gene that guarantees the onset of Alzheimer's disease at a very early age. One key finding is that DIAN participants have evidence of brain chemistry changes as many as 10 years before the first detectable memory and cognitive impairment symptoms. This finding suggests there is a significant window of time to intervene with therapies that could halt the brain changes before they affect memory and day-to-day functioning. Researchers in the DIAN study also found that the brain changes among high-risk populations are very similar to the changes that happen in people who develop the more common type of Alzheimer's, which affects older people. Two important studies -- with different approaches but similar goals -- will work to speed advancements in Alzheimer's treatment. Both focus on families with younger-onset familial Alzheimer's disease, a very rare version where symptoms begin before age 65 -- but the results will also inform research questions for the more common later-onset Alzheimer's disease. Earlier this year, the Alzheimer's Association awarded a $4.2 million grant to the DIAN study to carry out a clinical trial of up to three experimental medications in the U.S. population, called the DIAN Treatment Trial Unit or DIAN-TTU. The DIAN-TTU is expected to launch this summer and will investigate multiple drugs over a short period to determine whether they have an effect on biological markers of Alzheimer's. Drugs that demonstrate a biological effect will be followed for a longer period in a subsequent study to determine their ability to postpone or delay symptoms of Alzheimer's. Last week, the government announced that $16 million would be allocated to a promising five-year trial to explore whether a drug therapy delays memory decline or brain changes. The majority of the trial participants will come from an extended family of 5,000 who live in Medellin, Colombia. Many members of this family have a genetic guarantee of younger-onset familial Alzheimer's disease. The study will look at a single drug over a longer period to discover its efficacy. These scientific research efforts are just two recent examples of the thousands of projects under way worldwide that are necessary to change the scientific landscape of Alzheimer's disease and the lives of millions. The Alzheimer's Association is the world's largest nonprofit funder of Alzheimer's research, awarding more than $292 million to more than 2,000 grant proposals worldwide since 1982. We are encouraged by the commitment of new resources detailed in the nation's first battle plan to fight Alzheimer's. We will continue to invest in the innovative research opportunities that have the potential to prevent, slow or stop the development of the disease on the road to our vision of a world without Alzheimer's. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Maria Carrillo.","There are 5.4 million Americans with Alzheimer's and 15 million caretakers .

"(CNN) -- The Keystone XL pipeline has turned into a poster child for political posturing. While it is merely one of many pipelines crisscrossing North America, this project has become ""red meat"" that both sides of the congressional aisle are using to weaken each other in an election season. To make matters more complicated, Canadian public and private-sector officials have jumped into the fray by coming to town to extol the virtues of the pipeline. The battle has become so heated it's easy to lose sight of the main question on which the fate of the pipeline should rest -- whether the project is in America's national interest and what are the measurable benefits and costs. The pipeline, as originally proposed, would bring crude oil from the tar sands of northern Canada through the Great Plains to the oil refineries in Texas and Louisiana, primarily for export. Supporters tout that the project would bring much needed jobs. Opponents warn of environmental risks. Unfortunately, the fight over whether to greenlight Keystone XL is creating collateral damage that vastly outweighs the marginal benefit either side will gain from sticking to its current position. Three victims among many deserve special mention: the U.S. transportation bill, U.S.-Canadian relations and America's strategic interests. The transportation bill, now in its ninth extension, is a critical piece of infrastructure legislation that consolidates more than 100 separate programs into just five major investment categories (for efficiency) and establishes performance standards for these investments (no more ""Bridges to Nowhere""). It is finally in the last stage of negotiations between the House of Representatives and Senate. While the Senate passed a bill in March in a bipartisan 72-24 vote, the House has only a shell bill to offer, plus its ""non-negotiable"" insistence on mandatory approval of Keystone XL. The Senate majority has its own bazooka: a presidential veto if Keystone XL is in the bill. There is a good possibility that a sound, bipartisan bill authorizing a program so important to our future economic growth -- infrastructure -- will be tossed aside for a 10th extension and kicked into a new Congress to start all over from scratch. If this happens, both parties must stand to account in November for the damage done to our economy. America, which in 10 years has fallen from fifth to 23rd place in the quality of its infrastructure compared with its global competitors, will be the loser if the transportation bill becomes a victim of Keystone XL. If the project can't be resolved soon, U.S.-Canadian relations could also be compromised. Canada is not only our largest trading partner but also a great friend. Today, Canada supplies the largest share of U.S. oil imports and buys our products with the money we pay them for it. Yet the Canadian government risks becoming a pawn in our domestic political catfight. Keystone XL is being egged on by the fossil fuel lobbyists on both sides of the border who have urged Canada to double down against the initial permit denial and ""turn up the political heat."" In a recent meeting with representatives of the Canadian government, a U.S. oil industry representative argued that Canada should have pulled its ambassador when the Keystone XL permit was initially denied. That's crazy talk. Yet the Canadians have pushed hard for Keystone approval, bringing in both Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Alberta Premier Alison Redford to praise the pipeline and hosting the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers while in town to brief Congress on the merits of the pipeline. All the pressures aside, the United States needs to pause and think carefully about its national interest. Our future energy balance and supply chain should not be short-stopped by attaching Keystone XL as a nongermane rider to a transportation bill for temporary political gain. Politicians come and go; nations generally do not. The long-term strategic interests of both Canada and the United States are better served if all parties involved heed the analysis under way in the State Department rather than resort to legislative fiat or a presidential veto. Calmer heads are already working on the details of a better proposal: a new route, improved technology and perhaps cleaner oil. The Canadian government should vigorously and publicly embrace the existing State Department analysis and strongly oppose attaching Keystone XL as a rider to the transportation bill. Canada should not be complicit in rushed, political decisions -- it should play by the rules. Congress should resist the temptation to use Keystone XL as an opportunity for political brinkmanship. Both Democrats and Republicans need to make sure that the real issues aren't lost in the partisan noise of Washington and that we do our best to avoid all the collateral damage. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Burwell.","David Burwell: U.S. needs to think carefully about its national interest in considering pipeline .

"(CNN) -- It was the goal that broke a thousand Chelsea hearts. Almost three years ago, Andreas Iniesta fired an incredible shot in the nail-biting final moments of a European Champions League semifinal at Stamford Bridge. Scored in the last minute of stoppage time, it secured a 1-1 draw and put Barcelona into the final on away goals. Iniesta's ecstatic team then took the title in Rome, beating Chelsea's English rivals Manchester United. On Wednesday, the Spanish champions will return to London to face Chelsea for the first time since that fateful day on May 6, 2009 in the first leg of this season's semifinal. Unsurprisingly, talk has centered on that goal, with 2010 World Cup winner Iniesta adamant that this time around Barca will not settle for a draw. ""We are going there to get a win, to put in a good performance and commit as few errors as possible,"" the midfielder said on Barca's website. ""I guess it's inevitable that that goal is being talked about again. It's good to remember it because it was a special and very intense moment -- not just for me, but for all of us. Life goes on though, and Wednesday is a different situation and a different game. I'm very proud of that goal and happy to have been able to have that experience. It's a feeling that is hard to describe."" However, Iniesta warned that Chelsea's squad -- which now includes his compatriots Fernando Torres and Juan Mata -- will be a a strong opposition despite the London side's difficult first half of the season, which cost coach Andrew Villas-Boas his job. ""They have more experience. They were strong in 2009 and they will be stronger now -- strong, dangerous and intense. That will all be multiplied by the atmosphere at their own ground,"" Iniesta said . Wednesday's match will be the fifth meeting between the two sides in the knockout stage of the European Champions League, with 2009's dramatic match still looming large in the fierce rivalry. That game is also remembered for Chelsea player Didier Drogba's foul-mouthed tirade at referee Tom Henning Ovrebo after the Norwegian turned down four penalty appeals from his team in the second leg. The Ivory Coast striker is keen to move on from the outburst which landed him a three-game ban. ""It is not about 2009 because I think about the other times we played Barcelona and it is not only bad memories, we have some good memories as well,"" he said on Chelsea's website. ""So it is 50-50, even if Barcelona are set to be the best team in the world and they have the best player in the world. It is two games, anything can happen."" Drogba has reason to be confident, with the Blues boasting a perfect record in the Champions League at home this season, winning all five games played. ""The only thing I want is to play on Wednesday with my teammates and make a good result. Barcelona are the winners of last year's competition and nobody expected us to be in the semifinal so we have to show that we deserve to be there,"" he said. The match will be particularly loaded for Barcelona coach Josep Guardiola and his Chelsea counterpart Roberto di Matteo, who faced each other as players for the teams in the Champions League quarterfinals 12 years ago. Again, it was Barcelona who triumphed, beating the Blues 5-1 after extra time at Camp Nou to triumph 6-4 on aggregate.","Chelsea fans devastated after Barca score last-gasp goal to take historic 2009 semifinal .

"Rome (CNN) -- A man has confessed to planting a bomb that killed a 16-year-old girl and injured five other people outside a school in the southern Italian city of Brindisi, investigators in Italy said. Giovanni Vantaggiato, 68, told investigators he acted alone in making the device and placing it outside the school, they said. Cataldo Motta, the chief prosecutor for the southern city of Lecce, where the investigation is based, said Thursday in a televised news conference that Vantaggiato had confessed after nine hours of interrogation. He said investigators were still examining Vantaggiato's motive for the attack, which appeared to be personal, since his explanation wasn't convincing. Investigators traced Vantaggiato after examining video that showed him driving his own car and his wife's car in front of the school in the days before the attack. Police also studied closed-circuit TV footage that they said showed him using a remote control to set off the explosion. He was arrested Wednesday. Vantaggiato, who owns a gas station, had easy access to the gas and gas tanks used in the attack and the know-how to build an explosive device, investigators said. Just after the blast, police found three gas cylinders at the site that were detonated with a remote control, authorities said. The explosion occurred on the morning of May 19 as students were arriving at Francesca Morvillo Falcone school, which offers vocational training. The school is named after the wife of a prominent anti-mafia judge, which fueled initial speculation that the organized crime group might be behind it. Falcone was assassinated in Palermo, Sicily, in May 1992. Police have since dismissed that theory, Italy's ANSA news agency reported.","Investigators say Giovanni Vantaggiato confessed to the attack while under questioning .

"(EW.com) -- It has been over three years since we last saw Will Smith on the silver screen in 2008′s ""Seven Pounds."" Regardless of the profession, three years is a long break. But in the movie industry, it can be an eternity. So it was only natural for many to wonder whether Smith's previous box-office dominance would waver at all when ""Men in Black 3"" hit theaters last weekend. Could the movie star pick up where he left off in 2008 and continue selling a gazillion tickets as though his sabbatical simply never occurred? Well, sort of. ""Men in Black 3"" opened to $54.6 million last weekend (or $69.3 million if you include Memorial Day). While that's slightly better than the debuts of 1997′s ""Men in Black"" ($51.1 million) and 2002′s ""Men in Black II"" ($52.1 million), ""Men in Black 3"" actually sold far fewer tickets. If you adjust for ticket-price inflation, then ""Men in Black"" and ""Men in Black II"" opened to $88.2 million and $71.2 million, respectively. The legacy of 'men' in black . Furthermore, the first two ""MIB"" movies debuted on Wednesdays and would have scored even larger figures had they been held until Friday, like ""Men in Black 3"" was. And ""Men in Black 3"" was the series' only entry to benefit from 3-D surcharges. So ""Men in Black 3's"" performance was actually something of a disappointment, especially when considering its gargantuan $230 million budget. But to what extent, if any, is Will Smith to blame here? After all, we're talking about a threequel that was released a decade after the last installment -- and ""Men in Black II"" was a very poorly received installment to boot. Even if Smith had continued acting these past three years, it would probably be unreasonable to expect ""Men in Black 3"" to perform significantly better than it did. Also, according to the market-research firm CinemaScore, 50 percent of moviegoers listed Smith as their reason for buying a ticket to ""Men in Black 3."" So the actor was still the main drawing factor for the film. Take a look at Smith's five last features: ""Seven Pounds,"" ""Hancock,"" ""I Am Legend,"" ""The Pursuit of Happyness,"" and ""Hitch."" Yes, ""Men in Black 3"" failed to compete with the likes of ""Hancock"" ($62.6 million debut) and ""I Am Legend"" ($77.2 million). But if you averaged the openings of all five films, it'd come out to $45 million -- or $52 million when adjusted for ticket-price inflation. In that light, ""Men in Black 3's"" $54.6 million debut isn't so disheartening. Disappointing for such a pricey sci-fi action franchise? Sure. But a stain on Smith's box-office report card? Not really. The real test for Smith will be his next film, the M. Night Shyamalan sci-fi thriller ""After Earth,"" which will costar the actor's son, Jaden Smith. It's an original project, so franchise fatigue won't be a viable excuse this time. And it won't be released for another year (June 7, 2013). But while we wait, it's nice to see a movie star of Will Smith's caliber back on the big screen -- even if his star is shining a tiny bit less brightly than it used to. See the full story at EW.com .

"(CNN) -- Substitute Mario Balotelli scored a second-half equalizer to earn Inter Milan a 1-1 draw at Parma in their re-arranged Italian Serie A match on Wednesday. Balotelli fired home from close range on the hour mark, just two minutes after coming off the bench, after the Parma defence failed to clear a corner. On-loan Manchester City forward Valeri Bojinov had put the home side ahead in the 54th minute, the goal also coming from a corner that was not cleared properly. Parma played the final 18 minutes with just 10 men after having Francesco Valiani dismissed for a second yellow card. Inter are now unbeaten in nine matches and have increased their lead at the top of the table to nine points from Roma, with city rivals AC Milan another two points further back in third place. Meanwhile, in Germany, Bayern Munich and Schalke joined Werder Bremen in the semifinals of the German Cup with victories on Wednesday. Bayern thumped Greuther Furth 6-2 while Schalke had a narrow 1-0 win at Osnabruck. They are joined in the last four by second division side Augsburg, who claimed a 2-0 vsuccess over Cologne. And in Spain, Sevilla are through to the Copa del Rey final despite a narrow 1-0 defeat Getafe. Roberto Soldado's 53rd minute goal separated the sides, but Sevilla reach the final courtesy of their 2-0 first leg success.

"(CNN) -- ""It was the only race that frightened me, actually,"" motorsport legend Stirling Moss says of Italy's historic endurance rally -- the Mille Miglia. ""It certainly was one of the races throughout the year where I thought, 'Oh God,' because I didn't know where I was going."" Translated as the ""Thousand Miles,"" the race was held on public roads. Competitors set off from Brescia and blazed a trail south to Rome, before turning around and returning to the northern city. The rally was a true test of speed, courage and navigation. The Mille Miglia's origins date back to the early days of motorsport and the decision to move the 1922 Italian Grand Prix from Brescia to Monza, near Milan. The switch proved unpopular in Brescia, and when an automobile club was formed in the city in 1927, they sought to put on a racing spectacle of their own. The rest, as they say, is history. For 30 years between 1927 and 1957, competitors -- including Moss and five-time Formula One world champion Juan Manuel Fangio -- pushed their vehicles to the limit in an attempt to reach the finish line. It has since been resurrected as a serene, grand touring event, but in its racing years the prospect of driving at breakneck speeds down everyday roads was both a trial and a thrill for participants. Moss says it made for a nerve-shredding ride. ""Imagine going up a large incline towards a village and going at 185 mph without knowing which way the road goes,"" the 82-year-old told CNN ahead of this week's 2012 edition. ""If there is a turn over the brow, you need to know about."" In 1955, ably assisted by co-pilot Denis Jackson, the British driver loosened Italy's stranglehold on the race, sealing one of only three Mille Miglia victories by a foreigner in record-breaking fashion. Moss, one of the best drivers never to win the F1 world title, set an average speed record for the route, clocking a time of 10 hours seven minutes and 48 seconds. But when asked about one of the highlights of his 14-year racing career, Moss' response was surprising. ""I didn't know I'd won,"" he explained. ""All I knew is that I was the leader at the stop before. ""I didn't know I'd won until my time had been split and I knew I couldn't be passed, so it was a terrible anticlimax. I was very much on tenterhooks waiting. It was anticlimactic but nonetheless very exhilarating."" But when compared to all the races staged throughout motorsport history, including the 66 F1 grands prix Moss started, what set the Mille Miglia apart? ""The whole of Italy turns out, it's absolutely staggering,"" he said. ""All across the whole country, people come out and line the roads. It's amazing, more than five millions spectators. It's something that could happen nowhere else but Italy. ""The one thing you must remember is we were genuinely doing speeds of 185 mph, on ordinary roads. There were no autostrasses or dual carriageways. And the amount of cars you have to pass, hundreds of cars, it's pretty daunting."" Ultimately, it was the element of danger which proved the race's downfall. In addition to glorious victory, the Mille Miglia's legacy is also littered with fatal crashes. The most infamous was in 1957 in the village of Guidizzolo, a tragedy which proved to be the final nail in the race's coffin. Spanish driver Alfonso de Portago's Ferrari veered off the road and tore through a group of spectators, killing the driver, his co-pilot and nine bystanders, five of which were children. ""A lot of the drivers -- you had hairdressers, you had chefs -- really weren't competent enough to drive at the speeds you had to drive at,"" recalls Moss. ""In the modern day, one could not take the death toll. As the years passed, people dying in motorsport like that became unacceptable."" The 2012 edition began on Thursday, with Moss in attendance to take part in the festivities. Despite no longer being a rip-roaring, high-speed chase, the fabled tour still draws a big crowd. ""It's absolutely terrific,"" said Moss after this year's event had got underway. ""The enthusiasm of the people here ... The Italians line the streets, pat you on the head, it's just great. ""People bring their own cars, if they're fast cars, and go around. It's something very special."" Reflecting on the Mille Miglia as it was 60 years ago, Moss believes it had a certain spark which modern day motorsport hasn't quite rekindled. ""When the race car was just an ordinary road car, a bit faster of course, that was terribly exciting,"" he said. ""I'm sure it is today, but I'm not sure it would be quite as exciting as it was then.""","The Mille Miglia was an Italian road race between 1927 and 1957 .

"(CNN) -- The experience of Alex Ferguson could be the key to Monday's potentially title-deciding Manchester derby, according to one of the veteran manager's former stalwarts Edwin van der Sar. The Dutchman retired last year after Manchester United claimed a record 19th English championship, but that reign appeared to be over earlier this season as big-spending Manchester City took pole position under the guidance of Roberto Mancini. A form slump allowed United to move eight points clear at the top -- but that has been cut to three with three games to play ahead of the clash at City's Etihad Stadium. Ferguson is the most successful British manager of the modern era, having won 12 Premier League titles and two European Champions League crowns in more than quarter of a century at Old Trafford. U.S. focused on England's biggest game . ""He will be right up for it. He's had challenges over the last 26 years against various teams and he beat them, he got down to them and he diminished them and he's going to do the same with City,"" Van der Sar told CNN. ""He's going to motivate the players because it's a massive moment to win the Barclays Premier League. He's going to do it the same way he always does -- of course there are going to be remarks about, 'You have to win otherwise you're not going to show your face for the next two months in Manchester,' all that kind of thing. But in general it's all about tactics."" Mancini guided City to the club's first silverware since 1976 with success in the FA Cup last season, but it has been 44 years since a league title was celebrated by the blue half of Manchester. ""They've both got strikers on good form -- Sergio Aguero scored a lot of goals, Wayne Rooney scored a lot of goals,"" said Van der Sar, who played for United for six seasons. ""I think City has slightly a better defensive record. But I think the midfield is going to be the place where it's going to be decided. ""Hopefully my old teammates are up for it, can withstand the pressure."" The 41-year-old revealed he was hoping for a draw, which would leave United in the box seat ahead of final games at home to Swansea and away to Sunderland. City must next travel to Champions League-chasing Newcastle and relegation-threatened Queens Park Rangers. ""My heart is right, of course you want a win for United, and a draw would be fine also. So let's go for a draw, a 1-1 or something to decide who's going to win the Barclays Premiership. That would be great,"" he said. Van der Sar is one of the few footballers to have won the Champions League with two different teams -- helping deliver Ajax the title in 1995 and repeating the feat with United in 2008. The man named UEFA Best European Goalkeeper in 1995 and 2009 said that the Manchester derby had grown in importance in the last year along with City's fortunes. ""I remember when I came here and played a game and even lost during one of the seasons -- we lost both games -- but still ended up winning the league. They were still so happy that they won from us, even though we ended up winning the league so it didn't really matter that much,"" he said.","Former Manchester United goalkeeper says Alex Ferguson will have a key role in derby .

"(CNN) -- An Air Force squadron commander has been removed a week after a tilt-rotor CV-22 Osprey crashed in Florida during a routine training mission, injuring five, military officials said Friday. Officials were no longer confident in his effectiveness, said Col. Jim Slife, commander of the 1st Special Operations Wing. ""The challenges of the 8th Special Operations Squadron's demanding mission require new leadership to maintain the highest levels of precision and to reliably support the ground forces which count on the 8th SOS to safely accomplish their missions,"" Slife said in a statement, without providing details. Lt. Col. Matt Glover of Austin, Texas, had led the 8th Special Operations Squadron since May 2011, according to the Hurlburt Field website. The squadron is one of nine operating in the wing. Slife said the new squadron commander has extensive history in the Osprey program. The crash occurred about 6:45 p.m. June 13 at Hurlburt Field's Eglin Range, said Amy Nicholson, chief of public affairs at the airfield. The cause remains under investigation, Slife said. The Osprey was assigned to the 1st Special Operations Wing, the Air Force said. The tilt-rotor aircraft can fly like an airplane and land like a helicopter. The Army began developing the Osprey in 1982, though the program was nearly scrapped in 1989 when Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney sought to cancel it because of ballooning costs. Questions were raised about the safety of the Osprey after two crashes, including one in 1992 at a Marine Corps air base in Virginia that killed the crew. In late 2000, the Marine Corps grounded the Osprey fleet after two more crashes: one in Arizona that killed four crew members and 15 passengers and another in North Carolina that killed the crew. A redesign was ordered, and the craft resumed flights in 2002. The Air Force began using Ospreys in 2008 after testing the aircraft in 2006. The Marines deployed them in Iraq in 2007 after 18 years and $20 billion in development.","Osprey crashed last week in Florida during routine training mission .

"(CNN) -- The priceless, 8,000-piece collection of rare African-American memorabilia Nathaniel Montague spent decades collecting could be dismantled if a buyer doesn't come forward by mid-July. During a status hearing in bankruptcy court scheduled for July 20 in Las Vegas, creditor ABKCO Music & Records plans to ask the court to conduct an auction of the items in the Montague Collection, which includes slave and indentured servitude documents, a signed copy of Phillis Wheatley's ""Poems on Various Subjects"" dated 1773, and a handwritten letter from Booker T. Washington seeking financial assistance for 221 students at Tuskegee. ""There's nothing I can do,"" Montague said. ""I wish there were, but there isn't. I just hope that we don't turn out to be losers, and that I get something for my efforts."" Montague, a onetime radio personality who coined the phrase ""Burn, Baby, Burn,"" spent 50 years acquiring rare and one-of-a-kind pieces of American history, including books, photographs, paintings and ephemera. An assessment of five of the pieces puts their total value somewhere between $592,000 and $940,000. His goal was to turn it into a museum. Now that it is out of his possession, he just wants to see his life's work remain intact. Black history 'undertaker' loses treasures . Years ago Montague and his wife of 56 years, Rose Casalan, began taking out loans to archive and prepare the collection for sale. They found themselves overextended financially and declared bankruptcy last year. The collection was seized and is now housed under tight security in Las Vegas. It is in the hands of a trusteeship charged with selling it to satisfy the debts, including a judgment for $325,000 plus fees from New York-based ABKCO, an independent entertainment company that owns rights to recordings by Sam Cooke, The Rolling Stones and Bobby Womack. Fees have continued to mount, including $250,000 from a financing company to pay for housing and marketing the collection, said Jason Wiley, an attorney for ABKCO. ABKCO had agreed to give the trusteeship six months to market the collection. Time has run out, and there have been no buyers. Now, the company plans to petition the court to conduct an auction of the collection during the July 20 hearing. ""We haven't come close to getting this thing sold,"" Wiley said. ""We've got to cut this thing off."" Dotan Melech, the federal bankruptcy trustee charged with administering the Montague estate, is still hopeful he can find a buyer or get more time from the court. He has sent letters to a few hundred individuals and nonprofits that have shown interest in the collection asking them to submit their best bid by July 13. He is trying to come up with other solutions, as well, including setting up Twitter and Facebook accounts to help get the word out. He's also considered a Kickstarter campaign. ""In this economy, no one throws money at anything,"" Melech said. ""We're trying as hard as we can."" If the judge grants ABKCO's request, the collection could be sold piecemeal until the debt is satisfied. Any remaining items could be returned to Montague. That will break his heart, Melech said. ""If you have five children and two are taken away, it doesn't hurt less because you got three back,"" he said. Montague says he will think positively until a deal is made. ""I only want to look ahead, that it can be done,"" he said. ""Every day I think of what I can do until time runs out.""","Nathaniel Montague spent 50 years collecting rare, books, photographs, paintings .

"Washington (CNN) -- Several members of Congress pressed the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration on Wednesday to explain why stronger action has not been taken against three agents under investigation for alleged involvement with prostitutes in Colombia. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, noted that nine Secret Service agents lost their jobs for spending time with prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, in April. The men were sent to Cartagena in advance of a presidential trip. Sensenbrenner wanted to know why the DEA agents haven't been fired. DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart said she must wait until the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General concludes its probe concerning the allegations against the three agents. Secret Service scandal: systemic problem or abberation? ""It's not really appropriate for me to pre-judge the results, but I guarantee you that if there was misconduct, they will face our disciplinary process,"" said Leonhart. Leonhart said she immediately pulled her agents out of Colombia when she learned of the allegations and made them available to the inspector general for interviews. ""They are presently on limited duty while the investigation is taking place,"" she said. A DEA official told CNN the agents currently are not involved in any investigatory work and their only current task is to cooperate with investigators. According to two government sources briefed on the investigation, one DEA agent had a long-term relationship with a prostitute. Allegations concerning the DEA agents came to light following reports concerning twelve Secret Service agents who went out drinking at Cartagena night clubs on April 11 and ended up bringing women back to their hotel rooms. Three of those agents were cleared of serious misconduct. The military opened an investigation of 12 service members for their alleged involvement but has not announced any findings yet. The issue of DEA involvement came up when a Secret Service agent voluntarily reported to his supervisors that had attended a party with the DEA agents and several women at a Cartagena apartment on April 13. The Secret Service agent ---the 13th agent to be caught up in the scandal -- is currently on administrative leave and is not expected to lose his job, according to several sources. That Secret Service agent said he accepted a massage from a woman he thought was a masseuse and that when things started to turn sexual he stopped it. The agent is the third supervisor caught up in the Colombia controversy. According to a law enforcement official, the agent works in protective intelligence which reviews any threats and risks to the president. ""No classified or sensitive information was compromised"" by the 13th agent or the ones involved in the partying on April 11, said the official. There was a delay in Congress being told the details about the 13th agent. ""One significant concern was that there were DEA agents on the ground and care had to be taken not to accidentally identify them or disrupt any ongoing investigations,"" said the law enforcement official. The DEA agents worked undercover, acording to officials. Secret Service spokesman Max Millien said the agent ""self-reported potential misconduct"" on April 19 and an investigation was begun. Millien said Congress was fully briefed on May 4. ""Throughout this process the Secret Service has worked diligently to brief Congress on the details of this investigation in a transparent and comprehensive manner."" CNN's Ted Barrett, Dana Bash, Kate Bolduan, Ashley Hayes and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Secret Service and DEA agents were in Colombia in April, ahead of a presidential trip .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A Hong Kong government minister on Tuesday joined a growing chorus of people questioning the circumstances of the death last week of a prominent Chinese dissident who was found hanged in his hospital room. Dr. York Chow, the Hong Kong secretary for food and health, said in an interview with CNN affiliate i-CABLE News that the weak physical condition of Li Wangyang, a blind and deaf labor rights activist, made it hard to believe the hospital authorities' claim that he had committed suicide. Chow also cited an interview that Li gave to i-CABLE a few weeks before his death in which he expressed his commitment to promoting democracy in China. ""It seems that his character and personality are not of a person who is suicidal and are not of a person who would not have left a suicide note,"" Chow said. He urged other officials to convey the feelings of Hong Kong citizens about Li's death to the Chinese government in Beijing. Chow has said he will finish his term as health secretary in Hong Kong when the territory's new Beijing-backed chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, takes over next month. Friends of Li have criticized official claims that he hanged himself at the hospital Shaoyang, Hunan Province, as ""insulting"" and ""ridiculous."" They insist he was too weak to hang himself and was committed to continuing his activism. One friend, Huang Lihong, said last week that he had visited Li Wangyang at Daxiang District Hospital in Shaoyang a few days before his death on June 6 and found him in ""good spirits."" Li was blind, deaf and had trouble walking after spending more than 20 years in prison following the crackdown by the Chinese authorities on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989. He was one of China's first labor rights activists and was jailed shortly after the June 4 massacre in Tiananmen for urging workers to strike, according to Human Rights in China (HRIC), a nongovernmental organization. After spending 11 years in jail, Li was released in 2000 only to be imprisoned again in 2001 for doggedly petitioning Shaoyang authorities to pay his medical expenses for injuries suffered through torture in prison. They refused and he was sentenced to a further 10 years for ""incitement to subvert state power,"" according to HRIC. He was released last year but his family said he had been under 24-hour police surveillance in hospital. Li's brother-in-law Zhao Baozhu told HRIC that hospital staff phoned him and his wife, Li's sister Li Wangling, just after 6 a.m. on June 6 to tell them that Li had committed suicide. Zhao said they rushed to the hospital and found Li's body ""hanging by the window."" He noted that Li's feet were still on the ground. ""I've never witnessed a suicide like this,""said Mi Ling Tsui, communications director at HRIC. ""It raises questions. How do you hang yourself with your feet on the ground?"" Despite the family's claims that they weren't allowed to take photos of Li's body, three images of him said to have been taken after his death have been published on Boxun, a U.S.-based Chinese-language news website. Two photos show Li standing by a window with a knotted sheet around his neck, apparently tied to bars on a window above. A third photo shows Li's feet firmly on the ground, still wearing slippers. CNN tried repeatedly to contact Daxiang District Hospital where Li died but no one answered the phone. An official who answered the phone at the publicity office of Shaoyang Public Security Station said he hadn't heard of Li's case and advised calling another number. Attempts to contact other government offices were also unsuccessful. It's not known how long Li had been in hospital before his death. HRIC said only that he was being treated for his ""deteriorating health."" Zhao told HRIC that the authorities started monitoring Li on May 22. In the hours after Li's death, a petition appeared online urging his ""suicide"" to be investigated by authorities outside Shaoyang province and for the findings to be made public. It was started by Hong Kong-based journalist Bei Feng, Chinese economist Xia Yeliang and literary scholar Wu Renhua. Thousands of people have added their names to the petition, including many who listed their locations China. A memorial service for Li will be held Wednesday evening in central Hong Kong to mark the seventh day after his death. It will include a silent tribute as well as a pro-democracy song. Protesters demanding an investigation into his death already carried out a demonstration in the city on Sunday. CNN's Licia Yee, Anjali Tsui, Hilary Whiteman and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Li Wangyang, a labor rights activist, was found hanged in his hospital room .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. envoy to Myanmar arrived Wednesday in the Southeast Asian country's western state of Rakhine, where sectarian violence in recent days has killed more than 20 people and destroyed hundreds of homes. Vijay Nambiar, the special adviser for Myanmar to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, is in Rakhine for talks with local officials, said Aye Win, the U.N. national information officer in the country. Violent clashes between Buddhists and Muslims prompted the government of President Thein Sein to declare a state of emergency in Rakhine on Sunday, calling in the military to help impose order. The turmoil underscores the fragility of Thein Sein's efforts to move the country along a path toward democracy and pursue reconciliation among its different ethnic groups after he took power last year. The unrest in the western coastal area of Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh, has left 21 people dead and thousands seeking shelter in refugee camps, Myanmar state TV reported Tuesday evening. The violence erupted after the police detained three Muslim men in relation to the rape and killing of a Buddhist woman late last month. Anger over the case fueled an attack by about 300 local people on a bus in the Taungup area of Rakhine, killing 10 Muslim passengers on June 3, according to the New Light of Myanmar, a government-run newspaper. Since then, inter-ethnic clashes have multiplied, resulting in the destruction of 1,662 houses, state TV reported. Rakhine is home to the Rohingya, an ethnic Muslim minority who say they have been persecuted by Myanmar's ruling military junta. That makes the government decision to impose a state of emergency in Rakhine and call in the army a flawed response to the current situation, according to human rights advocates. ""For decades, the Rohingya have routinely suffered abuses by the Burmese army, including extrajudicial killings, forced labor, land confiscation, and restricted freedom of movement,"" the nongovernmental organization Human Rights Watch said in a statement Monday. It noted that the Buddhist Arakan people in Rakhine had also had their human rights violated by the military. ""Using the army to restore order risks arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and torture,"" the rights group said. As a result of their treatment by the authorities, the Rohingya have long sought refuge in other places. The United Nations has estimated that more than 200,000 Rohingya live in legal limbo in Bangladesh. Over the years, Rohingya have fled by sea in small boats to other countries like Thailand and Malaysia. The United Nations and human rights groups have called on the Bangladeshi authorities to let in refugees fleeing the violence in Rakhine, citing reports that border guards had turned back boats carrying people from Myanmar. ""Previously people have been allowed in to Bangladesh for medical treatment,"" Adrian Edwards, a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said Tuesday."" We hope that such good practices will be maintained."" Efforts to obtain comment from the Bangladeshi government were not successful on Wednesday. The unrest runs counter to the efforts of Thein Sein's administration to seek reconciliation with Myanmar's different ethnic groups and move the country toward more democratic governance. Western governments have rewarded progress in the country over the past year by easing economic sanctions. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed concern about the situation in Rakhine on Monday, calling on ""all parties to exercise restraint and immediately halt all attacks."" In a statement, Clinton urged the Myanmar authorities ""to work with local leaders -- together with Muslim, Buddhist, and ethnic representatives, including Rohingya -- to halt the ongoing violence, begin a dialogue toward a peaceful resolution, and ensure an expeditious and transparent investigation into these incidents that respects due process and the rule of law."" The United Nations said Monday that it was temporarily withdrawing some staff from Rakhine because of the unstable situation. CNN's Paula Hancocks, Jethro Mullen and Sarita Harilela contributed to this report.","More than 20 people have been killed in unrest in western Myanmar .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain on Thursday acquitted nine medical professionals who were accused of involvement in unrest in the country but upheld convictions of another 11. All 20 were convicted last year of attempting to overthrow the government and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. Bahrain sliced the sentences of many whose convictions were upheld Thursday. Of the 11 whose convictions stand, two are at large, five will be released on time served and the other four can appeal their sentences again, the Bahrain Information Affairs Authority announced. Human rights groups and some of the medical professionals, which include doctors, say they were treating people injured in last year's protests against the government. The group Physicians for Human Rights denounced the sentences and called on the government to set aside the verdicts against all the medics. ""Eighteen of the accused medical professionals have alleged that Bahraini security forces tortured them while in detention,"" the group said in a statement. Maryam Alkhawaja, vice president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, tweeted that the nine acquittals should not be seen as an achievement, because ""they shouldn't have been arrested and tortured to begin with."" In a statement, the government insisted that ""no medic is being charged for treating protesters. The charges brought against the medics were primarily for their involvement in politicizing their profession, breaching medical ethics"" and, most seriously, calling for ""and involvement in the overthrow of the monarchy."" Another Bahraini doctor, Nabeel Hameed, told CNN last month that during last year's protests, ""We became automatic witnesses."" He was on call -- one of only three neurosurgeons at Salmaniya Hospital, on February 18, 2011 -- when an injured protester was brought in. The patient had been shot in the head. ""For treating him and then expressing my concerns about the way he was injured, I got labeled as a traitor,"" Hameed told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. Two months later, he was arrested, he said. ""They took me into an interrogation center for about four days of torture. I was not alone. I was with other doctors. They made us stand for days together ... without sleep, without toilet privileges, without anything. And in between that, you get abused, you get spat at, you got insulted ... and everybody who passes by you just beats you on the head or the back."" ""But the worst thing is a room, an electronically locked room ... and when the doors open, all hell breaks loose. Because you start hearing these shouts of torture. Of people inside. ... Your turn is next. And my turn was next. ... Somebody even took a gun to my head and threatened me with death,"" Hameed said. He was later released, but as a changed man, he said. Bahraini officials have denied ordering torture. CNN's Lucky Gold contributed to this report.","20 medical professionals were arrested and sentenced last year .

"Washington (CNN) -- Weeks after the U.S. Southern Command began investigating reports that 12 troops engaged in misconduct during President Obama's visit to Cartagena, Colombia, the entire matter is still being reviewed to see if the evidence is strong enough for the military to take disciplinary action against those alleged to have been involved. Military lawyers at U.S. Southern Command ""are evaluating evidence obtained during the investigation to determine admissibility and strength of the evidence,"" the U.S. Southern Command said in a statement updating the status of the investigation. The individual military services have reviewed the evidence against the 12 individuals and made their recommendations to Gen. Douglas Fraser, the commanding general of Southern Command. It is now up to him, pending advice from his legal team, to make the decision on how to proceed. There are three options if there is a decision to take action. One is adverse administrative action, which could include a letter of reprimand or admonishment. Generally these types of actions end careers. A second is nonjudicial punishment, which could include withholding pay, reduction in ranks or confinement. These actions can be appealed by a service member, who can challenge the evidence and call witnesses. The third is military court-martial, which can lead to trial and conviction. ""Gen. Fraser is also carefully reviewing the information and is required by law to consider numerous factors to include the nature of the offenses, any mitigating or extenuating circumstances, the character and military service of the suspects and the recommendations of subordinate commanders. The goal is a disposition that is warranted, based on admissible evidence, just, appropriate and fair,"" the Southern Command statement said.","12 troops investigated for their conduct on Obama Colombia trip .

"(CNN) -- Prosecutors say Gary Schultz, a former Penn State vice president who oversaw campus police, held a file that detailed alleged incidents pertinent to the investigation of former football coach Jerry Sandusky, who faces more than 50 counts involving sexual acts with 10 boys since 1994. Schultz and Tim Curley, Penn State's former athletic director, have pleaded not guilty to charges of perjury and failing to report an alleged sexual assault of a child. The file, which prosecutors say was initially withheld during the investigation, shows inconsistencies with what Schultz and Curley told a grand jury, according to court documents filed by prosecutors and obtained by CNN on Tuesday. Prosecutors say e-mails from Schultz, Curley and others further contradict that testimony. ""The commonwealth is entirely justified in using those documents as evidence to support the charge of Perjury against Schultz,"" the court documents say. Read the document (PDF) Tom Farrell, Schultz's attorney, said, ""To be clear, Mr. Schultz did not possess any secret files. All his files were left behind after he retired and were available to his secretaries and his successor. The only 'secret' information revealed was the privileged grand jury information inaccurately described by unidentified law enforcement sources to the media."" Curley, 57, is on leave, and Schultz, 62, retired after the allegations.

"(CNN) -- Authorities searched Tuesday for a man they say sexually assaulted and stabbed a lone hiker at Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. The National Park Service released a sketch and offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the perpetrator in Friday afternoon's assault on Gatlinburg Trail near the city of the same name. The 44-year-old victim, who officials said did not know her attacker, managed to make her way afterward to Gatlinburg Bypass, where she flagged down a motorist, officials said. Rangers and National Park Service special agents were working more than 50 leads received on a tip line, said Molly Schroer, spokeswoman for the park, the most visited in the nation. What's in a trail hiker's backpack? The suspect was described as a white male in his 40s, of thin build, about 5 feet 9 inches tall, with a dirty blond crew cut and a thin mustache. He was wearing glasses, black dress pants and a gray T-shirt. Multiple tattoos include an unknown word across his abdomen. The hiker suffered multiple stab wounds on her neck, shoulder and hand. She was airlifted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, where she was released Sunday. Schroer said the woman's permanent residency is in Kentucky, but she had been ""temporarily"" residing in the Gatlinburg area. Georgia hiker's mom says showing grisly photos adds to grief .

""Working together with the assistance of the public, I am optimistic that we can solve this case."" Officials said anyone with information can call the tip line at 865-436-1580. Schroer said nothing like this has happened recently in the park, and officials ""believe that this is an isolated incident."" Ranger patrols in the area have been increased. According to the park service, Gatlinburg Trail is frequently used by joggers, walkers and bicyclists. It travels 1.9 miles one-way from the Sugarlands Visitor Center to the outskirts of Gatlinburg. It is relatively flat and runs through a forest. The park has 800 miles of trails, and hikers should take precautions, Schroer said.

"New York (CNN) -- It has risen -- floor by floor, gleaming steel beam by steel beam -- from the scene of what was incomprehensible destruction more than a decade ago. Now, as 1 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan stretches closer toward being the tallest building in the United States, it already stands as an icon in its own right. Punctuating the Manhattan horizon, the once-named ""Freedom Tower"" also was once fraught with controversy and costly redesigns. But it's soon expected to top off at 1,776 feet -- technically edging out the Willis Tower in Chicago by way of decorative spire affixed to its peak, and replacing the Twin Towers that fell to terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. ""Everybody takes pride in this building,"" says Marc Becker, deputy general superintendent of the construction firm Tishman. ""Everyone's an important piece of the puzzle, whether you're an iron worker, whether you're a painter, everyone has a job to do."" ""We're all here to see this through to the end,"" adds Becker. Crews at the site are gearing up for President Barack Obama's visit Thursday to the work-in-progress -- which now has reached 104 stories -- for an update on its upward growth. The building is expected to open in about a year and a half. ""We're going to have our topping-out beam placed on the street"" so that President Obama can sign it, says Mike Pinelli, general superintendent at 1 TWC. ""It's going be the first signature on the topping-out beam,"" he adds. ""It's typically signed by everybody on the project at some point and then we're going to erect it shortly thereafter to signify the topping out of Tower One."" On the 92nd floor, workers can often be seen hanging off beams as they twist steel rods into a lattice framework while blowtorches spray sparks against the upper floors. Steel beams fall 40 stories at WTC construction site . Lacking external glass at such heights, the structure is edged by black netting to prevent loose objects from falling into the plaza more than a thousand feet below. Ground was broken in April 2006, on a redesign by the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, with construction starting later that year. ""The structure itself is a hybrid,"" says Mel Ruffini, Tishman's project executive. ""The perimeter is steel, the core is concrete."" He calls it ""the strongest concrete we've ever used in New York, maybe in the United States, for an office building."" ""The walls are extremely thick, and all of the building supplies, elevators, all the risers, all telecommunications are within that concrete structure inside the building,"" he says. From the 92nd floor, workers are able to watch planes approach the New York region's three major airports, a subtle reminder, they say, of the thousands who died on that September day. ""Tower One, when it's complete, will symbolize everything that was lost in 9/11,"" Pinelli says. ""It also will symbolize our resiliency as a nation, all the hard work put in by everybody.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani security forces arrested a key al Qaeda leader near the nation's border with Iran, military officials said Wednesday. They arrested French national Naamen Maziche, who was in charge of some of the terror network's international operations, according to the Pakistani military officials. They did not want to be named because they are not authorized to talk to the media. Maziche is a close aide of al Qaeda leader Younis Al Mauretani, the officials said. Pakistani intelligence agents arrested Mauretani and three aides in September 2011. At the time of his arrest, Pakistani officials said he sought to attack targets in the United States, Europe and Australia. Osama bin Laden had asked Mauretani to focus on hitting targets of economic importance in the U.S. such as oil pipelines, dams and oil tankers, Pakistani officials said at the time. Mauretani told investigators Maziche was in Iran and possibly headed to Africa, the officials said. The exact time and place of Maziche's arrest was unclear. Al Qaeda's most wanted . And now, only one senior al Qaeda leader left . Journalist Ayza Omar contributed to this report .","Officials: Naamen Maziche was in charge of some of al Qaeda's international operations .

"(CNN) -- There once was a man named Norton who didn't know what to do with himself -- not just sometimes, but always. He slogged through school, then the University of Pennsylvania and pre-Beatles Liverpool on a scholarship. He shipped off to a foggy, wretched spot in Newfoundland in the Navy, and returned to a slightly less-wretched Brooklyn Heights basement. He became an architect -- the very same job his father and brother held -- and, feeling a bit burned out by 1960, secured a grant to write a kids' book about cities. But those old demons grabbed him, the ones that always seem to keep him from doing the things he should be doing, and Norton Juster began to write a story. His very first sentence: ""There once was a boy named Milo who didn't know what to do with himself -- not just sometimes, but always."" The sentence became a chapter, then pictures drawn by his friend and neighbor, cartoonist Jules Feiffer, and eventually, a book. The book became ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" -- perhaps you've read one of the 4 million copies printed during the last 51 years. In it, uninspired young Milo receives a mysterious tollbooth that takes him through the Kingdom of Wisdom (a city of sorts, with landmarks such as the Mountains of Ignorance, Foothills of Confusion and the Doldrums) to rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason. Along the way, Milo learns a bit about language, friendship, learning itself, and those very same demons -- petty tasks, habit, insincerity, fear -- that Juster battled. So, after an architecture career, a smattering of other books and countless fan letters, Juster, at 82, has at least done this: He can carry on a conversation with a 9-year-old. Short of writing a classic children's novel yourself, try this. Stop trying . It might've been unlucky that Juster's older brother was funny, athletic, handsome, whip-smart -- the undisputed ""hope of the family."" But for the younger Juster, it meant freedom to read encyclopedias, to absorb old Yiddish books, to lounge before Jack Armstrong stories on the radio, to invent with the architectural samples his dad brought home, to not like anything until he found what he loved. ""They gave me the greatest gift of all: They left me alone,'"" Juster said. ""There were no expectations hanging on my head so I had a good time browsing around in my own head and inventing my own world and that was the best kind of training I could have for whatever I did."" Be funny . Juster's father was a quiet man, never one to tell a bawdy joke. But he was a great spinner of puns, a master of wordplay, a man schooled by the Marx Brothers. ""'Ah-ha, I see you're coming early since lately,'"" he'd say. ""You used to be behind before, but now you're first at last.'"" Young Norton would freeze, confused. Was this funny? Should he laugh? ""You're a good kid,"" his father would say, his hand around his son's shoulder. ""I'd like to see you get ahead. You need one."" ""After a while, he'd pull one of these things on me, and I'd say, 'I understand that, and I can do that,'"" Juster said. ""And boy is that empowerment, when you suddenly realize that language is yours to play with."" Don't lie . A kid has got to have mentors, Juster said. It's why he gave Milo the kindly, talking timekeeper dog, Tock, and Humbug, the lazy, grouchy, mostly harmless ne'er-do-well. Whom Juster had was Uncle Bill -- a kindly ne'er-do-well, a Humbug-ish Tock. When young Norton wanted to play, Bill joined him. When the nephew ran away, the uncle was the one to fetch him. If you asked whether a visit to the dentist would hurt, Juster said, ""He would tell you 'Yes,' why and for how long. That's precious information for a kid."" Estimate higher . ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" could've died in the hands of ""the powers that be,"" Juster said -- book editors and experts who said it was too clever for kids, too loaded with puns and wit. Fantasy, some told him, would ""disorient the children."" ""Luckily,"" Juster says, the book first landed in the hands of an editor who worked outside the realm of children's publishing. They were able to get it published with the map Juster designed, the layout he imagined and the words he wrote. To kids, Juster believed, a new word was a great discovery, one of the few things they could control. ""If you think about it, there's no such things as a difficult word,"" Juster said. ""There's just a word you haven't come across yet."" Listen and remember . ""Children are children, and they're still fighting the same battles,"" Juster said. ""Those issues that I thought were my own personal issues, I now realize they're the issues of every kid growing up. The basic things that control their lives -- their fears, their uncertainties, their resentments, everything like that, remain the same. ""For people who write and for people who work in an area where you have to break the mold in some way, you have to retain, I guess, a good piece of the way you thought as a child. I think if you lose all of that, that's where the deadliness comes from. The idea of children looking at things differently is a precious thing. ""The most important thing you can do is notice.""","""The Phantom Tollbooth"" by Norton Juster celebrated 50 years in print last year .
Juster said the book has stayed relevant because the world changes, but children don't .
Milo, the book's main character, is really just Juster himself, the author said ."
"(CNN) -- Friends and family of Rodney King gathered in Los Angeles to bid final farewell to the man whose 1991 beating by the city's police sparked riots after the acquittal of the four officers involved. King was found dead in his swimming pool at his Rialto, California, home almost two weeks ago. He was 47. ""I'm extremely proud. Still, today, I can be up here and be sad, but I could have lost you when I was 6 so I'm thankful and I'm grateful. I wouldn't have had my sister if he would have died. I'm grateful for all of you for coming to show your support,"" King's daughter, Dene, said during the service. Rodney King looks back without anger . A spray of flowers perched atop King's black casket, which was set next to a smiling photograph of him. Music played over a slideshow of family photographs. Rialto police received a 911 call from King's fiancee, Cynthia Kelly, about 5:25 a.m. on June 17, according to Capt. Randy De Anda. Responding officers found King at the bottom of the pool, removed him and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital, police said. A preliminary autopsy report will not be released, coroner spokeswoman Jody Miller said. The coroner will wait until a full report based on the toxicology exam findings is available in six to eight weeks, Miller said. There were no preliminary signs of foul play and no obvious injuries on King's body, De Anda said. Police are conducting a drowning investigation. King's beating after a high-speed car chase and its aftermath forever changed Los Angeles, its police department and the dialogue on race in America. The video that captured the beating shows King cowering on the ground and attempting to crawl away as he is surrounded by a crowd of police officers. Four of them used their nightsticks to strike him. King was beaten nearly to death. Three surgeons operated on him for five hours. The video appeared on national television two days later, focusing attention on the issue of racially-motivated police brutality. Four LAPD officers -- Theodore Briseno, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind and Sgt. Stacey Koon -- were indicted on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and excessive use of force by a police officer. But following a three-month trial in the predominantly white Los Angeles suburb of Simi Valley, three of the officers were acquitted of all charges. The jury, which had no black members, deadlocked on one charge of excessive force against Powell, and a mistrial was declared on that charge. African-Americans in Los Angeles exploded in outrage. Rioters ran through the streets -- looting businesses, torching buildings and attacking those who were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The violence led to more than 50 deaths and $1 billion in property damage. On the third day of rioting, King emerged from seclusion to make a plea: ""People, I just want to say, can we all get along? Can we get along?"" Opinion: Can we all get along? Nearly a year later, the four officers stood trial in federal court on civil rights charges. Two African-Americans were picked for the jury, and King testified. Koon and Powell were found guilty and sentenced to 30 months in prison. Briseno and Wind were acquitted. King also sued the city of Los Angeles, and was awarded $3.8 million in damages. In later years, King had several more run-ins with the law, including a 90-day jail stint in 1996 for a hit-and-run involving his wife at the time. On the 20th anniversary of the beating in 2011, he was pulled over and ticketed for a minor traffic violation. King said last year on the anniversary that he has forgiven the officers who beat him. ""Yes, I've forgiven them, because I've been forgiven many times,"" he said. ""My country's been good to me ... This country is my house, it's the only home I know, so I have to be able to forgive -- for the future, for the younger generation coming behind me so ... they can understand it and if a situation like that happened again, they could deal with it a lot easier.""

"Kabul (CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai has reiterated his stance that NATO forces in Afghanistan should never make airstrikes on civilian homes, a practice that has angered many Afghans. ""As far as our responsibilities in Afghanistan are concerned, it was clearly agreed that no airstrike should be launched on the houses of Afghan people and no reason is valid for the use of it, and we totally call it disproportionate use of force,"" he told reporters in Kabul on Tuesday. ""Even if NATO forces are attacked, they cannot use airstrikes on civilian homes."" He said such airstrikes were ""completely banned, absolutely banned."" Karzai's strong words followed a statement by NATO on Monday that it will no longer use airstrikes against insurgent targets in civilian homes if there are ""other means"" to deal with the targets. Forces ""will continue to conduct operations against insurgents who use civilian dwellings, but when there is concern over the presence of civilians, air delivered munitions will not be employed while other means are available,"" Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings said. The statement did not elaborate on what other means International Security Assistance Force commanders would use. Karzai calls casualties unacceptable . The shift comes after an airstrike last week in Logar province that killed 18 people, including women and children. It was the latest of several such strikes that have upset relations between Afghanistan and the United States. Hollande: 4 French soldiers, interpreter killed in Afghanistan . Karzai cut short a trip to China following the strike and summoned the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, Gen. John Allen, to demand an end to the strikes. He and Allen had detailed talks, the Afghan president said, in which they agreed that this kind of strike on civilian homes ""cannot be repeated."" ""Afghanistan has been ... greatly troubled by civilian casualties, as you are all aware, and this has been an issue on which we have had serious tensions with our allies in NATO and the United States,"" Karzai said. The strategic partnership agreement signed by Afghanistan was supposed to turn a new page in the relationship between his country and NATO, he said, and ""bring an end to bombardment of civilian homes."" NATO forces said the Logar airstrike occurred when soldiers returned fire during a mission targeting a Taliban leader. An ISAF spokesman said insurgents were killed and security forces seized weapons and explosives. The change in policy will not hinder ISAF forces from pursuing insurgents, Cummings said. ""This restriction in no way limits our ability to take the fight to the enemy,"" he said. ""Air dropped munitions against civilian dwellings represent a very small percentage of all of our air operations."" Army Lt. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of ISAF Joint Command in Afghanistan, said Monday that since January 2012, ISAF had conducted more than 1,300 close air support operations, during which ""32 civilian compounds were damaged and five incidents of civilian casualties were confirmed."" NATO and the U.S. military apologized last month to the families and loved ones of Afghans killed in coalition airstrikes in two other villages, saying they were ""tragic and regrettable incidents.""

"(CNN) -- Seven people were injured Thursday when heavy rains caused a partial roof collapse at a Barbourville, Kentucky, business, officials said. Initial reports from the scene were that the drainage system at Tru-Seal Manufacturing was clogged and caused water to pool on the roof, causing a partial collapse, said Kentucky Emergency Management spokesman Buddy Rogers. Three people were taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, Rogers said. Several others walked over to the hospital on their own with minor injuries, he said. A total of seven people, all adults, were checked into the Knox County Hospital, said hospital spokesman Shawn Gentry. Barbourville is about 100 miles southeast of Lexington, Kentucky. Elsewhere, several homes were destroyed and others damaged Thursday when a tornado touched down near Dexter, Michigan, officials said. No injuries or deaths were immediately reported, said Marc Breckenridge, emergency management director for Washtenaw County. Authorities were assessing the number of damaged and destroyed structures, he said, adding the twister was not thought to be on the ground very long. Video from CNN affiliate WDIV showed one home reduced to rubble in a neighborhood, with an adjacent home heavily damaged. Dexter is about 10 miles northwest of Ann Arbor. The severe weather also affected the western and southwestern areas of Ann Arbor, said Mayor John Hieftje. Some streets were flooded, power lines were downed and one garage was struck by lightning, he said. Parts of the city also received hail, he said. The area was under a tornado warning until about 6:30 p.m., he said. Bill Marx, head baker at Dexter Bakery, told WDIV he was closing the business when he heard storm sirens. ""I stepped outside and saw the clouds turning around,"" he said. ""It was coming toward us. After it went by, it really started raining and hailing."" An area resident uploaded video of the tornado approaching Dexter to the Internet sharing site YouTube. ""There's trees flying around,"" one person can be heard saying on the video. A National Weather Service assessment will determine the strength of the tornado. Several counties in the area remained under severe thunderstorm and flash flood warnings Thursday night.

"(CNN) -- The Federal Reserve's newly released Survey of Consumer Finances confirmed what most of us already knew: The middle class has taken a really big hit. Between 2007 to 2010, the typical family had lost nearly 40% of their wealth. And, despite that our economy was 15% larger in 2010 than in 2001, the typical family's wealth decreased by 27.1% since 2001. On top of that, income had fallen. Median family income in 2010 was down by 7.7% from its 2007 level and 6.3% from its level a decade ago. The picture looks dismal, doesn't it? But none of these numbers are surprising really. Is the average American poorer than before? Yes. The Fed's survey is picking up on the huge effect of the collapse of the housing bubble. For many middle class families, their home is by far their largest financial asset. For decades, people were encouraged to believe that it was the safest way to save for retirement or other purposes. This clearly was not true when house prices became inflated. In the years when the bubble reached levels that were clearly unsustainable, from 2002 to 2007, housing was just about the worst possible place to keep wealth. Unfortunately, tens of millions of Americans listened to experts such as former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who assured the country that there was no housing bubble. According to reports, Greenspan has a very nice pension and a job that pays more than $1 million a year. He certainly doesn't have to worry like the typical American family. It is difficult to read through the Fed survey and not get angry at the wreckage from a completely preventable disaster. American families: How are you coping? Greenspan could have used his enormous stature to warn of the dangers of buying overvalued houses. He could have warned lenders of the risks of issuing mortgages on overvalued property. And he could have used the massive research capacities of the Fed to document without question the existence of a bubble and the damage that its collapse would cause. He also could have used the Fed's regulatory power to crack down on the epidemic of mortgage fraud that the FBI had highlighted as early as 2004. If Greenspan had acted responsibly and taken some of these steps, as some of us have urged at the time, the housing bubble could have been contained before it was too late. But if all else failed, he could have raised interest rates. To make interest rate hikes more effective, he could have told the markets that he was explicitly targeting the bubble. For example, he could have promised to raise rates until nationwide house prices fell back to their 2000 level. Greenspan's failure is history now, but we should demand that the Fed take asset bubbles more seriously in the future. There is nothing more important that the Fed can do. So, what now? It should be apparent that housing is not a safe asset, even when we are not in a bubble. Those who advocate that everyone should be a homeowner are displaying their ignorance. Homeownership in many markets can be like putting all your savings in your employer's stock. Ask an autoworker in Detroit if this is not clear. Another important takeaway is that older Americans are extremely ill-prepared for retirement. The median wealth for families between the ages of 55 to 64 is $179,400. For families between the ages of 45 to 54, it is just $117,900. This is everything they own -- all their savings, retirement accounts and the equity they have in their home. The typical retiree in the next two decades will be almost entirely dependent on his or her Social Security check. Remarkably, in Washington, all the important people think the most pressing matter is finding ways to cut Social Security and Medicare. By detailing the economic slide of the average American, the Fed survey highlights a problem that is becoming increasing clear: growing inequality in our country. While most people are hurting badly, the very rich -- whose wealth and income have grown disproportionately big in recent times -- have largely recovered from the downturn. Americans should not tolerate a society where the rules are rigged to redistribute income upward. Otherwise, expect to become poorer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Baker.","Federal Reserve released survey showing average family losing 38.8% of net worth .

"(CNN)  -- Obvious observation number one: Judging by the high response rate of our last two columns on online dating, it sure seems like a lot of you out there are looking for love. Obvious observation number two: Regardless of whether you agree with our advice, tons of you still have a lot of burning, itching questions regarding how to succeed in the digital-dating realm. Obvious observation number three: We're not aiming to make like Carrie Bradshaw anytime soon (we're not really that into shoes), so this shall be our last column on online dating for a while. Which leads us to the biggest obvious observation of all: When it comes to online dating, looks do count. Before you start ranting and foaming at us about inner beauty, blah, blah, blah, we're not talking about how lustrous your mane is or how exquisite your bone structure. No, we're talking more composition here -- i.e. what pictures you choose when baiting the hook that catches the fish of love (mmm, wriggly). Here are six examples of what will get you tossed back into the sea. 1). Baby on board . Why they're clicking ""next"": Featuring a picture with a baby does not make you look sensitive, it makes you look like you have a child. Nix all pics of you and spawn. If you happen to look really winning in your nephew's birthday snap and you can't possibly crop the tot, go ahead and include it in your gallery (not as your profile pic) and make sure to explain its origins in the caption. Otherwise, you're that weird dude/girl at a ""Dora The Explorer"" bash. However, if you do, in fact, have a child, by all means let all future Daddy Warbuckses and Maria Rainers know. 2). The wo/man behind the mask . Why they're clicking ""next"": Including a picture from this year's Halloween extravaganza can be a great way to show potential soul mates your ""fun side."" However, when your profile snap depicts you dressed as Hunter S. Thompson in ""Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas"" when most days you're adorned in chinos and polos, the ladies -- they get confused. When choosing a main pic, make sure to show the masses what you look like on any given day, not just October 31. Either that or execute a gonzo makeover posthaste. 3). More than one's a crowd . Why they're clicking ""next"": We're going to refrain from telling you at this juncture to cut out any pics of you and your ex (because if we have to tell you that, you're likely not over your ex, and you should likely not be online dating). No, we're just going to lay down this general rule: When it comes to digital dating, you should go it alone in your snaps (unless you're a member of that new buddy system dating site, DuoDater). A group shot of you and your pals playing Frisbee or idyllically leaping in a rushing brook aren't all that bad (They show your adventurous side! We're using exclamation points because we're talking about dating!), but pics of you and three pals in the midst of arm-slung camaraderie are just confusing. Uh, which one are you? (Even worse: What if all your friends are better looking than you?) Oh, and don't try to blur or obscure your pals' faces as a way to get around this golden rule. They just end up looking like Marty McFly's siblings in that picture in ""Back to the Future"" (read: creepy and melting). 4). The meta snap . Why they're clicking ""next"": Oops, your camera's showing. We understand that it can be hard to find a good picture, that most of our friends are not, in fact, professional photogs, resulting in a veritable parade of pics in which one is caught mid-sneeze, -laugh or -oozing drunken 2 a.m. taco bite. But, my friends, amazing advances in technology have afforded us the ability to take pictures of oneself without resorting to the dreaded standing-in-the-bathroom-with-a-camera shot. Front-facing cameras! Computer-based photo booths! Our cups runneth over. While posting a ton of self-made snaps on social networks like Facebook can seem a little, well, narcissistic and pathetic (you have no friends, you have no friends, you have no friends), it's totally OK on online dating sites. However, have a friend look over your pics before you post. While you may think you look mysterious and dashing in the half-light of your darkened bedroom, the shadows playing off the sharp planes of your face, you may just look like a confused mole, squinting into the oh-so-captivating world of ""WoW."" 5). The -- sorry, I just fell asleep. What? Why they're clicking ""next"": A washed-out picture of a dude sitting on a brown vinyl couch. An overexposed shot of a girl in sunglasses and a ponytail posing in Times Square. A blurry, red-eyed snap of a bro holding a beer. These images are not even worthy of your Flickr account, let alone your online dating profile. Why? Because they might as well be of anyone. As has been established multiple times already, online dating is a lot of clicking through pictures, waiting for someone to catch your eye, so it's vital that you have some good bait. Delete any pictures that could have been taken in Anywheresville, USA, and opt instead for a photo of you posing with your prize-winning 100-pound pumpkin/busting out your rad jump-kick skills/pretending to make out with the giant mouse at Mars' Cheese Castle. Whatever. Wake us up when you're ready to wow (not WoW) us. 6). Just a torso .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A 14-year-old Indian actress, Taruni Sachdev, was among the passengers who died in Monday's plane crash in Nepal, officials said. Jaikumar Thakur, a doctor at the Indian embassy in Kathmandu, told CNN that Sachdev was traveling with her mother, who also lost her life in the crash. The two were among 21 people on board a small plane that crashed after it was unable to land in a mountainous area of Nepal, killing 15. The plane was about a mile from the airport at Jomsom, a popular tourist town in central Nepal, when it went down, said Purusottam Shakya, deputy director of air traffic service operations in Kathmandu. It was operated by Agni Air, a Nepalese carrier. Taruni shot to national fame for her role as a schoolgirl alongside India's superstar Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek in ""Paa"" (Father), a movie with disability as its theme. Amitabh, who played Abhishek's son in the film, portrayed a child with a genetic condition that leads to premature ageing. ""Just reading that Tarini (Taruni) Sachdev the girl child artist in Paa, has perished in Nepal plane crash... please God may this not be true,"" Bachchan senior tweeted after the crash. Abhishek Bachchan also mourned the loss. ""SHOCKED and very saddened to hear about the Nepal plane crash. Lost 1 of my cutest co-stars. Little Taruni Sachdev from PAA. Speechless.....,"" he said in a tweet. Taruni also starred in dozens of TV commercials.","Taruni's mother also died in the crash .

"(CNN) -- Park Geun-hye is living up to her nickname, the ""Queen of Elections."" A day after her ruling Saenuri (or New Frontier) party won a majority in general elections, Park, its leader and likely presidential candidate, pledged that people's lives will get better. ""[We] will be sure to put into practice all the things we promised to the people,"" she said, according to Yonhap News Agency. ""[We] will start anew with the mindset that we will be remembered as sinners if we revert to the old ways of the past."" Of the 299 seats up for grabs in the National Assembly, Saenuri won 152 seats, while the opposition Democratic United Party (DUP) took 127. The election results are expected to boost Park's chances in the presidential election in December. Acknowledging defeat, the DUP's Secretary-General Park Sun-sook apologized for disappointing the party's supporters after pre-vote predictions of a landslide victory. ""The Democratic Party failed to turn public calls for punishing the current government and the ruling party into reality. We are sorry to disappoint the people,"" Park said. ""We will deeply reflect upon the meaning of today and try ceaselessly to be reborn as a party that the people can rely on."" Voter turnout this year was 54.3%, up 8.2% from the election four years ago. In the run-up to polling, a series of corruption scandals battered public confidence in traditional political parties. The ruling party was no exception: It changed its name from the Grand National Party to Saenuri in February to signal change. DUP's popularity also plunged amid revelations one of its candidates, Kim Yong-min, made sexist comments during a 2004 Internet radio talk show. The party apologized for the incident but did not remove Kim from office.","Results expected to boost Park's chances in December presidential election .

"(CNN) -- Greg Waldorf never imagined he would be running an Internet dating service. As a young boy it was technology that fascinated him. So much so that Waldorf started a software consulting company before he even began high school. He clearly had drive and a head for business, but matchmaking? It is not as far off as it may sound. eHarmony uses advanced technology to create personality profiles to match prospective couples, and it was that element that convinced Waldorf to become an early investor. ""My background is in technology and I came to eHarmony loving the research and scientific part of it, but once you start realizing what we are doing for our subscribers and you start seeing all the successes, the families that have been created... I really don't think there is another job I can imagine doing other than being CEO of eHarmony."" eHarmony says its goal is not just to find users dates -- It wants them to get married. In fact, the company claims that 236 people a day in the U.S. are married as a result of meeting through their site. Their success has not come without controversy. The company was sued in California for excluding gays. Others have complained they have been turned down without explanation. When I asked Waldorf about this, he said that in the future the company may look into providing different services, including same-sex, but that at the moment their research was designed specifically for heterosexual couples looking for marriage. I also asked about religion. eHarmony's founder, Neil Clark Warren, was an evangelical Christian with strong ties to the conservative Christian movement in the United States. Waldorf said the company had no connection to any religion and was open to people of all faiths who were looking for a happy long-term relationship. One of the perils of being CEO of a matchmaking service is that people tend to think you are an expert on the subject. He joked about people asking him to comment on celebrity couples during interviews and getting tapped for dating advice at dinner parties. But all kidding aside, Waldorf is acutely aware of how sensitive the business can be. ""This is a service that people come to with incredible expectations, that presents a challenge for us, because they want to meet their soul mate."" Though he is passionate about eHarmony's ability to help people find love, Waldorf met his wife the old-fashioned way -- through friends!","Waldorf started a software consulting company before he began high school .

"(CNN) -- Three prisoners -- including one considered to be among Belgium's most dangerous criminals -- have broken out of a prison near Bruges in a daring helicopter escape. Mohammed Johry, Abdel Had Kahjary Mulloul and Ashraf Sekkaki escaped a Belgium prison. Thursday's jailbreak prompted Interpol to issue an international alert to police around the world to be on the lookout for the men. Accomplices of the three inmates hijacked a helicopter and forced the pilot to land in the prison courtyard, Interpol said. The fugitives are Mohammed Johry, Abdel Had Kahjary Mulloul and Ashraf Sekkaki. Sekkaki is considered one of Belgium's most dangerous criminals, Interpol said, with more than 16 convictions for violence, including bank robbery and kidnapping. A 22-year-old man of Moroccan origin was an accomplice to the group but had to stay behind because the helicopter couldn't carry everyone, the Belga news agency reported. Jailbreaks by helicopter are becoming ""far too common"" worldwide, Interpol Secretary-General Ronald Noble said. That highlights the need for countries to report the identity of escapees as quickly as possible, he said. ""It is vital that police have the information they need to locate, identify and arrest these fugitives,"" he said. Belga identified the helicopter pilot as Ludwig Louwagie and said he was unhurt. ""It was just like in a film,"" Louwagie told the news agency. He said a couple had booked a sightseeing tour of the Bruges region Thursday afternoon. While in flight, the man suddenly pressed a weapon against his temple, Louwagie told Belga. The man took away his headset so the pilot couldn't talk to ground control and forced Louwagie to land in the prison courtyard, he said. ""I tried to land next to the prison, but the weapon was still pressed hard against my temple,"" he said. ""I had no choice.""","Three inmates escape from Belgium prison in helicopter .

"(CNN) -- European football's governing body fined Germany's national soccer body â‚¬25,000 ($31,000) Tuesday over what witnesses say was the display of neo-Nazi symbols by German fans at a Euro 2012 match.

"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) -- For just a moment we can hardly believe what is happening. The boyish leader takes a step towards the microphone, the massed ranks of the huge army he commands poised before him. And then he speaks. The adoring crowd who have been chanting his name falls silent. Kim Jong Un, not yet 30 years old, appears slightly nervous. His voice doesn't waver but his body moves back and forth restlessly and his eyes dart around. If his nerves betray him slightly, his words stay strong. He stands atop the shoulders of the men who have gone before him, his grandfather and father. Directly below him hang the huge portraits of the man North Koreans call the Great Leader, Kim il Sung, and his son the so-called Dear Leader, Kim Jong Il. North Korea marks founder's 100th birthday . The third generation of the Kim dynasty pledges to build on his family's legacy. But already, just with this speech, he is veering from their path. It is something his father never did. North Koreans I speak to say they can't recall ever hearing his voice. To be here now is ""the greatest gift I have received in my life,"" one man says. Kim Jong Un is speaking to two audiences: his people and the outside world he stands apart from. The newly-crowned Supreme Leader has a vowed to try to unite the fractured Korean nation, still separated after more than half a century. ""We have suffered the pain of separation for nearly 70 years,"" he declares. ""We have lived as one people on the same land for thousands of years to suffer like this is heartbreaking. ""Our party and our government will work with anyone who truly wants reunification."" But this is not a day for talk of peace. This is a military parade with all the menace this isolated nation can muster. To North Koreans this says they can defend themselves. To their enemies, especially the United States, there is a deadly message. ""Our military has become a powerful military able to handle any kind of modern warfare, with complete offensive and defensive capabilities,"" Kim says. ""The foreign powers are not the only ones with monopoly on military supremacy, and the days of their threatening and lying to us with atomic weapons is forever gone."" It is 100 years since the birth of the founding father of the nation, Kim il Sung. Installed as leader by Russia in 1945 after the liberation and the separation of North and South Korea, he is still revered as a freedom fighter and hero. To honor his birthday, the military, one of the largest on earth, shows off its arsenal. Soldiers -- men and women -- goose step with precision, while columns of tanks bearing the message ""we will smash the United States imperialists"" roll across the great parade square. The latest hi-tech weapons then follow, including drones and missiles that could potentially strike targets thousands of miles away. This is an army battle ready, a country still technically at war and soldiers determined to follow any order. ""With the strategy of the Great Leader Kim Il Sung, the dear Kim Jong il and Kim Jong Un, and with our bombs and weapons, we will destroy them,"" a group of soldiers tells me. In North Korea the army comes first, no expense spared. While it shows off its guns to the world, many people go hungry. The military is well fed, but aid agencies say the country's rural population suffers from chronic malnutrition and stunted growth as they scrounge for food. In a rare concession, Kim says this regime will not allow people to suffer any more -- as close as he could get to admitting the government had failed the people in the past. ""Our fellow citizens, who are the best citizens in the world, who have overcome countless struggles and hardships, it is our party's firmest resolve not to let our citizens go hungry again,"" he says. Across the capital, people watching on are alive to this moment. When I approach one group and merely mention the name Kim Jong Un they explode into chants and loud clapping. One man beaming at our camera says, ""we want to tell the world how proud we are to have such a man to lead us."" Kim has inherited the power, adulation and responsibility few people could possibly be prepared for. The world is watching and wondering if he will be different from his forefathers and whether he will even survive. When the parade passes, Kim will face the reality of ruling this poverty-stricken, pariah state.","Kim Jong Un spoke during a celebration in Pyongyang marking Kim Il Sung's birth 100 years earlier .

"Juba, South Sudan (CNN) -- Sudanese warplanes crossed a disputed border region to strike Monday in South Sudan, escalating fighting that threatens to return the neighboring African countries to full-scale war, a witness said. A Sudanese military commander, Kamal Marouf, was quoted by Radio Sudan's website as saying that more than 1,200 South Sudanese had been killed. A Sudanese military spokesman denied that Sudan had used military aircraft to bomb the south. ""We have nothing to do with what's going on in Unity state,"" he said, implying that militias or South Sudanese rebels were behind any fighting. The report of the bombing of the towns of Bentiu and Rubkona came days after South Sudan pulled its troops at the request of the United Nations from the disputed oil-rich region of Heglig, though Sudan says its soldiers retook the area from South Sudanese soldiers. Two fighter jets fired four missiles at the neighboring towns, divided by a river, hitting an open-air market and killing at least one person, said journalist Alan Boswell, who is in Bentiu. Boswell was in his car crossing the bridge between the two towns when anti-aircraft fire erupted. That was followed, he said, by missile strikes. ""I saw one boy who about 10 years old who was completely burned,"" he said. ""There are other casualties."" The remains of thatch-covered stalls in Rubkona smoldered for hours after the morning bombing, Boswell said. In a statement, South Sudan Information Minister Banaba Marial Benjamin said that three bombs had struck a market in Bentiu, killing two civilians, including a 12-year-old boy. ""The Security Council must take its responsibility and punish the Republic of Sudan for continuing this aerial bombardment and the violation of the airspace of Sudan,"" he said. Soon after, the United Nations called for Sudan to halt the aerial bombings after what it described as four morning attacks, including one on the capital of oil-rich Unity state. ""These indiscriminate bombings resulting in the loss of civilian lives must stop,"" said Hilde F. Johnson, special representative of the secretary-general for South Sudan, in a statement. Ban Ki-moon condemned the bombardment and called on Sudan to cease all hostilities immediately, a spokesman for the secretary-general said in a statement. He called on Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir and South Sudan's President Salva Kiir ""to stop the slide towards further confrontation and urges both sides to return to dialogue as a matter of urgency,"" the statement said. The U.N. peacekeeping mission said one of its helicopters was in the air during the 8:30 a.m. attack on Bentiu, the Unity state capital. ""The U.N. helicopter was in the vicinity at the time of the bombing, and it took off and landed without damage,"" said Josephine Guerrero, a spokeswoman for the mission. In the hours after the airstrikes, the military presence in the area increased, Boswell said. Two South Sudanese generals who were arriving near the towns said the airstrikes marked ""a clear escalation"" by Sudan, he said. In addition to the airstrikes, fighting continued Monday in several areas of the border region, said South Sudan's military spokesman, Philip Aguer. The attacks came a day after South Sudan said the Sudan Armed Forces had crossed into its territory and attacked two army bases. Southern troops had withdrawn there after occupying Heglig for more than a week. South Sudan said it was complying with a request from the U.N. Security Council to pull troops out, while Sudan said it had defeated the southern army and forced it to retreat. ""There will be no negotiation with the South,"" Bashir said Monday in Arabic on Sudanese government radio. ""We have spoken to them now with guns and bullets. ... We will teach the government of South Sudan a lesson."" First Vice President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha told parliament that the government will take whatever measures are needed to guarantee stability in Sudan, state-run media reported Monday. ""Taha has given a directive for immediate application of the Emergency Act along the border with South Sudan state,"" the official Sudan News Agency said. ""He said that the attempt of South Sudan state to destroy the oil facilities in Heglig can never cripple the Sudanese people, affirming that the Sudanese people are capable to renew its economic strength, provide resources and doubling its capability for production at all arenas."" In a speech last week, Bashir vowed to overthrow the government to ""liberate"" South Sudanese from the ruling party, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement. South Sudan's army spokesman, Col. Philip Aguer, suggested that the ground incursions and aerial bombardment may indicate that Bashir plans to make good on his threat to invade. ""There's a possibility that they're implementing what Bashir said,"" Aguer said. The Satellite Sentinel Project released images Monday that it said confirmed a buildup of military strike aircraft at two air bases. ""Many are in range to fly deep into South Sudan,"" said the project, which is led by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative. The project analyzed images of air bases at El Obeid, North Kordofan state, and Kadugli, South Kordofan, and identified 13 fighter jets, eight helicopter gunships and three Antonov transport aircraft, which the Sudan Armed Forces uses for bombing. Aguer said Monday's bombings were carried out by MiG fighter jets and Antonovs. South Sudan has accused its northern neighbor of repeatedly crossing its border since Sunday to launch ground and aerial attacks. Claims from either side are difficult to confirm, as journalists and independent observers rarely have access to the front lines. On state-run TV, a Sudanese government spokesman said Khartoum would respond to South Sudan's use of force with force of its own. The latest attacks came after Barnaba Marial Benjamin, South Sudan's minister of information, said his country's army had withdrawn from Heglig to bases near the border and inside South Sudan. Sudanese forces crossed the border and attacked them there over the weekend, he said. ""They are trying to drag us back into a war, and that's what the Security Council didn't want,"" he said. ""They must tell them to stop these attacks."" Benjamin said bases near the border had been repeatedly attacked by Sudanese troops based in Heglig and those attacks were what prompted South Sudan to take the area April 10. South Sudan split from the government in the north in July, officially breaking Africa's largest nation into two, the result of a referendum last year overwhelmingly approved by voters. The referendum was part of a 2005 peace deal that ended the civil war that had pitted a government dominated by Arab Muslims in the north against black Christians and animists in the south. In the separation, South Sudan acquired three-quarters of Sudan's oil reserves. The two countries have been locked in negotiations about how much the landlocked South Sudan should pay to use a pipeline and processing facilities in the north. While both countries claim Heglig, Sudan continued administering the region. Al-Bashir had vowed to ""never give up"" the disputed region. Sudan's oil industry suffered when fighting in Heglig forced a halt to oil production in those fields, which account for about half of the country's production of 115,000 barrels a day. Satellite images suggest that infrastructure in the Heglig oil fields may have been severely damaged by the fighting. The Satellite Sentinel Project released images Sunday that suggest a critical part of the oil pipeline infrastructure was destroyed. The collection manifold, which separates or combines oil flows without interrupting the overall flow, appears to have been damaged by an explosion. Each country has accused the other of being behind the destruction. Sudan has accused South Sudan of destroying oil infrastructure and said it would attempt to force South Sudan to pay for damages; South Sudan has said Sudan bombed Heglig field's central processing facility. Serious damage to the facility would prevent companies from resuming production and would require substantial investment to repair or rebuild. The renewed fighting follows a weekend appeal by U.S. President Barack Obama for the countries to ""choose peace"" and return to negotiations. CNN's Ben Brumfield in Atlanta and journalists Jared Ferrie in Juba, South Sudan, and Ishmail Kushkush in Khartoum, Sudan, contributed to this report.","NEW: Sudanese military commander says 1,200 South Sudanese dead .

"Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- The Turkish government reported a record number of refugees fleeing Syrian military offensives across the border, just days before the Syrian government pledged to withdraw military forces from population centers. In 24 hours, at least 2,741 Syrians fled down smugglers' paths to the barbed wire border fence, where they were met by Turkish border guards, the Prime Ministry Disaster and Emergency Management Directorate said. More than 23,000 Syrian refugees now reside in Turkey. The surge prompted Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu to make a 2 a.m. phone call to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, inviting U.N. officials to witness the growing refugee crisis firsthand. Davutoglu also told the U.N. chief he was receiving reports of Syrian military operations backed by helicopters from across the border. ""They are burning all the houses,"" one Syrian woman told journalists at the border late Thursday, as she sat with other refugees in a van awaiting transport to a nearby refugee camp in Turkey. ""It was a massacre in a Taftanaz,"" said another woman, who asked not to be named for security reasons. ""They butchered the people; they shelled and fired rockets; they displaced us. Bashar [al Assad] is an oppressor and a dog. May God have no mercy on him."" On Thursday night, opposition activists sent CNN video and photos of the devastated northern town of Taftanaz. The small rebel stronghold had been the target of days and nights of artillery bombardment as well as strafing from Syrian military helicopters. On Thursday afternoon, Syrian security forces observed a cease-fire, opposition activists said, allowing Syrian Red Crescent workers to collect bodies. Video shot on Thursday showed dozens of corpses, all of them male and some of them dressed in camouflage uniforms, laid out on the floor of the Al Kabir mosque in Taftanaz. Later, many of the dead were placed in a long, deep trench for burial. Grieving residents gathered around the mass grave. The total number of refugees fleeing grisly scenes like this has dramatically increased. Until now, the Turkish government has refused offers of assistance from international aid organizations like the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and has restricted access to the refugee camps. But on Friday, Foreign Minister Davutoglu suggested that a policy change was in the works. ""It is important for the international community to take a very clear stance with regard to the refugee flow now,"" he said. Davutoglu said he asked the U.N. secretary-general to take a ""much more active role"" in the refugee crisis. Several regional policy experts have predicted that a dramatic increase in refugees streaming across the Syrian border may prompt Turkey to move forward on plans to establish a ""buffer zone"" on Syrian territory. ""So far, the Turkish government kept the [refugee] issue to itself and did not let the United Nations take over,"" said Ufuk Ulutas, a Middle East expert with the Ankara-based SETA Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research. ""If Turkey receives 2,000 [refugees] every day, I don't think it will be a manageable number for Turkey,"" Ulutas told CNN, adding, ""If the influx is in big numbers, I don't think they will have any other options but to create a buffer zone."" Turkey last hosted huge numbers of refugees after the 1991 Gulf War in neighboring Iraq. The flood of ethnic Kurds fleeing a crackdown by Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein had long-lasting consequences on security in southeastern Turkey, where the Turkish state has long battled a homegrown Kurdish insurgency. Turkish officials have long denied speculation within the Turkish media about the possibility of a military intervention aimed at establishing a buffer zone in Syria. A senior Turkish official repeated those denials in a recent interview with CNN. ""We have said all along no safe haven, no buffer zones,"" the Turkish official said, on condition of anonymity. ""We're trying everything we can short of a military intervention ... to convince the Assad regime to stop violence and make a political transition possible."" Journalist Omar al Muqdad contributed to this report.","A record number are arriving in Turkey from Syria; more than 23,000 are said to be there .

"London (CNN) -- All flights into and out of London's Gatwick Airport were temporarily suspended Monday after a plane was forced to make an emergency landing amid reports of smoke in the cabin. A Virgin Atlantic flight bound for Orlando, Florida, left Gatwick Airport at 10:48 a.m. BST but returned to make an emergency landing due to a technical problem at 12:30 p.m. Emergency services were on the scene, and all passengers were evacuated from the plane, according to an airport statement. Virgin would not confirm or deny media reports that the cause for the landing was smoke in the airplane's cabin, but a spokeswoman for the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service said it sent six pieces of fire equipment to deal with an incident at the airport. The plane's emergency chutes were deployed to allow passengers to escape the aircraft, and four passengers sustained minor injuries, according to the airline. ""Due to a technical problem on board the aircraft, the captain decided as a precautionary measure to immediately evacuate the aircraft,"" Virgin said in a statement. ""Our teams at Gatwick are now looking after our passengers and assisting with their immediate requirements. Virgin Atlantic is working closely with the authorities to establish the cause of this incident."" Gatwick Airport's standby runway has been open since 2 p.m. BST to allow some flights to depart and arrive, but normal service has yet to resume, according to a spokeswoman. CNN's Richard Quest said the evacuation of passengers after an emergency landing is an unusual procedure suggesting that the incident was of a serious nature. ""The pilot must have feared there was a fire onboard or a potential of flames in order to order a full evacuation,"" he said. ""Otherwise you would just taxi in."" Virgin Atlantic said the Airbus A330-300 aircraft had 304 passengers, including three infants, and 10 crew members. Gatwick Airport is the UK's second largest airport and the busiest single-runway airport in the world. It serves more than 200 destinations in 90 countries for about 34 million passengers a year.","Virgin flight bound for Florida returned because of technical problem .

"(CNN) -- Another controversial immigration bill is on the horizon in the South, a regional battleground that has seen a number of states pass reforms on illegal immigration. Mississippi's Republican-dominated House of Representatives voted 70-47 Thursday to pass the ""Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhood Act."" The bill now goes to the Senate for approval, where it is also expected to pass. Both the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans, who won majorities last year for the first time in 140 years. Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican who supports the measure, said he believes too little has been done on immigration policies and a crackdown is urgently needed. ""Perhaps it's boat-rocking time in Mississippi,"" said Bryant, surrounded by fellow supporters of HB 488 at the state Capitol, where he passionately advocated for immigration reform. The Mississippi bill includes measures like requiring police to check the immigration status of people who are arrested. It would also prohibit any ""business transactions,"" including renewing a driver's license and getting a business license. ""Illegal immigration eliminates a lot of jobs for people who want to provide for their families. Passing this bill will open up more jobs and lower unemployment for the state,"" said Rodney Hunt, chairman of the Mississippi Federation for Immigration Reform and Enforcement, a proponent of immigration reform. Neighboring Alabama has one of the strictest immigration reform laws in the country. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, temporarily blocked the enforcement of two provisions of the Alabama law: one voiding contracts signed by those in the United States illegally and another prohibiting illegal immigrants from having transactions with the state for services, including licenses. The Southern Poverty Law Center said it has told Mississippi it will sue the state if the bill passes. ""I would suggest that just because the state can pass that doesn't mean it's a good idea,"" said Mary Bower, legal director for the SPLC. Said the governor's spokesman, Mick Bullock: ""Governor Bryant will not be deterred."" A number of Southern states, including Lousiana, Tennessee, South Carolina and Georgia, passed similar immigration laws at the start of the year in the wake of a controversial law passed in Arizona in 2010. The Arizona law became the focus of national media and legal attention. Among other provisions, it would require that local police, during the enforcement of other laws, check the immigration status of anyone they suspected of being undocumented. The U.S. Supreme Court plans to consider a challenge to Arizona's law in April.","The state's House of Representatives passed the bill Thursday .

"(CNN) -- Earle Hagen spent a couple of months trying to come up with suitable music for ""The Andy Griffith Show."" He awoke one morning, convinced the theme should be simple enough to whistle. In about 10 minutes, Hagen had composed the music that, like the show, became a fixture in American culture. Tuesday's death of  Andy Griffith, who played Sheriff Andy Taylor in the fictional town of Mayberry, brought a range of tributes to the legendary actor. White House mourns the death of Andy Griffith . For its part, YouTube showcased an eclectic mix of theme song variations. One clip features a hip-hop instrumental version. A whistling cockatiel stars in another, and a guitar-playing performer sings the little-known words to ""The Fishin' Hole,"" as the theme became known, in a third clip. Everett Sloane wrote the unused lyrics. In 1997, Hagen told the Television Academy Foundation's Archive of American Television that he provided the whistle for the original recording. ""I never whistled before in my life and never since,"" he said. After Hagen came up with the toe-tapping music, the show's producers filmed the familiar intro shot of Griffith and his son, Opie, played by Ron Howard, walking to their favorite Mayberry fishing hole. ""Andy can't go anywhere without somebody starting to whistle that theme at him,"" said Hagen, who died in 2008. Although he wrote music for other TV hits, including ""I Spy,"" ""The Mod Squad"" and ""The Danny Thomas Show,"" Hagen knew there was something special about ""The Andy Griffith Show.""

"(CNN) -- More than 10 million people -- almost one in two men, women and children -- in Yemen -- are facing a looming catastrophe. Families are surviving, but only just. Food and fuel price spikes, coupled with political instability, have left Yemen's economy in tatters. As is often the case, ordinary people are bearing the brunt of this crisis and have exhausted their options for coping with the extreme challenges that they face. Despite a new president and a political transition process underway, the humanitarian crisis continues to deteriorate. The economy has not recovered and food prices have not come down. In Hodeidah, a western port governorate where the largely rural population relies upon agriculture and fishing for livelihoods, the farming has dropped to a third of its normal production. Fishermen, large and small-scale farms, alike, cannot afford the diesel necessary to power their engines and water pumps -- even when it is available in the market. Many people lost their jobs during the political turmoil last year, at a time when food prices were skyrocketing. Like many families in Yemen with no alternatives, Mariam's sons left her and their young children to migrate to Saudi Arabia for work. She is 60 years old and sits in a one room hut which she built, together with her children, 10 years ago. She now shares it with her seven grandchildren. She tells me that like many others in the village, her sons were day laborers, and forced to migrate illegally to Saudi Arabia to look for work. ''My three sons are now in Saudi. They went searching jobs after they lost their jobs here. They haven't sent us any money yet. Last time, one called me saying that they couldn't find work and they are still being pursued by the Saudi police. He was saying that he won't send us money this month and asked us to find a way to keep going until they get a job."" Many families talk about selling off their few assets, skipping meals for two to three days at a time and pulling their children from school to just survive. With all of their neighbors in the same level of crisis, and the effects of the crises expected to deteriorate further, ordinary Yemenis have exhausted their options. Over the past year, one in three Yemenis purchased food on credit, and one in four are still falling further into food-related debt. Mariam describes with utmost fatigue how she turned towards creditors as a last resort: ""We live on 'please give me,' ' lend me until tomorrow,' 'please wait until God gives me help to return your money'; this is our life now."" But the creditors and traders cannot continue to have stock go out without money coming in. They have started to turn away families. Samia, mother of five, told me about her desperation at being turned away from the trader with tears in her eyes and her very sick child in her arms. ""They tell you, I am not God, I cannot provide ... even as your child lies there dying."" Life was always difficult, but the past year has pushed families to their limits. Mariam was among more than 100,000 beneficiaries that received cash from Oxfam's ECHO-funded Emergency Food Security and Livelihoods project (EFSL), created as a quick response to meet people's inability to purchase food caused by the current crises in the country. The project provided cash grants of $25 to families for each of three months. Those that received the payment included a diversity of vulnerable groups such as women, children, chronically-ill, disabled, elderly-headed households, and low income families. Mariam tells me: ''I bought salt, sugar, oil, flour, and medicine for one of my grandsons. I also paid off some of my debts. Those payments were enough to buy food for about 20 or 25 days... though it's only 25 days, it was a gift from God."" But despite the need for quick solutions like this, which meet people's immediate needs with dignity and can build towards lasting solutions, funding for humanitarian programmes has not been flowing fast enough. Food insecurity is at risk of becoming a normal part of life in Yemen, but the U.N. humanitarian appeal for the country has been just 43 percent funded. The crisis has worsened since the appeal launched in December, so the funds needed to help people in need are likely to increase when the appeal is reviewed this June. At this week's Friends of Yemen meeting in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, donors pledged a reported $4 billion in new funds for the country. The pledges are generous and signal that the international community recognizes the dire level of need; but it is unclear as yet exactly how this money will be spent and when it will arrive in Yemen. A good proportion of these funds need to be fast-tracked to meet the urgent humanitarian need. Almost half of Yemenis do not have enough to eat today and Yemen is entering its hunger season. The world can bring Yemen back from the brink of catastrophe -- but only if it acts now.","Oxfam: 10 million people in Yemen are on the brink of starvation .

"(CNN) -- A museum in Italy is burning artworks from around the world to protest harsh austerity cuts by the Italian government. Antonio Manfredi, director of the Casoria Contemporary Art Museum in Naples, kicked off the protest this week by setting fire to a painting by French artist Severine Bourguignon. Manfredi says the museum will burn three artworks each week as part of its ""Art War"" campaign. ""I have 1,000 artworks from artists around the world, and they're already facing destruction due to the indifference of the government,"" he told CNN. ""We want the government to pay attention to the country's cultural institutions."" In the face of mounting debt problems, Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti has enacted tough austerity measures in an attempt to keep the country from defaulting. Manfredi says those cuts have hit cultural institutions hard, and that a handful of museums in Rome, Palermo and elsewhere have closed in recent months due to lack of funding. The museum is only burning works with the blessing of their artists. Bourguignon watched the burning of her painting via Skype, Manfredi says, and artist Rosaria Matarese from Naples torched her wood sculpture in person at the museum on Wednesday. Other European artists are joining the protest -- Welsh sculptor John Brown burned one of his artworks on YouTube, and Manfredi says other artists will light up their artworks via Skype next week. ""Next week the first one is an artist from Austria,"" he told CNN. ""I hope that the government stops me because this is terrible what I'm doing."" While Manfredi has never received government funding for his museum, he says he wants the government to come to Naples ""just to see how difficult it is to be a museum here with no money."" Manfredi says the government has yet to respond to his protest, and says he won't stop until they answer.","Italian museum to burn 3 artworks a week to protest budget cuts .

"(CNN) -- The Connecticut Senate on Thursday voted to repeal the death penalty, setting the stage for Connecticut to join several states that have recently abolished capital punishment. In the last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Illinois have repealed the death penalty. California voters will decide the issue in November. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to pass. Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, has vowed to sign the measure into law should it reach his desk, his office said. ""For everyone, it's a vote of conscience,"" said Senate President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat who says he's long supported a repeal. ""We have a majority of legislators in Connecticut in favor of this so that the energies of our criminal justice system can be focused in a more appropriate manner."" In 2009, state lawmakers in both houses tried to pass a similar bill, but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican. Capital punishment has existed in Connecticut since its colonial days. But the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after giving up his appeals. ""It's not a question of whether it's morally wrong, it's just that it isn't working,"" said Richard Dieter, the group's executive director. ""I think when you hear of 15 to 20 years of uncertain appeals, that's not closure and that's not justice. It's a slow, grinding process."" Eleven people are currently on death row in Connecticut, including Steven Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky, who both were sentenced for their roles in the 2007 murders of the Petit family in Cheshire, Connecticut. The high-profile case drew national attention and sparked conversations about home security and capital punishment. In vetoing the measure to eliminate the death penalty in 2009, Rell cited the Cheshire deaths. Dr. William Petit, the sole survivor in that attack, has remained a staunch critic of repeal efforts. ""We believe in the death penalty because we believe it is really the only true, just punishment for certain heinous and depraved murders,"" Petit told CNN affiliate WFSB. Advocates of the existing law say capital punishment can act as a criminal deterrent and provides justice for victims. Opponents say capital punishment is often applied inconsistently, can be discriminatory and has not proven to be an effective deterrent. They also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods, including forensic testing. ""Mistakes can be made and you may not know about it until science later exposes them,"" said Dieter. But a recent Quinnipiac poll found that 62% of Connecticut residents think abolishing the death penalty is ""a bad idea."" ""No doubt the gruesome Cheshire murders still affect public opinion regarding convicts on death row,"" said Quinnipiac University Poll Director Douglas Schwartz. That number jumps to 66% among Connecticut men, and drops to 58% among the state's women, according to the poll. The Senate's proposed law is prospective in nature, meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death.

"(Lonely Planet) -- Bali may have its fair share of tourists seeking nothing more than seven days of sun, sand and sex in the southern party triad of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak, but this only forms a small part of what's on offer. In reality, Bali is a lush Indonesian island teeming with cultural experiences, delicious food and exhilarating adventures. For those after a little slice of Balinese culture, food and adventure, consider the following, less-visited possibilities: . 1. Southern Bali: Bukit Peninsula . Good for: surf, seafood and spirituality . Bali may be known for beaches and cornrows now, but it was the surfers who first discovered this beautiful Indonesian island. Go south from Kuta to Bukit Peninsula -- Bukit to its friends -- and you'll see what lured them here. Head to Ulu Watu beach for the kinds of waves eager surfers dream of, or to Nusa Dua for some killer breaks around the reef. Note however that Neptune's fierce in this part of town. Only experienced surfers should attempt to brave the waters around the Bukit Peninsula. Lonely Planet: Top 25 experiences in Bali & Lombok . Explore Bali's spiritual side with a visit to Pura Luhur Ulu Watu on the island's south east. Perched high on a cliff top, the temple has arresting views across the ocean that will leave you gob-smacked. (Just don't venture into Ulu Watu with any loose items dangling from you. The temple is awash with pick pocketing monkeys, and before you know what's happened they'll have scarpered with your best sunglasses.) A trip to the Bukit Peninsula isn't complete without visiting the Jimbaren fish markets. Early morning is the best time, as the market's in full throttle for the day's sales. Finish the evening in Jimbaren, watching the sun set at one of the picturesque seafood warungs (casual food stalls). There are three strips to choose from, with the southern section (near the Four Seasons) generally agreed to be the best. Watch out for high tide lapping at any belongings left on the ground. 2. Central Bali . Good for: food, unique coffee and natural wonders . Bali's famous for the delicacy of babi guling -- suckling pig -- and no place does it quite like Ibu Oka in the centre of Ubud. For a communal experience, join other diners on the warung right opposite Ubud's palace. If you'd prefer to sit, ask the staff to walk you a little further up the road to the 'secret' warung. The prices are the same, but it's a little quieter, a little plusher and a little more tucked away. Nothing bonds people like a shared plate of succulently cooked pig skin. Delish! Metered cabs are rare in Ubud but there are plenty of drivers around vying for your business (of mixed quality -- if you find a driver you like, get his number!). However, more adventurous souls might like to jump on the back of a scooter and zoom up and down the mountainside. Better yet, from around 60,000RPK you can hire your own scooter. Once you get the feel of the ebb and flow of traffic, you'll be free to explore the beautiful scenery of Bali's mountains all by yourself. Scooter 16km north to the Elephant Safari Park at Desa Taro and marvel at the gentle beauty of rescued Sumatran elephants. Don't be fooled by imitations. The only legitimate conservation park is the one booked through Bali Adventure Tours. Lonely Planet: Bali's best spas and chill-out spots . From Ubud, hire a driver and head north to Kintamani to see the awe inspiring sight of Gunung Batur, Bali's second highest volcano. Its last eruption was in 1994, and traces of the black lava can still be seen. Worth it for the crater lake alone, it's interesting to see the bustling of villages so close to a potentially murderous natural wonder. Make sure you check up on volcanic conditions before you go. Coffee lovers should stop en route to Kintamani at Tampaksiring to try kopi luwuk. Famous for passing the coffee bean through the digestive system of a cat, this coffee retails for a whopping $US50 a cup elsewhere -- here, you'll get it at a steal for around $US4. 3. North, East and everywhere else . Good for: waterfalls, kite surfing and beach paradise . Cross through the mountain ridges at Danau Bratan, stopping for some sweet strawberries from one of the many roadside vendors. Head north towards Lovina Beach, stopping to check out the Gitgit Waterfalls. At Lovina, enjoy the chilled out atmosphere among the black sand and seafood warungs -- just as fresh but much cheaper than Jimbaren -- and revel in the lack of the tourist throng. If you can afford the time, make a little side trip to Air Panas Banjar, three natural hot springs open daily from 8am-6pm. Admission a steal at 5000RPK. On the east coast of Bali, Sanur is much more laid back than beachside towns like Seminyak and Kuta but it's worth a visit -- particularly for those after the oceanic thrills of the former without the drunken revelry of the latter. Sanur is one of the best places in Bali to try out kite surfing. Strap yourself in and go away with the breeze! If you can spare the time, there are few greater experiences than hopping a boat in Candi Dasa and heading east to the Gili Islands for beach paradise. Sure, we're not in Bali any more, but it's so close that you could be. Rapidly gaining in popularity, it won't be long before the Gilis are overrun with tourists seeking a blissful beach getaway with little to no responsibility, so get in quick. Just northwest of Lombok, the Gilis are a 90-minute boat ride from the east coast of Bali. Each island (Trewangan, Meno and Air) caters to a different kind of traveler, but all three share the same untouched beauty. There are no cars allowed on the islands, so get used to cycling or walking. Lonely Planet: The world's most unusual beaches . © 2011 Lonely Planet.

"(CNN) -- Large swaths of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic dug out Saturday hours after killer thunderstorms barreled through, a recovery made more complicated -- and dangerous -- by intense summer heat. At least 12 people, from Ohio to New Jersey, were killed as a result of downed trees and power lines. The destruction prompted the governors of Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio to declare states of emergency, with Maryland indicating it would do the same. ""This is on par with Hurricane Irene,"" said Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, referring to last year's storm that was blamed for at least 20 deaths across eight states. Neighboring Virginia was particularly hard hit, with six deaths. At one point, the Old Dominion State had about 1 million power outages -- more than any other state and, according to its governor, the most caused by any weather event that wasn't a hurricane. ""This is not a one-day situation; it is a multi-day challenge,"" Gov. Bob McDonnell said. Joseph Rigby, president of the electric company Pepco, said it could be a week before power is back up in some areas of Washington. ""Given the damage, you can understand this is going to take some time,"" he said. ""The wild card is the weather."" The storms raced east Friday and into Saturday from Indiana through Ohio and into West Virginia and the nation's capital, carrying winds gusting as strong as 80 miles per hour. They left behind hundreds of downed power lines and trees that littered roads and damaged homes. ""This was a storm that obviously came upon us very quickly, without a great deal of notice, and the devastation that was caused is very significant,"" New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said, noting there's a particular need for fuel, generators and communications equipment in light of the storms. Nearly 4 million people were without power across the affected states at one point Saturday, a number that dropped by the end of the night to around 3 million. Those killed included two cousins in New Jersey, ages 2 and 7, who'd huddled with their families in a tent in Parvin State Park when strong winds felled a pine tree, crushing them. Their relatives all survived relatively unscathed, said Larry Ragonese, a spokesman for New Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. Record heat, storms bring despair, 'horror' A 30-year-old Kentucky man driving in Clark County late Friday came across downed limbs. When Michael Martin left his vehicle to clear the road, county coroner Robert Gayheart said, a tree fell, killing him. In Washington, where 19 intersections were without working traffic lights at one point Saturday, a couple was electrocuted after they went outside to check on downed power lines. The husband was killed while the wife -- who is in critical condition at a local hospital with burns -- is expected to survive, said police spokesman Araz Alali. The storm affected Amtrak service, including shutting down service between Washington and Philadelphia on Saturday morning. But those most inconvenienced were aboard a train that left New York early Friday morning ended up grinding to a halt at 11 p.m. that night in Prince, West Virginia, after trees blocked tracks both in front of and behind it, Amtrak spokesman Steve Kulm said. Finally by 8:20 p.m. Saturday, the 232 passengers -- who'd stayed aboard the Chicago-bound train, which had air conditioning and food -- had been taken off and put on buses so they could reach their final destinations, according to Kulm. CSX, which is clearing the debris from the tracks, on Saturday night was ""working as hard as we can to get service restored on our lines,"" company spokesman Bob Sullivan said. 5 tips to survive extreme heat . The storm's fury was felt online, as well, when digital clouds were knocked out by real ones. Power outages temporarily knocked out some Amazon Cloud services in Virginia, taking down sites that rely on them, including Netflix, Pinterest and Instagram. The aftermath of the storm was compounded by a forecast of another sweltering summer day. Without power? Share your photos, videos, stories with CNN iReport, but please stay safe . One in three Americans baked Saturday in an area of nearly 600,000 square miles experiencing unusually hot weather. That included record-breaking conditions in many locales, with temperatures above 100 degrees Fahrenheit dangerously common. Excessive heat warnings were issued in 14 states, indicating dangerous conditions for those unable to find refuge in a cool locale. And while there may be some cooling in some spots early next week, temperatures still are expected to remain at least in the 90s. In storm-affected areas, many people had no electricity to run fans, air-conditioning and refrigerators. Emergency rooms in Prince George's County, Maryland, filled up Saturday by people looking to escape the heat, said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. She noted that libraries and community centers across the state would stay open late, to act as cooling center. And at the Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, just north of Washington, third round play of the AT&T National was delayed as trees and tents came crashing down and the PGA venue was left without power. 5 tips to survive extreme heat . By Saturday afternoon, the course was eerily quiet -- still closed to fans and volunteers -- even after play resumed. Even in places where power was not disrupted, people with no air-conditioning were advised to spend the day in a library, a cooling center or some other such place to avoid heat exhaustion. The U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention was among many government agencies trying to keep people informed -- from knowing when the food in your suddenly inoperable freezer can't be eaten to taking a cool bath if you don't have AC. WCSC: New weather bug system could keep carriage horses healthy . The Jackson County medical examiner in western Missouri, for instance, was investigating three deaths that may be related to the heat, according to the Kansas City Health Department. ""Current indications are that this heat wave will continue well into next week, though there is still some uncertainty in the forecast,"" the National Weather Service said in its warning around St. Louis. ""The effects of excessive heat are cumulative... Take action to protect your health."" Will 2012 be the hottest summer on record?

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan exited this season's Champions League to Marseille in a dramatic finish to their last 16, second leg tie in the San Siro Tuesday. Trailing visitors Marseille 1-0 from the first leg, 2010 winners Inter leveled on aggregate through a Diego Milito goal in the 75th minute. The match looked headed for extra time until a long clearance found Marseille substitute Brandao, who eluded two defenders before beating Julio Cesar with a low shot. Inter were stunned but had time for one more attack, Giampaolo Pazzini earning a penalty as he was brought down by Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda, who was sent off for a second yellow card. Pazzini converted the penalty with the last kick of the match as it finished 2-2 on aggregate. But the French side went through on the away goals rule to reach the quarterfinals of the competition for the first time since 1993 . The defeat will heap the pressure on Inter's coach Claudio Ranieri, who has seen his side win just once in 11 games to slide down Serie A. Both Wesley Sneijder, who was later substituted, and Milito spurned cast-iron chances in the first half to give Inter some breathing space in the tie and they paid a heavy price. ""This match is a picture of our season, we played better than Marseille and even tonight we had the clearer chances,"" Ranieri told Italian television. ""Over 180 minutes Marseille had three shots on goal but in football the team who wins is the one that scores, so well done to them. ""This year we haven't had any luck, I can't ask the team for more."" Meanwhile, Mario Gomez scored four goals for Bayern Munich as they romped into the quarterfinals with a 7-0 rout of FC Basel. Bayern trailed 1-0 from the first leg, but their Swiss visitors were overwhelmed in the Allianz Arena once Arjen Robben had scored the opener after just 10 minutes. The Bavarian giants had warmed up for the match with a 7-1 rout of Hoffenheim in the Bundesliga Saturday and continued in the same vein. Thomas Mueller added the second on 42 minutes before Gomez grabbed the first of his tally on the stroke of half-time. He added three further second half goals in the space of 17 minutes with Robben rounding off Basel's humiliation with his second before the finish. ""It was fun to play in that. To score seven goals in a Champions League match speaks for itself,"" said Robben. ""Fourteen goals in our last two games speaks volumes for the way we have played,"" he told gathered reporters. In the English Premier League Tuesday, Liverpool beat Merseyside rivals Everton 3-0 with captain Steven Gerrard scoring a hat-trick. Everton could have gone above their neighbors with victory at Anfield but were always on the back foot after Gerrard's superb lobbed goal in the 34th effort. Luis Suarez set him up for his second after the break and he rounded off his triple in stoppage time. The result leaves Liverpool two points behind sixth-placed Newcastle in the standings.","Bayern Munich rout Basel 7-0 in Champions League last 16 .

"Seoul (CNN) -- Luke Elie claims he and his American basketball team introduced the high five to North Korea. It's a big claim, but anything's possible after the group of fourteen players and coaches held a week of training camps for North Korean students in the capital, Pyongyang. ""We really wanted to promote basketball, diplomacy, friendship, break those barriers,"" said Elie who founded the club -- Coaches Team -- while living in South Korea. The club's stated mission is to ""use basketball to break down political and social boundaries that exist all around the globe."" Growing up with his missionary parents in South Korea close to the DMZ -- or demilitarized zone, separating north and south -- Elie always wanted to see what was happening in Pyongyang. ""North Korea was a place that was so close yet so far away."" Elie believes his was the first American basketball team ever to visit North Korea. His intention was to foster friendships and build trust through sport. ""We wanted to... bring in a whole team of Americans and say hey we're not those guys you see on posters,"" he said. ""We're not those guys you hate so much, we want to be separated from the government and let the government do whatever they want."" Relations between Washington and Pyongyang have long been strained. Tensions rose earlier this year after the North Korean regime defied international warnings and launched a long-range rocket. The U.S. and other countries saw the launch as cover for a ballistic missile test. But Coaches Team was adamant their visit would ignore politics. The players had far more interaction with North Koreans than most tourists do, although Elie admits the students they trained were suspicious of them in the beginning. ""At first there was distance,"" he said. ""But before the end of the games and practicing sessions, the kids were definitely laughing with us. It took a while to get laughs out of the kids, we didn't know why they didn't smile."" Basketball is one American import that the North Korean leadership may not object to. The young leader Kim Jong Un is believed to love the sport as did his father, the late Kim Jong Il, who is rumored to have been a big fan of basketball star Michael Jordan. Elie hopes that may help when they try to return next year. But even though the trip was a sporting one, the team did not escape the usual North Korean propaganda. They were taken by their tour group to the USS Pueblo, a U.S. Navy spy ship captured by Pyongyang in 1968 and told stories of the ""US imperialists,"" but that didn't seem to phase Elie. ""We tried not to look to the anti-Americanism or the propaganda, we knew it was coming, we were briefed ahead of time and we didn't want to get caught up in that."" The group also attended a Protestant church service. Human rights groups claim that North Korean Christians have faced persecution in the past for practicing their religion. ""To actually go there and be a part of a church service of that kind was actually very shocking, it was very enlightening and actually a very interesting experience,"" said Elie, himself a Christian. And there was the obligatory visit to the huge bronze statues of North Korean founder Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong Il. Other sightseeing tours included Pyongyang's funfair and the famous Juche Tower, named after Kim Il Sung's principle of ""Juche"" or ""self-reliance."" The players and coaches raised $50,000 themselves to fund the trip. They're hoping to find sponsorship for future visits -- and Elie is determined there will be more training tours. ""We've seen as athletes and as someone who's played and traveled all around the world and with groups that have done likewise,"" he said ""We've seen what basketball can do to break down barriers or race, religion and anything else you could ever imagine."" CNN's K.J. Kwon contributed to this report.","American basketball club held training camps for North Korean students .

"(CNN) -- Funeral services were held Sunday for Saudi Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, a hard-line conservative credited with pushing back al Qaeda. Nayef, named crown prince in October by his brother the king, was heir to the Saudi throne. Saudi state TV, which reported his death Saturday, broadcast Quran readings as an expression of mourning for the prince, who died in Geneva, Switzerland. He was in his late 70s. ""It is a shock. We all knew his health was frail, but his death is a shock,"" Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman Osama Nogali said. ""We still don't know the reason behind his death."" The Saudi Press Agency published a statement from the Royal Court, saying it ""condoles the Saudi people on the deceased prince pray to God to bless his soul and to reward him for his services to his religion and homeland."" Nayef's body arrived at the Grand Mosque in Mecca on Sunday. He was to be buried following the funeral in Al-Adel cemetery in Mecca, according to Oussama Nogali, Saudi foreign ministry spokesman. Saudi King Abdullah was in attendance at the funeral, along with Gen. Hussein Tantawi, head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. After the funeral, a period of mourning -- most likely for three days -- will be announced, a Saudi official said. The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement Saturday offering his condolences. ""Under his leadership, the United States and Saudi Arabia developed a strong and effective partnership in the fight against terrorism, one that has saved countless American and Saudi lives,"" Obama said. He praised Nayef for supporting a broad partnership between Saudi Arabia and the United States. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden similarly offered his condolences, and hailed the former leader as an important ally in the fight against terror. It is expected that authorities selected by the king to choose a successor will meet as soon as the mourning period is over, the official said. A new crown prince could be named within the next three to four days, the source said. Nayef served as Saudi interior minister since 1975, overseeing the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. He also served as deputy premier. A classified U.S. Embassy cable leaked by the website WikiLeaks described Nayef as a hard-line conservative who was lukewarm to King Abdullah's reform initiatives. Nayef led the crackdown against hard-line Islamists who took control of Mecca in 1979 and also oversaw the smashing of Saudi-based al Qaeda cells in the mid-2000s. In recent years, his son, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, has led the kingdom's fight against al Qaeda as the elder Nayef seemed to have taken more of backseat. On Saturday, the Bahrain state-run news agency announced three days of mourning in that country and ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff there and at its embassies abroad. Kuwait also announced a three-day mourning period. CNN's Rima Maktabi, Hamdi Alkhshali, Mohammed Jamjoom and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: The crown prince will be buried at Al-Adel cemetery in Mecca .

"(CNN) -- A widespread outbreak of severe weather across the Deep South may be one for the record books, as the National Weather Service received reports of more than 150 tornadoes. ""This could be one of the most devastating tornado outbreaks in the nation's history by the time it's over,"" CNN Meteorologist Sean Morris said. The unofficial number of twisters reported Wednesday by the Storm Prediction Center was 151.  The same system continued to spin off tornadoes early Thursday. The long-term average for confirmed tornadoes in April is 116. ""It was certainly a rare day that there were so many tornadoes that caused so much damage in populated areas,"" CNN Meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said. An official count is not immediately available, but Jeras said she expects that the numbers will reveal a historic April with a record number of twisters. Authorities were still assessing damage from the storms early Thursday, and it could be days before officials establish how many tornadoes hit. Several meteorological conditions combined Wednesday to create a particularly dangerous mix, Morris said.  A storm system that brought severe weather to parts of the South Plains earlier this week headed east, a cold front was moving across the Deep South and upper levels of the atmosphere were conducive for severe storms. ""It is tornado season, but an intensive event like this only will occur maybe once or twice a year,"" Morris said. ""It's very rare to have all these ingredients come together."" The deadly phenomena can be spawned from rotating thunderstorms called supercells, which can stretch across areas as large as entire counties. A tornado can form when a mesocyclone -- a rotating column of air -- is created within a super cell storm and is stretched to create a funnel-like structure that can reach speeds of up to several hundred miles per hour. ""Almost like when you pull the drain in your tub,"" said CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers. ""The entire storm spins and is focused and angled down."" ""When you have a storm all by itself like we saw yesterday, that's when you get this structure,"" he added. The worst tornado outbreak in U.S. history occurred in April 1974, when 148 twisters touched down in 13 states over a 16-hour period, according to the National Weather Service. The agency said 330 people died and 5,484 were injured in a path of damage that covered more than 2,500 miles. That month saw a total of 267 tornadoes -- the largest number recorded since 1950, according to the weather agency. By early Thursday, authorities said hundreds of people had been killed as storms swept through Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and Arkansas. And dramatic images of massive funnel clouds and flattened buildings left little doubt about the storms' strength. ""The storms are just amazingly explosive and they're covering a very large area,"" said Greg Carbin with the National Weather Service Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma. With the latest outbreak, April may turn out to be a historic month for tornadoes, he said. ""We may finish out April with more than 300 tornadoes,"" Carbin said. ""It looks like it will be a record-breaker as far as sheer numbers go. The numbers for April are definitely on a record pace."" CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","NEW: Tornadoes can be spawned from rotating thunderstorms called supercells .

"Tuscaloosa, Alabama (CNN) -- It was around by 5 p.m. Wednesday when residents first saw the monster tornado heading toward the heart of this proud Southern university town. Many prayed. Others grabbed video phones. Some fled for their lives. The winds hissed. The destructive force of Mother Nature that day won't ever be forgotten by the 93,000 people who call Tuscaloosa home. That day has united them, through horror and hope, tears and prayers. Michael Zutell, a manager at a CVS, rushed a family of three into the pharmacy's breakroom, where they huddled with employees. Their car had screeched to a halt at the door, the tornado just across the street. Not too far away, Lenora Bolden saw it from her front porch and cuddled with her 5-year-old daughter and husband. Her daughter sang out, ""Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!"" Bolden chimed in with ""Thank you! Thank you! Thank you."" Janet Puckett buried her head in clothes in an alcove of her house a few blocks away. ""Oh God,"" she said as her house trembled. Gar Blume had a different reaction. ""Oh s---,"" he screamed. Blume was in his law office in a Tuscaloosa neighborhood known as Alberta or Alberta City -- a working-class residential area east of downtown that's predominantly African-American and Hispanic. Blume would owe his life to five people who pulled him from rubble -- one of whom he said was a known drug dealer. In a one-block radius around Blume's office, he said, at least 15 people were killed. Sharon Burns had no way of knowing at the time, but Alberta Baptist Church -- the house of worship where three generations of family have attended, the church where her grandfather laid the cornerstone in 1922 -- was about to get pummeled. Just up the road, Alberta Elementary had stood as a beacon of hope for low-income children here. Built in recent years, the school was a state-of-art facility, complete with a computer lab, gym, library and plush rooms. Luckily, it was empty Wednesday afternoon. One of the few things still standing at the school is a doorway. Above it, the sign reads, ""School is cool."" As bad as the destruction is across Tuscaloosa, Ground Zero lies in Alberta, where homes and anything else in the tornado's path were demolished for blocks on end. ""I've never seen devastation like this,"" President Obama said as he toured Alberta during a visit to Tuscaloosa on Friday. Front yard a trash can . Janet Puckett stands outside what's left of her home on 30th Avenue in Alberta. Its walls crumbled under the force of the storm. Her living room and a front bedroom disappeared. The roof of the house got sucked up, too. ""A war zone,"" she says of the mountains of broken 2-by-4s and other debris all around. See hi-res photos of the devastation . She raised her three boys in that home, lived there for 30 years. She points across the road, three homes up, to where her truck landed in an oak tree. ""It's buried in a twisted part of the tree,"" she says. Her other vehicle got tossed across the yard, its windows smashed in. The tornado picked up a neighbor's home and dropped it across the street. The woman inside was killed. Puckett is glad to be alive, she says, ""but I've lost everything really."" She laughs, smiles and chuckles as she surveys the damage, her family all around. The only thing intact in her home is the deep freeze, which sits where it always has in the kitchen. ""You have to laugh to keep from crying, I guess."" When the tornado hit, she simply hung on tight and kept her head buried. Walls shook, dust fell everywhere. ""When I looked up, all I could see is sky,"" she says. ""It was still daylight. You see the pictures on TV of these war zones. That's what I was thinking of. ""My nerves were shaking all over my body."" Her youngest son, Tommy, was killed seven years ago at age 23 in a car accident. Her husband has been hospitalized for the last six months with an array of health problems. Now this. ""They say the Lord can't put on you more than you can take,"" she says. ""But how much more can I take?"" Amid the debris, she's found some photos of her youngest son, ""but not all."" ""I don't know where they are,"" she says. ""Under all that mess, I guess."" She tosses an empty french fry container on the debris heap. Her front yard is now a trash can. The family has planted an American flag out front, a ray of hope that they will rebuild. A few houses up, amid the twisted piles of former homes, someone's walker stands in a front yard. Resting against it is a young woman's wedding photo, a wide smile on her face. Roger Davis stands outside a cousin's home. He raises his hand and points up and down the road. ""This is Ground Zero,"" he says. Many people here are renters. ""Do you think most these people have insurance? This is just ridiculous."" ""Just take a walk through, it's a mess. It's a mess."" ""But I'm hopeful. There is some hope in this,"" he says. ""All I can say is God Bless America."" 'The woman with the baby is screaming' The CVS lies in the heart of Tuscaloosa's commercial district, next to the city's main mall and the Wood Square Shopping Center, just west of Alberta. CVS manager Michael Zutell herded workers into a windowless breakroom after news of a tornado was confirmed. He and shift supervisor Devin McAnnally then walked to the front of the store to lock the door. They couldn't believe their eyes. The tornado was across the road, above a Chipotle restaurant. A 4-door Dodge Stratus sped into their parking lot and stopped right outside the front door. A husband and his wife jumped out, the woman clutching their young baby. Zutell ushered the family into the breakroom. ""I've always heard the story of the train sound, and that is what it was,"" Zutell says. ""It was just loud as can be."" About 12 people were hunched in the breakroom. ""You're just hearing glass breaking, the woman with the baby is screaming."" Standing outside of what is now a shell of a building, he says, ""I thank God."" ""Absolutely blessed,"" McAnnally adds. ""It's mindboggling to think you walked away OK."" Zutell said. The day after the tornado, the two men were handing out water to strangers. Proof of how lucky they are lies next door inside the shopping center. Not a single wall is left of Big Lots. The Krispy Kreme and Full Moon BBQ are gone too. Cars tossed like toys sit on top of each other. 'We heard a freight train and we just cuddled' Lenora Bolden walks around to the back of her house where one of Tuscaloosa's classic druid oaks fell between three homes, only scraping one. Its trunk juts 15 feet into the sky. ""We're all safe,"" she says. ""That's why I can tell you God is good."" She lives at the edge of Alberta City. She's lived at the modest home for 10 years. ""My husband and I were standing on the porch and we seen the funnel coming across,"" she says. ""We heard a freight train and we just cuddled."" She was heartened by the community's resolve. As soon as the storm cleared and the sun shone, neighbors helped neighbors. Strangers pitched in, too. Anything to help. As she talks, about eight members of Tuscaloosa Fire and Rescue stroll down the street carrying axes and other chopping equipment. They've been conducting a street-by-street search of the city. Jim Ray, one of the firefighters, pitched in along the Gulf Coast after Katrina. ""This damage is much more devastating than what we saw in Katrina."" He keeps walking. There are more homes to search. 'It's just a building' ""Let's just say he's a self-employed pharmaceutical salesmen,"" the lawyer says. ""A drug dealer."" ""He gets free legal services for the rest of his life."" How anyone survived in Blume's law office is one of those freaks of nature. Nothing remains but a pile of twisted wood, smashed cinder blocks and wrecked bookshelves. ""We're grateful and fortunate to be alive,"" he says. ""Fifteen bodies were found in a one-block radius of my building."" He and his wife, Nettie, were inside when the tornado hit. The lights had flickered and he'd gone into the server room to cut off all computer systems. His wife followed. Then the walls crashed in. He got buried, she got slammed by an 8-foot-tall bookcase. ""Are you alive?"" Nettie screamed. ""Yes,"" he said. Her legs were pinned. Blume gently tried to make his way out. He heard voices and waved his arms. ""Help!"" The drug dealer and four other people, he says, ""dug me out and dug my wife out."" ""If it weren't for them, we wouldn't have gotten out."" Across the street, the sun shines through the roof of Alberta Baptist Church, many of its stained-glass windows smashed. Soft notes from a baby grand piano waft through the tattered area, a girl at the keyboard, surrounded by about 10 friends and family. The church has been here for 89 years. It had just gone through a $3 million renovation. Inside, the piano -- and faith -- is about the only thing still holding together. Sharon Burns, the granddaughter of the man who founded the church, sheds gentle tears. ""It's just a building,"" she says softly. ""But with lots of great memories,"" her close friend, Jeanne Silliman, adds.","Area east of downtown Tuscaloosa known as Alberta was Ground Zero for tornado .

"(CNN) -- When beloved ""Swamp People"" family member Mitchell Guist died Monday, tributes began pouring in for the Louisiana alligator hunter. Guist was part of the reality TV show that has attracted viewers to its portrayal of the unique Cajun lifestyle, as seen through the eyes of people who make their living in the vast, mysterious landscape of Louisiana's largest swamp, the Atchafalaya River Basin. What is 'Swamp People'? The History Channel show's Facebook page, already home to a loyal community of over 1 million viewers and fans, has been filled with memories of Guist from the show, why they loved to watch him and prayers for Guist's brother, Glenn, who is also on the show. Tammy Noah Whitten enjoyed watching the relationship unfold between the two brothers on the show. ""I always loved watching 'The Guist Brothers'!"" she wrote. ""They were so sweet together. Mitchell will be greatly missed. You could tell they had a very close relationship."" Others loved to watch out for the brothers' ""shenanigans"" week after week. Their relationship and hijinks helped to drive the show for many. Bernard Hendrix wrote, ""We will all miss Mitch. He was something else. Along with Glenn they made you laugh about hunting or fishing, like the time they caught the gator. Or how Glenn would shoot Mitch squirrel hunting."" New Orleans between the meals . Linda Collins Barnes remarked on the Facebook page that Guist reminded her of her dad, while Shellie Poet wrote that ""These good old boys were the best.

"(CNN) -- Facebook's $104 billion initial public offering comes at a time when the United States is suffering a bout of self-doubt. Many wonder if America is falling behind as other countries are catching up fast. And yet the Facebook phenomenon did not occur in a vacuum. You might say it could have happened anywhere. But it happened in America. And there was a reason for that. A company created almost on a whim by a handful of college students rocketed to worldwide popularity in under a decade, bringing together some 900 million users and in the process transformed the way people communicate and interact with each other. It's no coincidence that Facebook, like Google, Apple, Twitter and Intel, started in the United States. It's also no coincidence the car, the airplane, the light bulb and the telephone were invented here. The fact that America is the birthplace of revolutionary ideas is not an accident. Here are some of things Facebook tells us about America -- not just what is right but what requires careful, urgent nurturing to preserve. Still brewing that magic potion . The modern world knows there is a special, mysterious magic about America. Despite many serious problems, the main ingredients of that unique recipe remain. The United States has created an environment that fosters innovation and promotes creativity. There is no better place on earth to break with convention, think differently and blaze one's own path. America's government may look dysfunctional, its schools leave much to be desired and its financial institutions have the potential to cause disasters, but on the individual level the drive to dream big is as strong as ever. And the structure of support for those who have great ideas is still in place. How America shapes the world . The days when Washington's wish was the world's command are over. But America's ""soft power"" lives on. The great events of our time have unfolded partly as a result of American technologies. The Arab Spring of 2011 was aided by Facebook and Twitter. Interpersonal relationships have been recast by social media. The industrialized world could hardly function without its Google searches and iPhones. American movies, TV shows and music are emulated. The drive of immigrant minds . America's not-so-secret formula has always included attracting immigrants and helping them and their children flourish. According to a report by the Partnership for a New American Economy, more than 40% of the 2010 Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. One of Facebook's founders, Eduardo Saverin, was born in Brazil. Google's co-founder, Sergey Brin, came from Russia. Zuckerberg's ancestors, as well as those of Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, were Jewish immigrants. As long as America continues to attract and welcome people with intelligence and entrepreneurial spirit, the country will pulsate with creative force. Designed in America, made in China . Americans may be rolling out one great idea after another, but other countries are getting many of the jobs that come from its inventions. The iPad alone has created 700,000 manufacturing jobs in China. While American students are falling behind in international tests, the U.S. still has one of the best higher education systems in the world. We need to make sure our students not only attend college, but study the areas that will be critical to the future: science, technology, engineering and math. Maybe then they will find the ways that will allow American ideas to fuel employment in the country. Government policies matter . Facebook is successful because bright minds created it, venture capitalists supported it and consumers embraced it. But that's not the whole story. Facebook and other similar high-profile companies would not have made it without the right government decisions, ones that made the Internet possible or lowered the price of the microchips. While government funding of key industries is crucial, so is the decision to get out of the way at the right moment. America is one of the world's best places to do business since government does not interfere much with the private sector. China is trying desperately to become a science and technology competitor to America, but it drove Google out of the country and its heavy-handed tactics have led to technology that mostly copies other countries' ideas. It's not always about money . In the United States, people can make monumental fortunes when they have good ideas. But many of the most influential entrepreneurs are driven more by a sense of mission than materialistic pursuits. Zuckerberg could have sold out years ago and lived a life of luxury. Steve Jobs seemed unconcerned with worldly comforts. The real driver for these innovators is a wish to create and build. Those people whose only goal is to make millions sometimes live less fulfilling lives and occasionally cause serious trouble for the economy. Getting rich is fine, but it's good for society and the world when individuals work to build more than just a fortune. Young technology entrepreneurs can follow the examples of the giants of their field. As a society, America should highlight the need to create and build, not just accumulate. So, hurrah for Facebook. Hurrah to those who have transformed the world and our lives. And congratulations to America for creating a place where people's ideas can become reality. Now learn from what you did right, America. And remember, others countries are also learning from America's success. The secret is out. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Facebook's $104 billion comes at a time when America is doubting itself .
Frida Ghitis: There's a reason why the Facebook phenomenon occurred in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Indonesian authorities say they have arrested five people after allegedly finding $2.6 million worth of cocaine in a British woman's luggage. Lindsay June Sandiford was found to have blocks of cocaine in her suitcase after she arrived in Bali on a Thai Airways flight, government officials said. She covered her face as she was escorted in front of the media Monday. Sandiford -- who was described as a 55-year-old housewife by the British media -- has not made a public statement. Video from Monday did not show her speaking. Three other Britons and an Indian national are also being questioned, the BBC said. ""The cocaine brought by the smuggler was of the very rare type,"" Made Wijaya, head of the airport's customs office, told the official Antara news agency. Sandiford allegedly had 4.8 kilograms (10.6 pounds) of the drug, the report said. The drug sells on the black market at $533 per gram -- making the full load worth $2.6 million, the state news agency said. In the course of the investigation, authorities also arrested three more people from Britain and one from India in connection with the alleged drug transportation, all accused of being ""part of an international syndicate,"" the state-run news agency said. The British Foreign Office said it is ""aware"" of the arrests and is ""ready to provide consular assistance.""

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- College senior Kaitlin Ripple had always known the business world was competitive. Yet when she started Baldwin-Wallace College, located in a suburb outside of Cleveland, Ohio, she had no way of knowing how cutthroat it would be when she entered the ""real world."" Now with graduation days away, Ripple is contemplating her next move. While she'd love to stay near Cleveland, Ripple, who majored in marketing and minored in international business, is realistic and has expanded her search far beyond the city's borders and started researching other cities' costs of living and job prospects. ""I am looking anywhere and everywhere and make it known in my cover letter that I am willing to relocate regardless of if assistance is offered (as some companies no longer do I hear),"" she says. ""I have applied to jobs in the South and even in Europe. If I find an opportunity that I am passionate about I would go anywhere."" There are many members of the Class of 2010 who have stories just like just like Ms. Ripple's. While there's relief that classes are over, exams have been taken and term papers turned in, what lies ahead is an extremely challenging and competitive job market across the country. Top cities for new grads . While many new grads tend to look for jobs near their college or hometowns, scores of them are considering locations they might not have when they entered school four or five years ago. ""This job market is one of the most challenging new grads have ever faced, with fewer jobs available and competition from more job seekers who are likely to have more experience,"" says Nathan Lippe, career adviser for CareerRookie.com. ""New grads will need to go the extra mile -- both literally and figuratively -- when it comes to their job searches."" ""Many new grads are feeling the pressure of deciding where to live after college,"" said Tammy Kotula, public relations and promotions manager, Apartments.com. ""Finding an affordable apartment and a good job may determine where to live, but it's also important to look at cities offering the culture and lifestyle these young adults enjoy."" For new grads who plan to expand their job searches beyond their college towns or hometowns, Apartments.com and CareerRookie.com just released the third annual ""Top 10 Best Cities for Recent College Graduates"" based on the ranking of top U.S. cities with the highest concentration of young adults (age 20 to 24) from the U.S. Census Bureau (2006), inventory of jobs requiring less than one year of experience from CareerRookie.com (March, 2010) and the average cost of rent for a one bedroom apartment from Apartments.com (2010).

If you are considering expanding your job search to other cities, Lippe offers these tips: . • Be flexible and open-minded about locations and jobs you might not have considered previously. Even if you don't end up in your dream job, you can earn valuable transferable skills that you can take with you to your next job. • Contact an alumnus from your college who lives in that city and join your alumni chapter if there is one. • Get an insider's perspective by familiarizing yourself with the local media and other resources. Read up on the city's business and community news. • Develop a list of companies within the area and learn about their businesses and company cultures. • Register with a national recruitment agency; interview with a recruiter in your local office and have that person put the word out to other offices in your target cities. • Consider spending a few days in your desired city to learn more, network and set up informational interviews. In your applications and cover letters, tell hiring managers the dates you'll be in the city and available to interview. Despite a troubled job market, Ripple says she wouldn't have majored in studies that might have brought her more job prospects. ""I genuinely enjoy and have a passion for International Business and Marketing and I would have majored in it no matter what.

"(CNN) -- MotoGP leader Jorge Lorenzo hopes he can overturn Honda's qualifying dominance for Saturday's Assen TT race after setting the third fastest time behind Casey Stoner and Dani Pedrosa. The Spaniard holds a 25-point advantage over polesitter Stoner after winning the last three races in motorcycling's elite class. World champion Stoner recovered from a morning crash to deny Honda Repsol teammate Pedrosa first place on the grid. ""I tried my best in the last lap of qualifying but I made a little mistake in the last chicane on braking and lost a few tenths,"" 2010 world champion Lorenzo said on the MotoGP website. ""I was surprised at Casey's last lap; it was fantastic and so fast and Dani was also very close to him. We have a good position for tomorrow on the front row and we have a good race pace and I'm confident with the bike so I'm happy. ""Qualifying is one thing but the race is another, tire choice will be important for the race."" Stoner, who has announced he will retire at the end of this season, claimed his third pole position of 2012. ""This morning was probably one of my biggest crashes, which is saying something! The crash really knocked the wind out of me, I hurt my head, neck, wrist, knee and shoulder -- it was a bad one for sure,"" he said. ""The team did a really great job, they kept their heads down even when I wasn't riding to my full potential or the bike's full potential and when we were struggling to get the rear tire to work, they didn't give up. ""Then when we came back onto the soft rear tire for the first time since FP1, the bike had much more feeling and we were able to put together a fantastic lap and put it on pole. As far as race pace goes, we're still struggling and we need to work on this and make some decisions before the race."" The 26-year-old Australian, who also won the world title in 2007 with Ducati, has triumphed in two of the six races so far and was second last time out in Britain. Pedrosa, who is third in the standings 39 points behind his compatriot Lorenzo, was edged out by just 0.115 seconds. Lorenzo's teammate Ben Spies won the race last year, but will start sixth on the grid on Saturday. ""Qualifying was a frustrating experience. We tried a setting this morning and went backwards, so the first bit of qualifying we tried a modified setting from yesterday which again wasn't working so well,"" the American said.

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi will make her first trip outside the country in more than two decades when she visits Thailand next week to attend a regional conference, a spokesman for her party said Thursday. Suu Kyi, a pro-democracy campaigner who endured years of house arrest under Myanmar's military rulers, will travel to the Thai capital of Bangkok on Monday where she will participate in the World Economic Forum on East Asia, said Nyan Win, a spokesman for the National League for Democracy. The visit to Bangkok comes ahead of a longer trip to Europe next month during which Suu Kyi will make a series of key addresses, including the acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize that she was prevented from collecting in 1991 because she was in detention. Nyan Win and the organizers of the World Economic Forum declined to give more information about what part Suu Kyi would play at the Bangkok conference. President Thein Sein of Myanmar, the former military official whose civilian government has instituted many of the country's recent political reforms, is also scheduled to attend the forum. Suu Kyi and 33 other newly elected members of her party took up their seats in the Myanmar parliament at the start of this month, a historic step for the country's progress toward democracy. In the past 12 months, Thein Sein's government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. Those steps, as well as the by-elections last month where the NLD won nearly every seat it contested, have been applauded by the United States, European Union and other governments. They have responded by easing sanctions on Myanmar, which is also known as Burma. Suu Kyi's first speaking engagement in Europe next month is an address at a conference in Geneva, Switzerland, organized by the International Labor Organization on June 14. Then on June 16, she will deliver her long delayed Nobel acceptance speech in Oslo, Norway. After that, she will travel to Britain, the former colonial ruler of Myanmar and the country where Suu Kyi received her university education. While there, she will address both houses of the British parliament on June 21, a rare honor for foreign dignitaries. The relatively successful elections and Suu Kyi's freedom to travel contrast starkly with the situation in the country at the start of the 1990s. Suu Kyi led her party to a landslide victory in 1990, the previous time Myanmar had held multiparty elections. But the military junta ignored the results and kept her under house arrest. Myanmar's economy stagnated and its people lived under repressive rule until the military began to allow the fledgling reforms of the past two years. The progress the country has experienced recently in nonetheless qualified by ongoing violence between government forces and some ethnic rebels, reports of voting irregularities in the by-elections last month and the military-backed ruling group's overwhelming control of parliament. The U.N. secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, noted ahead of a visit to the country last month that Myanmar's ""fresh start is still fragile."" CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Aung San Suu Kyi will visit Europe next month to make several speeches .

"London (CNN) -- Europe risks being squeezed between ""low-cost China"" and ""high-tech America"" unless it can rediscover the knack for innovation, says the head of aerospace company Avio. Francesco Caio, the CEO of Turin-based Avio, told me that Europe's prospects were bleak unless it could find a ""new frontier of innovation."" ""Europe runs the risk of (being) squeezed between the muscles of low-cost China and the innovation of high-tech America,"" said Caio, a corporate high-flyer whose resume includes heading Cable and Wireless, Indesit and Olivetti. ""I am genuinely concerned that if Europe is not determined to go all the way we run the risk of having a 'half-baked cake' -- which would be very dangerous if ... digested."" European leaders need to face the fact that ""an industrial model that has worked very well to create wealth and growth has come to an end,"" he said. ""That is the challenge and that is the role of leadership in Europe -- (to) make sure we have the ideas, vision and new ability to mobilize the great forces and strength that Europe has for growth."" Avio is the prime contractor for Vega, the new European rocket system designed to launch the small satellites that are expected to be the main driver of the aerospace industry. Watching the Vega's maiden launch from the Guiana Space Center in February had been exhilarating, said Caio. ""You put seven years of development on the line -- you have a few seconds in which the system needs to perform particularly well,"" he said. ""It was a relief in the first 12 seconds, the first 24 seconds, and then it was off."" Made from carbon fiber, the Vega uses a solid propellant which gives it faster speeds than the Ariane 5. ""I think it lowers the barriers to entry for satellite launch, and for the exploration and exploitation of space technology, for smaller companies, university centers,"" he said. Of the nine satellites launched into orbit by Vega rockets so far, seven had been developed by European students. Despite the gloom surrounding his country's economic fortunes, Caio said there were ""two stories"" for Italian business at present. ""Companies that have a mix of domestic and export are doing very well, indeed, because they have hooked on to growing markets,"" he said. ""People who have been focused just on domestic market? Yes, they are suffering."" Avio was now looking to Brazil and China for growth, said Caio. ""We're going where new consumers are learning the beauty of flight.""","The head of aerospace firm Avio says a new model is needed for European growth .

"Beijing (CNN) -- At just after midnight on Saturday, in a bar down an old lane in Beijing, the band suddenly stops playing. Grabbing the microphone, the manager tells everyone to remain in the venue; the police are outside threatening to escort to the nearest police station any foreigner not carrying valid documents. The atmosphere instantly sours. This is just one of many incidents that have occurred in Beijing over the weekend following last week's launch of a 100-day campaign to ""clean out"" non-Chinese living or working illegally in the city. Until the end of August, all foreigners are expected to always have on them a valid passport, visa and resident permit, as stipulated by an announcement on Peaceful Beijing, the official Beijing Public Security Bureau account on popular Chinese micro-blogging site Sina Weibo. If not, they will face repercussions, which range from fines to police detention and deportation. A number for a hotline locals can call to report suspicious foreigners was also included in the announcement. Since then, the police presence in the main expat and student areas of the city has noticeably increased, households and companies have been spot checked, and queues at local police stations to register residency are large. Lin Song, media officer of the Exit-Entry Administration Department under the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, was not available to immediately comment when asked about the crackdown. However, last week in an editorial in the Global Times, he remarked: ""Some foreigners do not know Chinese laws well, and they might feel strange being randomly questioned by the police, but it is necessary to improve their legal awareness and make sure they stick to Chinese regulations."" Beijing police announced on Thursday that the city's friendly attitude toward foreigners has not changed. ""Beijing will stick to the policy of reform and opening up, and we sincerely welcome foreign friends to work and live in Beijing,"" a spokesman told the state-run Xinhua news agency, adding that foreigners' legitimate rights will be protected.Â . But the crackdown has left a bitter taste in the mouths of many, not least those who have resided in the city for years and see it as home. Media worker Jacob Trent was pulled off his bike by the police on Saturday and demanded to produce his papers. ""I have been living here for a decade and yet I still get treated like -- and sometimes called -- a foreign barbarian,"" lamented the American, who speaks perfect Mandarin and is engaged to a Chinese girl. Another longtime expat, David Park, was equally distressed. ""I have noticed a change in how I am treated. It has gone from curiosity to hostility,"" commented Park. The 27-year-old, an employee at a renewable energy firm, has been contemplating a move back to England. These events will make his decision easier, he said. Park was not the only person expressing a desire to leave in the wake of tensions. Mia Bate, an African-American doing an internship, has no intention to renew her visa once it expires in September. ""I never used to notice people looking at me on the streets,"" she said. ""Now I do and it makes me feel really uncomfortable."" The campaign comes amid a heated online debate about the behavior of foreigners in China. The most noticeable example has been the uploading of a video onto the Chinese video sharing site Youku of a foreign man sexually assaulting a Chinese woman in Beijing. The video attracted more than 11 million views and 80,000 comments to date. Beijing police revealed the foreigner in the video to be a Briton on a tourist visa. Police deny the incidents are related, but in the minds of both foreigners and Chinese they are. Prominent host on Chinese Central Television, Yang Rui, posted on Sina Weibo that Beijing must clean out its ""foreign trash"" to ""protect innocent girls."" According to Yang, they must ""cut off the foreign snake heads."" Similar rhetoric has been voiced by locals offline. When Beijing resident Mandy Zhang's mother caught wind of the video, she called her 26-year-old daughter and asked her not to visit places that foreigners frequent. For both mother and daughter, the visa crackdown might not be an ideal solution, but it is necessary. ""Police cannot tell who is good or not. Some foreign men come here with the wrong intentions,"" Zhang said, adding: ""We treat Westerners too well and this needs to change."" According to statistics provided by the city government, Beijing is home to about 120,000 foreigners. Most have arrived during the past decade, attracted by a booming economy and a visa policy that has been relatively relaxed. Crackdowns on this scale are very rare, with the last noticeable one being in the lead up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Lars Laaman, a professor of Chinese history at London's SOAS, who has lived in the capital on and off since the 1980s, says these incidents only occur when the government is feeling uneasy,"" he commented, alluding to events that have gripped the nation over the past few months such as the dramatic fall from power of Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. Whatever the cause, as China's economy continues to grow, its foreign population will likely rise too. Finding a workable solution to the visa situation will become increasingly important.","New regulations demand all foreigners carry a valid passport, visa and resident permit .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea said Monday that it would soon initiate ""special actions"" aimed at destroying the South Korean president and his government. North Korean armed forces will use ""unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style"" to carry out the actions, the official Korean Central News Agency said in a report, adding that the operation would take 3 or 4 minutes. It did not specify what those actions would involve. An unusual broadcast on North Korean state television also announced the planned measures and showed images of people throwing rocks at a caricature of Lee Myung-bak, the South Korean president. North Korean state media have consistently lambasted the conservative Lee and his administration. Recent reports have described them as ""rats."" One of the main motivations for the threats Monday appears to have been the announcement last week by the South Korean military that it had deployed a cruise missile capable of striking any site in North Korean territory. That move showed that Lee's government ""has long lost its reasoning power,"" the KCNA report said Monday, citing the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army. The South Korean Unification Ministry did not have an immediate comment on the statements from Pyongyang. The menacing comments from the North follow its failed launch of a long-range rocket earlier this month, which exacerbated tensions in the region. South Korea and the United States described the rocket launch, which Pyongyang said was to put an ""earth observation satellite"" in orbit, as a long-range missile test in disguise. CNN's Judy Kwon contributed to this report.","South Korea announced a new missile that could strike the North .

"(CNN) -- She was found still wearing the shimmering silver cocktail number she wore to celebrate her wedding. She was as bright as the sequins on that dress. Young. Beautiful. But within two days of saying, ""I do,"" she was dead. Police officers in the suburban Chicago town of Burbank found Estrella Carrera, 26, in the bathtub of the condominium she planned to share with Arnoldo Jimenez, 30. She had been stabbed multiple times. ""This was a brutal murder,"" Capt. Joe Ford, spokesman for the Burbank Police Department, said Wednesday. ""There is some aggression, obviously."" Police found no signs of a forced entry into the condo on Rutherford Avenue. They were searching Wednesday for Carrera's husband. Jimenez is the prime suspect in his young wife's murder and is wanted on a first-degree murder warrant, police said. ""It is important to know that this appears to be an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation and the investigation is continuing,"" police said Monday, before obtaining the warrant. Jimenez had known Carrera for three years and married her Friday, at Chicago's City Hall, police said. The couple had dinner with family and friends and then climbed into a party limousine to celebrate at a night club on the north side of town. ""She was happy. She was fine,"" Carrera's cousin Sandy Lopez told CNN affiliate WBBM. Carrera was more like a sister to Lopez than a cousin, Lopez said. At 26, she had her whole life ahead of her. ""Why? Why would you take her from us?"" Lopez said, struggling to comprehend how anyone could commit such a heinous act. The last time anyone saw the newlyweds was at 4 in the morning Saturday when they got out of the limo and headed back home to their condominium in a nondescript three-story brick building. About 36 hours later, police found her body after responding to a call from a family member concerned that there might be something wrong. Carrera had failed to pick up her two children, ages 2 and 8, as scheduled the day before. Family members tried to contact her and Jimenez on their cell phones. No one answered. Jimenez was last seen driving his black 2006 Maserati sedan, a car that Ford estimated was worth between $50,000 and $60,000. ""It's a pretty expensive car, without a doubt,"" Ford said. Such a car raises eyebrows in Burbank, a blue-collar community that is ethnically mixed. Police said thought and prayers go out to Carrera's family, especially her motherless children. Meanwhile, Ford said, police will keep ""peeling the layers of the Jimenez onion.""","Estrella Carrera and Arnoldo Jimenez were married last Friday .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House may have voted contempt charges against Attorney General Eric Holder, but that has not ended the investigation into who at the Justice Department knew about Operation Fast and Furious -- and when. Tuesday, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, sent a letter to Holder demanding to know who at the Justice Department was aware of a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives memo on questionable tactics, which was forwarded to ATF headquarters and possibly to the Justice Department one day before Justice sent a faulty letter to Grassley denying any ""gunwalking."" ""Which DOJ personnel received a copy of the February 3, 2011 memorandum before the February 4, 2011 reply was sent to me?"" Grassley demanded to know. Grassley said information he has received, apparently from whistleblowers, indicated the memo questioning Fast and Furious from ATF field agent Gary Styers had caused a stir at ATF headquarters. ""It has been alleged individuals within the Deputy Attorney General's office and Office of Legislative Affairs at the Department were aware of or actually read the memorandum before the Department's February 4, 2011 letter was sent,"" Grassley said. Grassley said he wants answers and any relevant documents no later than July 17, 2012. The issue is significant because the February 4 letter from Justice denied any ""gunwalking"" of illegally purchased firearms that had made their way across the Mexican border to drug cartels. But the Justice Department 10 months later had to admit to Congress that letter was wrong, and it was formally withdrawn by senior Justice officials.

"(CNN) -- The spiraling conflict between Sudan and South Sudan poses a threat to world oil prices, the prime minister of neighboring Kenya has warned. Speaking to CNN's Jim Clancy, Raila Odinga called on the international community to take a more active role in resolving the crisis that brought the two countries close to war in April. ""Certainly, if this continues it is definitely going to affect the oil prices and therefore the international community cannot sit by and just watch this happening,"" said Odinga. ""But apart from affecting the oil prices, many people are going to die,"" he added. Odinga called on the African Union (AU) to increase its presence in the hotly contested border between the two countries. ""AU need to send more troops to the border between the North and the South, and while they are there insist that the demarcation be done using independent forces so that the issue of border dispute is resolved once and for all,"" said Odinga. ""If AU does not have the capacity to do so, then the U.N. should complement AU forces."" Read more: Oil discovered in Kenya . Odinga's call comes as AU mediator and former South African president Thabo Mbeki arrived in the Sudanese capital city of Khartoum Thursday in a bid to convince the two parties to resume negotiations. South Sudan split from Sudan last year as part of a 2005 peace deal that ended decades of war in Africa's largest nation. The war left two million people dead and ended with the peace agreement that included an independence referendum for the South. Significant issues between the countries remain unresolved, however, including status of their citizens, division of national debt, disputed border areas and sharing of oil wealth. Simmering tensions peaked last month when South Sudan seized the oil-producing region of Heglig from its northern neighbor. Oil fuels the economies of both nations and Heglig oil facilities account for about half of Sudan's production of 115,000 barrels a day. South Sudanese forces withdrew days later after Sudan lodged protests with the United Nations and African Union, but South Sudan said it continued to come under aerial and ground attack. Odinga said neighboring Kenya wants the matter ""to be dealt with as quickly as possible so the humanitarian crisis is avoided."" He added: ""The previous conflict in the Sudan had a very devastating effect on Kenya because we hosted the majority of the Sudanese refugees in Kenya. As we are talking right now there is already an influx of new refugees coming from South Sudan as a result of this conflict, so there is a big fear in Kenya that we may again end up having to host so many refugees as a result of this conflict."" Opinion: Can Kenya avoid Africa's resource curse? In late March, Kenya announced that it had finally struck oil after decades of exploration. British-based Tullow Oil said it established more than 20 meters (65 feet) of net oil pay, which refers to the depth of the oil reservoir. But Odinga said that the experience from other African countries has shown that oil can either be ""a blessing or a curse."" On a cautious note, Odinga stressed that Kenya should not neglect other sectors of the economy in favor of oil. ""One-commodity economy is dangerous in my view because it is not sustainable and therefore in Kenya we must avoid the pitfalls that have been fallen in the other countries on the continent by managing this oil properly,"" said Odinga. Victoria Eastwood and Teo Kermeliotis contributed to this report.","Kenyan PM has warned the crisis between S.Sudan and Sudan can affect oil prices .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi broke his own European Champions League record as he scored five goals in Barcelona's 7-1 demolition of Bayer Leverkusen in Wednesday's second leg of their last-16 tie. The three-time World Player of the Year had set the previous best of four against Arsenal two seasons ago, and proceeded to go one better with a dazzling display in the Nou Camp. He now has 12 goals from seven Champions League matches this season as the defending champions waltzed into the quarterfinals 10-2 on aggregate against their unfortunate German opponents. The 24-year-old scored 12 last season as he was the tournament's top scorer. Messi's reaction to his feat was characteristically humble. ""The most important thing is that we won, that's what we wanted,"" he said. Coach Josep Guardiola said the Argentina forward ""is the best"" and ""unique because of his talent and for his competitive capacity."" ""It's not easy to score five goals in a game. We are very fortunate to have a player like this, we can only enjoy him and this team,"" Guardiola said after his team reached the last eight for the fifth successive year. ""We only try to provide the conditions so that he can receive the ball as many times as possible where he feels comfortable."" Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, the Bundesliga side could not contain Messi as he scored twice before the break in the 25th and 42nd minutes. Messi claimed his hat-trick early in the second half with a lob after he eluded a static Bayer defense from Fabregas' through pass. Debutant Cristian Tello added Barca's fourth, again set up by former Arsenal star Fabregas. Messi then scored from a tight angle for his fourth after a defensive error, and goalkeeper Bernd Leno was at fault again as he allowed a weak shot by the 20-year-old Tello to go in for the sixth. Messi's fifth with six minutes to go was unstoppable -- taking him to 49 overall in Europe's top club competition, the sixth highest total -- before Karim Bellarabi scored a consolation for the visitors. The night's other Champions League tie saw triumph for Cypriot underdogs Apoel Nicosia, who reached the quarterfinals for the first time in the club's history. Apoel beat French giants Lyon 1-0 after extra time for a 1-1 aggregate score, then won the penalty shootout 4-3. Dionissis Chiotis was the home hero with two saves in the shootout after Gustavo Manduca scored the only goal of the night in the ninth minute of normal time to cancel out Alexandre Lacazette's winner for Lyon in the first leg.","Lionel Messi hits record five goals Barcelona's 7-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen .

"(CNN) -- Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s fans and critics will find out Saturday night if he's still ""Money"" -- his nickname -- and still undefeated, when he takes on WBA super-welterweight champion Miguel Cotto in Las Vegas. The two fighters offer divergent personalities out of the ring, and distinct styles in it. The 31-year-old Cotto is more inconspicuous and workmanlike, while the 35-year-old Mayweather has a more flamboyant, brash reputation and a sizable cohort of celebrity supporters. Those wishing him luck on Twitter shortly before the fight included teen pop star Justin Bieber, skateboarder and MTV personality Rob Drydek, musician Akon, and Rob Kardashian of the E! reality show clan. The breakdown of the purse for the fight demonstrates the fighters' respective clout: Win or lose, Mayweather is set to pocket $32 million, while Cotto would get $8 million. While the odds are against him, Cotto declared before the bout that he had ""no doubt"" he'd win. ""I'm ready and prepared for anything he can bring to me,"" Cotto said. Physically, Mayweather entered the bout as the taller of the two by an inch, while Cotto weighed in at 154 pounds, three pounds more than his foe. Max Kellerman, a boxing analyst and commentator for HBO (which like CNN is owned by Time Warner) said Mayweather has evolved into a ""consistent, thudding puncher"" who counts on pressuring his opponent. In the other corner, Cotto is known for being aggressive and a deft puncher, added Kellerman. The Puerto Rican has lost twice in his professional career, most recently against eight-division champion Manny Pacquiao -- whom Mayweather has famously challenged verbally, but has never fought. After an accomplished amateur career that includes several Golden Gloves titles, Mayweather burst on the pro scene in 1996 and hasn't lost since. The Michigan native's athletic success speaks for itself, having won seven different titles in various weight classes in his career. But he's had his share of trouble outside of the ring. That includes a 90-day prison sentence tied to his conviction on a domestic violence charge, after police said he'd punched the mother of his children at his home. Mayweather had been set to go to prison earlier this year, but a Nevada judge pushed back his reporting date to June because the boxer had already lined up Saturday's fight date.","Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Miguel Cotto face off in the ring in Las Vegas .

"(CNN) -- The storm system that plowed through the South left scenes of destruction described as ""surreal"" and ""sickening"" by those who saw them. Authorities were working to reach those trapped; some states are facing a long and arduous recovery. Here's a look at the latest confirmed death toll as provided by state authorities as well as reports from some of the worst-hit areas. OFFICIAL STATE DEATH TOLLS FOR APRIL 27-28 TORNADOES . Alabama - 238 . Tennessee - 34 . Mississippi - 33 . Georgia - 15 . Virginia - 5 . Arkansas - 1 . TOTAL - 326 . Source: State officials . ALABAMA . The death toll from the severe weather in Alabama has claimed the lives of at least 238 people, according to state emergency officials. The state Emergency Management Agency reported 18 additional deaths in Marion County, bringing the total number of deaths there to 21. Sheriff Kevin Williams told CNN Friday afternoon that 35 people had died in the county, with the additional deaths not yet included in the official state total. The state listed 20 people as missing in Marion County. Tuscaloosa city officials reported 45 deaths as of Friday afternoon, but later revised that to 39 because of a counting error. That change was not immediately reflected in the state's total. Almost 1,000 people were treated for injuries in the city and 446 people were unaccounted for, although not necessarily missing. President Barack Obama and the first family toured Tuscaloosa on Friday. Obama met with Gov. Robert Bentley and families affected by the storms and promised expedited emergency assistance to the devastated region. ""We're going to do everything we can to help these communities rebuild,"" he told reporters. Medical personnel treated more than 1,700 injured people. Thirty-one of the state's 67 counties were affected by the tornadoes and storms. Bentley declared a statewide state of emergency and mobilized approximately 2,000 Alabama National Guardsmen to provide emergency assistance. Obama signed Alabama's Emergency Declaration and ordered federal aid to supplement state and local response efforts. --  Tuscaloosa: Mayor Walter Maddox described a surreal scene as the twister plowed through: ""There were parts of the city I literally didn't recognize,"" he told CNN's Eliot Spitzer. ""We have hundreds of homes and businesses destroyed, and hundreds more damaged. -- Birmingham: Severe damage was reported in Birmingham's western suburbs; Hueytown, Concord and Pleasant Grove saw ""catastrophic damage,"" said Hueytown Police Chief Chuck Hagler. ""I don't think you understand the scale of the devastation,"" he said. -- Hackleburg: Almost 30 people died in this town in northwest Alabama, according to the sheriff. Schools, businesses and homes were destroyed. -- Cullman: What was thought to be a tornado damaged a hospital, ripped the roof off the courthouse and pummeled a number of residences, authorities said.

Serious flooding was reported in areas of western Tennessee, and more than 130,000 were without power. -- Chattanooga: A 41-year-old woman was killed when a tree fell on her mobile home, according to WDEF. Her husband and son told investigators they were taking shelter in a closet when she walked over to a window and was crushed when the tree fell. In Chickamauga Lake, north of Chattanooga, no one was injured when a funnel cloud smashed into the Camp Columbus RV park, destroying several vehicles. Resident John Tripp told CNN affiliate WTVC that he saw the massive tornado form, taking up water as it crossed the lake, before it smashed into the campground. -- Apison: Eight deaths were reported in this community east of Chattanooga. Twenty-eight people were taken to hospitals. GEORGIA . The death toll in Georgia stands at 15, officials said Friday. Gov. Nathan Deal has declared a state of emergency in 16 counties. The state reported 115 injuries. The state has concluded search operations, is conducting preliminary damage estimates and has done aerial surveys. --Catoosa County: Eight deaths occurred here, according to the Georgia Emergency Management Agency. Three were confirmed in the town of Ringgold, according to the Catoosa County Coroner. The town in northwest Georgia has been hit particularly hard, with some buildings entirely demolished, Major Gary Sisk said. In Ringgold, the storm appeared to pick and choose its targets. Some homes were left virtually unscathed, or perhaps had minor roof damage. Others had no roof at all. Still more homes were simply gone, vanished into a pile of rubble. ""It just looks like confetti,"" emergency management spokeswoman Lisa Janak said Friday, adding 300 homes were lost in the county. -- Dade County: Two people were confirmed dead in Trenton, according to Georgia's Emergency Management Agency. -- Spalding County: The sheriff's department confirmed two fatalities. State officials said numerous homes were severely damaged. -- Lamar County: The state confirmed two deaths. -- Rabun County: One death. MISSISSIPPI . The death toll from severe weather in Mississippi has risen to 34, according to state emergency officials. More than 150 injuries were reported. One of the 33 deaths was on Tuesday. Another was a firefighter who died Friday after collapsing while clearing storm debris.

"(CNN) -- A Federal Trade Commission official announced that Twitter users will be able block personal data from being shared with third-party websites. The announcement came at an Internet privacy forum in New York, where FTC Chief Technology Officer Ed Felten announced the micro-blogging and social media service is participating in ""Do Not Track,"" the Internet privacy feature launched last year by Mozilla for users of its Firefox web browser. ""Do Not Track"" allows users to block third-party cookies, which are used to piece together Internet users' personal information and online activity. To opt into the service on Twitter, users must select the ""Do Not Track"" feature within the Firefox browser. Other top web browsers, including Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Internet Explorer, have similar features. According to the FTC, ""Do Not Track"" will not require the government to compile a list, unlike the ""Do Not Call Registry,"" which allows consumers to opt out of receiving telemarketing calls. The FTC has not voted yet on whether to fully support ""Do Not Track."" Despite not officially supporting the feature, the FTC was pleased with Twitter's decision. ""Twitter's use of 'Do Not Track' in its new feature is good news for Twitter users and a meaningful step toward broader adoption of a strong 'Do Not Track' system that will give consumers simple, comprehensive control over online tracking,"" said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. ""Hopefully other companies will follow suit."" Twitter was quick to praise the FTC's comments. ""We applaud the FTC's leadership on 'Do Not Track,' and are excited to provide the benefits of 'Do Not Track,'"" Robert Weeks, a Twitter spokesman, told CNN. The move comes at a pivotal time for Internet privacy rule-making. The Commerce Department and the White House have been working to determine what role federal regulations will play in protecting web users' privacy. In February, White House and Commerce Department officials met with Internet industry leaders to discuss Washington's role in protecting private data on the web. President Barack Obama said at the time, ""American consumers can't wait any longer for clear rules of the road that ensure their personal information is safe online."" Companies are increasingly facing scrutiny over how they protect personal information gathered online. Two companies feeling heat over their privacy policies have been Internet giants Facebook and Google. Facebook depends on advertising revenue generated from games and other third-party apps running on the site. User activity is tracked to help Facebook pick targeted advertisers for the users. Google's business model is similar. Both companies have recently faced a groundswell of anger when they announced major changes to their privacy policies. Web privacy advocates, including some government officials in the United States and elsewhere, have repeatedly expressed unease with the sheer amount of data Facebook possesses about its users and how that data may be used. According to Mozilla, around 9% of Firefox users opt in to ""Do Not Track."" The highest percentage of users turning on the feature live in the Netherlands, France and the United States.","FTC official: Twitter is participating in the ""Do Not Track"" Internet privacy feature .

"(CNN) -- The Lord's Resistance Army slammed ""Kony 2012"" as a ""clear act of malevolent deception and manipulation of world mass consciousness"" in an 18-page statement believed to be its first response to the viral video spotlighting the renegade group and its leader, warlord Joseph Kony. ""Behind 'Kony 2012' lurks the U.S.A., which is not a 'banana republic' state, but a world hegemonic power that runs a vast global network of war, intelligence and security institutions, and a myriad of their humanitarian front and service organizations,"" said the statement signed by Justine Labeja, a spokesman for Kony's organization known commonly by its acronym, LRA. Invisible Children, the San Diego-based activist group that launched the ""Kony 2012"" campaign, is one of those front organizations, the LRA charged. CNN obtained the statement, issued Wednesday, through journalist Frank Nyakairu, who passed it on along with the e-mail he received it in. He said it was sent to him from LRA representatives in Nairobi, Kenya, who have been quoted in international news media. Nyakairu is respected internationally for his coverage of the LRA. ""Kony 2012"" has drawn criticism from many corners but this was the first reaction from LRA. The video laid out the LRA's alleged atrocities over more than two decades -- killing and maiming villagers, recruiting boys to become soldiers and forcing girls into sexual slavery. Thursday, Invisible Children released a sequel to the original half-hour video, which was viewed by millions of people and turned Kony into a household name. The first video became highly controversial, sparking a flurry of questions about Invisible Children's intentions, its transparency and whether the social-media frenzy was too little, too late. It also drew criticism for not highlighting alleged Ugandan military atrocities, for not saying that Kony is no longer in Uganda and is operating with a much smaller army, and for casting a spotlight that might make it harder to capture him. The sequel, ""Beyond Famous"" addresses criticism of ""Kony 2012"" and explains what politicians in Washington and in Africa have done in the past month. ""We made the first video intentionally for a young Western audience, and therefore it was a priority that the video keep their attention,"" said Ben Keesey, the executive director of Invisible Children. ""This (new) video goes deeper. I think people will respond."" Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. The African Union said last month that it plans to deploy 5,000 troops to hunt him down in a mission assisted by 100 U.S. combat troops the Pentagon sent to the region in October. Kony formed the LRA with the intent of overthrowing the Ugandan government. Since 2006, the LRA has migrated to remote hinterlands on the borders of the Central African Republic, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has been on the run since being scattered from a temporary base in Congolese territory by a botched 2008 U.S.-backed attack on Kony's position dubbed Operation Lightning Thunder. Since then, LRA attacks have killed 2,400 people and displaced 465,000, according to Resolve Uganda, a nonprofit group that monitors LRA activity. Another 3,400 people have been abducted. The LRA statement said Invisible Children has been used to cover up the ""vile acts of the U.S.-supported military regime of Uganda in its dirty war activities."" It accused Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell, who directed video, of sanitizing the acts of the Ugandan military. ""In effect, 'Kony 2012,' whose falsehoods have now boomeranged on one of its authors and purveyors, a Mr. Jason Russell, constitute(s) the biggest ruse and the most sordid 'open air' 'sleight of the hand' act that has ever been used to deceive the gullible and the uninformed in the world,"" the LRA statement said. ""Millions have consequently had their intellect and minds 'pocket picked' and subjected to the most banal trickery, deception and manipulation,"" it said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Most of us go about our daily business never thinking about the U.S. Supreme Court or the cases it decides. But sometimes, it gets a case so big -- and could affect your life so much -- you simply have to take notice. This week is one of those times. The highest court in the land is preparing to tackle perhaps the most important appeals to reach it in more than a decade: the massive health care reform legislation championed by President Barack Obama. The court will soon hear six hours of oral arguments over three days on the law's constitutionality -- and your health and your finances could be on the line. Their eventual rulings in an election year will not only guide how every American receives medical care but would also establish precedent-setting boundaries of government regulation over a range of social areas. ""The implications in the health care litigation are impossible to overstate,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a prominent Washington attorney and publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. ""It has tremendous consequences for President Obama's re-election because it's a signature achievement. But in terms of law, this case is really going to decide how much power Congress has to regulate spheres that we've often thought of as the jobs of the states or of just individuals."" A century of federal efforts to offer universal health care culminated with the 2010 passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. After months of bare-knuckled fights over politics and policy, the legislation signed by Obama reached 2,700 pages, nine major sections and 450 some provisions. The U.S. Supreme Court: How it works . The partisan debate around such a sweeping piece of legislation has encompassed traditional hot-button topics: abortion and contraception funding, state and individual rights, federal deficits, end-of-life-care and the overall economy. The high court now gets the final word. ""These issues are really central to whether the federal government can regulate anything it wants to, or whether there are some things that only the state governments can regulate,"" said Paul Clement, the attorney who will argue against the law, on behalf of a coalition of 26 states. On the other side are progressives who back the Obama administration and its congressional supporters. ""Congress thought it necessary to regulate the nearly 20% of our nation's economy that makes up the health care industry and to make sure insurance companies did not discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, for example,"" said Elizabeth Wydra, chief counsel at the Constitutional Accountability Center. ""That is squarely within Congress' authority."" Your guide to the arguments . Debate comes down to four key issues . Despite its complexity, the high court has narrowed its focus to just four key issues: . One: Constitutionality of the individual mandate (also known as the ""minimum coverage"" requirement), the key funding provision. Two: Whether the individual mandate is a ""tax,"" thereby limiting authority of the courts to immediately decide the mandate question. Three: Whether other parts of the law can survive if the mandate is struck down. Four: Federal vs. state conflict over expansion of the cooperative Medicaid program. It is the ""individual mandate"" that has sparked the most controversy. It requires nearly every American to purchase some level of insurance or face a tax penalty of up to about $700 a year. Typical of the ideological divide, the opposing sides do not even agree on what the individual mandate was designed to accomplish. Supporters see it a way of spreading health care costs to a larger pool of individuals, ensuring affordable, quality medical care. They say regulating commerce and the economy has long been a federal prerogative. Health law supporter: 'It really is going to help the American public' The Justice Department will tell the high court that since every American will need medical care at some point in their lives, individuals do not ""choose"" to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs from the millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are shifted to insurance companies and passed on to consumers. Health law opponent: 'Congress made a bad situation worse' But opponents see a fundamental constitutional violation, an intrusion into citizens' personal lives, forcing Americans to purchase a commercial product they might not want or need. The states equate such a requirement to a burdensome regulation of ""inactivity."" One federal appeals court has found the act unconstitutional. Two others have has said it is a proper exercise of congressional mandate. A third court has ruled against the states on technical grounds, saying local officials lack authority to even go into to court and argue the individual mandate issue. Twenty-eight states and countless individuals and groups have sued the administration. What the reform is designed to do . Health care reform, a top Democratic priority since the Truman administration, was passed by the previous Congress in a series of close party-line votes. Obama signed the act into law in March 2010. Among other things, the measure was designed to help millions of uninsured and underinsured Americans receive adequate and affordable health care through a series of government-imposed mandates and subsidies. The federal government will tell the court that 45 million Americans last year lacked health insurance, roughly 15% of the country's population. Critics have equated the measure to socialized medicine, fearing that a bloated government bureaucracy will result in higher taxes and diminished health care services. Opponents derisively labeled the measure ""Obamacare."" Republican leaders, who captured the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections, have vowed to overturn or severely trim the law. All the major GOP candidates for president have echoed similar calls, especially in their TV campaign ads. That has concerned some liberal legal analysts. ""It seems what the conservative state attorneys general and the governors were trying to do was seek a do-over of the act in the courts, to achieve what they couldn't in the legislature. And it really has become a bit of political theater,"" says Wydra. ""If the Supreme Court and especially some of the conservative justices uphold the mandate, and deliver the message to the tea party that their constitutional vision is fundamentally flawed, that makes it much harder for tea party candidates and their supporters to have their constitutional theories taken seriously by the American people."" Supreme Court and election-year blockbusters . But the states worry how far the federal government would go in the future, all in the name of regulating ""commerce,"" if the high court found the law constitutional. ""I think about just a couple of years ago when the automobile industry was suffering, and Congress said: we're going to give people incentives to buy new cars,"" said Clement. ""Well, it would have been even more effective and even better for the car industry if Congress had just said: if you make more than $100,000, you need to buy a new car. They haven't done that, maybe it's self-restraint, maybe it's because the [sweeping] power really doesn't exist. That's really what the court is going to decide."" How the justices could rule . The entire court of nine justices will hear the case, despite separate calls for Clarence Thomas and Elena Kagan to recuse. They will have several options before them when issuing opinions in these cases. They could separately strike down or uphold the individual mandate and Medicaid provisions and rule whether the entire law must be scrapped. Or they could declare a legal ""time-out""-- concluding the constitutional questions must be postponed until the major provisions go into effect in 2014, when any real ""harm"" from the financial mandates would presumably be felt. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform . The opportunity to rule on a landmark case brings with it precedent-setting opportunities to either expand or deflate not only the power of Congress and the executive but also the judiciary's own prestige and authority. In some ways, it is a perilous path, since the courts have increasingly become a political football. ""We're in a little bit of a political death spiral for the Supreme Court, as ideologues on the left and right attack justices with whom they disagree, maybe decreasing the public's confidence in the Supreme Court,"" said Scotusblog.com's Goldstein. ""And as they take up health care, abortion cases, immigration -- all of those issues -- there are going to be more excuses to attack the justices."" So expect nine unelected judges and the tricky issues such as health care they confront to be major talking points in this year's state and federal elections. Their votes could ultimately decide whom Americans choose on Election Day 2012. ""Our job on the court is to decide -- and control our stress,"" Justice Stephen Breyer told CNN a couple of years ago while discussing how to manage -- personally and professionally -- the biggest, most politically explosive Supreme Court appeals. ""Keep yourself under control. And do your best on the decision."" That's wellness advice that could serve the nine-member bench -- and anyone passionately folllowing the case -- in the days to come.

"(CNN) -- In his recent CNN column, Bill Bennett lambasts Obama campaign's slide show ad, ""The Life of Julia,"" as the epitome of government reliance propaganda. The conservative commentator protests that nothing less than our very liberty is at stake when a cartoon woman is depicted being aided at points in her life by the president's policies, and the cries of outrage emanating from Fox News indicate that many a right-wing pundit have heeded his call. But when Bennett zeros in on his concerns that Julia is depicted with no man and no church in her life, his true agenda starts to come clearly into focus, and along with it, the core contradiction of the conservative ideology. The Republican Party claims to stand for individual liberty and opportunity, but it actually believes that only some individuals are worthy of those fundamental rights. As the slide show depicts Julia using the opportunities provided to her through government programs to excel in school, in parenting and in starting a small business, Bennett quakes with frustration that she is doing so without a man. At one point, he bellows, ""Instead, the state has taken their place and is her primary relationship."" But his core charge is ludicrous. Just because the story doesn't introduce a male character does not mean that Julia's life is bereft of relationships. With or without a man, the truth is that any woman will face most of the situations shown in the slide show at some point in her lifetime and will be at a competitive disadvantage without programs that offer equal opportunity to succeed personally and professionally. Conservatives who continue to wage a war on women's health and economic parity willfully ignore the basic facts facing American women today. Seventy years after Rosie the Riveter popularized the idea of women in the workplace -- or at least as factory line workers while the men were at war -- women still only make 77 cents on the dollar compared with men for doing the same job. Innovative and entrepreneurial women fare no better. Male-founded start-ups receive four times more venture capital funding over female-founded start-ups. Women-led companies are twice as likely to get debt versus equity capital, requiring that women shoulder more of the risk on their own. Despite research showing that gender diversity within senior ranks of organizations translates into financial value, especially when innovation is part of the equation, women have not gained much footing. Moreover, according to the 2010 census, four million more women than men live in poverty in the United States. And what about that government with which Bennett is so concerned? It must be rife with women who want to bilk the system for women like Julia, right? Wrong. The number of women representing Americans in Congress fell in 2010 for the first time in 30 years. Women went from 93 seats in the House and the Senate to 90 combined. Women represent less than 17% of leadership at the federal level, a number that qualifies the U.S. for a rank of 73 in the world for female representation in government. We're tied with Turkmenistan. Women like Julia have systematically watched the right wing try to take away their opportunities and liberties. Republicans have repeatedly voted against fair pay provisions, parental leave, job training and other proposals that allow women to obtain and pursue opportunity through their lives at the same rate as their male counterparts. The budget of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, slashes nutritional assistance that would disproportionately affect women and children, while providing billions in tax cuts for already wealthy individuals, the vast majority of whom are men or couples where the primary wage earner is male. It is no longer shocking that Republicans continue to fight against equality; their actions have been consistent and focused on eroding women's rights and economic security. The only shocking fact is that Bennett and other conservatives believe they can claim the mantle of ""liberty"" and ""opportunity."" Julia and millions of other American women will secure their own liberty and opportunity only when the GOP stops trying to prevent our democracy from doing what it was designed to do: Offer all Americans an equal chance at success. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ilyse Hogue.","Conservatives criticize Obama campaign's ad, ""The Life of Julia,"" as big government .

"(CNN) -- Tens of thousands of protesters unhappy with planned tuition hikes in Quebec took to the streets Tuesday afternoon in Montreal to mark 100 days of demonstrations. After a weekend of clashes, tension at first subsided because organizers of the downtown rally provided an itinerary in advance, as required by an emergency law passed late last week, police said. Still, the protesters, many wearing red, split into three groups, with only one column following the prescribed route. Montreal Police Cmdr. Ian Lafreniere said there had been no arrests in the afternoon protest. Police were unable to detain suspected anarchists who threw rocks and broke bank windows because they ran toward another group of protesters, he said. ""Luckily it's been raining,"" he told CNN. But some protesters wearing masks threw objects at police officers in another march Tuesday night, said police spokesman Daniel Fortier. Six people were arrested. Police had warned demonstrators three times that their protest was illegal, Fortier said. Police would not provide crowd estimates. Tuesday's protest was intended to denounce tuition increases and Bill 78, which requires organizers of a demonstration with more than 50 participants to provide written details and the route of the event eight hours in advance. ""The exercise of democracy has to be done without disruption to ensure that no unfortunate event take place,"" police said. CLASSE, considered the most militant of the province's three main student associations, has said it will continue to protest without giving police an approved itinerary, according to CNN Canada affiliate CTV. ""We are witnessing the biggest act of civil disobedience in Canadian history,"" read one post on a CLASSE Twitter page. ""We have a rendezvous with history, and we won't miss it,"" read another. Tuesday's march was planned by a coalition of 140 community groups and unions, some of which said they're heeding the new legislation. At least 300 people were arrested and 20 were injured in Montreal during weekend clashes between police and protesters, according to CTV. The movement began after a proposed tuition hike of $1,625, which would be implemented over several years. Lafreniere said police have made about 1,000 arrests since the protests began. ""It's day by day. It's a peaceful city, normally,"" he said.","NEW: Six arrested in evening protests .

"(CNN) -- Never during its 92 year history has the NFL experienced anything like this: battles everywhere, but not inside stadiums. They're occurring in federal courtrooms, where more than 100 former players are suing the league over various health issues they claim were caused by negligence on the part of everybody from the commissioner to trainers to coaches. Then there is The Dissenter. The more Lester Hayes spoke on the other end of the phone from his home in Modesto, California, the more he delivered a blindsided sack to conventional wisdom. This was after I asked the former cornerback great for the Oakland/Los Angeles Raiders whether coaches, team executives or even leagues are responsible for the epidemic of long-term injuries to current and former players. Does brain injury link NFL players, wounded warriors? Hayes responded with the speed of a blitz. Despite his lifelong battle with stuttering, he said clearly, ""It's all on the players, not anybody else, because the players have the same gladiator genes that existed in Rome over 2,000 years ago. They have a love of football to the 10th power. So the players make the final call. Trust me. No matter what they are told by doctors or anybody else, they will fight to play."" Let that sink in for a moment. Now consider that a slew of Hayes' former NFL peers disagree. Big time. In fact, Pro Football Hall of Fame runner Eric Dickerson just joined all those other retired players in filing lawsuits in federal courts alleging that the league hasn't done enough to protect players from concussions and other football-related injuries. Ohio State linebacker choosing career over concussions . There also have been at least 12 suicides involving former NFL players during the last 25 years, including perennial Pro Bowl defenders Junior Seau and Dave Duerson within the last 14 months. According to the suing players, such tragedies are related to the league's negligence in fully explaining the health risk of concussions to players. Not only that, the suing players claim the league isn't allocating enough of its estimated $9 billion in total revenue each season toward the proper care of its current and former players suffering from head trauma and other football-related injuries. All Hayes knows is that, at 57 and in the midst of his decades-long run as a football youth coach in Modesto, his health is just fine after his 10 years with the Raiders through 1986. No knee or back troubles. Definitely no post-concussion woes. Remember, too, that Hayes played during that generation of Raiders teams noted for mixing it up so much that he said the collisions ""sounded like a 12-gauge shotgun blast."" He contributed to more than a few of those blasts with noted enforcers for the Raiders such as Jack Tatum, George Atkinson, Ted Hendricks and John Matuszak. Along Hayes' way to five Pro Bowls, two Super Bowl rings and 1980 NFL Player of the Year honors, he was known as everything from Lester The Molester to The Judge to The Only True Jedi. Now just call him The Dissenter. ""Lord, have mercy. It's so much safer to play in the NFL these days than during my time,"" Hayes said, referring to the NFL Players Association joining former players in urging the league to make things even safer. The league has responded. You've had NFL commissioner Roger Goodell doing everything from moving kickoffs up five yards (to reduce the number of injuries on kickoff returns) to delivering heavy fines to defenders who slam into quarterbacks too harshly. There also are strict guidelines for teams to follow when a player has just the hint of a concussion. Hayes chuckled, saying, ""We didn't have any guidelines. You could actually lead with your face mask (as a defender) -- putting your face mask on an opposing player's face mask, without a $15,000 fine. You could throw a forearm shiver to the throat. People played with broken bones. Guys would carry smelling salt in their socks, so if you got a little woozy on the field, you'd reach into your sock for help."" Then there was the ""secret room."" According to Hayes, it was a staple for the Raiders. ""I don't know what other teams had, but I'm sure they had something that was similar,"" he said, referring to the place at stadiums that players visited on game days to receive a series of painkilling shots. That said, Hayes said Raiders team doctor Robert Rosenfeld spent more time trying to talk him and other players out of taking the shots than otherwise. ""It was 1985, and I had never missed a game, and me and Dr. Rosenfeld were going at it -- back and forth, and I'm begging him, just pleading and screaming at him, 'Doc, I've got to play. Give me the shot,' "" said Hayes, recalling what was a lengthy shouting match at the time on how to handle his strained calf muscle. ""The Doc is telling me, 'Lester, take a few days off. I don't like shooting muscle.' But it's going back and forth, with me yelling. And God rest his soul, he wouldn't back down, not until I just forced him to do it. He always showed a lot of love and compassion."" I encountered Rosenfeld, who died in 1994, as a Raiders beat writer for the San Francisco Examiner during the early 1980s, so I know Hayes speaks the truth -- for some Raiders. As for others, not so much. While offensive lineman Curt Marsh blamed the amputation of his right foot on a misdiagnosis by Rosenfeld, defensive end Pat Toomay once told ESPN that the typical response of Rosenfeld to most injuries was, ""You're OK. It's just a bruise."" Hayes said in response, ""Listen, I'm waiting there outside of the secret room, observing, listening to Doc tell players, 'Sit out. Sit out.' They wouldn't do it, because they were gladiators, and Mr. Davis had instilled such a will of winning into each of us that we had to get out there."" That is Mr. Davis, as in the late Al Davis, the notoriously hard-driving owner of the Raiders from 1963 until his death in October. His motto was ""Just win, baby,"" which makes you wonder. ""No, no, no. Mr. Davis never pressured us to play,"" Hayes said. ""He never, never did. It was always the player's call. You can't blame Mr. Davis, and you can't blame the doctors, because a lot of guys see stars (as in being physically dazed) on the field, but that gladiator gene takes over. I never saw Dr. Rosenfeld apply pressure in the secret room, except to try to put us in street clothes on game days."" The Dissenter laughed, adding, ""In the 21st century, I don't know if secret rooms still exist."" If we knew, they wouldn't be secret.","Terence Moore says there's an ""epidemic of long-term injuries"" to past and present NFL players .

"(CNN) -- Two days after being released from jail after getting into a fight on his university's campus, a 21-year-old Maryland man allegedly killed and then ate parts of his housemate, court records show. Alexander Kinyua was being held without bail Friday at the Harford County Detention Center after being charged with first-degree murder, first-degree assault and second-degree assault in the alleged cannibalism case. Harford County Sheriff Jesse Bane told reporters a day earlier that Kinyua admitted killing his housemate, cutting him up, and then eating his heart and part of his brain. His public defender on Friday declined to answer questions about the case, according to his office. 'Zombie apocalypse' trending as bad news spreads quickly . According to the Harford County District Court case record, the killing occurred on May 25. Six days earlier, Kinyua was involved in a fight on the Baltimore campus of Morgan State University, school spokesman Clint Coleman told CNN on Friday. The fight led to charges against Kinyua, including first-degree assault and reckless endangerment, according to court records. Noting the university's no-tolerance policy against violence, Coleman said that after the incident, Kinyua was no longer considered an active student at Morgan State, even though he'd compiled enough credits to warrant beginning the fall semester as a senior. Kinyua was detained and released from jail on May 23, according to records posted online by the state judiciary system. Overheard on CNN.com: Are we all 'zombies'? It wasn't until Tuesday that Antony Kinyua -- Alexander Kinyua's father -- called a Harford County detective assigned to a missing person's case and told him about a gruesome discovery made by another of his sons, the charging document states. The other son explained to the detective how he had come across two metal tins covered by a blanket in the basement laundry room of Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie's residence in Joppatowne, which is about 20 miles northeast of Baltimore. He opened the tins and found a human head and two hands. The brother said he ""confronted (Alexander Kinyua), who denied the remains were human,"" then went upstairs to get his father, the detective said in the charging document. When the father and son returned to the basement, ""the items he observed were gone and ... Alex Kinyua was cleaning the container he observed them in."" Two Harford County detectives later arrived and discovered the head and hands on the home's main floor. ""He admitted to killing our missing person, Mr. Kodie, and cutting him up with a knife,"" Bane said. ""He further stated that he consumed Mr. Kodie's internal organs -- specifically his heart and portions of his brain."" The suspect told detectives to go to the parking lot of the nearby Town Baptist Church, where they could -- and did -- find the rest of Agyei-Kodie's remains in a Dumpster. A missing person's report filed May 26 described Agyei-Kodie, 37, as ""very intelligent."" He had earned multiple master's degrees from schools in Ghana and was a graduate student at Morgan State University until 2008, according to Coleman.

"(CNN) -- As a gunman opened fire inside a cafe in Seattle, a patron jumped into action, hitting the shooter twice with a stool and saving three lives, police said. Investigators hailed him as a hero, but the man told a Seattle newspaper that he was simply keeping a promise to a brother who died in the World Trade Center terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Police identified the man only as Lawrence, but The Seattle Times reported his full name Friday as Lawrence Adams. After Adams' brother died on 9/11, he told the newspaper, he promised himself that if something like that ever happened again, ""I would never hide under a table."" He was true to his vow Wednesday when faced with the gunman. ""There's a hero. .... He put his life at risk,"" Assistant Police Chief Jim Pugel told reporters. In an interview with police, Adams said he had glanced at his phone when he heard gunshots, then sprung into action as he saw people scrambling around him. ""I just threw the frigging stool at him, legs first,"" he said in a statement published on the official Seattle police blog. Police said his actions allowed three people to escape while a man armed with two handguns attacked. The shooting left four people dead and one person critically injured inside Cafe Racer, a peaceful coffeehouse in the city's University District. A second shooting, about a half-hour later near downtown Seattle, left a woman dead, authorities said. The suspect in both shootings, identified by police as Ian Stawicki, died Wednesday night, several hours after he shot himself in the head as a five-hour police manhunt came to an end. Witnesses told police the gunman began shooting after an employee at the coffee shop asked him to leave. Police said that a new piece of evidence investigators viewed Thursday showed the gunman opening fire in the cafe, where patrons were reading books and chatting over coffee. ""One person stands up, looks like he's going to go outside for a minute. At that point the suspect stands up and starts shooting ... and then just goes down the bar. He chases a few people,"" Pugel said. ""At that time he's been hit by the stool, twice. He completes the shooting, puts the guns in his pockets, actually took a hat from one of the victims, put it on his head and walked out."" Stawicki, Adams said, ""looked at me like he didn't [care] at all. He just moved towards the rear of the bar instead of dealing with me at all, and I just brushed past him. He was on a mission to kill my friends."" Police said they were shocked by the apparently senseless violence. ""In my almost 30 years in this department I've never seen anything more horrific and callous and cold,"" Deputy Chief Nick Metz said. Witnesses described the shootings in several 911 recordings released by police Thursday. ""Someone came in and shot a bunch of people. I'm hiding in the bathroom. We need help right away. ... There's people down all over the place out there,"" one man calling from Cafe Racer said. A female caller told dispatchers she saw a gunman assaulting a woman in a parking lot in downtown Seattle, then shooting her, stealing her black Mercedes and running her over as he sped away. Authorities will continue their investigation into the shootings for several weeks but are ""very confident"" that Stawicki is the only suspect, Pugel said. The violence left Seattle reeling Thursday. ""Our department and the whole city is just trying to catch its breath"" after the shooting, Metz said. Two of the victims at Cafe Racer were members of a local folk band, God's Favorite Beefcake, according to CNN affiliates. They were found dead at the coffeehouse. A woman and a man died later at a hospital. A fifth person was in critical condition, police said, but was not expected to survive. The suspect's brother, Andrew Stawicki, told The Seattle Times that Ian Stawicki had long struggled with mental illness, but refused to talk about that or his anger. ""Someone like that is so stubborn, you can't talk to him,"" he told the newspaper. ""It's no surprise to me this happened. We could see this coming. Nothing good is going to come with that much anger inside of you."" A Wednesday night meeting was held in the city's Central District, where Mayor Mike McGinn and police officials discussed a recent spike in violence in Seattle, KOMO reported. ""If violence is a disease, our city is infected,"" said Paul Patu, of the city's Youth Violence Prevention Council, according to CNN affiliate KCPQ. ""When old people are afraid of young people, something is wrong. We have to commit to getting to know each other and stop being strangers."" Seattle, a city of about 600,000, recorded 20 homicides in 2011, according to Police Department statistics. Wednesday's shootings bring 2012's year-to-date total to 21, according to KOMO. Two cases have been cleared, and seven arrests were made. Two other people have died in random shootings in Seattle in the past month, according to CNN affiliates. In late April, a 21-year-old woman died in an apparently random drive-by shooting near downtown. And a 43-year-old man died last week while driving down the street with his family. Police said the gunman's intended target in that shooting was another person involved in a dispute with the gunman. No arrests have been made in either case. On Saturday, a bystander was wounded near the city's landmark Space Needle when he was struck by a bullet allegedly fired by a gang member involved in a dispute with another man, according to KIRO. McGinn acknowledged at a news conference that the violence had shaken the city, KIRO reported. ""It's going to take our political leaders coming together to give our police officers the support and tools they need to do their jobs,"" he said.","The Seattle Times identified the hero as Lawrence Adams, 56 .

"(CNN) -- The Louisiana State Police said Tuesday that they have joined the FBI in investigating allegations that New Orleans Saints General Manager Mickey Loomis had the ability to eavesdrop on opposing coaches for nearly three seasons. ""By placing an investigator with the FBI team, we'll go through the allegations and see where they take us. All we have now are allegations of illegal use of wiretapping and eavesdropping,"" Louisiana State Police Superintendent Mike Edmonson said. When asked specifically whether the allegations involve Loomis, he responded, ""Yes."" ESPN reported this week that the Saints manager had a device in his Superdome suite that was wired to allow him to hear members of the opposing coaching staff from 2002 to 2004. The stadium suffered severe damage in 2005, when Hurricane Katrina ripped through the city. Citing anonymous sources, the report said it could not determine for certain whether Loomis ever used the system. On Monday, Saints spokesman Greg Bensel called the report ""1,000% false -- completely inaccurate."" ""We asked ESPN to provide us evidence to support their allegations, and they refused. The team and Mickey are seeking all legal recourse regarding these false allegations,"" he said. Interim head coach Joe Vitt addressed the report Tuesday, calling it ""ludicrous,"" ""juvenile"" and ""irresponsible."" ""It's absolutely ludicrous. It's impossible,"" he said about the wiretapping allegations. ""That's something from 'Star Wars.' "" Jim Haslett, former Saints coach and current defensive coordinator for the Washington Redskins, similarly cast doubt on the ESPN report. ""At no time during my tenure as head coach with the New Orleans Saints did Mickey and I discuss monitoring opposing team coach's communication, nor did I have any knowledge of this. To my knowledge this concept was never discussed or utilized,"" he said in a statement. The statue of limitations for wiretapping crimes is typically five years, according to CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. When asked how that fact might figure into the investigation, Edmonson said, ""Let's find out that if the allegations are factual and if state law has been compromised first. Then it will be up to the U.S. attorney or district attorney to review the matter."" A spokesman for the National Football League said Monday that the league had no prior knowledge of the wiretapping accusations, which come on the heels of another Saints scandal. This month, the NFL upheld penalties it imposed against the Saints and members of its coaching staff for the team's bounty program. The unprecedented punishment was handed down in March after an NFL investigation found that the team had an ""active bounty program"" during the 2009, 2010 and 2011 seasons. During this time, players were purportedly offered payments if they managed to hurt opposing players and knock them out of a game. The stiffest penalty handed down -- an indefinite ban -- was given to Gregg Williams, the Saints defensive coordinator who, over the offseason, moved to take that same position with the St. Louis Rams. Head coach Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012-13 season. Loomis was suspended without pay for the season's first eight regular-season games, while Vitt was suspended without pay for the first six regular-season games. The team was also fined $500,000 and ordered to forfeit its second-round draft picks in 2012 and 2013, the NFL has said. The league may consider ""modifying the forfeiture"" of the 2013 draft pick, assuming other conditions are met, it has said. The NFL has yet to impose penalties against individual players involved in the bounty program, but Commissioner Roger Goodell said Tuesday that they, too, bear some of the responsibility. ""The evidence is quite clear that the players embraced this. They enthusiastically embraced it. They put the vast majority of the money into the program, and they actually are the ones playing the game,"" he said during an NFL Network interview. ""I think everyone bears responsibility here. We've held the executives and the coaches to a higher standard, but the players need to recognize, they need to make sure this isn't happening either."" CNN's Rick Martin contributed to this report.","NEW: Interim head coach says the accusations are ""ludicrous"" and ""irresponsible""

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- Dioncounda Traore, Mali's interim president, was beaten and rushed to a hospital after hundreds of protesters demanding his resignation stormed the presidential palace Monday. Traore was assaulted and hit over the head when protesters found him inside the palace. The president was later taken to the hospital where he was treated for a wound to his head, hospital staff said. ""There were three dead and some injured by gunshot when [Traore's] security shot at people,"" said Bakary Mariko, a spokesman for the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy, a group of military officers who mounted a coup in March. April: Traore sworn in as interim president . Protests were expected after the Economic Community of West African States, which has tried to broker a return to civilian rule after the coup, agreed to let Traore remain in charge for a year to oversee the transition. And ECOWAS has warned that followers of Capt. Amadou Sanogo, who led the revolt that deposed President Amadou Toumani Toure, were threatening to derail the agreement. Traore's term as interim president had been set to expire on Tuesday. Groups denouncing him gathered Monday morning in the Place de l'Independence, in the center of Mali's capital, Bamako. Security Clearance: Disaster looms for people of Mali . Traore ""is not staying as president of Mali,"" said Youssouf Kone, the leader of several groups demanding the interim president's resignation. ""We will stay until Traore agrees to step down,"" he added. ""We're going to make this the Tahrir Square,"" referencing the 2011 protests in Egypt. Just before 11 a.m. (7 a.m. ET), a group of protesters parted and moved up the hill in direction of the presidential palace. ""We don't want Dioncounda"" and ""Down with ECOWAS,"" chanted a couple in the crowd, which remained peaceful at that point. When it reached the palace gates, the spontaneous march had gathered a couple of hundred supporters, some of them shouting slogans in support of the coup leader, Sanogo. According to witnesses, soldiers stood by as the crowd entered the building while others climbed over armored vehicles parked nearby. Some protesters were seen parking motorbikes and bicycles inside the palace. In other parts of town, protesters burned tires and put up posters saying the country will never heal with Traore in power. The group closed of one of the city's bridges, causing the traffic to stand still all over Bamako. The protests reflect longstanding frustrations with Mali's political class. Several of the protesters expressed discontent with Traore, a former labor activist who was the country's parliament speaker before his appointment as interim president in April. ""Traore is part the same self-serving political elite that has misruled the country for years,"" Fadima Sy, one of the protesters in Place de l'Independence, said. Interim Prime Minister Cheick Modibo Diarra went on state television Monday evening to denounce the attack and appealed to local politicians and organizations to stop encouraging the youth to march. Mali had been hailed as a shining example of African democracy before the coup, having experienced more than 20 years of democratic government. Sanogo and his fellow officers ousted Toure on March 22, complaining that he had failed to properly equip soldiers battling a growing insurgency by Tuareg rebels in the country's north. While ECOWAS and other countries pressured Sanogo to relinquish power, Tuareg fighters and Islamic rebels swiftly advanced and now claim control of much of northern Mali.","Demonstrators storm Mali's presidential palace on Monday .

"(CNN) -- Hong Kong is like no other place I've been. The city's character is influenced by former British colonial rule, by its deep natural harbor, and its rapid growth and culture of consumerism as one of Asia's major financial hubs. Its 7 million inhabitants literally live on top of one another in high-rise apartments that stretch as far as the eye can see. That part you probably know. What you may not have heard is how green and stunningly beautiful this metropolis -- which sits perched along lush mountainous islands that jut out of the South China Sea -- really is. If you're sitting on the fence about whether to travel to Hong Kong, trust me, it's worth it. And when you get here, follow these tips: . Viewing party . There's no shortage of epic views of Hong Kong's expansive skyline. After a day of shopping and exploring the architecture in Central, head to Hong Kong Park in Midlevels for something more affordable. The park's conservatory, fountains, aviary and modern art exhibition are all free to the public. First-time visitors won't want to miss taking the tram to The Peak for the quintessential Hong Kong experience, but keep in mind that it's a tourist trap, full of kitschy shops and a Madame Tussaud's wax museum. Avoid the weekend crowds if you can, but most importantly, pick a clear day or risk disappointment in not capturing one of Hong Kong's most spectacular views. Once the sun goes down, find a comfy spot on one of the dozens of trendy rooftop bars -- like Wooloomooloo in Wan Chai or Aqua Bar in Tsim Sha Tsui -- for stunning views of Hong Kong at night. Get high . Despite Hong Kong's reputation as an urban jungle, you're never more than 20 minutes away from nature. Nearly two-thirds of Hong Kong is green space, and parks and hiking trails line the rolling hills and mountains that surround the city. Fair warning: Many of the trails are steep, and some have stairs that go on forever. One of my favorite places to hike is Hong Kong Island's south side. Dragon's Back, a gorgeous ridge trail, is a great place to catch stunning views and a nice sea breeze, and ends near the charming beach village of Shek O. If you're up for a real challenge, start at Tai Tam dam and hike to ""The Twins"" for a double dip of very steep climbing that leads to unforgettable views of the south side's beaches. Hike down the slopes to Stanley, shop at the weekend market and grab dinner at one of the restaurants along the French Riviera-styled waterfront for a relaxing end to the day. Experience Kowloon . For a true Hong Kong experience, cross Victoria Harbour by taking the Star Ferry from Central to Kowloon and some of the world's most densely populated neighborhoods. Walk the streets and crowded markets of Mong Kok and Sham Shui Po to get a sense of old Hong Kong. Here, you can still see factories and low-rise walkups full of local merchants, but you'd better act quickly. Much of Hong Kong's older buildings are being torn down and replaced by mammoth skyscrapers. Head to the Temple Street night market for a unique adventure in haggling. Hundreds of street stalls sell cheap goods and knockoff merchandise. Rows of fortune tellers and palm readers wait to read your future. Hungry? You've got to try the Cantonese-style rice pots from one of the many curbside restaurants that line the street, or venture into one the massive dining halls for traditional hot pot. Where's your favorite spot to eat in Hong Kong? Share your tips with CNN iReport. Island hop . Hong Kong's outlying islands are the perfect escape from the crowded streets and just a quick ferry ride away from Central Ferry Pier. Lamma is a charming, laid-back island dotted with fishing villages, incredible seafood, coffee shops, hiking trails and hidden beaches. Cars aren't allowed, so expect to see lots of bikes and dog-friendly families. A little farther out is Cheung Chau, where you can leisurely explore the Pak Tai Temple and sample dried fish at one of the many butcher shops and fish vendors in the central district of this mostly quiet residential island. Finally, head to Lantau Island and take a glass-bottom cable car to ""The Big Buddha,"" a massive bronze statue that offers stunning views of Lantau Peak. Note: The summers in Hong Kong are hot and humid and prone to the occasional typhoon. July and August are particularly swampy.","Hong Kong is a former British colony that is now one of Asia's major financial hubs .

"(CNN) -- The mystery behind the peculiar inscriptions ""Out of the Blue"" and ""True Blue"" which first appeared on Sauber engine covers at the Chinese Grand Prix has finally been revealed. The Swiss Formula One team has joined forces with English football club Chelsea in an innovative marketing ploy aimed at attracting a global audience -- and boost sponsorship. It's the first such partnership between the sports, and from next week's Spanish Grand Prix all Sauber cars will be emblazoned with the slogan ""Welcome Chelsea FC."" Chelsea, owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, already has an international fanbase but can now also capitalize on the following of Sauber's drivers -- Mexican Sergio Perez and Kamui Kobayashi of Japan. Likewise, the Sauber logo will soon be plastered on advertising boards at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium in London and on walls in the club's interview areas. The multi-million-dollar organizations will share merchandise sales, advertising space and even sports scientists. ""A partnership like this between Formula One and football has never existed before in this form, yet there are numerous commonalities and possible synergies. In either case we are talking about team sport at the highest -- and international -- level,"" said Sauber chief executive Monisha Kaltenborn. ""The Sauber F1 team and Chelsea FC are dealing with many of the same sporting and commercial topics and we want to strengthen each other in these areas. We are looking forward to exploiting these opportunities."" F1 fans will get their first live glimpse of the new Sauber C3Is stamped with the Chelsea logo at the Circuit De Catalunya from May 11-13. ""We felt that this Swiss team, the fourth oldest of the existing teams, reflects our own ideals perfectly,"" Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay said. ""In a year when Chelsea celebrates 20 seasons as a Premier League team, Sauber does so as a Formula One team. We share many philosophies when it comes to how the respective organizations are run, from the development of young talent to constantly striving for success. ""Sauber's philosophy towards grassroots development has produced some of the best drivers in F1, which mirrors our dedication to develop promising young football talent through our academy. Abramovich has bankrolled Chelsea since buying it in 2003, but the club now has to start paying its own way under European football's new financial fair play rules. ""This partnership will benefit us both greatly, with the potential to create unique commercial opportunities,"" Gourlay said.

"(CNN) -- Does John Edwards deserve to go to prison? The jury has decided, and he's walking. Whatever we may think of the Edwards trial, one thing is certain: the prosecution was a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money on a non-crime. Who cares if a billionaire wants to give a multimillionaire some money to hide his mistress (who pays taxes on the gift)? The prosecution of Edwards was never so much about Edwards as it was about George Holding. Wait -- who is George Holding? And why should we care? After winning a recent primary, Holding is likely the next congressman in the 13th District of North Carolina. He initiated the prosecution against Edwards while he was a U.S. Attorney. But he didn't argue the case in court. Instead, after receiving a year's worth of headlines (and Republican praise) for charging Edwards, Holding resigned from the case to run for Congress. Maybe Holding understood the weakness of the case, which rested upon Edwards' failure to report the money billionaire heiress Bunny Mellon and another wealthy donor gave to him to help hide his mistress. The problem is that if Edwards had reported contributions and then used them for personal expenses, he would have been guilty of a crime, since the Federal Election Commission bars spending official campaign funds on personal expenses. Therefore, according to Holding, Edwards was damned if he did, and damned if he didn't. To prove his case, Holding had to show that Edwards knowingly broke the law. But if neglecting to report the gifts as campaign contributions constituted a crime, yet reporting such gifts as contributions would violate existing law (by implying that Edwards converted contributions to personal use), then it is impossible to prove Edwards knew he was breaking the law, which would be necessary for a conviction. That's not very good legal reasoning on which to rest a case -- especially a case unlike any other that had been successfully tried. And since Holding had access to all the available evidence and knew that no witness and no recordings would suggest that Edwards knew he was breaking the law, it is difficult to see how Holding thought he might win, other than hoping that jurors disliked Edwards so much they would convict him. Or maybe Holding wasn't all that concerned with the legal reasoning. Perhaps he realized that, win or lose, he'd already gotten enough mileage from the case to realize his political ambitions. By the time he indicted Edwards, the well-connected Holding knew that the newly Republican state legislature had drawn a safe district he could win, if only he could get out of the primary. And what better way to appeal to Republican diehards than prosecuting the smarmy, liberal trial lawyer John Edwards? Holding certainly received his reward last month when he won his congressional primary. The public generally associates politicians with the pursuit of ambition and power. Too often, investigators act from similar motives. Law enforcement officials seek to justify long, expensive investigations into high-profile targets by stretching the law to win convictions and mount the biggest scalps on their walls. The former head of the St. Louis FBI who investigated me for a campaign finance violation years ago said of his job: ""I love the chase. [It] was fantastic. It was me against them. And the smarter they were, the richer they were, the more I enjoyed catching them."" But justice isn't about investigators' adrenaline rushes or personal advancement. It's about the common good. If the central goal of prosecuting ""corrupt"" public figures is to remove them from public life, then the Edwards prosecution is a clear case of overkill. He is a walking punch line, unfit to run for dog catcher. Why should prosecutors spend millions of dollars and years of time targeting him with novel legal theories? I am familiar with Edwards' predicament. During my 2004 congressional campaign in Missouri, I approved a meeting between two aides and a man who wanted to send out a postcard highlighting my opponent's dismal attendance record in the state House. In the immediate aftermath, our campaign denied any involvement in the mailing, and then when faced with a Federal Election Commission complaint which gave us a chance to come clean, we maintained our denial. Five years later, through an unlikely set of circumstances culminating in my best friend's wiretap, I ended up in prison for a year. As a current taxpayer who spent a year loading trucks at a prison warehouse, eating food for which you, dear reader, paid, I can tell you two things. First, I did not want to pay to house, feed and clothe multimillionaire lawyer John Edwards. Second, the only person in this sordid mess whom prosecutors should have considered indicting is someone who was already granted immunity. That's right, Andrew Young, who defrauded the 99-year-old Bunny Mellon by siphoning (or, more precisely, stealing) hundreds of thousands of dollars to build his dream house. Of course, prosecuting Young wouldn't have gotten George Holding all the publicity that prosecuting John Edwards did, and it definitely wouldn't have gotten him to Congress. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Smith.","Jeff Smith: John Edwards trial was a ridiculous waste of taxpayer money on a non-crime .
Smith: Prosecution of Edwards was really about George Holding, who will be in Congress .
He says Holding indicted Edwards for political gains and attention .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Mohamed al-Zawahiri, brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, will be freed from prison in Egypt after 13 years, his attorney said Monday. He was acquitted by an Egyptian military court and will be released Tuesday, said attorney Nizar Ghorab. Mohamed al-Zawahiri was imprisoned in 1999 after being detained and extradited from the United Arab Emirates on allegations that he was linked to the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Al-Zawahiri was acquitted on the assassination charges but later was accused of conspiring against the Egyptian government. He was sentenced to death, but then appealed the ruling. Last year, Egypt's interim government released him along with scores of other political prisoners after a general pardon was issued by the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which ruled the country after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. But al-Zawahiri was arrested again shortly after. Ahmed al-Zawahiri, nephew of Mohamed al-Zawahiri, told CNN that after the release last year, security forces stormed his uncle's home, beat him up and rearrested him for no apparent reason. ""It was a day after my uncle spoke to a local paper and spoke of the torture he endured inside prison for years,"" Ahmed al-Zawahiri told CNN. ""He paid a high price for being Ayman's brother and he has denounced any sort of violent ideologies now that his main enemy, the Mubarak regime, has been removed,"" the nephew added. ""Zawahiri has been tortured for years by Mubarak's state security officers because he is the brother of Ayman Zawahiri,"" Ghorab said. Mohamed Al-Zawahiri is a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, of which his brother was once a leader. The United States describes the group as a terrorist organization that merged with al Qaeda in 2001. Its ""primary goals are to overthrow the Egyptian government and replace it with an Islamic state and attack U.S. and Israeli interest in Egypt and abroad,"" the U.S. State Department once said. Five other Islamists charged with similar crimes were acquitted along with Al-Zawahiri, said Ghorab. They are Abdel Aziz al-Jamal, Alaa Sarhan, Sayed Imam, Murgan Mustapha Salem and Mohamed Islamboli, the brother of the executed Islamist who killed Sadat, the attorney said.","NEW: His nephew and attorney say Mohamed al-Zawahiri was tortured .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff on Friday vetoed 12 articles of a controversial forest bill approved by Congress last month, which was promoted by the powerful agriculture lobby but slammed by environmentalists. The legislation updates the complex Forest Code, regulating how much and what kind of land should be maintained as native forest and how much can be cleared for ranching and agriculture. Rousseff's decision comes less than a month before Rio de Janeiro is due to host a high-profile U.N. summit on sustainable development. Many Brazilians had pushed for a complete veto, staging protests across the county and collecting 1.9 million signatures for a petition. Instead, Rousseff opted for line-item vetoes of articles that many said would grant amnesty to those who had illegally cleared land. She vetoed sections that would have eliminated reforestation requirements and sharply reduced the area around water sources that must be maintained as forest. The Amazon rainforest covers a huge area, roughly half as large as the United States, with about 60% of it in Brazil. It is estimated that nearly a fifth of the Brazilian forest has been lost since 1970, but over the past decade, authorities cracked down on clear-cutting, reducing the rate of deforestation by 80%. Rainforest home to vast treasury of life . Former environment minister and presidential candidate Marina Silva has been a loud critic of the bill. ""It's a setback without precedent after the 23 years of progress we've made,"" she said. Sen. Katia Abreu, who represents the agriculture and ranching lobby, said the question of reforesting around rivers is more complicated than it appears. ""There are a lot of people who only have a tiny plot of land which is entirely inside the river margins,"" she said. ""What are they going to do with those people? How are they going to reimburse them?"" For years, the Brazilian government encouraged settlers to slash and burn forests in the sparsely populated center, north and west of the country for farming and ranching. Over three decades, Brazil went from being a food importer to an agricultural powerhouse. The new Forest Code has been an attempt to reach a compromise for farmers and environmentalists.","Forest Code regulates how much land should be maintained as native forest .

"Washington (CNN) -- A JetBlue pilot arrested after an apparent meltdown aboard a March flight has been found not guilty by reason of insanity. A federal judge in Amarillo, Texas, made the determination Tuesday after a psychologist testified that pilot Clayton Frederick Osbon ""suffered from a severe mental disease or defect that impaired his ability"" to understand his actions. Judge Mary Lou Robinson found that Osbon committed the offense of interfering with a flight crew, but she judged him to be not guilty by reason of insanity and ordered him to be held pending further examination. Osbon was ordered immediately transported to a ""low-security"" federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas. Pilot breakdown draws attention to mental health standards . ""We don't have a comment. We are going to let the process play out. We continue to support Osbon and his family,"" said Alison Croyle, a JetBlue Airways spokeswoman. Osbon, 49, was charged following a March 27 incident on a JetBlue flight from New York to Las Vegas. Early in that flight, the plane's co-pilot became concerned about Osbon's bizarre behavior, according to an FBI affidavit. As the Airbus A-320 was climbing out of New York's Kennedy International Airport, Osbon talked about his church and needing to ""focus,"" the affidavit says. He then told the co-pilot to take the controls and to work the radio, and began talking about religion, making statements that were incoherent, it says. The co-pilot became further concerned when Osbon said ""things just don't matter"" and when he yelled over the radio to air traffic controllers. At one point, Osbon said ""We're not going to Vegas."" Concerned by Osbon's erratic behavior, the co-pilot suggested that they invite an off-duty JetBlue captain into the cockpit. Instead, Osbon ""abruptly left the cockpit to go to the forward lavatory,"" the affidavit said. The co-pilot used the opportunity to get the off-duty pilot into the cockpit and lock the door. When Osbon tried to enter his code into the cockpit door, the co-pilot announced over the public address system an order to restrain Osbon. Several passengers brought Osbon down, according to the affidavit and to passengers on the plane. The flight was diverted to Amarillo, where it landed safely with the passengers still restraining Osbon. Previously on CNN.com: . Investigators get voice recorder from JetBlue flight .

"Washington (CNN) -- JPMorgan Chase announced last week that it lost $2 billion as the result of some complicated trades intended to hedge against economic risk, which according to its top executive is apparently not as bad as it sounds. ""This is a stupid thing we should never have done, but we are still going to earn a lot of money this quarter. It's not like this company is jeopardized -- we hurt ourselves and our credibility, yes, and we've got to fully expect that and pay the price for that,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Explain it to me: How did JPMorgan lose that much money? To be perfectly clear, JPMorgan did not lose taxpayer money. It lost its own money. Still, the news shook up Wall Street and Capitol Hill with bad flashbacks. ""Well, this is a big surprise because this particular bank is well-respected. It is well-led. And so, to have this kind of a loss from hedging activities is a big surprise,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I think what it points out that there are no rules of the road for hedging and for derivatives. And this needs to happen."" After the meltdown three years ago that nearly took the country over a cliff, Congress passed Dodd-Frank, a regulatory law to rein in risky investments and prevent the need for future government bailouts. Writing the regulations has been a ferocious battle, particularly over something called the Volcker Rule, after former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. It would ban banks from trading with their own funds. Worried about damaging the industry's ability to protect itself and hurting the recovery, the Treasury Department, Republicans and Wall Street have been trying to water it down. Dimon, a kind of a shining light in the industry, is a leading opponent of the Volcker Rule. Or has been until maybe now. Sen. Carl Levin, D-Michigan, told ""Meet the Press"" that the price to be paid ""will be that they will lose their battle in Washington to weaken the rule. That is the real price."" If Dimon has lost his voice, Republicans have not. ""Bear in mind, the Dodd-Frank bill, 2,300 pages, they've already had 400 rule-making sessions, and this is where you have so much government regulation coming in that you can't see the forest for the trees,"" Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tennessee, said on ABC's ""This Week."" It is, as talking head after talking head conceded, very complicated. But not all of it. ""In how we manage that portfolio, we did lose $2 billion trading. In hindsight, we took far too much risk,"" Dimon said. ""The strategy we had was barely vetted. It was barely monitored. It should never have happened."" Unfortunately, the part that is clear is not reassuring. Watch State of the Union with Candy Crowley Sundays at 9am ET.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Amid the crush of migrant workers who gathered to see Aung San Suu Kyi in Bangkok Wednesday was Sein Htay, a Burmese worker who has been in Thailand for 17 years. He took his son, two-year-old Waiyanmin, to greet the Burmese opposition leader on her first visit outside Myanmar in more than 20 years. They gathered with thousands of others outside a migrant center on the outskirts of the Thai capital where Suu Kyi spoke to an elated and emotional crowd, many of whom said they never thought the day would come. ""There's no better feeling in the world than what happened,"" Sein told CNN through migrant rights activist Andy Hall. ""He said he's happy beyond words, cannot describe the feeling. So positive,"" said Hall. Hall described walking about the streets in the suburb of Mahachai, home to the highest concentration of Burmese migrants in Thailand in the hours before Suu Kyi's arrival. ""All the workers were saying they just thought it was rumors. They said until they actually saw her face, they still didn't believe it,"" he said. ""And then she was there, speaking to them. They didn't feel like she was there, they were so amazed."" From a balcony high above the crush of people, Suu Kyi told them that she would try her best to look after migrant workers' rights. ""The laws of this land which do provide protection for workers are not always observed by everybody concerned,"" she said. ""We need to educate our workers as to their rights, by what kind of legal means there are for defending their rights, because whatever we negotiate with our host government we want to do it in a harmonious way. Of course we will also be asking for help and support from the local authorities,"" she said. There are around three million migrant workers in Thailand, of which around 80% are from Burma, according to the Mahidol Migration Center. They were lured by the promise of work to support their families from a country where jobs are scarce. ""We don't have any jobs so I came to Thailand,"" Sein told CNN in English. In the past 17 years Sein said he had worked in just about every lowly-paid job open to migrants in Thailand: in construction, on fishing boats and at the factories back at port, where workers peel prawns and package seafood for export. According to a recent United Nations Report, the poor regulation of migrant workers under Thai law makes them vulnerable to exploitation. ""Irregular migrants are in a vulnerable position owing to their migration status, and are often exposed to abuse and exploitation, including physical or psychological abuse, poor working or living conditions, withholding or non-payment of wages, and excessive working hours, as well as arbitrary arrest and extortion by law enforcement authorities,"" stated the report, by the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, Joy Ngozi Ezeilo. Thailand responded to the report by saying it contained ""inaccuracies or errors concerning relevant laws, policies and processes."" It added that some recommendations from the report had already been undertaken. Andy Hall said most, if not all, the migrant workers he's spoken to in Thailand want to return to Myanmar, if only there were jobs. ""They never wanted to be here in the first place. They've been caught between two hells, one hell in Myanmar and one hell in Thailand,"" he said. ""They never wanted to be here in Thailand. It's not their homeland and they've not been welcomed here in terms of their human rights. They've been welcomed here as laborers who do cheap work,"" he said. Amid the sweltering heat, Suu Kyi said that it was up to Burmese migrants as well as the government to create a Myanmar that could welcome them back. ""Everybody has a responsibility. They too [Burmese workers] have a responsibility and we too have a responsibility to create the kind of country to which all our people can return, whenever they wish too,"" she said. However, one Myanmar expert said more changes needed to be made within the country before many Burmese migrants would consider going home. ""People need to be assured that there will be some kind of rule of law around property and around individual businesses to feel safe to return,"" said Monique Skidmore, pro vice-chancellor of international and major projects at the University of Canberra in Australia. ""The nationalization of businesses, for example, the use of middle men, the increasing taxation that continues to be leveled, those kinds of economic parameters need to change,"" she said. ""The ability to own property and not have it confiscated by the state... Even in border areas you've got to be assured that the Burmese soldiers are not going to steal your chickens or levy you for a quarter of your rice quota, for example.""","Thousands of Burmese migrants brave heat to see Aung San Suu Kyi in Thailand .

"(CNN) -- Schapelle Corby, the Australian serving time in a Bali, Indonesia, prison on a conviction of drug smuggling, has had her jail term cut by five years. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's decree to reduce the former beauty therapist's 20-year jail sentence to 15 years arrived in a letter on Monday, according to Amzer Simanjuntak, a spokesman of Denpasar District Court. The decree was dated May 15 and also stipulated that the original 100 million Indonesian rupiah (US$10,700) fine still had to be paid, the spokesman added. Before entering Kerobokan prison to visit her on Wednesday, Corby's sister, Mercedes, expressed gratitude for the decision. ""Our family would like to say, 'Thank you,' to the Indonesian president,"" she said. ""We now hope to get more information about possible parole for Schapelle, and we hope to get positive news on that. She is very happy.' The appeal for clemency, which Corby filed on the basis of a medical examination that diagnosed her as suffering from acute depression with psychotic symptoms, comes nearly seven years to the day of her sentencing. Corby, now 34, was convicted in May 2005 for smuggling nine pounds (4.1 kilograms) of marijuana in a bag while arriving at Bali's Denpasar International Airport the previous October. She has always maintained her innocence, saying that she was the victim of a drug smuggling operation. Aside from whether Corby will be eligible for parole -- and if so, where she would serve it -- the timeframe for her release remains unclear because of remissions granted for good behavior. A spokesperson for Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said, ""Should Ms. Corby's legal team apply for parole, the Australian Government would support it."" Indonesia's Justice and Human Rights Minister Amir Syamsuddin on Wednesday linked Corby's case to that of ""hundreds of"" Indonesian inmates in Australia held in trafficking cases and said he hoped they would get similar attention. ""Especially the underage children, whose number are quite many,"" he said. In addition to those cases, Amir cited Corby's illness during imprisonment and lighter sentences imposed by other nations on marijuana possession convictions as factors that the government weighed in granting Corby clemency. Meanwhile, Australian Foreign Minister Bob Carr said there is no link between the Corby case and the release of convicted Indonesian human traffickers, including three from a Western Australian prison last Friday amid concerns they were minors. ""If there were no Schapelle Corby in a Balinese prison we'd still be releasing minors, kids on fishing boats who'd been collected through people smuggling,"" he said to reporters Wednesday in a video broadcast by Australia's ABC News. ""We'd be releasing them because it is plainly indecent to have in Australian adult jails kids from Indonesia who have been picked up on fishing boats being misused for people smuggling. ""At no stage has the Government sat down with our Indonesian counterparts and said, 'We'll release minors from our jails, if you consider a clemency application by Ms. Corby.'"" Journalist Rudy Madanir contributed to this report.","NEW: Decree, dated May 15, says $10,700 fine must be paid, court spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Guinea-Bissau's military has arrested acting President Raimundo Pereira and Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr., a military spokesman said, in a coup that has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community. The men were taken into custody Thursday night, as gunfire and explosions rocked the capital of Bissau. Daba Naualna, a spokesman for the army's chief of staff, told CNN on Friday night that both Pereira and Gomes were well, and that no one had been killed or wounded in the unrest. He claimed a group that calls itself ""the Military Command"" was behind the arrests, though it is not clear who its members are. Afterward, according to Naualna, the actual leaders of Guinea-Bissau's armed forces took control of the situation in an attempt to ensure stability. ""The (army chief of staff) thinks, for the sake of the country, that power cannot fall into the streets and decided to have (the military) play its part in seeking solutions with the political class to resolve this crisis,"" the spokesman said. Asserting that it has no desire to ""stay in power,"" the military is asking for members of political parties to send it concrete ideas by Sunday on what to do next, Naualna said. A meeting will take place that day to discuss the proposals. Such political moves have done little to dull the anger expressed Friday by foreign leaders, some of which highlighted the fact the coup occurred just before the second round of a presidential election set for April 29. African Union Chairman Jean Ping issued a statement expressing his group's ""total rejection of any attempt at undermining the constitutional order"" and demanding the ""immediate and unconditional release"" of Pereira and Gomes. U.N. Security Council members issued a joint statement Friday saying they ""strongly condemn the forcible seizure of power"" and ""firmly denounce this incursion by the military into politics,"" and urged the ""immediate release"" of the prime minister, president and other senior officials. Separately, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned ""in the strongest possible terms"" and pressed the Guinea-Bissau military to ""respect civilian authority, constitutional order and the rule of law."" The White House used similar language, urging ""all parties to reconcile their differences through the democratic process."" On Saturday, the foreign ministers of the Community of Portuguese Language Countries, known as CPLP, will meet in Lisbon to assess the situation and take ""concerted measures"" regarding Guinea-Bissau's situation, that group said. The Military Command issued its own statement contending that the revolt was in response to a ""secret deal"" between the governments of Guinea-Bissau and Angola. This ""deal"" was drawn up by the Guinea-Bissau government to allow Angolan troops in the country and mandates ""Angola to attack Guinea-Bissau's military,"" a communique from the group said. This group says that Pereira and Gomes signed the deal, and it accuses the African Union, whose rotating presidency is currently held by Angola, of also supporting intervention by Angolan forces. The Military Command, like the larger military, does not intend to remain in power and wants to ""return"" the country to normalcy, according to its statement. The group called for calm and for people in the capital ""to refrain from acts of violence and vandalism that could jeopardize the order."" Guinea-Bissau's history has been marked by several military coups and attempted coups since the nation of 1.6 million people gained independence from Portugal in 1974. The conflicts have ravaged the West African nation's infrastructure and economy, leaving it among the poorest in the world. The first round of voting in a presidential election was held March in Guinea-Bissau, and campaigning for the second round was about to begin. The election was prompted by the death of the incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha in January after a long illness. The residence of Gomes, the prime minister and a presidential candidate, was looted, witnesses said, as were the homes of some government ministers, including Interior Minister Fernando Gomes. The country's public media outlets are under the control of the army and are regularly broadcasting statements from the military, witnesses said Friday. A number of Angolan troops are present in Guinea-Bissau under a bilateral agreement, on a mission to help reform the country's armed forces, Angola said. Angola, also a former Portuguese colony, issued a statement earlier this week stating its intention to unilaterally withdraw its troops. The U.S. Embassy in Senegal said the situation in Guinea-Bissau is unclear, but it is closely monitoring events. It urged U.S. citizens to remain where they are and avoid downtown Bissau. ""We are disheartened by the negative turn of events so soon after the first round of Guinea-Bissau's presidential election,"" it said. ""We are deeply concerned about the safety of all those in Bissau today, and urge all parties to put down their weapons and restore legitimate civilian leadership."" Elisabete Azevedo-Harman, a professor of politics at the Catholic University of Portugal and Mozambique who is currently in Bissau, told CNN that she heard gunfire and explosions Thursday night near the prime minister's residence. Soldiers and police remained on the streets of the capital Friday, but in smaller numbers than the night before, she said. People were starting to venture out again, she added. Sanha had become president in September 2009, months after the assassination of his predecessor. Despite his coming to power in what international observers deemed a fair and peaceful election, his tenure was marked by turmoil among the country's military and political leadership. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full, five-year term.

"(CNN) -- As my companion and I passed through security on a gorgeous Washington afternoon Friday, invited by President Barack Obama to join hundreds of openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender folks at the White House for a reception celebrating LGBT Pride Month, I couldn't help but reflect back. The White House and I go back a long way. In the 1950s, as a young gay boy growing up in a small fishing town on the southern coast of California, I had, for some seemingly inexplicable reason, an intense fascination with all things White House, and especially its occupants, our American presidents. On Halloween in the third grade, my mom crafted for me a magnificent costume of Thomas Jefferson, and I missed that I'd won a prize because my cotton wig impaired my hearing. At major family gatherings, I'd dress up in what became known as my ""presidentials"" and entertained relatives by my deft ability to name all the presidents in order, right up to and including Dwight Eisenhower. So, the idea of growing up to be president some day was implanted in my head, and it became the source of great consternation for me when, in grad school in the late '60s as civil rights, feminist and anti-Vietnam War ferment was swelling, I ratified my own commitment to social justice by openly claiming my gay identity. I burst out of the closet with a bang, co-founding the Berkeley, California, chapter of the Gay Liberation Front, for one thing. But with all that came the sad realization that, alas, I had to completely abandon my dream of ever becoming president. Still, the White House beckoned me. In the mid-1980s, I had an opportunity to represent an obscure and unhappy publication as its journalistic correspondent in the White House for a few years. I leaped at the chance, moving across the U.S. to be there, in the press room, almost daily. I didn't like who I worked for and I didn't like who was president at the time, but I loved the White House, especially on the few occasions when I was included among journalists invited to one of the many holiday parties held there. LZ Granderson: The secret gay agenda . Ah, the East Room (where the formal news conferences were also held), the Blue Room, the Red Room and so forth! All the ponderous presidential portraits and artifacts chronicling the colorful history of the nation's chief executives. But while there, I felt light years away. I was gay, and I kept it to myself in those days. I was an outsider granted a glimpse of what I'd cherished so intimately as a youth. The idea of being gay was allowed nowhere near the official corridors of power. To the gay movement, it was a huge breakthrough when, in the 1990s, a president first uttered the word, ""gay,"" in a nonderogatory or ""as in happy"" sense, in a major speech. President Bill Clinton later spoke at one of the first national dinners of the Human Rights Campaign in the late 1990s. Held at a hotel ballroom blocks from the White House, I was there. Hope for LGBT people was in the air. Fast forwarding to last week, it was deeply moving to be back in the White House, finally not as a closeted journalist or anything other than an open and affirming public citizen. Unlike the LGBT reception held there just a year earlier, this time there were women and men in military uniform, some holding hands with their same-sex partners, made possible only after the president led the overturning of don't ask, don't tell in the course of the past year. Entering the East Room amid cheers to speak to us, President Barack Obama reaffirmed the commitment he'd made only weeks before to full support for gay marriage. We have a president now who can say without hesitation, as he did Friday, ""As long as I have the privilege of being your president, I promise you, you won't just have a friend in the White House, you will have a fellow advocate for an America where no matter what you look like or where you come from or who you love, you can dream big dreams and dream as openly as you want."" Thank you, Mr. President: You mean those kind of ""big dreams"" I had as a kid! There is no doubt in my mind now that there is some LGBT youngster in our land right now who will grow up to become president of the United States some day. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicholas Benton.","As a child, Nicholas Benton was fascinated with White House and presidents .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- A series of explosions rocked Baghdad on Thursday morning, killing at least 31 people and leaving more than 50 others injured, Iraq's interior ministry said. In a separate incident in Kirkuk, two car bombs exploded, killing four people and injuring 23 others, including six police officers. The violence may continue a pattern of outbreaks following lulls. March had the lowest monthly death toll since the U.S-led invasion in 2003, officials said earlier this month. According to interior ministry figures, 112 people died violently in March: 78 civilians, 12 Iraqi soldiers and 22 police officers. Until then, the lowest monthly death toll was in November 2009, when the country recorded 122 deaths. Figures have fluctuated in Iraq month to month, with lulls in violence followed immediately by an uptick. In March, Iraq hosted an Arab League summit, a gathering that signaled the political emergence of post-war democratic Iraq.

"London (CNN) -- Barclays on Monday announced the resignation of its chairman, Marcus Agius, in the widening scandal surrounding the bank's manipulation of interbank lending rates in 2008 and 2009. In a statement to the London Stock Exchange, Agius said the scandal has ""dealt a devastating blow"" to Barclays' reputation. ""As chairman, I am the ultimate guardian of the bank's reputation. Accordingly, the buck stops with me and I must acknowledge responsibility by standing aside,"" he added. Barclays was fined US$450 million last week by British and U.S. regulators after the bank admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates as part of LIBOR (London interbank Offered Rate) -- an interest rate floor between big banks that is set in London each trading morning. Authorities are also investigating other banks, with Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) understood to have fired some of its traders involved in LIBOR, according to British media reports. Britain's Financial Services Authority on Friday said the law must be tightened to deal with abuses, while Bank of England Governor Mervyn King attacked British banking culture, saying something had gone very wrong with an industry he derided for resorting to ""deceitful"" methods to make money. Meanwhile, Agius will stay on as chairman while the board searches for his replacement. Chief Executive Bob Diamond is also facing calls to resign. Both Diamond and Agius are expected to appear before a UK parliamentary committee later this week to face questions about the saga. The bank says it will also launch an audit into all of its past business practices and has vowed to make its findings public.

"(EW.com) -- Last night's results show spanned an exhausting two hours, but luckily Ryan Seacrest was able to keep the telecast as fresh as the yellow rose on Randy Jackson's sweater by trying out various intonations of his favorite term (""the nationwide vote"") and one of life's eternal questions, ""WHO WILL FILL THESE STOOLS?"" It's Ryan's time to shine, so don't even think about trying to plow him over, Brielldozer Von Huge Mistake! Speaking of freshness, Jimmy Iovine showed up. They'd found him living in the boiler room under Joe Pesci's School of Speech (the Harvard of the West; sorry, Stansbury) and he was more than happy to come sit in a little room off to the side and drop little truth pellets all over the Top 24.

On Reed Grimm: ""Way too kitschy for me, way too cabaret. Not gonna make it on this show like that."" Eben Franckewitz: ""Not ready for primetime."" Baylie Brown: ""Beautiful tune, nice tone, but she lost the plot."" And my favorite, Jimmy on Adam Brock: ""Supposedly he has a large black woman trapped in his body. As of right now, he's not pulling them both off."" Someone had to say it. Jimmy only lost me a little when he compared Aaron Marcellus to a cheesy Don Cheadle and called Heejun Han's intentions into question. Just because the kid has a sense of humor doesn't mean he thinks the show is named ""American Comedian."" Everyone knows it's named ""American Adele."" Heejun wouldn't be in the Top 13 if he couldn't actually get through to people while the music's on. So here they are -- your Top 13! America's Top 10: Phillip Phillips, Jessica Sanchez, Hollie Cavanagh, Joshua Ledet, Heejun Han, Shannon Magrane, Skylar Laine, Elise Testone, Colton Dixon, Jermaine Jones . Wild cards: Erika Van Pelt (Randy's choice), Jeremy Rosado (J. Lo's hugmonster), and DeAndre Brackensick (Steven Tyler's 17-year-old spirit animal) The six wild card contestants had to ""sing for their lives"" while their nine devastated compadres had to sit around, playing dead. Up first: Jen Hirsh on the Beatles' ""Oh Darling."" Maybe they showed too much of her too soon. I'd been really excited about Jen heading into this week, but the magic was gone. I agreed with Jimmy that Jen should have stayed miles away from Adele on Wednesday and this last performance of hers seemed just as desperate in terms of what he called ""vocal pyrotechnics."" She changed much more of both melodies than she needed to. It's always a fine line on Idol -- wanting to make something your own vs. going too far. I realize that Jeremy Rosado was a mostly personal/emotional choice for J. Lo, but I ain't mad at her because I love watching people cry, and because his high notes on Carrie Underwood's ""I Know You Won't"" sounded perfect to me even through the tears. If Jeremy is as popular with the other singers as he seems, I think he's a good one to have around during these first few weeks. It's always better when the cast can be at ease with each other -- and have you heard Jer-Bear gives the BEST hugs? ""Something's going through your body right now,"" suggested Ryan as Jeremy shook with emotion after his performance. If this was Ryan's way of begging for a hug, he should consider being more direct. Just get in there. Nestle, quick! Not so tender was Brielle Von Hugel, who nearly knocked Ryan over in her excitement to be called back into the spotlight, which is where Brielle belongs. ""That's just Brielle,"" she said OF HERSELF. ""Putting a twist on old classics."" Right, Brielle? Right. Brielle. Anyway, moments after Jimmy Iovine had bitched about there being ""too many Adele wannabes,"" Brielle launched right into Adele's ""Someone Like You."" [Aside:] I tend to have no shame regarding the way I live, and have generally adopted a ""sucks to be you"" attitude toward my neighbors when it comes to my TV habits. I'm sorry the apartment walls are thin, but we're all paying rent here and I'm just trying to do my job, you know? In all my years of recapping embarrassing reality television, Brielle's performance marks one of the few times I've ever actually turned my television way, way, way down -- not, like, as a courtesy to the Thai delivery guy (that's normal) but as a way to save face from strangers passing in the night. I could hear that someone was about to walk by outside, and I suddenly couldn't bear the thought of him or her thinking I might have CHOSEN to listen to ""Someone Like You""...like this. [/End of aside.] . Against all odds, the blessed Steven Tyler was honest with Brielle. ""I heard you nail it. A little pitchy in some spots in the turnaround. I just didn't hear it this time, I'm sorry baby."" It took him three sentences to twist his gist from lie to truth, but he did it. I'm proud of him. You could tell DeAndre Brackensick was a shoo-in for the wild card before he'd even begun ""Georgia On My Mind"" -- pretty much because of his hair. You just cannot NOT put that hair in the Top 13 when the hair-owner in question also has this super-high, very pure voice which, as of yet, he has no idea how to handle. The vocal coaches will help him, and he'll either figure it out in the near future or he'll crash and burn like the fire Eben Franckewitz never quite set to the rain. DeAndre is an adorable, sweaty, unpredictable sweetheart and I love not knowing what crazy hairography or misguided vocal gymnastics he'll try to pull off next. I'm into it. Yes! After getting sacked with having to sing second of 12 girls Wednesday night, Erika Van Pelt got her second chance and went all out in her purple bridesmaid shift on Lady Gaga's ""Edge of Glory."" She kicked ass. In fact, I'd comment on this performance the same way as Jimmy Iovine commented on her showing from Wednesday: ""She has music in her blood, and great restraint -- something the show needs more of, not less."" Erika didn't need to twist this song into a wretched balloon animal of Lady Gaga in order to prove she was the one to bring in as a finalist. Singing it solidly was enough. I'm not sure it'll be enough to keep her in much longer; I'm just glad we'll get to hear her voice another time. She does need a big performance next week -- and better placement. Finally, the judges called for Reed Grimm. Do it, Reed! Sing Adele's ""Hometown Glory"" the way it was meant to be self-indulgently cackled and scatted! No, Mr. Grimm gave Adele (and Randy, whose favorite word is ""Adele"") a break by self-indulgently cackling and scatting his way through Bill Withers' ""Use Me."" Eliminated: Reed Grimm, Brielle Von Hugel, Jen Hirsh, Chase Likens, Hallie Day, Adam Brock, Baylie Brown, Chelsea Sorrell, Creighton Fraker, Aaron Marcellus, Eben Franckewitz, Haley Johnsen . I'm fairly happy about this Top 13. I'm extremely happy about a Fox press release I just received that informs me that Deandre Brackensick ""makes Polynesian costumes for a living"" and that Hollie Cavanagh ""loves old couples."" Who doesn't?! I'm making a Polynesian costume right now! (In Photoshop; you can't see it until it's perfect.) Also, Jessica Sanchez ""can rap,"" y'all. Watch out. Next week the girls will don all-new pageant gowns to sing Whitney Houston, while the guys will try out Stevie Wonder. I wonder....if DeAndre can just make his hair look even prettier than usual and get permission to sing ""How Will I Know (If Heejun Really Loves Me)."" Fingers crossed!

"(CNN) -- Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo thinks Fernando Alonso's victory at the European Grand Prix can energize his team's bid to secure their first drivers' championship since 2007. The Spaniard became the first driver to record two wins this season, after the opening seven races of the campaign were won by seven different drivers. Alonso had started the race in 11th place but worked his way up the field to take the checkered flag and a 20-point lead in the drivers' championship. It represented the 30-year-old's 29th grand prix win and brought with it a ringing endorsement from Ferrari's president, who hinted the marque were keen to hunt down their first title since Kimi Raikkonen triumphed five years ago. Alonso reclaim world championship lead in Valencia . Montezemolo told Ferrari's official website: ""An exceptional driver, a competitive car and a perfect team: that is what our victory was made of. ""I am happy for (team principal) Stefano Domenicali and for all his team who have worked so hard and so well. I want to thank them individually, both for that and for what they are doing to keep improving. ""The championship is long, every race is unpredictable and there is still so much to do. But yesterday's win is a real adrenaline rush to encourage even more of a push."" Alonso shared the podium in Valencia with two drivers who are woven deep into Ferrari's fabric. Raikkonen, who landed the Italian team's last title, returned to the sport this year after a spell in the World Rally Championship and claimed second place for Lotus. Michael Schumacher was third in his Mercedes, the German winning five of his seven world titles with Ferrari, and Montezemolo expressed his pride at seeing all three take top honors in Spain. ""I saw all three champions of 'my' Ferrari hugging each other,"" he added. ""Thinking back to so many amazing wins in these last 15 years and to the people who have contributed to that -- from Michael to Kimi, from (former Ferrari team boss) Jean Todt to the other drivers, from the engineers to the mechanics -- I was really touched."" Alonso won the first of his two career titles for Renault in 2005, breaking Schumacher's dominance of the sport. He successfully defended his crown the following year. He now takes his 20-point lead in the championship to the British Grand Prix at Silverstone next month, hoping to emulate his victory in the 2011 race.","Ferrari president delighted with Fernando Alonso's victory at the European Grand Prix .

"Rome (CNN) -- At least one girl has died and half a dozen are injured following a bomb blast outside a school in the southern Italian city of Brindisi, Italian officials said Saturday. Officials have given conflicting accounts of the number killed and injured. Daniela Buccoliero, an official at the Prefecture of Brindisi, a local office of the Interior Ministry, told CNN one 16-year-old girl had died and another six students are injured, two of them seriously. Brindisi Mayor Mimmo Consales and Fabiano Amati, regional minister for Italy's Civil Protection agency, said there had been two deaths as a result of the blast. Amati said the scene shortly after the explosion was ""dramatic."" ""There were school back packs and notebooks everywhere. Many windows of the nearby buildings were broken,"" he told CNN. Amati said the police had found three gas cylinders at the site that were detonated with a remote control. The device was concealed behind a trash can by a wall 50 meters from the entrance of the school, he said. ""It's an attack on all Italians because schools are considered a secure area,"" Amati said. ""It's the first time in our country that a school is under attack."" Consales told CNN one of the girls had died in surgery from the wounds she sustained in the blast. Another of the injured is in very serious condition, he said. Italy's Prime Minister Mario Monti said the government was determined to combat crime and unite the country. He expressed the government's ""deep sorrow, dismay and outrage"" at what he called a ""most grave and heinous crime"" in a statement from the United States, where he is attending the G8 summit. Monti was informed of the blast during the night, and has been in close contact with Italy's president, interior minister and other local authorities since. He has ordered the country's flag to be displayed at half-staff Saturday and for the next three days, and sent a message of condolence to those directly affected by the blast. Italians gathered in front of the Pantheon in Rome and at Plebiscito square in Naples late Saturday to protest the violence and to show support for its victims. Three days of mourning were declared in Brindisi, where schools will be closed through Tuesday. The explosion occurred early Saturday as students were arriving at the school, which offers vocational training, Italy's ANSA news agency reported. It is not yet clear why the school was targeted or who carried out the attack. Police chief Francesco Cirillo told CNN that the motive is under investigation and that no one has claimed responsibility. Nichi Vendola, governor of the Puglia region where Brindisi is situated, said: ""It could be either a mafia or a political terrorism attack. It's too early to say. It's an unprecedented event."" The Francesca Morvillo Falcone school is named after the wife of a prominent anti-mafia judge, which has fueled speculation that the organized crime group might be behind it. It has been 20 years since Falcone was assassinated in Palermo, Sicily, in May 1992. The school is located near both the tribunal and the city's tax collection agency. Italy's tax collection agencies, called Equitalia, have been targeted by mail bombs, Molotov cocktails and suicides in front of their offices in recent months, with the incidents occurring in the cities of Rome, Livorno and Bologna, respectively. Italy's interior ministry said this week that it would start to deploy soldiers outside some government buildings because of the current tensions. The local anti-racket commission of Mesagne, a town in Brindisi province, issued a warning last week of heightened threats by both organized crime groups and anarchists against government agencies. An anti-mafia march that scheduled for Sunday will go ahead as scheduled. Journalists Livia Borghese and Barbie Nadeau and CNN's Joseph Netto contributed to this report.","NEW: Italians gather in Rome, Naples to protest the violence .

"(CNN) -- Feed the world's starving. Cure vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Put an end to crop failure. Combat global warming. Such are the promises of genetically modified (GM) rice. But if it all sounds too good to be true, environmentalists say, that's because it is. For proponents of GM rice, GM food is the obvious solution to the ongoing problems of population growth, changing climate conditions and malnutrition. For its opponents, it's an unnecessary and potentially catastrophic exercise which only feeds corporate interests and does little to solve the real problems of global food supply, malnutrition and farming practices. According to seed producer Syngenta, there are around 81 million hectares' (200 million acres') worth of GM crops presently being grown in the world, representing the work of 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries. They are spread mainly between just five countries -- the United States, Canada, Argentina, China and Brazil -- which represent 98 percent of the US$44 billion GM crop market, according to TheCampaign.org. Rice is by far the most important crop for more than 50 percent of the world's population, according to WWF, and relied upon by around 2 billion people in Asia for 60 percent to 70 percent of their daily calorie intake. Asia is the world's biggest rice market, growing and consuming 90 percent of the world's rice, according to Greenpeace. Globally, we will produce around 633 million tons of rice this year, says the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. But in 20 years' time, that won't be enough, according to the European Association for Bioindustries, or EuropaBio (the self-proclaimed political voice of Europe's biotech industry). Because of population growth, the rice industry will have 1 billion new customers annually requiring 200 million tons more of rice than there is today. To meet the nutritional needs of all of these people -- in addition to the 800 million presently starving -- food production will have to ""more than double"" in under 40 years, it says. But problematic weather conditions such as flooding and drought, brought on by climate change, are putting strains on global food production, GM supporters say. And to make matters worse, around 40 percent of crops each year are lost to pests, weeds and diseases, says Syngenta. GM rice proponents: Higher nutrition, environmentally friendly . With GM rice, these problems are confronted, if not solved, its proponents say, as different strains of rice can be bred to withstand attack from pests, diseases and hostile environments. Not only that, they say, but GM rice can be bred to offer much higher nutritional values than regular rice can, supposedly combating the issues of malnutrition that are now endemic in the developing world. (According to the Golden Rice Network, around 1 billion pregnant women in Asia are Iron-deficient; 2 billion more lack Zinc; while 250 million children are Vitamin A deficient.) As a result, the Philippine Rice Research Institute and Strive Foundation have developed a GM rice strain they are calling ""3-in-1"" rice that is packed with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc, according to the Philippines Information Agency. And Golden Rice, developed by Syngenta, is said to be loaded with so much beta-carotene that it can combat the issues of Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) to the point that some say it can even prevent blindness. The original Golden Rice was launched onto the world stage in 2000 by Syngenta, and it has recently been improved to the extent that ""Golden Rice 2"" now contains 23 times as much beta carotene as the original. Scientists testing the strain say a serving of 200 grams should provide the recommended daily Vitamin A intake; challenging critics such as Friends of the Earth who previously said its claim of beating VAD were erroneous. GM proponents are now even claiming that GM crops are more environmentally friendly than traditional crops. A study by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA) claims that the effect of farmers in the U.S., Canada and Argentina in 2005 growing weed killer-resistant crops was the equivalent to taking 4 million cars off the road and preventing 9 billion kilograms (19.8 billion pounds) of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere. The reason: Farmers planting these crops didn't need to plough the fields to destroy weeds, which meant the organic matter didn't get exposed to the atmosphere, releasing greenhouse gases in the process, according to the New Scientist. GM rice opponents: Unknown risks, chemical use . But for all GM rice's promises, the world's leading environmental NGOs -- Greenpeace, WWF and Friends of the Earth -- are simply not persuaded. Traditional farming practices need to be embraced they say, as farmers have been selectively breeding rice successfully for centuries. There are now as many as 140,000 varieties, says Greenpeace, which have been developed without genetic tampering to resist particular diseases, or pests, and to survive in drought conditions -- or floods. No one knows what the long-term health impact of GM rice is, opponents also argue, and using GM rice seeds leads to the trap of having to buy the chemicals sold by the companies selling the seeds. NGOS such as Greenpeace argue these chemicals are unnecessary, particularly in the early part of the growing season. According to Greenpeace, the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines reduced its insecticide use by 95 percent between 1993 and 2003, ""with no yield loss"" and a further study found that 80% of pesticide sprays used in the Philippines were ""unnecessary."" Then there is the basic concern over introducing foreign genes into the rice itself. Golden Rice was developed by introducing two genes from a daffodil, for example, while new breeds of rice being given approval by the United States for trials actually contain human genes. Adding to the concern of unknown health and environmental risks presented by altered rice is this worry: What happens when the seeds contaminate other types of neighboring non-GM rice? That question was effectively answered last year, when two global rice scares shook the rice industry and substantially bolstered support for GM opponents in the process. A U.S. rice strain, developed by Bayer CropScience -- which was unapproved for human consumption -- leaked into the global food chain, as did illegal seeds that were being sold in China. Bayer was sued by farmers claiming their crops were contaminated, the Reuters news service reported; the world's largest rice processor Ebro Puleva immediately announced it would stop buying U.S. rice; the European Union and Japan declared import bans on U.S. rice; and rice prices went through the floor. Since then, says Greenpeace, and in a resounding victory for the anti-GM movement, 41 rice companies from around the world have come out and rejected GM rice. Furthermore, key rice producing countries Thailand and Vietnam have banned GM rice for good. Those two countries alone account for nearly 50 percent of all global rice exports, according to the NGO. A contentious issue . The issue of GM rice has become so contentious that even the co-founder of Greenpeace came out publicly in defense of it recently, attacking the NGO's ""scare tactics and sensationalism"" in an issue of The American. ""Golden rice can indeed contribute, in a cost-effective manner, to the alleviation of VAD [vitamin A deficiency], thereby easing children's suffering and, in many cases, saving their lives,"" he wrote. ""My old Greenpeace compatriots counter these findings not with their own science, but rather with Hollywood-style fictions about 'killer weeds' and 'Frankenfoods.' Their campaign suggests a complete lack of respect for science and logic."" Greenpeace argues it is not anti-science or anti-biotechnology, however, and promotes the use of techniques such as Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) which allows scientists to breed pest/weather-resistant crops by identifying which gene is responsible for the resistance, then repeatedly cross-breeding and backcrossing them (to eliminate undesirable inherited traits) until the desired crop has been achieved. WWF, meanwhile says the system of rice intensification (SRI) can save ""billions of cubic meters"" of water every day (40 percent less than conventional methods, it says), while increasing yields by more than 30 percent, according to Treehugger.com. SRI is based on farming methods first adopted in Madagascar in the 1980s and entail: developing nutrient-rich, un-flooded nurseries (as opposed to flooded ones); planting rice seedlings further apart from each other; using composts or manure instead of chemical fertilizers; and controlling the amount of water the rice receives. If India were to dedicate 20 million hectares of land to this system, WWF says, ""The country could meet its food grain objectives of 220 million tons of grain by 2012 instead of 2050."" WWF says that if this method was implemented, not only would it save water and bring food security, it would also help the environment -- SRI rice fields do not emit methane, WWF says, as do conventional rice growing environments.

"(EW.com) -- Who had more money thrown at him this weekend? A bong-smoking teddy bear with a bad attitude or Channing Tatum in a sparkly G-string? Surprisingly, the stuffed animal proved the victor! Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane's raunchy comedy ""Ted,"" which stars Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, earned an impressive $54.1 million out of 3,239 theaters during its debut weekend -- the third-best debut ever for an R rated comedy behind the openings of ""The Hangover Part II"" ($85.9 million) and ""Sex and the City"" ($57 million) -- and the best debut ever for an original comedic storyline. What went right? According to Universal's President of Domestic Distribution Nikki Rocco, ""The film. The marketing. The advertising -- that's what went right!"" During a phone call with EW this morning, Rocco praised ""Ted's"" advertising campaign kick-off in April, when MacFarlane appeared in a 90-second TV spot during an episode of ""Family Guy"" and pointed audiences to ""Ted's"" extra-buzzy red-band trailer online. Clearly, much of the loyal ""Family Guy"" audience turned out for the opening weekend. ""It's been a while since an original, zany comedy has been on the marketplace,"" says Rocco. ""Everybody likes something fresh, something new."" Indeed, they did. ""Ted's"" debut frame easily surpassed those of other recent R-rated hits like ""21 Jump Street"" ($36.1 million), ""Horrible Bosses"" ($28.3 million), ""Bad Teacher"" ($31.6 million), and Wahlberg's own PG-13 flick ""The Other Guys"" ($35.5 million). Each of those films exhibited substantial legs at the box office and crossed $100 million domestically. Given ""Ted's"" decent reviews and healthy ""A-"" CinemaScore grade , it should too. Universal just may have a $200 million hit on its hands -- great news considering the film, which was produced by Media Rights Capital, cost just $50 million. Men made up most of the crowds. According to Universal, Ted's audience was 56% male, while 52% of moviegoers were 30 or older. You know which movie's audience wasn't predominantly male? ""Magic Mike's."" The endlessly written about stripper film, which is partially inspired by Channing Tatum's real-life stripper past, grossed a tremendous $39.2 million in its opening weekend from audiences which were 73% female. The result is far higher than anyone in the industry would have predicted a month ago, but ""Mike quickly snowballed into a ""Sex and the City""-type release and became a must-see ""event"" for groups of women in the mood for something other than ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" ""This is what the business is about,"" says Warner Brothers' President of Domestic Distribution Dan Fellman. ""There are surprises sometimes, and when you get a sleeper, it's great."" For Warner Brothers, ""Magic Mike"" was already a winner on its opening day, when it grossed a jaw-dropping $19.4 million. The film was independently financed for $7 million by Steven Soderbergh, Channing Tatum and Matthew McConaughey; Warner Brothers then paid $7 million to acquire ""Magic Mike"" from Soderbergh, with whom they often collaborate, and agreed to distribute. Of course, advertising and distribution costs exist as well, but according to Fellman, ""Everybody is making a lot of money."" While ""Magic Mike"" did score a sizzling debut, the drama also proved incredibly front-loaded. (And no, I'm not talking about Joe Manganiello's character Big Dick Richie.) After ""Mike's"" $19.4 million opening day, it fell by a whopping 42 percent on Saturday to $11.4 million and then a more-standard 26% on Sunday to $8.4 million. These declines point to a truncated run at the box office â€” as does the moderate ""B"" CinemaScore grade from audiences, who may have been expecting an upbeat romp from ""Magic Mike,"" which is actually quite a bit darker than advertising suggests. Thus, only time will tell whether the film passes $100 million domestically. Still, ""Magic Mike"" shouldn't be viewed as anything but a huge winner -- especially for its star, Channing Tatum, whose banner year continues. Following the success of ""The Vow"" ($125 million), and ""21 Jump Street"" ($138.3 million), Tatum's appeal has earned him another smash, and no actor in Hollywood has a higher stock than him right now. Maybe it's a good thing that ""G.I. Joe"" got pushed.... Last weekend's chart champion, Disney-Pixar's $185 million effort ""Brave,"" dropped by 49% in its second weekend to a still-strong $34 million -- good for third place. The Scottish adventure raced past the $100 million mark on its eighth day of release and has now earned $131.7 million after two weekends. A good comparison for ""Brave"" is another Pixar favorite ""Wall-E,"" which also dropped by 49% in its second weekend and had earned $127.2 million at the same point in its run. ""Wall-E"" finished with $223 million domestically, and that seems like a probable total for ""Brave"" as well. In fourth, ""Tyler Perry's Madea's Witness Protection"" started with a potent $26.4 million from 2,161 theaters -- a bit ahead of the director's last Madea film, ""Madea's Big Happy Family,"" which debuted to $25.1 million in 2011. ""Witness Protection's"" small uptick is an encouraging sign for the cross-dressing franchise, which was beginning to show signs of age when ""Madea's Big Happy Family"" earned ""just"" $53.3 million, a full 41% less than 2009â€²s ""Madea Goes To Jail,"" which grossed $90.5 million. Audiences issued the picture, which cost $20 million, an ""A-"" CinemaScore grade. Rounding out the Top 5 is Dreamworks' $145 million sequel ""Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted,"" which has held up quite well in the face of ""Brave"" over the past two weeks. ""Madagascar 3"" dropped 40% this weekend to $11.8 million and has now grossed $180 million after four frames. The zoo animal comedy has stampeded up the box office faster than either of its predecessors -- at the same point in its run, ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" had earned $159.1 million. ""Europe's Most Wanted"" is now poised to be the highest domestic earner in the franchise, and it will soon outdo the original ""Madagascar's"" $193.6 million haul. Down in tenth place, Disney's family drama ""People Like Us"" flopped almost as badly as last weekend's ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World."" Despite overall positive reviews, ""People Like Us"" grossed a measly $4.3 million from 2,055 theaters. Good thing the Chris Pine/Elizabeth Banks drama, which earned a ""B+"" CinemaScore grade, carries a light $16 million budget. Overall, the box office is demonstrating remarkable health. Without a giant action movie in the Top 5, the current lineup was still able to set a June box office record with a cumulative gross well above $200 million. (I'll add in exact figures when they become available.) Some are saying that the heat wave sweeping across the U.S. is driving people into cool, air-conditioned theaters, and in a poll posted yesterday, 59% of readers voted that the heat does, in fact, make them more likely to go to the theater. It should also be noted that neither of the top two films are in 3-D. 1. Ted -- $54.1 million . 2. Magic Mike -- $39.2 million . 3. Brave -- $34.0 million . 4.

"(CNN) -- World motorcycling champion Casey Stoner is determined to show he is still the man to beat in 2012, having set the early pace ahead of the MotoGP season's opening race in Qatar on Sunday. The 26-year-old Australian led the pack at Thursday's first practice session at Losail, and was also fastest at the first of two runs on Friday. The Honda rider was followed by Yamaha's 2010 world champion Jorge Lorenzo of Italy in both outings. Ducati's American rider Nicky Hayden, another to have won the championship, finished third on Thursday -- while Honda's Andrea Dovizioso was in that position after Friday's opener. Stoner has been in sparkling form during pre-season testing along with Spanish teammate Dani Pedrosa, who was fourth last year after an injury-hit season. ""We started this evening with huge chatter issues and I was a little afraid we couldn't fix this but after a few more exits we managed to reduce it to a more comfortable level,"" Stoner, who has won the world title with two different teams, said on the MotoGP website after Thursday's session.

In contrast, it was a slow start for Valentino Rossi, a seven-time world champion in the sport's premier class, who finished the Thursday session in 10th place and the same again in Friday's first run. The Italian rider will be hoping to make a comeback after a disappointing 2011 season, his first with Ducati after a long period of dominance at Yamaha. Rossi and teammate Hayden must also familiarize themselves with the still-new Desmosedici GP12 machines. ""I used the hard tire the whole session, trying to do a lot of laps in order to understand it. The new tire is much better for warming up, so good for safety, but it started to slide a lot after some laps and made some of the under-steer worse,"" Rossi said.

"Washington (CNN) -- A 31-year-old Oklahoma woman helped make medical history and started a chain of ""paying it forward"" when she decided to donate her kidney to a stranger halfway around the world, a man in Athens, Greece, officials announced Friday. Elizabeth Gay was the history-making donor, and Michalis Helmis was the recipient. His wife, Dora Papaioannou-Helmis, in return donated one of her kidneys to a patient in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The announcement of the first intercontinental organ exchange was made at a news conference held at the Greek Embassy in Washington. ""The joint effort of 'paying it forward' confirms what a huge difference an individual can make,"" Greek Ambassador Vassilis Kaskarelis said during the press conference. It ""confirms that we are all part of one world, that our fates are intertwined and that if we all work together, the possibilities are endless"" So far, one Greek and four American lives have been saved, and two more transplants are scheduled with a donor from Trinidad and Tobago joining the chain. Gay was the first in the chain of kidney transplants. ""The opportunity to help change someone's life, in itself, would be an honor but to potentially change the world -- it's huge,"" she said, ""I felt that ... a month of surgery and recovery in order to help give someone else life was completely worth it."" Before Gay could get the opportunity, though, Greek law had to be changed to allow the exchange. Greece's transplant law -- intended to prevent black market organ harvesting -- stated that only a first or second relative could donate a kidney. Papaioannou-Helmis, whose husband was in desperate need of a kidney transplant, spearheaded the efforts to change the law. After meeting with various officials and ministers, Helmis family attorney Vasilis Athanasiou said they ""understood what could be done."" The law was changed 18 months later, and the Greek couple flew to the United States in December 2011 so the husband could start the process and receive his new kidney. Four months later, she returned to donate her kidney to a Pennsylvania man -- a chain started by a practice called ""kidney pair donation."" ""Kidney pair donation is when two people come together -- someone loves somebody enough that they want to give them a kidney, but they find out that they're not compatible,"" said Dr. Michael Rees, director of transplantation at the University of Toledo, where the Gray/Helmis kidney exchange took place. ""So instead, they're willing to give a stranger a kidney so that another stranger can give their loved one a kidney."" ""As a donor I feel very well and I'm very calm,"" Papaioannou-Helmis, who attended Friday's news conference with her husband via Skype, said through a translator. ""Every day that I see Michalis well I'm very happy. And every day I think of Liz, and I think of the person that received my kidney, Mr. Charles Ripple and I wonder how he's doing, how he's feeling every day."" ""It's just been fabulous. Everything is working good,"" Ripple responded, ""I feel the best I've felt in a couple years."" Theodora, Dora Papaioannou-Helmis' full name, in Greek means ""gift from God.""","Elizabeth Gay, 31, of Oklahoma donates her kidney to a stranger in Greece .

"(WIRED)  -- HP has at last revealed its long-awaited Slate, an 8.9-inch tablet with capacitive multi-touch and running Windows 7. The Slate, you will remember, was proudly touted by Microsoft's Steve Ballmer as an iPad killer, back before the iPad even existed. So is this an iPad competitor? No freakin' way. The HP Slate 500 Tablet PC is just that, a PC. It runs on a 1.86GHz Intel Atom Z540 processor, has 2GB RAM and a 64GB SSD, along with a Broadcom accelerator for 1080p video, a USB port, HDMI-out, a hardware Ctrl-Alt-Delete switch, a button to activate the on-screen keyboard and a pair of cameras, one on the back for photos and one on the front for Skyping. It also has, somewhat unbelievably, a slide-out Windows license. That's right.

"(CNN) -- Back in January, Vice President Joe Biden summed up President Obama's first term with: ""Osama Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive."" At the time, the Obama campaign sought to emphasize the president's record in foreign policy and saving the auto industry. Last week, the campaign unveiled a new theme and sent Biden to Ohio to test it out. For the first time, Biden called the Republican contenders by name and said that they would ""bankrupt the middle class."" The campaign is now more focused on the economy, highlighting the difference between the president's ""promoting the private sector"" and the GOP's ""promoting the privileged sector."" The president's political fortunes have improved, but voters are fickle. Voters applauded George H.W. Bush for winning the Gulf War in 1991; then after an economic slump, they fired him in 1992. If the economy keeps getting better and if President Obama seems to be on top of world affairs, then he will indeed win. Conversely, if the recovery stalls or if he botches a foreign crisis, then he will probably lose. So how do things look? Although unemployment remains high, it has come down from its peak levels. Other economic indicators are pointing in the right direction, too. In the past three years, for instance, the Dow Jones has increased by about 70%. On the global scene, President Obama has pulled out of Iraq. As tough as the war in Afghanistan may be, it has not cost nearly as many American lives as Korea or Vietnam. In any case, the administration is planning to withdraw. All told, things aren't great, but they were worse a few years ago. That's hardly an inspiring slogan, but the reality may be sufficient for the president to get a second term. Here's the rub: Reality can suddenly turn bad. In the middle of his term, President Carter seemed a decent bet to win re-election. The economy was doing OK, and he had brought the Egyptians and Israelis together at the Camp David Summit. Then the revolution in Iran disrupted oil supplies, hiking gasoline prices and triggering an economic recession. The Iranian hostage crisis initially prompted Americans to rally around their president, but as it dragged on, his approval ratings sank. Although the current situation in Iran isn't identical, there are enough similarities to trouble the White House. Uncertainty has driven up pump prices, which have slowed the rise in the president's poll numbers. As Newt Gingrich says, ""You can't buy enough advertising to offset driving past a gas station."" A nuclear Iran would put the president's diplomatic skills to the test. If he failed, he would pay a steep price on Election Day. So sunshine means political victory and dark skies mean defeat. But consider the partly cloudy scenario, where the news is bad enough to put the outcome in doubt but not so terrible as to ensure the president's ouster. In such cases, messaging comes into play. It might move only a point or two, but in an otherwise 50-50 election, that margin can make the difference. President Obama's habitual response to policy problems is to say that ""there is no silver bullet."" He should drop that line, since it sounds defeatist. And werewolves are the only ones that like hearing there are no silver bullets. Instead, the classic political strategy is to go on the attack. As Richard Nixon put it: ""Politics is battle, and the best way to fire up your troops is to rally them against a visible opponent on the other side of the field."" For Democrats, this advice means painting the GOP candidate as the heartless instrument of the wealthiest 1%. We are already hearing such rhetoric. For President Obama, however, there is a catch. During the 2008 campaign, he collected millions in campaign contributions from the 1%. This time out, some of them are shutting their checkbooks to him. Moreover, the rhetoric of rich versus poor can lead to awkward moments. Recently, Vice President Biden accused the GOP of not caring about the middle class. Critics noted that he made the remarks at a $10,000-per-couple fundraiser. This kind of back-and-forth will count only if conditions produce a close election. A big margin on either side will depend largely on the economy and grand issues of war and peace. Reality trumps rhetoric. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John J. Pitney, Jr.","Vice president Joe Biden pitches to voters, ""Osama Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The 16 Afghans killed in a shooting spree in early March were buried without autopsies, in accordance with the Islamic tradition of a quick burial. Any effort to do disinter the bodies and do an autopsy would probably be resisted by the Afghan villagers. But that could present one of many challenges military prosecutors will have in making a case against the alleged shooter, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales. Last week, after meeting with Afghan President Karzai, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the ""Afghanistan people would see that the United States is indeed going to not only prosecute this individual but ensure that he's held accountable."" But making good on the secretary's promise will not be easy. ""I think the chances that he will walk are not bad,"" said Gary Solis, who spent 20 years in the Marines as a judge advocate general and military prosecutor. He now teaches the laws of war at Georgetown University Law Center. Eugene Fidell is another former military prosecutor and the former president of the National Institute of Military Justice who currently teaches at Yale Law School. He's a little less pessimistic about the prosecution's chances in the case but he said ""of course, they're going to have their hands full."" The lack of autopsies on the victims of the massacre in Afghanistan's Kandahar province is just one of many hurdles that the prosecution in this case will face once the charges become official. To prove someone caused a person's death, prosecutors need a cause of death. As any fan of TV's ""Law and Order,"" or countless other cop shows knows, that usually means an autopsy by a forensic pathologist. But Afghanistan is a Muslim country and Islamic law dictates the dead be buried right away, usually within 24 hours. So no such post-mortem exams were possible. One Afghan minister tried to help U.S. investigators but Hajji Agha Lalai Desdageeri, a member of Parliament from Kandahar, told CNN that investigators ""should take some samples of the dead bodies but (many) people gathered around this place and said, 'No this is not acceptable.'"" This is not the first time U.S. prosecutors have tried a murder case without an autopsy. ""This is a big problem. Prosecutors have faced that problem in several of the cases growing out of incidents like this in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" said Neil Puckett who in his 20 years as a Marine, worked as defense counsel, prosecutor and a military trial judge. But even without autopsies, military prosecutors have been able to present evidence at previous trials establishing cause of death. ""How it's usually done is that (with) the cause of death, you have photographs hopefully of the bodies and of the wounds on each body. And although you don't have the body, you present evidence depicting the wounds and the dead body and you present these to a prosecution witness (and) a doctor, and the doctor testifies these wounds would unequivocally would result in death,"" Solis said. ""It's certainly not a preferred means, but that's how it's been done."" The next hurdle is getting witnesses to testify. ""The court-martial itself has subpoena power, to require people to come to court, but that subpoena power does not extend beyond our national basis,"" Puckett said. ""What we've seen in the past is that the U.S. government will make every effort to ask people and encourage them and provide them transportation to come to the United States to testify. More often than not, they decline that."" If potential witnesses decline, attorneys involved in the court martial turn to Plan B. ""The next best option is video teleconference testimony."" That would require a live closed-circuit TV feed be established between Afghanistan and a court room in the United States. Bale's defense attorney has indicated he intends to raise the issue of Bale's mental state during the trial. ""Anybody that has seen what he's seen and done what he's done at the request of the military -- and I'm not talking about these allegations -- I think would have PTSD,"" attorney John H. Browne, Bales' attorney, told reporters earlier this week. Solis said that could help Browne's client avoid prison time. ""Defense counsel may argue that there is diminished capacity, despite that fact. If the jury is sympathetic and accepts that there was a lack of capacity, it's conceivable that the jury would find him not guilty."" If Bales has mental problems, Solis said, it might lead to his being convicted on a less serious charge than being found not guilty across the board. ""If the chances are not bad that he will walk, I think the chances are extremely good that he will not be convicted of the maximum charges. I think that if any he'll be convicted of a lesser (charge)."" Between the difficulty with the evidence and the mental health issues, at least one of the attorneys suspects there might be a plea bargain before the case ever reaches trial. The hurdles ""may incentivize the government to negotiate a plea,"" Fidell said. But if all this sounds like defense attorneys have an easy job ahead, they have hurdles, too. ""The accused may have made incriminating statements, he may have made admissions when he was apprehended,"" Solis said. Defense Secretary Panetta told the media last week that Bales ""told individuals what happened."" ""That greatly narrows the options of the defense when your man admits he did the killing,"" Solis said. But Bales' attorney told reporters ""there's no confessions."" And there is the issue of video from Bales' base that CNN's Barbara Starr reports shows him leaving the camp before the shooting and coming back afterward. ""The film of him snooping through an orchard to avoid detection to get back into the case -- that, too, will militate against the defense case,"" Solis said.","Victims of the shooting in Afghanistan were buried without autopsies .
Islamic tradition calls for a quick burial .
That lack of pathology evidence is just one of the many hurdles prosecutors will face .
""I think the chances that he will walk are not bad,"" says one former military prosecutor ."
"(CNN) -- A bear ate the corpse of a convicted killer in a wooded area of Canada, according to authorities. The mauled body of Rory Nelson Wagner, 53, was found in a rural area in southern British Columbia on Wednesday evening, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Police believe Wagner was already dead in a 1986 Volkswagen Jetta when the black bear broke into the vehicle, ate some parts of him and dragged the rest of the body away. ""The driver's window of the vehicle was down and investigators noted numerous muddy animal prints and scratches on the car,"" police said. Officials ""discovered the body in the surrounding bush, about 120 meters from the vehicle,"" police said. Drug paraphernalia and a bottle of liquor was found in the car. A coroner is conducting an autopsy and toxicology tests. Wagner and two other people were charged with the 1993 killing of a man they thought had sexually assaulted a relative, CNN affiliate CTV reported. The man they killed was found not guilty of sexual assault charges, according to the affiliate. Wagner was convicted for the murder, but he had been on parole. Conservation officials say the bear was caught, but may be killed to ensure public safety.","The body of Rory Nelson Wagner was found in a rural area this week .

"Cairo (CNN) -- One person died and more than 300 were injured Friday when clashes broke out in Cairo as protests against the country's military government turned violent, state media reported. Video from the scene showed some protesters throwing rocks at security forces, and the security forces spraying water cannons at the demonstrators, who were protesting near the country's Defense Ministry. The protests erupted amid a backdrop of frustration about the pace of reform since Hosni Mubarak was ousted as president last year and over concern that Egypt's military leadership is delaying the transition to civilian rule. One person was killed and 373 were injured in the clashes in the Abbasiya area, said Ahmed Ansari, director of Cairo's emergency medical services. Egypt's ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said a curfew will be enforced in Abbasiya Square and streets leading to it from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. ""Those involved in (the) Abbasiya clashes and inciting them will be dealt with according to the law,"" the Supreme Council said. Egypt's state-run Nile TV showed at least two members of the military police suffering injuries and being carried away from the front line of the clashes. Thousands of people descended on downtown Cairo on Friday after several parties urged supporters to voice their outrage about deadly clashes this week and demand the resignation of Egypt's interim military government. At least 11 people were killed and scores injured Wednesday in violence in Abbasiya, where a sit-in protest has been going on for a week outside the Defense Ministry. As the latest clashes gathered steam, Nader Abdel Aziz, a human rights lawyer, reported seeing warning shots fired in the air by security forces, as well as military helicopters hovering over the scene. Some military officers have been injured by rocks thrown by protesters, he said. Alaa Al Iraqi, Supreme Council spokesman, said officials warned protesters that the Defense Ministry was ""a red line"" that shouldn't be crossed. ""They threw rocks first at the military police soldiers, insulted them and pushed through barbed wire,"" the spokesman said. The rock-throwing injured several soldiers. ""No live ammunition of any kind was used except for standard protocol for dealing with riots,"" he said. The Muslim Brotherhood's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, was among those taking part in another protest in Tahrir Square, the heart of Egypt's protest movement, under the banner of ""stopping the bloodshed."" At least three stages had been set up in the square, where a mostly Islamist crowd planned to demonstrate, according to Nile TV. Many are supporters of Islamist candidate Hazem Abu Ismael, who is among a number of candidates disqualified from the May 23 presidential election. Ahmed Maher, founder of the liberal April 6 movement, which was among those to join the protests in Abbasiya, said it was urging its supporters to pull back. ""We are withdrawing from Abbasiya to avoid and limit bloodshed. Some of our field medics will remain behind to assist only,"" he said. The April 6 movement wants accountability from the Supreme Council for the Armed Forces for the deaths of protesters in the Abbasiya clashes Wednesday. The Ministry of Health earlier dispatched 70 ambulances to the Abbasiya protests, dubbed the ""Final Friday"" march. And the Arab Doctors Association set up two makeshift clinics. The Al Nour Salafi party has boycotted the Abbasiya protest. The Supreme Council said on its Facebook page Thursday that the clashes in Abbasiya were aimed at delaying the presidential elections and stalling the formation of a constituent assembly. The Supreme Council also said that certain ""unnamed"" groups have used verses from the Quran calling for jihad, or holy war, to try to draw the military into an armed conflict. The military had tried to persuade the protesters to move from their position near the Ministry of Defense to Tahrir Square, but they refused, the Facebook statement said. Controversy about the approaching presidential elections has been growing. The Muslim Brotherhood's preferred candidate, Khairat El Shater, who was disqualified from running last month, was referred to the country's general prosecutor Friday for insulting the election commission. Abu Ismael was also referred to the general prosecutor for alleged forgery. He was disqualified from standing because of evidence that his late mother had U.S. citizenship, an assertion he has denied. On Thursday, three other presidential candidates also were referred for alleged violations of election campaign law. The three candidates -- leading independent Abdel Monein Aboul Fettouh; Mohamed Mursi of the Islamist Freedom and Justice Party; and Amre Moussa -- were accused of breaking the law by holding meetings on college campuses. ""These infringements by the presidential candidates will be taken very seriously, and they will be questioned as soon as possible. They could be fined,"" Adel Saeed, the official spokesman for the general prosecutor, told CNN on Thursday. The election commission has disqualified about 10 of the 23 presidential contenders, its chief has said. The disqualifications have prompted widespread anger. International powers urged all sides to exercise restraint after the clashes Wednesday. Assailants targeted the protesters in Cairo early Wednesday, medical sources said. At least 150 people were injured, Dr. Ahmed Thabet, a physician working in a field hospital near where the clashes took place, said Thursday. It was unclear who the attackers were, but they were not wearing uniforms, witnesses said. The Freedom and Justice Party blamed the Supreme Council for the deaths and injuries in the Abbasiya clashes, and it said that the council, not the protesters, wants to delay the transition of power. A government official denied reports that the military was involved in Wednesday's violence. Clashes have erupted in Egypt since an uprising led to the toppling of Mubarak in February of last year, with protesters demanding the military leaders who took over hand over power to a civilian administration. Journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and CNN's Amir Ahmed and Saad Abedine contributed to this report.","Death, injuries reported in the Abbasiya area, state media says .

"(CNN) -- More than two years after releasing its game-changing tablet computer, Apple now actually owns the name ""iPad."" A Chinese court says the company has paid $60 million to a Taiwanese firm for the rights, nailing down the name as its own in a country that is increasingly becoming a huge market for electronics. Shenzhen Proview Technology had trademarked the name ""iPad"" in 2001. Apple paid the company about $55,000 in 2009. But Chinese authorities refused to recognize the payment and ruled last year that Proview still owned the name in that country. ""The iPad dispute resolution is ended,"" the Guangdong High People's Court said in a statement acquired by the New York Times. ""Apple Inc. has transferred $60 million to the account of the Guangdong High Court as requested in the mediation letter."" Apple did not immediately return a message seeking comment Monday morning. China is already Apple's second-biggest market behind the United States. It only shows signs of growing as more of its roughly 1.3 billion people become more tech-savvy. A lawyer for Proview told the Times that the company hoped for more money but settled because it has debts to pay. He said it had wanted as much as $400 million, according to the Times. Proview had argued that Apple didn't negotiate in good faith, using a shell company that promised not to make competing products under the iPad label. The company alleges the negotiator concealed that he was working for Apple, gave a false name and said the company he represented was IP Application Development -- or IPAD, for short. The dispute certainly hasn't slowed demand for the tablet and other Apple products in China. When the iPad 2 was released last year, a skirmish broke out outside a Beijing Apple Store after a man believed to be a scalper was escorted away by security after trying to cut in line. And some Chinese entrepreneurs don't even worry so much about the Apple products they sell actually being Apple products. Last year, authorities discovered 22 fake Apple Stores in just one city and ordered them to either change their names or shut down. It was unclear at the time whether the gadgets they were selling were actually Apple's or fakes.","Apple finally acquires the name ""iPad"" in China .

"London (CNN) -- The chief executive of Barclays, one of the world's largest banks, resigned Tuesday in the wake of a scandal, the bank announced. Bob Diamond's resignation is effective immediately, the bank said. Diamond has long been a controversial figure, and has been a vocal backer of huge bonuses for bankers. ""It's about pay for performance,"" he told CNN earlier this year, calling bonuses ""rewards for success."" The bank announced the resignation of Chief Operating Officer Jerry del Missier hours after Diamond's. Chairman Marcus Agius resigned on Monday, but in the wake of Diamond's resignation, Agius returned as chief executive on Tuesday. Barclay's reputation has been hammered by a scandal involving the rates at which banks lend each other money, known as Libor. That rate affects how much interest ordinary people pay on everything from credit card debt to home mortgages and student loans. Former investment banker Ralph Silva says that is why the scandal has caused such fury. ""If they're manipulating Libor, what they're basically doing is taking money out of the public's pocket, because their mortgage rates change, because their interest rates change, their loans/credit cards change -- or their pension income changes,"" he said. Why LIBOR scandal will change banking culture . The chairman of the Financial Services Authority, Britain's banking regulator, last month blasted the ""cynical greed of traders asking their colleagues to falsify their Libor submissions so that they could make bigger profits."" FSA chairman Adair Turner said the scandal ""has caused a huge blow to the reputation of the banking industry"" and ""has justifiably shocked and angered people."" Diamond is due to to testify about the scandal before the British parliament's Treasury Committee Wednesday. The bank was fined more than $450 million last week by British and American regulators for rate-fixing during the height of the global financial crisis, and is one of a host of banks facing lawsuits in New York over the scandal. At least seven other banks are under investigation on suspicion of rate-fixing, leading to speculation that Diamond could be the first of many executives to resign. Financial regulators in London have not named the banks, but Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse and UBS have acknowledged that they are under investigation. Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have also confirmed that they are under investigation. Bank of America has refused to comment on reports that its is being probed. British Chancellor George Osborne welcomed Diamond's resignation, calling it the right decision for the bank and the country. ""We need our banks to be focused on lending to the economy, not on the scandals of the past, and I hope this will be the first step towards a new culture of responsibility in British banking which is what the British people want to see,"" said Osborne, effectively the country's finance minister. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Monday that a full parliamentary inquiry would be held into the Libor rate-fixing scandal and standards in the banking industry, with witnesses called to give evidence under oath. The resignation of the American-born Diamond comes a day after Barclays chairman Agius announced his own resignation over the lending-rate scandal. But Agius reversed his decision Tuesday and will lead the search for a new chief executive, Barclays said. He will stay on until a new chief executive is selected and then ""begin the process of stepping down,"" the bank said. Barclay's is the 15th largest bank in the world, according to an annual list of the world's top 1000 banks released by The Banker magazine on Monday. It is Britain's second most profitable bank, and the 18th most profitable in the world, the trade magazine said. Diamond's total compensation package for 2011 was worth Â£6.3 million ($7.92 million), including salary, bonuses and share options, the bank said. The annual bonus consisted of Â£2.7 million in shares and was deferred over three years, the bank said. In his resignation statement, Diamond said he always aimed ""to do what I believed to be in the best interests of Barclays."" Barclays chairman to resign . ""No decision over that period was as hard as the one that I make now to stand down as chief executive. The external pressure placed on Barclays has reached a level that risks damaging the franchise -- I cannot let that happen,"" Diamond said. ""I am deeply disappointed that the impression created by the events announced last week about what Barclays and its people stand for could not be further from the truth. I know that each and every one of the people at Barclays works hard every day to serve our customers and clients. That is how we support economic growth and the communities in which we live and work. ""I leave behind an extraordinarily talented management team that I know is well placed to help the business emerge from this difficult period as one of the leaders in the global banking industry."" ""Bob Diamond has made an enormous contribution to Barclays over the last 16 years of distinguished service to the Group, building Barclays Investment Bank into one of the leading global investment banks in the world,"" Agius said in the statement. The $450 million fine came after the bank admitted some of its trading desks purposely under-reported its interest rates as part of LIBOR (London interbank Offered Rate) -- an interest rate floor between big banks that is set in London each trading morning. Last week, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King attacked British banking culture, saying something had gone very wrong with an industry he derided for resorting to ""deceitful"" methods to make money. CNN's Paul Armstrong, Jim Boulden, Isa Soares, Nick Thompson and Maureen Farrell contributed to this report.","NEW: Another top Barclays executive resigns hours after CEO Bob Diamond .

"(CNN) -- Mario Balotelli's first-half double saw Italy through to the final of Euro 2012 as they stunned Germany in Warsaw. Germany were hot favorites going into this semifinal but Balotelli struck twice before halftime and Germany were unable to claw their way back. Mesut Ozil pulled a goal back from the penalty spot in injury time, but Italy deservedly held on to set up a final against Spain on Sunday. The win continues Italy's remarkable record in major tournaments against Germany, who have failed to beat the Italians in eight attempts. This emerging young German side were tipped by many to go all the way at this tournament, but their burgeoning progress was checked by a clinical Italy team. Germany started the match as expected and the Italians were lucky to survive a couple of early wobbles by their goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. The Italy captain was caught in no-man's land early on, allowing Mats Hummels to poke goalwards only to see Andrea Pirlo scramble the ball off the line. Minutes later, Buffon pushed out a Jerome Boateng cross and was relieved to see the loose ball bounce off his own defender, Andrea Barzagli, and behind for a corner. But midway through the first half it was Italy who made the breakthrough with a quite brilliantly worked goal. Germany stood off Pirlo, allowing the Italy playmaker to sweep a pass out to Giorgio Chiellini who fed Antonio Cassano. Cassano superbly spun away from two defenders and swept in an inviting cross that allowed Balotelli to drift away from Bastuber and head home from close range. Sixteen minutes later, the Italians remarkably doubled their lead with a sweeping counterattack following a Germany corner. Italy left two strikers forward and the tactic paid off as Riccardo Montolivo swept a long ball over the head of Philipp Lahm, allowing Balotelli to chest the ball down and run clear before smashing an unstoppable shot beyond a stunned Manuel Neuer. The first-half double saw the young Manchester City striker double his international goal tally -- having scored just once coming in to Euro 2012 Balotelli is now the tournament's joint leading goalscorer on three. Germany needed a response in the second half and they got it in effort, but not in goals. A smart one-two on the edge of the area between Lahm and Toni Kroos ended with Lahm sidefooting over when he should have hit the target. A goal then would have ensured a fascinating second half, but Italy looked just as likely to score again as Germany increasingly gambled at the back. Balotelli curled a shot across the face of goal before limping off with cramp and Claudio Marchisio twice drilled wide from inviting positions as Italy failed to kill off the German threat. Substitute Antonio Di Natale wasted another golden chance eight minutes from time when he ran clear but fired into the side netting, but at the other end Italy's defending was outstanding. That resilience was emphatically underlined by Federico Balzaretti's goalsaving tackle to keep out substitute Marco Reus late on, although Balzaretti's handball in stoppage time did give Ozil the chance to score from the spot. That came too late to save Germany though and Italy now face a Spain side who they held 1-1 in the group stages earlier in this tournament.","Mario Balotelli scores both goals as Italy beat Germany 2-1 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Brothers Thomas and Raymond Kwok, who control Hong Kong's biggest property development company, Sun Hung Kai, have been arrested for suspected corruption, authorities said Thursday. Also arrested for suspected corruption was a person described by Hong Kong's Department of Justice as ""a former principal official of the government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,"" a spokesman for the Independent Commission Against Corruption said. The Kwok brothers' fortune is $18.3 billion, according to Forbes Magazine, which rank the brothers and their family as the 27th richest in the world.

The company has since announced the shares will resume trading when Hong Kong's stock exchange opens Friday morning. The firm has set up a special committee to handle all matters arising from the investigation, and the company's board, whose six members include the two brothers, has resolved that the Kwoks will ""continue to undertake and discharge their duties to the group, including their duties as joint chairmen and managing directors of the company,"" according to a company statement.

"(CNN) -- The acquittal and mistrial in John Edwards' campaign finance fraud trial completes a fall from grace that transformed the man who might have been president into one of the most vilified and lampooned political figures in the country. Opinion: Edwards jury got it exactly right . The boyish-looking, smooth-talking lawyer and self-described ""son of a millworker"" was once known for rallying supporters with a populist mantra describing two Americas -- the haves and have-nots. Now he is best known for fathering a child in an extramarital affair while his wife Elizabeth battled incurable cancer and, according to prosecutors, scheming to use wealthy donors' money to help him cover up his affair and hide his mistress from the public. WTVD: Juror had no intention of flirting with Edwards . It was all so different five years ago, when Edwards could be heard preaching his populist prose to Iowa voters who eagerly packed into lumber barns, Veterans of Foreign Wars halls and restaurants across the state. He had every reason to believe he could be president. He felt the country would let Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both senators at the time with presidential ambitions of their own, destroy each other with negative campaigning. John Edwards: Once a cheater, always a cheater? And if the country wasn't ready to elect a black man or a woman president, he would rise as the more experienced and safe nominee. To many voters, Edwards was a fitting candidate to live in the White House and serve as president. Instead, Edwards appeared in front of TV cameras Thursday and took responsibility for ""my sins"" after his federal corruption case ended in an acquittal and mistrial. Prosecutors had accused Edwards of using almost $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps. But after more than 50 hours of deliberations, jurors cleared him of one of six counts and deadlocked on the rest. Why politicians lie . Edwards, who turns 59 on June 10, argued that while his actions were wrong, they were not illegal. Emerging from the courthouse with his parents and daughter at his side, he said that while he never believed he committed a crime, ""I did an awful, awful lot that was wrong, and there is no one else responsible for my sins."" Now a widower, he is the sole caregiver to his two youngest children by his late wife -- Emma Claire, 13, and Jack, 11. The couple also raised two older children. Their son, Wade, died at age 16 in a 1996 road accident. Daughter Cate Edwards Upham attended every day of her father's four-week trial, sitting behind Edwards and next to her grandparents. Edwards charges: The rundown . Edwards also provides financial support for his daughter with Rielle Hunter, his mistress from the campaign trail during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election. A product of a working class family from South Carolina, Edwards got a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1977. He became a successful trial lawyer representing claimants against large corporations and insurance companies. He won his first, and only major, political race in 1998, unseating a Republican incumbent to become a U.S. senator from North Carolina. As a senator, Edwards reportedly made it onto a list of potential running mates for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. He didn't make the ticket that time. But before his first term ended, he was running for president and ended up as Sen. John Kerry's running mate in 2004. Kerry lost to incumbent President George W. Bush. Once running mates, Kerry and Edwards quickly severed their friendship after what was a disappointing election for Edwards. He quickly set his sights on Iowa, gearing up for another presidential bid in 2008. Edwards met Hunter in early 2006 at a bar at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hunter approached Edwards, not believing it was him. Later that evening, Edwards and Hunter met again, privately. Overheard on CNN.com: 'Being a slimy dirtbag doesn't equal being a criminal' The man who constantly spoke about two Americas began living two lives. The 40-something Hunter told Edwards that she could help his campaign. Edwards hired her to produce a few videos that would present the politician in a more relaxed manner. The videos were called ""webisodes"" and were posted to Edwards' campaign site. However, instead of showing Edwards in a new light, the flirtatious on-camera banter only highlighted just how close Edwards and Hunter had become. Staffers began to suspect that Hunter had become more than a videographer to Edwards. That thought was fueled by Edwards' directive that Hunter be allowed to travel with him whenever either of them insisted. Josh Brumberger was Edwards' chief of staff during the time Hunter traveled with the campaign. On several occasions, he talked to Edwards about Hunter's involvement with the campaign. One heated altercation ended with Edwards firing Brumberger, and by the fall of 2006, several longtime senior aides left the campaign amid Edwards' refusal to end his relationship with Hunter, as detailed in ""Game Change,"" the book about the 2008 election. On December 28, 2006, Edwards launched his presidential campaign in New Orleans against the backdrop of a city trying to rebuild and revive itself. He vowed to strengthen the middle class, progressively end poverty and tackle the longstanding Democratic health care platform. But just as the campaign got off the ground, it hit turbulence. In March 2007, Elizabeth Edwards announced she had breast cancer for the second time, and it was incurable. Still, they decided to continue with the campaign. And in the weeks after the devastating discovery, internal campaign polling showed Edwards surging ahead of rivals Clinton and Obama in Iowa. Meanwhile, Hunter had become pregnant. And to complicate things, Edwards was swimming in a pool of bad press -- he had received $400 haircuts and had made a six-figure salary working for a hedge fund that was linked to subprime lending and foreclosed homes. Enter Rachel ""Bunny"" Mellon. The wealthy banking heiress and widow who was once a close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy had been a supporter of Edwards since the 2004 election. After already contributing to Edwards the maximum allowed by law, Mellon provided additional money. According to court documents, between June 2007 and January 2008, Mellon allegedly wrote personal checks payable to a friend, hiding that she was giving money to Edwards. The checks were made out to the wife of Edwards aide Andrew Young, in her maiden name, and were deposited into accounts controlled by her and Young. As Edwards and Young planned, Young allegedly used the money to provide Hunter with rent, furniture, care, living expenses, medical visits and prenatal care. In total, the now 101-year-old Mellon gave Edwards seven checks ranging from $10,000 to $200,000. On October 10, 2007, the National Enquirer ran its first story saying Edwards was having an affair. The next day while campaigning in Summerton, South Carolina, Edwards denied the report, calling it ""tabloid trash."" With tabloid reporters and photographers chasing Hunter and publishing photos of her pregnant, a second wealthy donor came forward. Fred Baron, a wealthy Texas lawyer who is now deceased, was the national finance chair of the campaign. Court documents show that from December 2007 to January 2008, Baron allegedly wrote nine checks ranging from $9,000 to $58,000. The money was used for Young to hide a pregnant Hunter from the media, as he falsely claimed paternity for her child. Baron's money was used to charter a private jet for trips to Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Aspen, Colorado; San Diego and Santa Barbara, California. Things weren't faring better for Edwards on the campaign trail. He placed second in the Iowa caucuses, and following disappointing losses in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he ended his campaign for president on January 30, 2008. Amid rumors in Democratic circles that he was secretly trying to broker a deal for vice president or attorney general in a Clinton or Obama administration, reporters remained persistent and continued to ask Edwards if he was having an affair. In February 2008, Hunter's and Edwards' child was born. Six months later, after repeated denials, Edwards admitted he had an affair with Hunter in an August 8 interview with ABC. When asked in the interview if he was the father of Hunter's child, he responded, ""That is absolutely not true."" While his name was not on the birth certificate, Edwards would eventually claim paternity and apologize for denying the baby was his child. In February 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged they had opened an investigation on Edwards regarding campaign finances. By this point, his more than 30-year marriage was falling apart. John and Elizabeth separated and lived apart until Elizabeth Edwards succumbed to breast cancer weeks before Christmas in 2010, with Edwards and their oldest daughter, Cate, at her bedside. For Edwards, life got worse. After testimony from a cast of former staffers, including Hunter and Young -- the latter having published a scandalous tell-all book -- a grand jury indicted Edwards on June 3, 2011. Edwards refused a plea bargain that would have given him a few months in prison but would have allowed him to keep his law license.","Once a Democratic star, John Edwards fell from grace after an affair .

"Hatay, Turkey (CNN) -- Two dolphins who were rescued from a filthy pool at a Turkish tourism resort were released back into the wild this week after years in captivity. So far, the male dolphins have exceeded their trainers' expectations: Within 48 hours, satellite transmitters showed that Tom and Misha had traveled more than 100 miles, and they were observed hunting fish as a team and interacting with other wild dolphins. ""It's unbelievable to see them travel this hard and fast,"" said Jeff Foster, a Seattle-based sea mammal expert who oversaw the dolphins' rehabilitation and preparation for release into the wild. ""The assumption is they're going back to the area that they were a pod in. They're definitely on a mission,"" Foster said. Foster spoke to CNN by telephone from a sailboat in the Aegean Sea, where he and his team have been tracking the animals' progress with the help of transmitters attached to the dolphins' dorsal fins. Because of bad weather, the team hasn't been able to keep direct contact with the dolphins since their release Wednesday, although they are still able to track them via satellite. Foster suspects the dolphins are racing back to the waters around the Turkish city of Izmir where they were initially believed to be captured years ago. Tom and Misha are part of an expensive, ambitious and risky program sponsored by the UK-based Born Free Foundation, which is aiming to prove that captive dolphins can be reintroduced to the wild. For more than a year, Foster and his team worked in a quiet cove on the Aegean, teaching the two dolphins how to catch their own food. He said the intensive training was necessary to get the dolphins ready to fend for themselves. ""It would be like taking your dog and releasing it into the woods,"" Foster said. ""If you don't prepare your dog for that, it would never happen."" When Foster first met these dolphins more than a year ago, he said they would eat only if humans placed dead fish directly in their mouths. ""We had literally thousands of fish in the pen, and they just wouldn't look at them,"" Foster said. ""They had just been so used to being hand-fed in a captive situation that they did not recognize fish as a food source."" Foster has prior experience with another high-profile release program that ultimately ended in failure. He worked in Iceland more than 10 years ago as part of a multimillion-dollar effort to prepare the killer whale Keiko from the movie ""Free Willy"" for release back into the wild. Less than a year after his release, Keiko died off the coast of Norway. But Foster said he believes Tom and Misha stand a much better chance of survival. ""These animals haven't been in captivity as long as Keiko. Keiko was held in captivity for more than 20 years. He was held as a solitary animal for many of those years,"" Foster said. Tom and Misha are each estimated to be around 12 years old, after initially being caught in the Aegean Sea five or six years ago. ""They've probably spent the majority of their life out in the wild,"" Foster said. ""Because we're dealing with two males, you can develop competition feeding with them ... they're ideal candidates for reintroduction back into the wild."" Tom and Misha first attracted the attention of wildlife conservation activists in 2010. At the time, they were being kept at a Turkish resort where tourists paid to swim with the dolphins in a shallow, filthy swimming pool. ""The pool in Hisaronu, Turkey, where Tom and Misha had spent the summer months of 2010 had such a high bacterial count ... that it was a significant health hazard to the dolphins and for the unsuspecting tourists who paid to swim with them,"" wrote Shirley Galligan, a representative of the Born Free Foundation, in an e-mail to CNN. ""The water was filthy with feces and dead fish and a layer of 'sludge' at the bottom."" According to Born Free, a nonprofit conservation group based in the United Kingdom, the dolphins were underweight and listless and would not have survived much longer in the pool, which ""having been hastily constructed, was in danger of collapse from subsidence."" A coalition of environmental groups successfully campaigned to rescue the animals and transport them in the back of a truck to a sea pen in the Aegean. In the final days before their release, Foster and his team attached specially designed transmitters to Tom and Misha. The tags, which are about the size of a cell phone, broadcast the dolphins' location via satellite and VHF radio. The sponsors of the program admit there is no guarantee of success. ""There have only been a handful of reintroduction programmes with mixed results,"" Galligan wrote. ""Returning any captive wild animal to the wild is never without risk."" One of the few successful cetacean reintroductions on record involved an orphaned female orca named Springer. Foster was a member of the team that helped rehabilitate the emaciated animal and eventually reintroduce her to a pod of related killer whales off of Canada's Pacific Coast a decade ago. She has reportedly survived and thrived in those waters ever since. Michael Moore, a marine mammal expert at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, predicted major challenges for Tom and Misha. ""Can they break the bond with humans, and can they create a bond with other [wild] dolphins?"" he asked, in a phone interview with CNN. ""The irony is that if these animals do get released into the wild, it's a big, bad world out there and they will have to learn how not to get entangled in fishing gear."" According to Moore, Tom and Misha's release will have virtually no impact on the world's wild dolphin population, which faces an onslaught from industrial fishing nets, decimated fish stocks and polluted seas. But he and other dolphin experts say successful reintroduction could increase biodiversity awareness in Turkey and set an important example for the multibillion-dollar captive marine mammal entertainment industry. There has been a rapid increase in the number of ""dolphinariums"" and ""swim-with-dolphin"" programs cropping up across Turkey over the last decade. ""Turkey, being a very popular and beautiful holiday destination, is sadly responding to the public demand for that 'dolphin experience' by providing more captive dolphin facilities than anywhere else in Europe,"" wrote Born Free's Galligan. ""Conditions in general are very poor."" Born Free did not publicly announce the day of Tom and Misha's release in order to protect them from curious onlookers. On Wednesday, after divers peeled away the last barrier separating the dolphins from freedom, the pair initially hesitated. ""They sat in the pen for 15 to 20 minutes after we opened the gate. These guys are cautious animals,"" Foster said. Eventually, trainers gave them a hand cue to leave. Underwater video filmed by scuba divers shows Tom slowly turning and leaving the sea pen. Misha then sped off after him. Within hours, the Born Free team photographed Misha flipping large local fish called mullet out of the water. And then, they witnessed strange behavior from a dolphin rolling on the surface. It took some time to identify the animal by its dorsal fin. ""It was totally completely different dolphin!"" Foster said. ""A single dolphin that was interacting with Misha. Within the first four or five hours after we let them out, they were pursuing fish and interacting with wild dolphins. It was everything and more than we expected."" Despite initial encouraging behavior, Born Free is not yet celebrating. ""We must remain cautious,"" the organization announced on its website. ""There is still a way to go before we know 100 per cent that Tom and Misha have readapted fully to life back in the wild.""","Two dolphins were returned to the wild, after 5 to 6 years in captivity .

"(CNN) -- A centuries-old copy of a 500-year-old map that christened the New World as ""America"" has been discovered at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich -- folded and wedged inside of an old book, according to a release on the university's website. The original map, created in 1507 by cartographer Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller, according to the release, shows the continent of America isolated from Europe by a vast ocean and as a much smaller, banana-shaped landmass than what is mapped today. The ancient map was based on a variety of research expeditions, with Amerigo Vespucci's voyages at the beginning of the 16th century featuring heavily, according to the U.S. Library of Congress.

The map itself is made up of globe segments, each containing different parts of the world that when cut out and folded together create a small globe.

"(EW.com) -- Oprah Winfrey took to Twitter last night to ask Nielsen viewers to watch her cable network OWN, drawing criticism from some followers and investigative scrutiny from the ratings measurement company. ""Every 1 who can please turn to OWN especially if u have a Nielsen box,"" she tweeted Sunday evening at the start ""Oprah's Next Chapter"" and the mega-rated Grammy telecast. She later added, ""Commercial Grammy people..u can turn to OWN."" That tweets caused a backlash on the social networking site, with readers accusing her of ""begging for viewers"" and being ""desperate."" Oprah followed up with a flurry of defensive replies that were apparently in response to reader criticism: ""The word 'please' is used as courtesy not a beg ... 'desperate' not ever a part of my vocab ... 'unethical' a little harsh don't u think? Seemed like it made sense to me. Sorry if u're offended."" The original tweet has since been deleted. As Deadline noted, networks are not allowed to specifically target Nielsen subscribers. It's policy prohibits ""attempts to single out panel members ... to change their viewing habits."" ""In accordance with our policies and procedures, Nielsen is reviewing this incident with our clients and we may withhold, breakout and/or make a note in the ratings,"" a Nielsen rep told EW.com. ""We take any violation of our policy seriously and will work with clients to resolve the situation."" Of course, given that 39.9 million people watched the Grammys last night, with CBS crushing rivals, a more effective punishment might be releasing OWN's ratings instead of holding them back.

"(CNN) -- Hours after being released from jail, a man walked through an emergency door at San Diego International Airport, onto the tarmac and sat down on a United Express plane Tuesday, according to San Diego authorities. ""He completely bypassed TSA screening,"" San Diego Harbor Police Chief John Bolduc said. ""He was in a public area and went out an emergency fire door, which gave him access to the tarmac."" Marc Duncan, 38, was paroled from jail Monday night, according to San Diego County Sheriff's Department records. He had been serving time for theft. After it was opened, the emergency door alarm sounded, and Bolduc said police were on site in four minutes, but by then Duncan had blended in with other passengers. He allegedly boarded a 30-seat United Express aircraft operated by SkyWest, which was heading to Los Angeles, according to airline spokesman Wes Horrocks. The flight attendant realized she had too many passengers, Nicholas Blasgen, a passenger on the plane told CNN affiliate KGTV. ""They said, 'What is your count?' She said this is my count, and they said that is wrong."" The passengers got off the plane and their luggage was searched. ""They had us put all the bags out, they separated the bags by enough distance and had the dog go over everything,"" Blasgen said. Duncan was identified and arrested. He is being held in the San Diego jail and is scheduled to be in court Thursday. ""I still can't, in the world, understand how this happened,"" Blasgen said. ""It sounds like they just have lax security or not enough management. Something was going wrong."" The Harbor Police chief said they will examine this incident and find out where to make security improvements. ""The guy did breach security, but he was caught,"" Bolduc said. ""We have multiple layers of security built into our airports, as you know, and the backup systems were able to catch this guy.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Mitt Romney worshiped his father. Barack Obama barely knew his. In the nature-versus-nurture debate, psychologists say fathers play an important role in the men their sons become. And the two presidential candidates' relationships with their fathers offer insight into the men they are today. ""It's called the cloth of individuality,"" said Dr. Ditta M. Oliker, a clinical psychologist whose research has focused on the lasting effects of childhood in adulthood. Rather than an either/or, she said, psychologists now recognize the cloth that results from the interweaving of a person's DNA and experience dictates both personality and character. In President Obama's and Romney's cases, fathers -- present or absent -- are a large part of that cloth. And in both cases, psychologists say their fathers' presented different obstacles and opportunities. Obama was raised largely by his maternal grandparents and spent much of his childhood and adulthood decoding stories he heard about Barack Obama Sr.'s life. He writes in his book ""Dreams of My Father"" about piecing together newspaper clippings, photographs and his family's stories in building a portrait of his father. ""My father became a prop in someone else's narrative,"" Obama wrote, ""An attractive prop -- the alien figure with the heart of gold, the mysterious stranger who saves the town and wins the girl -- but a prop nonetheless."" But depending on a child's support system, Oliker doesn't think an absent father is necessarily an obstacle. It leaves room for ""imagination, wishful thinking and dreams,"" she says. ""Depending on how the family talked about it will make a difference in how the person emerges from the myth of the father."" Romney, on the other hand, followed closely in his father's footsteps. Both were successful businessmen, then governors and finally presidential candidates (although George Romney ended his run before the first Republican primary in 1968). ""My dad is Mitt's hero,"" G. Scott Romney, Mitt's older brother, told New York Magazine. ""And, look, I think my brother's an exceptional person. But Mitt has said he's a shadow of his father."" Romneys share looks but not traits, colleagues say . It could have been difficult for Romney to come out of his father's shadow. ""I would raise the question whether Romney doesn't struggle a bit with meeting the high expectations that were put on him because... you are your father's son,"" Oliker said. She says studies of sons of successful men show that their children often falter because they cannot live up to the aura. Both doctors say how the candidates' developed out of their relationships with their fathers can say a lot about the way they approach their candidacies, and in Obama's case, his time in office. ""You see a path in [Romney's] maturing over the years, in what some people might call 'flip-flopping' could be explained as a maturing path into finding his own stance,"" Dr. Henry Cloud, a clinical psychologist and author of ""The One Life Solution: Reclaim Your Personal Life While Achieving Greater Professional Success,"" explained of Romney. ""Sometimes it takes a boy with that kind of power figure over him time to declare [who he is]."" Cloud added that Romney lately seems to be more comfortable in his skin, perhaps a sign that he is assuming the alpha position once occupied by his father. Obama's father's absence, on the other hand, could be credited in part for his sky's-the-limit style that helped him win the 2008 election. ""He didn't grow up with the father over him, which is where the boy gets the sense of limits,"" Cloud said referring to the president as a visionary. ""He doesn't govern [the executive branch] in thinking what they can't do, but rather what they can do."" Romney, Obama: Why they have trouble connecting . But for both candidates, Oliker says, much of the credit for who the men are today rests on their own shoulders. ""Both men had to have strong character and had to have strong drive to reach what they have reached, in both cases perhaps in spite of their fathers,"" she said. For Romney, Cloud says it would be possible for a strong father figure to push his child down a lesser path. Instead, he says warmth present in the Romney home could have curbed negative impacts of his powerful father. For Obama, too, it was also the sum of the people around him that may have made up for his absent father. ""It takes a village,"" Oliker said. Regardless of their circumstances, both doctors agree that the mixture of the two men's personalities and the circumstances that helped them develop into adulthood were the right fit. ""There were obviously things that went well with both of them. Both the hero father and the absent father, the message in this is that somebody did something right,"" Cloud said.","Obama's, Romney's relationships with their fathers shaped the men they became .
Obama relied on photos, clippings and family stories to learn more about his father .
""My dad is Mitt's hero,"" G. Scott Romney, Mitt's older brother, said .

"(CNN) -- I feel like a short-order cook flipping a pancake, looking at it in the air from side to side, to see how well done it is, to see if it is ready. There are plusses and minuses to every statement made by a celebrity. I am a great fan of Anderson Cooper, especially of his hair, but I still want to be honest about what I think of the message he recently sent to Andrew Sullivan, on whose blog he came out on Monday. It's a pancake with two sides, and it's still up in the air. On one side, Anderson Cooper joins a long troupe of people like Ellen DeGeneres, Elton John, Liberace and on back down the line, for which the Great Announcement has got to be seen as made, perhaps, for the sea whelks and the Easter Island statues who don't get CNN at home and don't notice sexuality and its cues. I mean, there may yet be a population of creatures on the planet surprised that Anderson Cooper is gay, but I suspect they eat plankton. My Take: Will there be gays in heaven? On the other side, honesty still takes courage, and one of the things that a bright cunning professional with good hair does when he or she comes out is to encourage other gay or lesbian people with good hair to let it down, too. What I like better than Cooper's admission, or the good reasons he summarizes for making such an admission, is his insistence that even under these circumstances he has a right to a private life, and he intends to invoke those rights. I have generally resisted being identified as a gay spokesperson, even though I am gay and I do speak. And have political opinions, and I use them in my writing. (I haven't got the hair to be a gay spokesperson, though.) Less facetiously, the truth is that I could not stomach being a professional gay spokesperson because I have never been a professional homosexual. I am only a professional writer, and as such -- just as Cooper attests, too, about himself -- my sexuality is a real but a limited part of my character. It is something that has helped define me as an artist in that it taught me how to stand on the margins and scrutinize the center. News: Anderson Cooper says he's gay, happy and proud . Incidentally, so, too, has being a Roman Catholic in this dark season of Catholic instability, hysteria and political game-playing. So, too, has being married to a man with whom I have adopted three brown-skinned kids. So, too, is believing that the physicality of books matters. Also, believing in not being a one-issue voter. All these aspects of my self marginalize me, but they don't make me a Catholic writer, a gay writer, a blended-family writer, a nut-job. They make me a better writer, because they round me out. They fill me with contradictory and complicating sympathies. They make me work harder at being myself. So, the pancake is still in the air. Will Anderson Cooper be a better professional journalist for having been honest in this aspect of his life? I don't know that anyone can be sure of this, him least of all. Celebs, readers proud of Anderson Cooper . But that is why, in the end, the pancake flips onto a plate ready for serving in a pool of warm maple syrup, and it looks just right. He is willing to take the chance that he might be marginalized for this. He thinks it is important enough to risk being belittled, even by an admirer, like me. Maybe Anderson Cooper holds close to his heart a maxim that I do. It's by Emerson, one of my own local heroes. He wrote ""Character is centrality, the impossibility of being displaced or overset."" When I was about 17, I stitched those words into some invisible vest pocket of my psychic armor and said to myself: ""You don't have to tell all the truth. You just have to be sure not to lie. Do not do anything that will cause you to be displaced or overset. Be central upon the limited, unorthodox, marginalized square upon which, through no doing of your own, you find that you stand."" News: Chely Wright: What happened after I came out . Here's your pancake. And look. It has a face in it! A holy miracle. It isn't the face of Anderson Cooper and it isn't even the face of Jesus (who also has great hair). It's Ralph Waldo Emerson. Eat your pancake. It's good for you. Thank you, Anderson. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Gregory Maguire.","Gregory Maguire: Most people knew Anderson Cooper was gay; he came out Monday .
He likes that Cooper insists that he still deserves privacy .
He says like Cooper, he knows that being gay is one part of the many qualities that define him .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Department of Education granted eight additional states waivers Tuesday from strict requirements of the No Child Left Behind law. The White House announced a deal last year that allows states relief from provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or No Child Left Behind (NCLB), if certain standards are met. The federal flexibility will be allowed ""in exchange for state-developed plans to prepare all students for college and career, focus aid on the neediest students, and support effective teaching and leadership, "" according to the U.S. Department of Education. With the addition of eight news states, the Obama administration has approved 19 states so far, while 17 states and the District of Columbia are under review. U.S. Department of Education Secretary Arne Duncan announced the latest waivers for Connecticut, Delaware, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Rhode Island at an event in Hartford, Connecticut. ""These eight additional states are getting more flexibility with federal funds and relief from NCLB's one-size-fits-all federal mandates in order to develop locally-tailored solutions to meet their unique educational challenges,"" Duncan said. ""States must show they are protecting children in order to get flexibility. These states met that bar."" The first round of waivers was announced in late February. Republicans have been critical of Duncan and the waiver program. ""I don't believe that the language of the law allows the secretary to provide conditional waivers,"" said Rep. John Kline, R-Minnesota, chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce at a hearing in late March. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney praised the progress of the No Child Left Behind Law in his education plan laid out last week in Washington, but criticized Democrats for stalling the issue . ""As a result of NCLB, standards, assessments and data systems are light-years ahead of where they were a decade ago,"" according to Romney. ""The Obama administration's refusal to work with Congress to address these challenges represents a clear failure of leadership."" The U.S. Department of Education has given states a September 6 deadline to apply for the next round of waiver requests.","The addition of 8 new states brings to 19 the number of states with waivers .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)  -- Kuol Dut was six when the swirling chaos of war churned through his village. He recalls playing in a field as neighbors raced toward him, screaming about militias attacking their homes. Even a boy of Kuol's age knew that militias and soldiers slaughtered men, women and children in the vast, flat expanse of southern Sudan. So he ran, too. That attack separated Kuol from his mother and father and cast him into a childhood of desolation. He would see friends starve to death, skin stretched taut over ribs, chests rising and falling with rattling wisps of breath. Later, a rebel army would train him to fight as a child soldier, Kuol says. Despite the horrors that he endured, Kuol's journey eventually gave him a reverence for education and a deep Christian faith. It also led him to the hustle and bustle of the United States, a place with gleaming office towers, cable television and all-you-can-eat buffets. There Kuol would pursue his dream of becoming a Catholic priest. He would also learn that his mother was alive after all -- and they would reunite 16 years after last seeing each other. Behind the scenes blog: 'Lost boy' reminds writer of powerful lesson . The last time Kuol had seen his mother and other relatives was in 1988, when he and his neighbors left their smoldering village. ""If they are dead,"" he recalls praying, ""just take their souls and put them to your right hand."" Kuol joined an exodus of southern Sudanese, victims of a war that pitted a northern government of Arab Muslims against black southerners who follow Christianity or traditional religions. The war also involved fighting between rival southern factions. It would kill more than 2 million people and displace 5 million others from 1983 to 2005, when a peace treaty silenced the guns as a separate conflict raged in the Darfur region of western Sudan. When Kuol fled, many others were also leaving their homes around southern Sudan. Some were escaping attacks. Others were recruited as child soldiers, according to Human Rights Watch. Kuol said rebels escorted him as he trudged across dangerous terrain for roughly 450 miles -- about the distance from the city of New York to Cleveland, Ohio. ""In those days, I saw many dead people for the first time in my life,"" Kuol wrote in 2001, before he had perfected his English. ""Some wild animals which were friends to us before and ever, such as hyena, leopard, cat, fox, rat and etc. became the good eaters of flesh."" Kuol says he and the others had so little food and water that he drank his own urine and ate soft mud to survive. ""People were dying while I was watching them. There was nothing I could do. I didn't have food. I didn't have water,"" Kuol says. ""When I look back, my question always is 'How did I make it? Who was taking care of me? I realize now that God was taking care of me."" As refugees streamed from Sudan into Ethiopia, aid workers noticed thousands of boys, many near death, traveling without parents. News accounts from the time describe ""dying young boys"" and ""walking skeletons."" The United Nations counted 17,000 ""unaccompanied minors"" -- mostly boys -- among 250,000 refugees in three Ethiopian camps in 1990. Aid workers and journalists dubbed them the ""lost boys of Sudan"" after the characters in ""Peter Pan,"" who were cast as children into the world of adults. During Kuol's time in Ethiopia, he says, he asked the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army to give him military training so he could defend himself if he returned to Sudan. In 1991, when 10-year-old Kuol and others were forced from Ethiopia back into Sudan, he says, the rebels gave him an AK-47 during a year he spent fighting. ""My gun was so heavy, but I managed to carry it,"" he says. In 1992, after fighting and wandering and getting shot in the leg, Kuol joined an exodus of southerners fleeing across the border into Kenya. He and several thousand other ""lost boys"" wound up at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. Kuol lived at the camp for the next nine years, going to school, playing soccer and singing in a choir at the Holy Cross Parish. An Italian priest named Father Joseph gave him a purple, plastic rosary that Kuol says he wore around his neck nearly every day for the next several years. Then the United States, acting on humanitarian grounds, decided to resettle about 3,800 ""lost boys."" Most of the young men had never held an ice cube, written a check or seen tall buildings, but they would get just a few months' assistance before they had to find jobs and support themselves. Kuol's new life started at 3:51 p.m. on July 18, 2001, when United Airlines flight 1905 landed in Atlanta, Georgia. A caseworker for the nonprofit International Rescue Committee drove him to a hotel room, where Kuol turned on a TV tuned to CNN. ""Well, senator,"" a voice was suddenly saying, ""if you believe that life begins at conception, how can you then favor embryonic stem cells?"" Kuol found work at a college cafeteria but soon followed rumors of a better job to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He arrived, saw snow for the first time and got a phone call that started to unravel the mystery of what had happened to his family. The caller said he was Kuol's long-lost brother. He had come to the Kenyan refugee camp just after Kuol left and met people who said he looked like Kuol. What's more, the two were from the same village in Sudan and had the same number of siblings. ""Can you tell me my nickname?"" Kuol said, suspicious. The man said people once referred to Kuol as Alek. He was right. ""Can you name your sisters?"" Kuol asked. The caller named them from eldest to youngest. ""I felt like crying,"" Kuol said, ""but I adjusted myself not to cry."" Convinced it was his brother, Kuol asked about their parents. His brother passed along a tip that they might be in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. So Kuol says he sent a friend $100 to go there and ask around. The goal was to find southerners from Kuol's village and ask if anyone knew what became of his mother. On July 12, 2002, the friend called with news: Kuol's mother was alive. Soon Kuol dialed a phone number and the woman who answered asked who was calling at five in the morning. ""Your son,"" Kuol said. After the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote about Kuol re-connecting with his mother, a woman in suburban Atlanta who did not even know the young man paid for him to fly to Africa to reunite with the mother he had not seen in 16 years. ""She came running and gave me a hug,"" Kuol recalled. ""It was my first time to see my mother and be happy again."" After talking with his mother, Kuol changed his name from Daniel Khoch to Kuol Dut to honor his father and drop the ""Daniel"" he had adopted in a refugee camp. He became a U.S. citizen in 2007 and spent three months the next year back in southern Sudan, in that same village of thatch huts that a militia torched so many years earlier. Kuol learned that a brother and three sisters survived the war and now have 18 children between them. His father and two sisters, though, had died. As for Kuol, he pursued his dream of becoming a Catholic priest by attending Divine Word College, a Catholic school in Epworth, Iowa. He later transferred to the University of Saint Thomas, a Catholic college in St. Paul, Minnesota, graduating this May with a degree in theology and philosophy. Now 27, Kuol says he may try to earn a divinity degree and become a priest. Or he may seek work as a youth minister or teacher. He'd like to spend a year or two figuring out his future. What he needs more than anything right now, he says, is a job. He's worked in food service, at a meat-processing plant, Baptist Church and warehouse. Kuol has confidence. ""The suffering I went through gave me courage and taught me to be patient. Even if I find myself in a bad situation here, I can sit back and remember,"" Kuol says. ""Now I have my apartment. I have food. I have water. I have my clothes."" He knows he'll find a job. He will survive. Mark Bixler told the story of Kuol Dut and other young men from southern Sudan as the author of ""The Lost Boys of Sudan: An American Story of the Refugee Experience."" He is a supervising editor at the CNN Wire.","Six-year-old Kuol Dut was forced from his family and home by war .

"(CNN) -- Canadian police say they're looking for possible connections between the discovery of severed body parts in two cities, including what appears to be a human foot mailed to the headquarters of the ruling Conservative Party. The grisly find in an office tower in Ottawa on Tuesday came the same day that a janitor found human remains -- but not a full human body -- behind an apartment building in Montreal, about 200 km (160 miles) away. Police also confirmed late Tuesday the discovery of a second human body part in Ottawa. No other details were immediately available. ""It would be foolish for us to disregard what is going on in Montreal,"" Constable Marc Soucy, an Ottawa police spokesman, told CNN. But both Soucy and Constable Daniel Fortier, his counterpart in Montreal, said there was no known connection between the incidents Tuesday night. ""'It's too soon to make any links between those two events,"" Fortier said. Soucy said a hazardous materials team was sent to the office tower that houses the Conservative offices in Ottawa shortly after 11 a.m. after workers reported a suspicious package. The officers who responded noticed what appeared to be bloodstains on the box, he said. Ottawa police Sgt. Steve Hodgson told reporters outside the office that the package had been addressed to the Conservative Party. Staffers had begun to open the package before calling police, he said. The party, led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper, had no comment on the incident Tuesday evening. Police are still calling the foot ""possibly"" human as they await tests from medical examiners, Soucy said. He would not discuss the condition of the appendage, whether any note accompanied the package or where it had been postmarked. Ottawa's major-crimes unit is checking with other police departments for similar cases and looking back through missing-persons files for any clues, Soucy said. ""We're going to look at every avenue,"" he said. In Montreal, Fortier said investigators have no reports of missing people who might fit the description of the remains found Tuesday. He said a janitor made the discovery while looking into a report of ""smelly garbage"" Tuesday morning, and police don't know how long the remains might have been there. CNN's Jake Carpenter, Paula Newton and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Police say it's too soon to link grisly discoveries in Montreal and Ottawa .

"Bamako, Mali (CNN) -- U.S. aid to Mali could ""very seriously be affected,"" a U.S. State Department spokeswoman said Friday, a day after renegade soldiers staged a coup in the young African democracy. The United States gives Mali's government roughly $140 million in aid each year. ""A little more than half of that is humanitarian aid -- food, etc. -- that would not be affected. But if the situation is not resolved democratically, the remaining portion of that aid could very seriously be affected,"" Victoria Nuland told reporters in Washington. ""Any U.S. assistance to the government of Mali, beyond what we give for humanitarian purposes, is at risk if we cannot get back to a democratic situation in the country,"" she said. Nuland spoke the same day the African Union suspended Mali's membership. At a meeting in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the African Union implemented the punitive measures until constitutional order is restored in Mali. Paul Zolo, Nigeria's ambassador, said the African Union would hold accountable all those involved in the breakdown of security in Mali. Chairman Jean Ping said the council would consider sanctions similar to those imposed in Ivory Coast during its recent political turmoil. In the Malian capital, Bamako, shops and offices remained shut a day after the military ousted President Amadou Toumani Toure. The new military junta suspended the constitution and closed the nation's borders. Toure's whereabouts remain unknown. The military has only said that ""he is safe."" Ping said Toure was in still in Mali and was apparently ""protected by his royal guard."" Nuland said the same. Amnesty International reported at least three deaths in Thursday's coup. Amnesty's director in Mali, Saloum Traore, said the casualties were discovered in the Gabriel Toure hospital; 28 others were injured. Amnesty staff members have not been able to access the other major hospital in Bamako. News of the military takeover garnered immediate worldwide condemnation. The west African nation of about 15 million people was considered a shining example of democracy. Amadou Konare, the spokesman for the renegade soldiers who seized control, accused the government of mishandling an insurgency by Tuareg nomads, who have long called for the creation of an independent state and have risen up against the Malian government a number of times since the 1960s. The indigenous tribe are spread across Mali, Libya, Algeria, Niger and Burkina Faso. The latest uprising began to take root late last year but gained momentum in January, when the rebels began attacking towns in northern Mali. It has been further energized by an influx of fighters who had been fighting on behalf of former Libyan ruler Moammar Gadhafi. The Tuareg took advantage of the chaos in the capital and pushed south to occupy the town of Anefis, previously held by the Malian soldiers, according to an online statement from the Azawad National Liberation Movement. They announced on Radio France International that they would go after other cities, including Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu, that they said were rightfully theirs. The statement said the coup would not affect the Tuareg quest for a separate homeland. Amadou Aya Sanogo, Mali's new military leader, said Friday that he would reach out to the rebels for peace talks. The junta declared a nationwide curfew but called on people to return to work Tuesday. It also said Mali will hold elections for a new president, though no date was announced. Konare said Mali security forces have formed the National Committee for the Restoration of Democracy and State to work as a transitional government. A 1991 military coup led by Toure ended a dictatorship in the landlocked West African nation. Toure became president in 2002, was re-elected in 2007 and was scheduled to step down in April, when elections were set to pick his successor. Jennifer G. Cooke, Africa director of the think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the Mali coup, if ultimately successful, would be a major setback to the nation's political development. ""With the region, the international community and very likely the vast majority of Malians in stark opposition, there is no good outcome here, and things are likely to end very badly for the mutineers,"" Cooke wrote on the center's website. The growing Tuareg insurgency has raised concerns in Washington, which sees Mali as an important ally against al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the sub-Saharan offshoot of the terrorist group. The ongoing violence between these rebels and security forces has compelled tens of thousands of Malians to flee into neighboring countries and created turmoil in Toure's administration. Conflict in the region has forced the United Nations to appeal for $35.6 million to address the growing humanitarian crisis as throngs of Malians flee into neighboring countries.

"(CNN) -- Jeanne Campbell, who has broken bones in her legs, was sitting in her Lewisburg, West Virginia, home when a massive storm barreled through late last week and a tree came crashing through her roof. ""I just heard the thump on the house and saw the bricks flying, and I was afraid it was gonna come on down through the ceiling,"" she told CNN on Wednesday. She managed to get up and move to the center of the house. ""Amazing what you can do when you have to,"" she said. The tree's impact left a large, visible crack through her ceiling. Now, days later, Campbell sits on her porch in a wheelchair, surviving record heat with no power and a quickly dwindling supply of food. Her husband managed to get some staples such as bread. ""There was no lunch meat or anything that we found in the stores, but there is always peanut butter,"" she told CNN with a smile. ""We're tough, we'll make it. West Virginians -- we can make it."" The lack of power and limited food supply have put her in the same boat as millions of others this week. Triple digit strategies for staying healthy . As of Wednesday night, 699,000 customers scattered across 11 states had no electricity, down from about 1.8 million late Monday -- and from a peak of 4 million over the weekend. A household is considered one customer, so the actual number of people without power is higher. Pepco power company, which serves the D.C. metro area, said it expected to restore power by the end of Wednesday to 90% of its customers who lost electricity. West Virginia Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said about 300,000 customers were without power Wednesday morning. That number appeared to have dropped to 238,000 by evening. Parts of his state as well as South Dakota, Iowa and Nebraska were under heat advisory warnings. Excessive heat warnings were in place for portions of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. The National Weather Service said those areas would be scorched with temperatures near or above triple digits. As Americans celebrated Independence Day, many in the affected regions are focused on finding ways to get by until power can finally be restored. Eddie Harmon and his family in South Charleston, West Virginia, have spent nights sleeping in a car just to avoid the oppressive heat inside their home. One of his daughters has gone to stay with her grandmother, who has a generator. He walked to visit some neighbors to make sure they're OK, he said in an iReport. Getting around is tough because many gas stations have run out of supplies. People are running out of cash as well and the ATMs have run out, he said. Ironically, a previous power outage paid off, he said. His deep-freeze freezer had 3 inches of solid ice at the bottom because of a power outage two winters ago -- and that helped keep some chicken cold enough to be safe for cooking. ""I actually had cold Corn Flakes last night before I went to bed because I had milk that was still good,"" he said in a YouTube video Tuesday. Tomblin said Wednesday that while food is in short supply, ""we've made a lot of progress"" since the storm. Gadgets to help you survive a power outage . The Democrat praised federal officials for their assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency ""has responded fantastically,"" providing generators and ice within hours of the state's request, he said. Jeanne Campbell was among those who got power back and then lost it again -- meaning more wasted money and more wasted food. And with the large tree that shaded her house now down, she can't spend much time indoors. ""With a tin roof, it's gonna get even hotter now,"" she said. But, she added with a smile, she can deal with the inconveniences. ""I'm not worried."" David McMann, in Charleston, West Virginia, has paid a price for the storm and lack of power at his home. He raises koi fish and lost three as a result. ""It was hard to watch them die, and stand by knowing I had done all I could do."" One of the fish ""was 15 years old and had become almost a friend, if that is possible,"" he said in an iReport. ""This has been an expensive storm for us in more ways than one. This was to have been our vacation. Our traveling has been put off, for we do not have any idea when the power will be restored. I am 63 years old and have been through hurricanes in Virginia and Florida. I have never experienced the wrath of nature any stronger than what blew through these mountains on Friday evening."" While some of the most harrowing tales come from West Virginia, people throughout much of the Northeast have been struggling as well. Mark Cohen sent iReport a video of his destroyed yard and neighborhood in Mays Landing, New Jersey, showing downed trees, smashed cars and damage to his home. ""We would have been better off with a tornado,"" he said. Cohen, his daughter and his girlfriend have been sleeping in the basement to stay cool. Despite damage to his home, Cohen is looking at the bigger picture. ""When you see this around you -- I'm not an emotional guy -- you quickly think, 'Wow this is nothing. It could have been so much worse,' "" he said. ""You think about the people around the country losing their houses and you can't complain. It's inconvenient, but big picture, we're fine."" The heat-driven storm that started Friday has resulted in at least 22 deaths from Ohio to New Jersey, 13 of them in Virginia. Another three people in North Carolina died in a second round of storms Sunday. People react to record temps: ""It's not the heat, it's the stupidity"" CNN's Maria White, Jake Carpenter and Chandler Friedman contributed to this report.","NEW: Nearly 700,000 remained without power Wednesday night .

"(CNN) -- On the surface, the first round of the Egyptian presidential election seemed to show that the Muslim Brotherhood and the remnants of the Mubarak regime are locked in mortal combat for the political soul of Egypt -- as Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi faces pro-military candidate Ahmed Shafik in a second round of voting in June. Buying into this simplistic formula, however, would be a total misreading of the far more complex picture. To understand the political reality of Egypt and the strengths and weaknesses of the major political forces operating in the country, one needs to look more closely at all of the electoral results. First, it is very clear that the Muslim Brotherhood, despite Morsi's emergence as the presidential front-runner, lost almost half its support base between the parliamentary and presidential elections -- from 47% to 25%. It is true that the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood was able to mobilize its political base in the presidential elections more effectively than its competitors. But the support of a mere quarter of the electorate is nowhere near sufficient for the Brotherhood to govern the country by itself. Only part of this decline in support can be attributed to former Brotherhood leader Abdelmonen Abol Fotoh's 2011 defection from the party and his decision to run for president as an independent. The decline also reflects a disenchantment with the Brotherhood's poor legislative performance, its attempt to pack the constituent assembly with its supporters, reneging on its promise not to run a presidential candidate and its tendency to compromise with the military on important issues. The election results also demonstrate that the total Islamist vote is somewhere around 40% of the electorate. That might be overstating its strength. Islamist Abul Fotoh garnered many votes from secular liberals who mistakenly considered him to be the anti-establishment front-runner. Many voted for him to prevent Mubarak-era candidates Amr Mousa and Shafik from winning. The real surprise of the election was the emergence of Hamdeen Sabahy -- whose campaign was built on nationalism and demands for social justice -- with 22% of the vote. Sabahy was often referred to as the Nasserist candidate who represented the legacy of the Gamal Abdul Nasser, the leader of the 1952 revolution and Egypt's first president. His campaign did not get going until very late in the day; otherwise it is more than likely that the runoff would have pitted him against Morsi. That would have given Sabahy a real shot at winning the runoff, given the anti-Islamist search for a viable candidate untainted by the Mubarak regime. Sabahy's performance in the first round indicates that many who voted for the Muslim Brotherhood in parliamentary elections, especially the working classes, were disillusioned with its advocacy of a free market economy and lack of attention to social justice and welfare issues. Sabahy's message of social justice worked, as demonstrated by his lead in Cairo's working-class district Imbaba, long considered a Muslim Brotherhood stronghold. Sabahy carried the two most populous cities, Cairo and Alexandria, without much organizational support -- a remarkable performance by any standards. The fact that pro-military Shafik, the leading remnant of the Mubarak regime, took almost a quarter of the votes seems remarkable. But the superior financial capability and patron-client network of the former ruling party NDP, especially in the Nile Delta, and covert support from the military brass played a big role. Reports are emerging that the security services and military-linked pro-Mubarak landlords coerced many of the Delta peasantry to vote for Shafik. It appears that pressure was also put on public servants and their families. Shafiq's law-and-order message also attributed to his success. The security situation in much of the country has deteriorated markedly -- some argue deliberately engineered by the military. But his performance can also be read as the last gasp of the old regime, which can be well and truly buried if its opponents, from the Brotherhood to the Nasserists and liberals, can form a coalition capable of providing effective and legitimate government. This should not be an impossible task. It is clear that the Islamist forces are fractured and the Brotherhood's base is shrinking, as the political playing field becomes increasingly level in a democratizing Egypt. There are indications that the Brotherhood is aware of its limitations, which has forced it to mellow considerably, sacrificing some of its ideological purity at the altar of political pragmatism. If the leaders of the various trends of political opposition to the Mubarak regime demonstrate adequate wisdom and put together a governing coalition that includes no remnants of the old regime, Egypt's democratic experiment could be securely launched on the road to maturity. It is most important that the Brotherhood and Sabahy's campaign come to an understanding that would allow them to share power, possibly with Morsi as president and Sabahy as vice president of a democratic Egypt. The Brotherhood must also give the Nasserists and liberals a voice in writing a new constitution that would guarantee the fundamental rights of citizens and delineate a process for orderly political transition, based on periodic elections for the executive and the legislative branches of government. A consensus will also have to be built on the role of Islam in the new political order. The Muslim Brotherhood has demonstrated remarkable flexibility in the past on this issue. It may be even more flexible now that it realizes a consensus on Islam that is acceptable to the majority of political parties and factions would be essential to creating a coalition. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mohammed Ayoob.","Mohammed Ayoob: Muslim Brotherhood lost half its support between the two elections .
The Brotherhood can't govern by itself with support of only 22% of electorate, he writes .
Ayoob: Mubarak-linked candidate did well, but social justice proponent did well, too .
Liberals, Nasserists and Brotherhood must form their own coalition, Ayoob writes ."
"(CNN) -- More than a dozen alleged members of American Front, a down-on-its-luck white supremacist group, were charged Friday in Florida with participating in paramilitary training, prosecutors said. The alleged ringleader of the group, Marcus Faella, was also charged with directing the activities of a gang and teaching paramilitary training, they said. Nine members of the group, including Faella and his wife, Patricia Faella, were charged with conspiracy to shoot at, within or into a building. According to police, Faella was planning to stage provocative disruptions at the Orlando City Hall and at a Melbourne, Florida, anarchist gathering that included members of anti-racist skinhead groups. Faella, police documents say, wanted to stir up media attention to help gain new recruits for American Front, which hate-tracking groups says has been faltering since the death of its leader, David Lynch, in California. All but one of the 14 people accused in the investigation have been arrested, according to prosecutors. That person's identity is being held pending arrest. ""Today, Central Floridians sent a strong message to our communities: the message that criminal behavior whose thesis is hate and intolerance will not be allowed to flourish in our neighborhoods,"" said Lawson Lamar, state attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit Court of Florida. Nationally, American Front has had a long and violent history, including the beating death of a Salt Lake City man and a string of 1993 bombings in California, according to hate-tracking groups. The 25-year-old group enjoyed a resurgence in 2007 under Lynch, described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a charismatic leader who helped form it in 1987. But Lynch was shot to death in his home in March 2011, leaving the group with no clear leader, according to the Anti-Defamation League. It has shrunk significantly in the past year, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Most of the group's 50 or so members appear to live in Florida, according to the ADL. ""Faella views himself and the other members of the AF as the protectors of the white race,"" investigators wrote in an affidavit, referring to the group by its initials. ""Faella has stated his intent during the race war is to kill Jews, immigrants and other minorities."" Faella bonded out of jail on Saturday, according to Osceola County, Florida officials. His wife was released on Sunday, they said. According to police, Faella's group watched videos training them in fighting and the use of AK-47s and other weapons at the compound, which the affidavit said is ringed with barbed wire and protected by pit bulls and firing positions facing the driveway. The property was meant to become a refuge for white supremacists after the fall of the U.S. government during a race war, investigators wrote. The group was making body armor and sniper suits and stocking up on supplies in preparation, according to police. On at least one occasion, a group member who also belonged to the National Guard provided training to American Front members that he had learned in the military, according to the affidavit. The arrests came on the heels of a two-year investigation based on the reports of a confidential informant who had to flee the fortified compound on April 28, according to the arrest affidavit. At a meeting to plan the attack on rival skinheads that day, Faella nearly discovered secret recordings the informant had been making of training exercises, according to an affidavit released by police.","More than a dozen alleged members of American Front face charges .

"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court begins each session with a proclamation that ends with the words ""God save this Honorable Court."" Even strict advocates of the separation of Church and State ought to say ""Amen"" to that line after Thursday's decision upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act . I write this as someone who not only thought that the act would be overturned, but also still thinks there are strong constitutional arguments to be made against the mandate. All Americans, however, regardless of their partisan affiliation or views on the Constitution, had something to celebrate Thursday . Despite what almost all the pundits predicted, the court's decision provides some evidence that there remains one institution of American government that cannot be seen as nakedly partisan. In the end, Chief Justice John Roberts, a career Republican who was nominated for the Supreme Court by George W. Bush, cast the deciding vote upholding the signature act of the current Democratic administration. This, I think, is what Americans indicated they were looking for when they elected a president in 2008 who, four years earlier, had risen to national prominence by giving a speech in which he took issue with those who would ""slice-and-dice our country into red states and blue states."" Unfortunately, the divide between Republicans and Democrats has, if anything, gotten worse over the past 3Â½ years. Of course, each side blames the other for this result; they are both right. More blame, however, is not what is needed. We used to refer to Congress, or at least the Senate, as the ""world's greatest deliberative body."" We all know that very little of what might be termed ""deliberation"" goes on within either chamber nowadays. Instead, Republicans attack Democrats, and Democrats attack Republicans. To deliberate means to consider something carefully. It means you have to listen to and weigh the position of your opponent. Unfortunately, in today's world, partisans have adopted what amounts to a version of political fundamentalism in which giving any credence to the other side's position is a form of heresy. But deliberate is exactly what the Supreme Court does. It is a far from perfect process, and yes, the court is affected by politics. As James Madison reminded us, however, neither the government nor the governed are angels. Perfection is not to be expected. Some attempt, however, to think through issues in a nonprejudicial way is required. Of course, Supreme Court justices have advantages. They do not have to stand for election and, as the chief justice wrote in his opinion read Thursday, they do not have to take a position on whether a law ""embodies sound policies."" Nevertheless, the court, and particularly the chief justice, offered an important lesson to the political branches on Thursday on how they might undertake to solve the nation's problems. Will those who serve in the political branches listen? Their initial reactions are certainly not encouraging. The president and Congress may, however, want to take a look at current approval polls. Although even their numbers have declined lately, the Supreme Court has a much higher net approval number (+8), than Obama (-4), or the Congress (-62). Hopefully, the court's numbers will be improved after Thursday's decision. Both the Republicans and Democrats will doubtless find fault with Roberts' opinion, but the example of bipartisan deliberation that the court provided was much needed in today's political climate. ""This Honorable Court"" deserves our gratitude. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Paul Sracic.","Paul Sracic says whatever your political bent, you can celebrate Supreme Court's decision .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The father of a homeless California man who died after being beaten by Fullerton police officers filed a wrongful death lawsuit Thursday against the city, its police chief and the six officers allegedly involved in the fatal incident. The lawsuit filed by Frederick Ronald Thomas Jr., 55, of Cypress, California, also alleges assault and battery, negligence and civil rights violations in the death of his son, Kelly James Thomas. The suit, filed in Orange County Superior Court one year after the beating, seeks more than $25,000 in damages. Homeless man cries for help, his dad in graphic arrest video . Kelly Thomas, 37, a lifelong resident of Fullerton, was shirtless and carrying a backpack, and was wearing long pants and slippers, when Fullerton police were called to investigate a ""homeless"" man looking in car windows and pulling door handles of parked cars at the city's bus depot last July 5, the lawsuit said. A security camera at the downtown bus depot provided 16 minutes of video of the officers questioning and then beating Thomas, who was schizophrenic. An anniversary vigil was scheduled to be held Thursday evening at the Fullerton depot. Two of the officers have been charged in the beating death and were ordered in May to stand trial. Officer Manuel Ramos is charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, and Cpl. Jay Patrick Cicinelli is charged with involuntary manslaughter and felony use of excessive force. Both have pleaded not guilty. Civil suit alleges false police report in death case of homeless man . Ramos, 37, a 10-year veteran of the police department, would face a maximum sentence of 15 years to life if convicted, authorities said. Cicinelli, 39, a 12-year Fullerton police veteran, would face a maximum of four years in prison if convicted. ""The murder of Kelly Thomas was the inevitable result of the culture of corruption and deliberate indifference within the City of Fullerton Police Department,"" the lawsuit alleges. ""The city's police department has a longstanding reputation of running roughshod on its citizens' constitutional rights, ignoring citizen complaints and issuing no discipline to officers accused of wrongdoing,"" the lawsuit claims. Fullerton police spokesman Sgt. Jeff Stuart said the department hadn't yet reviewed the lawsuit and didn't have a comment Thursday. Recently, Thomas' mother, Cathy, received $1 million from Fullerton's insurance reserves in an agreement to settle her claim against the city in her son's death, according to a city statement. Cathy Thomas, who's divorced from Frederick ""Ron"" Thomas, released the city and its police officers from all potential claims, the city's statement said. Garo Mardirossian, the attorney in Ron Thomas' suit, told reporters Thursday that he also represented Cathy Thomas at one point. He declined to comment on her settlement agreement.

"(CNN) -- Barclays CEO Bob Diamond and COO Jerry del Missier have resigned in the wake of the interest rate-fixing scandal that has rocked the bank. The resignations come less than a week after Barclays, one of the world's largest banks, was fined $450 million by British and U.S. regulators after admitting it purposely under-reported its interest rates as part of LIBOR (London interbank Offered Rate) -- an interest rate floor between big banks that is set in London each trading morning. CNN interviewed analyst Ralph Silva, a former investment banker with more than 20 years experience in the financial services sector, about Diamond's resignation and what it means for the future of banking culture. What does Diamond's resignation mean? Bob Diamond's resignation sets a precedent -- we have to realize that Barclays was the first of 15 banks that are under investigation for LIBOR manipulation. Let's say that even half of those banks come to the same conclusion and are fined by the regulators. Does this mean we're going to lose seven or eight of the most powerful bank CEOs in the world? If that's the case then this signals a complete and radical cultural change within the financial services industry, and the whole industry will change because of this. And that's why Barclays were so important to get this right. This was an unforgivable situation for one simple reason: this affects the public. When banks beat up on each other, who cares? When banks beat up on professional investors -- high net worth individuals, people who should know better -- who cares? But when you start messing with grandmothers' pensions, everyone cares, and that's why this is a game-changer. Explain how this scandal has affected the public? The LIBOR rates for different currencies are directly connected to 99% of all (commercial) banking products -- mortgages, credit cards, and payouts for things like pensions are all based on LIBOR rates. So if banks are manipulating LIBOR rates, what they're basically doing is taking money out of the public's pocket, because their mortgage rates change, because their interest rates change, their loans/credit cards change -- or their pension income changes. Various LIBOR rates are determined each day for different currencies (dollar, yen, euro) around the world, and these rates are the benchmark by which commercial banking operations around the world are conducted each day in those respective currencies. What side of the bank was most interested in LIBOR? This would be the investment bank, because they make money on LIBOR day in and day out. As head of the Barclays investment wing when LIBOR was being manipulated, isn't it hard to believe Bob Diamond didn't know it was going on? Actually it is believable, because it's about 15 people globally who handle LIBOR -- 15 people who pick up the phone and talk to their colleagues and say: ""Let's make LIBOR this today,"" so he wouldn't know about these conversations, so we don't blame him or think what he did was criminal -- what we think was that he should've had more oversight at the bank. How will this actually be a culture change? Won't it be a slap on the wrist? The new management coming in is going to have to say ""we have to look at every part of the bank that affects the public, and we have to have so many checks and balances that absolutely nothing can happen."" Up to this point, if you're a banker and you screw the public, whatever -- the assumption was that the net benefit to the economy of your bank was greater than one or two individuals (in the public). What we're saying now is ""no, if you screw one person, you're out of here -- you screw another bank, a professional investor, go ahead -- but if you screw a grandmother (out of money), you're out."" The next Barclays boss will be from the same banking culture as Bob Diamond. What will be different? The change is very simple -- now they know they can get fired for those things. Before they thought they were untouchable. The problem with culture is the degrees of separation -- these guys know the price of a bottle of Dom Perignon, but you ask them the price of a pint of milk and they have absolutely no clue. The new management will come on and say, ""I have to know the price of a pint of milk, I have to know what people pay on a mortgage, and I have to make sure that whatever I do at this bank isn't going to affect that."" And that's a great change. It's something we need. What qualities will a bank boss in this ""new culture"" need? The next boss needs to be a general. Before a boss would only worry about money -- as long as at the end of the year the bottom line says you were profitable -- that's not enough anymore. You have to profitable, but you have to be moral as well. More morality in banking is exactly what we're talking about -- the culture has to be moral, what happened here isn't about money, it's a morality issue. Where has this push for ""moral"" banking come from? Banks are no longer on a pedestal. All of a sudden banks and grocery stores are at the same level -- we wouldn't accept a supermarket selling us spoiled bananas. Historically, whatever the banks said we would do, but now we won't accept that anymore. People are saying, 'hold on, you're a business like any other business, you make money off our backs, so do what I tell you to do.' I remember the days when banks opened at 10:00 a.m. and closed at 3:00 p.m. with an hour for lunch. So you had to change your entire life to deal with the banks. Those days are over. The change is that the public understands what banks are doing and all of a sudden we say there are alternatives -- I can put my money into Tesco, Tesco has a bank. Other supermarkets have banks. I can get a credit card at Starbucks. So all of a sudden the banks are realizing they need to start doing the right thing. How big is the LIBOR scandal going to get? This is a potential scandal for the 15 biggest banks in the world, because they're the only ones who play with LIBOR rates -- these are huge organizations, which also poses some risk. These are enormous organizations employing millions of people. The biggest problem with the Bob Diamond thing is people may believe that all bankers are evil. Fifteen guys cause LIBOR rates, and if the police have their say they're going to be in prison. But a million other people working for a bank get up and do an honest day's work for an honest living, they send their kids to school, they're honest people. We shouldn't paint everyone with the same brush. How many people determine LIBOR? Is the system going to change because of this scandal? It usually ends up being one person at each bank who determines LIBOR for the day. A bank determines what they want LIBOR to be for the day, and the LIBOR person calls up his equivalent and the other banks and they negotiate what the rate will be for that day. That number then pops up on every computer around that bank, and that's the rate. The system absolutely has to change -- we've been talking about changing the system for some time, but we just believe that in a period of such change because of the economic crisis, we should wait until everything settles down and then change it. If the Lehman Brothers-style bankruptcies that wrecked the global economy didn't bring real change, why will this scandal? The difference is that all of Lehman Brothers' customers were all filthy rich. Their customers were governments, municipalities, professionals in the financial services industries -- they knew what they were doing, there were risks that they all understood. But (Barclays) is retail banking: this is human-being-to-human-being, people who aren't expected to know anything about financial services, they're expected to be able to trust the banks. That's what makes this different. In fact, we give these banks a license on the agreement that they never put ordinary customers at risk, and that's what they did here. So Bob Diamond resigning is the start of a new era of commercial banking? It is, and the banks don't like to move fast, but the governments are going to insist on a culture change. Let's see how things go with the other banks (that may be implicated in LIBOR rate-manipulation) -- if I were any of the other banks, I'd want to stay real quiet now. I'd want to keep this thing in the courts for 10 years until everybody forgets about it. Any early favorites for the next Barclays CEO? Would you want that job? That's the problem -- I think anyone who probably should fit into that job is smart enough not to want it. Why would you do that? If you want to be in a bank right now, you want to be Number Two. You get just as much money as the top guy, but you're not in the press all the time -- so the next time a head has to roll, it's someone else's head. But this culture change won't transform the investment bank-related issues that brought down the global financial system in 2008, will it? That's fair, but we've been working on a solution to that problem for a few years now. So we're well under way to fixing that problem. If you look at the difference (since 2008), the banks are far better capitalized now, and they have all been moving in the right -- or ""protect the banks"" -- direction. What banks have not been doing is moving in the ""protect the customer"" direction, and this is going to be make them move that way now.

"(CNN) -- Syria's besieged leader says he regrets that his soldiers shot down a Turkish jet last month but said they thought the plane belonged to Israel. ""I would not wish it for any plane other than an enemy one. Especially for a Turkish plane, I say 100%, if only we did not shoot it down,"" President Bashar al-Assad told Turkey's Cumhuriyet newspaper in an interview published Tuesday. ""The Turkish people are our brothers and something that would make them sad would never make me happy and it did not. If this was an Israeli plane, of course, I would have been happy."" The June 22 shootdown of the F-4 Phantom jet came after Israeli planes had previously used the same air corridor three times, al-Assad said. Israel and Syria are longtime adversaries. ""A plane coming from that side is perceived by the Syrian military as an Israeli plane. It was accepted as an enemy plane, reacted against fast and fired at,"" he said. ""Since we couldn't see it on our radars and no information was given either, the soldiers downed it. We learned that it belonged to Turkey after shooting it down."" As a result, al-Assad said, the significance of the downing ""should not be exaggerated."" The shootdown underscores rising tensions between the two nations over Syria's nearly 16-month government crackdown and the grass-roots uprising against the regime. Syria and Turkey have acknowledged that the plane strayed into Syrian airspace, but Turkey said the incursion was accidental and quickly corrected. Turkey's National Security Council has bolstered its forces along the border and said last week the nation would act against any ""hostile action"" by Syria. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country was changing its rules of engagement and would treat any military approach by Syrian forces toward its border as a threat that ""will be dealt with accordingly."" NATO deplored the shootdown, but the alliance, of which Turkey is a member, did not promise any action in response to the incident. Turkish officials said Tuesday that they scrambled jet fighters Monday to track Syrian helicopters flying near the border between the two countries. It was the third consecutive day in which Turkish officials have sent jets to intercept Syrian helicopters closing in on the border, the Turkish armed forces said. No shots were fired. The search for the downed jet's wreckage and pilots was ongoing. The Turkish government, once close with al-Assad, has been sharply critical of the Syrian leader's clampdown against his citizens. Turkey is hosting thousands of Syrian refugees and anti-Assad opposition groups. Al-Assad criticized Erdogan's ""dangerous"" posturing after what he said was an understandable military move. ""In an environment like this, arrival of such a plane is naturally perceived as an enemy plane,"" he said. ""Anyone who understands military matters a bit would know this. A country at war would behave this way anywhere in the world. This is absolutely not a political decision. However, unfortunately, the Erdogan government is after narrow calculations using this incident. He hasn't gotten the Turkish people's support for 15 months about the Syria policy. Now, he wants to use this incident as an opportunity to turn the animosity between governments to animosity between the people. This is very dangerous."" Despite the tensions, al-Assad draws a distinction between the Turkish government and Israel, its longtime adversary. He said he doesn't see Turkey as an enemy. Al-Assad criticized Turkey for cutting off ties between its army and Syria's. That hurt communication after the downing, he said. ""We would have handled the matter between military officials,"" he said. ""However, in the recent months we do not even have a telephone number anymore of a Turkish commander to call in case of an emergency."" Asked under what conditions he would leave his position, al-Assad said, ""If millions of people in my country don't want me, of course I would go. Why would I sit where I am not wanted?"" A report published by Human Rights Watch accused the Syrian regime of carrying out ""a state policy of torture"" to crush dissent. The group, citing interviews with more than 200 former prisoners and security officers who defected, identified 27 detention centers across Syria where prisoners were tortured. The carnage has spiked in recent days, with at least 109 people killed Sunday and 114 people killed Monday, opposition activists said. At least 71 deaths were recorded Tuesday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. CNN cannot independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because Syria restricts access by international journalists. Al-Assad's forces are showing signs of fracture, with reports of defections growing. At least 258 people, including soldiers, officers and their relatives fled Monday, said Col. Malek Kurdi, deputy commander of the rebel Free Syrian Army. He said it was not certain how many were soldiers and how many were relatives. As violence raged, diplomats and dissidents continued to search for ways to resolve the problem. Opposition groups have been meeting in Cairo, Egypt, in an attempt to unify their platform. World powers huddled Saturday in Geneva, Switzerland, in an attempt to devise steps to end the crisis. Ahmad Fawzi, spokesman for Kofi Annan, the U.N. and Arab League joint special envoy to Syria, called the meeting ""an accomplishment,"" with all parties coming together to agree on the need for a transitional governing body in Syria. Speaking to reporters Tuesday, he said Russia and China, which have pushed back on tough world action against al-Assad's regime, ""will put their full backing behind this agreement and do whatever they can do."" ""We are appealing to the parties to take a deep breath and step back from the brink and look long and hard at the proposals on the table because they form a framework for a solution,"" he said. The group in Switzerland agreed that both the regime and opposition fighters should immediately observe a cease-fire and implement Annan's six-point peace plan without waiting for the actions of others. The transitional government could include members of the current Syrian regime, making it theoretically possible that al-Assad could be be a part of any transition. Annan pointed out that the Syrians will decide the makeup.

"(CNN) -- Germany's build-up to Euro 2012 suffered a setback Saturday with a 5-3 defeat to Switzerland in Basel. It was the first time the Swiss, who did not qualify for this summer's tournament, had beaten Germany in an international since 1956. German coach Joachim Loew fielded an understrength team as he rested eight Bayern Munich players who were involved in the Champions League final defeat to Chelsea last weekend. But the performance of their understudies will do little to inspire confidence, with goalkeeper Ter Stegen having a forgettable error-strewn match as the Germans lost for the second time in a row. Having gone through Euro qualifying unbeaten, they were beaten by France 2-1 in their last friendly in February. Swiss striker Eren Derdiyok, who plays in the Bundesliga, scored a hat-trick and put his team 2-0 ahead with two first half goals in three minutes. Both goals were laid on by strike partner Tranquillo Barnettas before defender Mats Hummels pulled one back for Germany just before halftime with a header from a Mesut Ozil cross. But Derdiyok made it 3-1 after 50 minutes, again from a Barnettas assist. Andre Schuerrle cut the lead to give Germany some hope before Andre Lichtsteiner made it 4-2 in the 67th minute. Marco Reus added the third for the Germans five minutes later but Admir Mehmedi sealed victory for the Swiss and made it 5-3 late on. ""We didn't expect a result like this and we cannot be satisfied by it,"" Loew told AFP. Meanwhile, Spain warmed up for a defense of their European title with a 2-0 friendly win over Serbia in a friendly played in Switzerland. Coach Vicente del Bosque was also forced to field a second string line-up with many of his players involved in Friday's Copa del Rey final between Barcelona and Athletic Bilbao. Atletico Madrid's Adrian Lopez, a second half substitute, headed the 2010 World Cup winners in front in the 64th minute. He was then pulled down by Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic to earn a 75th minute penalty, converted by Santi Cazorla. Spain announce their 23-man squad for Poland and the Ukraine Sunday. Portugal, captained by Cristiano Ronaldo, were held to a disappointing 0-0 draw by Macedonia in Leiria. Their group rivals in the Euro finals, Denmark, were beaten 3-1 by a young Brazil side, who are preparing for the London Olympics, in a friendly in Hamburg. Porto striker Hulk scored twice with Denmark's Niki Zimling turning an Oscar cross into his own net for the other goal. Nicklas Bendtner pulled a goal back for the well-beaten Danes. The Netherlands also went down to a friendly defeat, losing 2-1 at home to Bulgaria. Arsenal's Robin van Persie gave the Dutch a 45th minute lead but Bulgaria, who did not make Euro 2012, equalized four minutes into the second half with an Ivelin Popov penalty after Rafael van der Vaart had hand balled. Bulgaria striker Ilijan Mizanski grabbed a shock winner in the second minute of injury time as the home side pushed forward and were caught on the break.","Switzerland beat Germany 5-3 in friendly international in Basel .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Members of the powerful Hezbollah movement and its allies brought down Lebanon's unity government Wednesday after resigning from Prime Minister Saad Hariri's Cabinet. Minister of State Adnan Sayyed Hussein turned in his resignation along with 10 members of the Hezbollah-led March 8 alliance, meaning that the threshold needed -- 11 resignations from the 30-member Cabinet -- to collapse the government had been reached. Hariri was meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House as the political crisis erupted in Lebanon. ""The efforts by the Hezbollah-led coalition to collapse the Lebanese government only demonstrate their own fear and determination to block the government's ability to conduct its business and advance the aspirations of all of the Lebanese people,"" Obama said. Hariri next heads to Paris, where he is expected to meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Hariri's office said. Lebanon's government has been at an impasse over the U.N.-backed special tribunal's investigation of the assassination of Rafik Hariri, the current premier's father. It is widely expected the tribunal will indict members of Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, which is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Doha, Qatar, for a Middle East forum, said the tribunal was on the verge of handing down indictments. ""We view what happened today as a transparent effort by those forces inside Lebanon as well as interests outside Lebanon to subvert justice and undermine Lebanon's stability and progress,"" she said. Hezbollah has blamed Israel for the 2005 bombing that killed Hariri and has pressured the government to reject the tribunal's probe. Opposition member Fadi Abboud said the opposition bloc had been calling for a Cabinet session to discuss the tribunal and met Wednesday to discuss what action to take if their demands were not met. Attempts to resolve the dispute have failed so far. Hezbollah's walkout Wednesday came after a Saudi-Syrian initiative hit a dead end. In a statement issued before the resignations, Hariri said that ""despite the developments in the last hours, we will by all means work to keep the doors open for the Lebanese to reach the solutions that ensure stability and calm and preserve national unity."" Obama stressed to Hariri the importance of the tribunal's work ""as a means to help end the era of political assassinations with impunity in Lebanon."" The failure to break the impasse between Hariri's government and Hezbollah has raised fears of a renewal of the sectarian bloodshed that plagued Lebanon in 2008. Rafik Hariri's death stunned the nation and prompted tens of thousands to protest, blaming neighboring Syria for the killing. Syria has always denied the accusations. At the time of the bombing, Syria had immense political influence in Lebanon. A U.N. Security Council resolution demanded Damascus fully cooperate in the investigation. Eventually, the horrific events and the probe led to a complete withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon after 30 years of military presence. CNN's Nada Husseini and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama meets with Hariri and denounces Hezbollah's actions .

"LOS ANGELES, California (Reuters)  -- Actor-comedian Eddie Murphy publicly acknowledged on Friday having fathered a child out of wedlock with Spice Girls singer Melanie Brown, who brought a paternity suit against him earlier this week. Eddie Murphy, at the Academy Awards in February, is the father of Spice Girl Melanie Brown's baby. A brief statement issued by Murphy's publicist said the 46-year-old star of ""Dreamgirls"" and the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" movies ""always has and will continue to honor his responsibilities as a father."" ""Mr. Murphy and Ms. Brown dated very briefly and never made any plans of ANY sort,"" the statement said. ""He acknowledges paternity of the child Angel, and has paid child support to Ms. Brown as well as covering the expenses of her pregnancy."" The statement concluded by saying Murphy ""views this as a private matter, and as such, will not be making any further comments about it."" Murphy had never publicly acknowledged paternity before. Brown filed suit against Murphy in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, seeking to legally establish his paternity and seeking unspecified child support for the 3-month-old girl. A DNA test in June confirmed that Murphy is the father of Brown's baby, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, who was born in April. The couple dated last year and Brown, 32, known as Scary Spice as a member of the British pop phenomenon, listed Murphy as the father on the child's birth certificate. Celebrity magazines reported this week that Murphy had become engaged to his girlfriend of 10 months, Tracey Edmonds. Murphy has five children from his first marriage to Nicole Mitchell, which ended in divorce in April 2006. The Spice Girls announced in June they would be reuniting for a world tour starting in December.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Kim Davis buried three members of her family at Savannah's Magnolia Memorial Gardens last year. She visits them three or four times a week. She hears her brother, Troy Davis: ""I am innocent."" She hears her sister, Martina Correia: ""Don't give up the fight."" And her mother, Virginia Davis: ""I love you."" Kim Davis is left holding the family mantle now, assuming the lead to clear her brother's name. It was a role Correia had played since August 1989, when Troy Davis was named a suspect in the shooting death of Savannah police Officer Mark Allen MacPhail. She stayed by her brother's side through his trial, conviction and sentencing, and visited him for two decades on Georgia's Death Row, never slowing in her effort to exonerate him. Through the years of legal battles and appearances before judges and clemency boards, Correia suffered from breast cancer eating away her body. By the time of Davis' execution last September, she was bound to a wheelchair. A chest tube helped her breathe. Still, she stood up from her chair to speak on her brother's behalf. The doubt cast over Troy Davis' guilt made him a poster child for opponents of capital punishment. Correia became one of the movement's strongest advocates. She held on for two months after the execution, buoyed by promises to her brother that she would be his voice when he could no longer speak. ""Martina told Troy she would continue to fight,"" Kim Davis says. The execution, she says, even helped Correia make a turnaround in her failing health, so determined was she to make good on her word. They had always been close: T and T, they called themselves. Tina and Troy. But by Thanksgiving, Correia was sinking. She died a few days later. Davis took her place at a Washington anti-death penalty event. It was the first time she had spoken in her sister's stead and she knew there would be many more such events to come. Her brother wanted it that way. Strapped to the execution gurney, Troy Davis said: ""I ask my family and friends to continue to fight this fight."" Recently, Kim Davis drove from Savannah to Atlanta to speak about her brother at Spelman College and at Woodward Academy, a private school. She walks with a cane because of multiple sclerosis. She wears a blue T-shirt that says ""I Am Troy Davis."" ""The fight was bigger than Troy,"" she says. ""We're fighting against the system."" Nothing she does will bring her brother back; there can be no more hearings in court. But if she keeps digging, maybe one day she will find a clue. Maybe one day someone will say something that will convince everyone that her brother did not kill. She believes Georgia executed an innocent man. She cannot hide her deep disappointment in the justice system. But she prays for the MacPhails, she says. ""It's sad for someone to have so much hate in their heart."" Troy forgave those who spoke against him, she says. So she has, too.","Troy Davis' younger sister has taken up the battle to clear his name .

"(CNN) -- Workers involved in the tourism industry along the U.S. Gulf Coast hope this Memorial Day weekend is one of their best in a long time. The threat of oil from the Deepwater Horizon spill kept many tourists away from beach communities last year. Since the oil spill, BP has provided money to states to help promote tourism. So far, the oil giant says it has given Florida $42 million, Mississippi $18 million, Alabama nearly $30 and Louisiana $25 million in tourism grants. Here are some comments about Gulf Coast tourism from people who work in the sector: . Mississippi . Janice Jones, a marketing manager at the Mississippi Gulf Coast Visitors Bureau said she is ""hopeful about this year."" She said ""everyone kind of looks around for the piece of wood to knock on when you say that."" In addition to the 2010 oil spill, the area was also devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Jones said for Memorial Day weekend she is conservatively estimating that about 75% of hotel rooms will be booked -- a number that would be 10% more than in 2010 and the highest level in at least three years. Additionally, she said the hotels this year will be filled with tourists, while last year they were filled largely with BP cleanup workers, who generally didn't spend money on tourist activities. Alabama . Herb Malone, president and chief executive of Gulf Shores & Orange Beach Tourism said lodging rates have been climbing. ""Since October 2010, we have seen an upward trend every month."" Memorial Day tourism numbers for beach areas are up, even compared to years before the spill. Malone added, ""We are seeing increases over 2009 figures, which is a good indication that things are moving in the right direction."" Florida . Will Seccombe, chief marketing officer for Visit Florida said ""we are looking for a really solid Memorial Day, and a really solid summer."" Most of Florida's beaches never saw any crude come ashore. The area impacted last year by the oil, or rumors of oil, is ""clearly bouncing back and it's a big bounce"" he said. ""Northwest Florida is going to have an incredible rebound year."" Louisiana . ""We are looking much better for recreational tourism this year,"" said Jacques Berry, spokesman for the state Department of Culture, Recreation and Tourism.

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Decades after The Beatles first surged onto the international music stage, fans in Argentina are flocking to a new museum dedicated to the 'Fab Four' that opened in the country's capital this week. Museum creator Rodolfo Vazquez said he started his private collection after someone gave him the group's ""Rubber Soul"" record when he was 10 years old. ""I listened to 'In My Life' and I fell in love with The Beatles for all my life,"" he said. ""What I did was collect things, collect and collect like any fan, of football, stamps, action figures, whatever -- the little bit that I could get because in Buenos Aires there wasn't a lot of material,"" Vazquez said. By 2001, Vazquez secured a Guinness World Record for the ""largest collection of Beatles memorabilia."" At the time, he had 5,612 items in the attic of his Buenos Aires home. The collection now contains more than 8,500 items, according to Vazquez. Remembering John Lennon: The interviews . Vazquez said he bought some of the material with his own money, but acquired most of it through exchanges with fans around the world. Now, for an entrance fee of about $2.50, other aficionados can catch a glimpse of the collection, which Vazquez says is the first Beatles museum in Latin America. ""We're visiting from Uruguay. We came and we saw that it was opening and we decided to come,"" visitor Rodrigo Guerra said. ""It's very nice. It has everything."" In addition to memorabilia on display, the complex where the museum is located also includes a thematic restaurant and a replica of the Liverpool bar where the legendary band got its start. The museum, which opened Monday, was still drawing a steady stream of people Friday -- many of them members of a younger generation that never saw the group perform live. Several wore Beatles T-shirts. One sported a ""Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band"" tattoo. ""When the band played, I hadn't been born, so I'm looking for what my parents lived through,"" student Jimena Dieviataia said.","The museum's creator has been collecting memorabilia since he was age 10 .

"(EW.com) -- When Lady Gaga flounces onto a concert stage in one of her Marie Antoinette-gone-""Clockwork Orange"" getups, there's never much doubt that you're watching a glorious ''monster.'' The magic of Katy Perry, by contrast, is that she'll show up to perform in a shiny blue wig with Bettie Page bangs wearing oversize spinning lollipops pinned to her breasts ... and damned if she still doesn't look like the girl next door. In the thrilling 3-D concert film ""Katy Perry: Part of Me,"" there are a lot of things to love about Perry, from her sweetly sexy and pert beauty to her full-throated voice to the outrageous hookiness of songs like ''Teenage Dream'' and ''Last Friday Night'' (to me, her greatest track). Yet you could talk about every one of those things without capturing what's most special about Perry: the joy that beams out of her like a holy light. ""Part of Me"" works hard to prove it's more than a glorified infomercial, and one reason it is more is that Perry has a startling story to tell. The daughter of Pentecostal ministers, she grew up in a Christian bubble, sheltered from pop. But once she embraced pop, she did so with an almost religious zeal. The film also documents the breakup of her marriage to Russell Brand, and though it's glimpsed from the sidelines, Perry's despair is on full display. ""Part of Me"" demonstrates why feeling the sorrow may help to project the joy. EW's grade: A- . See the full story at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- Political groups and campaigns hoping to sway voters on the health care issue have spent about $70 million on health-themed TV ads since January 2011, according to a CNN analysis of ad spending data. What the health care ruling means to you . The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule Thursday on the constitutionality of President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act. According to the data, which is tracked by Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group, one of the groups that spent the most is AARP, which funneled about $10.3 million into ads in favor of the law. Ariel Gonzalez, director of health and family advocacy at AARP, says the group remains supportive of the legislation -- which was signed into law in March 2010 -- because it is hugely beneficial to his organization's members. Timeline of the health care law . ""We lobbied for its passage and we continue to comment on the regulations and implementation,"" Gonzalez said. ""The law does outstanding things for seniors and for our younger members. We are excited about the closure of the Medicare doughnut hole coverage gap with medications. We are excited about free preventive services and wellness benefits and the provision that eliminates the pre-existing conditions barrier and high premiums, and it has ended a good deal of fraud that had happened within the system."" But AARP's pro-reform ads were largely an exception, the data shows. Most groups' health care ads were soundly opposed to the law. Karl Rove's conservative Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies spent the most among all groups and campaigns -- $14.98 million -- on ads that ran 22,004 times. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce bought the second highest number of spots, spending more than $8.3 million to run ads against the legislation more than 13,000 times. The 60 Plus Association, which characterizes itself as the conservative alternative to AARP, spent $1.6 million on 2,861 spots. Jonathan Collegio, spokesman for Crossroads GPS, said their ads are designed told hold candidates who supported the law ""accountable for their vote."" ""Our goal with the ads is to create an environment where repealing the legislation or replacing it with more free-market principals is possible,"" he said. Basics: Health care reform issues . ""And frankly the president has a huge soapbox by which he can promote what he says are the benefits of this legislation, and the only way the opposition can push back is through ads."" Blair Latoff, senior director of communications for the U.S. Chamber, says her organization's effort is focused on electing a pro-business Congress. ""We've engaged earlier and more aggressively than ever in our 100-year history,"" she told CNN in an e-mail. Latoff characterized the ads as part of the chamber's ""unprecedented voter education efforts to highlight candidates' positions on issues critical to the American recovery,"" including the health care law and other ""job-killing regulations."" ""This is a multi-dimensional process that is not focused on Republicans vs. Democrats, but lawmakers who support free enterprise vs. those who instead choose big government,"" she said. Among the candidates, Obama's campaign spent $3.46 million on 8,211 spots, and presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney spent $3.8 million on 7,181 spots. Priorities USA Action, the independent super PAC supporting Obama's reelection bid, spent $2.57 million on 5,193 spots. Restore our Future, the independent super PAC supporting Romney, spent $1.36 million on 3,589 spots. Read the ruling (.PDF) Among Senate and House candidates, Jon Bruning -- the conservative Republican who hopes to fill the seat being vacated by retiring Nebraska Democratic Sen. Ben Nelson -- spent about $500,000 on some 2,200 health care-themed spots. His ad asks, ""Why am I leading the fight to stop President Obama's health care law? Just look at the unconstitutional power grab of a federal mandate that forces you to buy certain kinds of insurance."" Nelson's was the 60th and final vote needed to block a Republican filibuster against the health care bill, which passed in the Senate largely along party lines in December 2009. Drew Westen, an Emory University psychology professor who wrote ""The Political Brain,"" said the ad debate is about much more than health care. ""If I were a Republican candidate I would fill the airwaves with attack ads against Obamacare, just like they are doing, because this is one of the weakest links for this administration,"" Westen said. ""This was probably one of the most poorly managed messaging campaigns from a president in American history,"" he said. ""Here was his signature issue in the first term that was supposed to be his strength, but his administration did a bad job selling it, and even those who benefit from the legislation don't realize they do because the Obama administration never explained it well."" Westen says much of the problem was the way the Affordable Care Act was constructed. The provision that would matter most to people, he says, won't kick in until 2014 -- when 30 million people would be able to get health care without being denied insurance due to pre-existing conditions. The delay in implementing that provision, Westen says, let conservative groups run ads against the law before Americans experienced its benefits. ""The Obama administration had this extremely naÃ¯ve idea that a good idea would sell itself, and that it was a waste of time to talk to the American people,"" Westen said. ""Instead, they let the right dominate the airwaves about this debate. When the administration finally started to fight back right before the midterm elections in 2010, it was too late. It just looked like sour grapes."" No matter what decision the U.S. Supreme Court reaches on the legislation, he says, expect to see more ads on health care in the future. By the numbers: Health insurance .","PACs, campaigns have spent about $70 million on health care ads since January 2011 .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid had two players and coach Jose Mourinho sent off as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Villarreal, offering hope to Barcelona in the race for the Spanish title. Cristiano Ronaldo's goal looked to have sealed victory for the league leaders, only for Marcos Senna to salvage a point for the home side with seven minutes left. After that defender Sergio Ramos was sent off for picking up a second yellow card for a foul on Nilmar before midfielder Mesut Ozil was dismissed two minutes later for dissent. It was Real's second 1-1 draw in the space of four days after Malaga took a point from the Bernabeu on Sunday night, leaving Mourinho's team six points clear with 10 matches to play. Barcelona will take heart from Real's stutter, having kept their chase up with a 5-3 win over Granada on Wednesday. While Barca's talisman is Lionel Messi -- whose hat-trick in the Granada game saw him become the club's highest goalscorer of all time at the age of only 24 -- Real would be significantly weakened without Ronaldo. His strike took his goal tally to 33 for the season, just one short of Messi, as Real seek to secure their first league crown since 2008. Real are still favorites to claim the title, but their game against Barcelona on April 22 is looking ever more crucial. Elsewhere, Bayern Munich booked their place in the final of the German Cup by beating Borussia Monchengladbach on penalties. The game remained goalless after 120 minutes of football, but Bayern won 4-2 in the shootout to seal a clash with Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund on May 12. Meanwhile, Napoli overcame a 2-1 aggregate deficit to beat Siena 2-0 and clinch a place in the Italian Cup final against Juventus. An own goal from Simone Vergassola was added to by Napoli striker Edinson Cavani.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A new robotic suit could transform the lives of paralyzed people, giving them the ability to walk again. A lightweight robotic suit can help some wheelchair users walk. The invention, known as ReWalk, acts like a kind of exoskeleton. It consists of lightweight, motorized leg supports and an assortment of intricate motion sensors. Users wear a backpack that holds a computerized control box which helps the medical device recognize when a step needs to be taken. ""Standing changes my whole environment. I don't have to look from the bottom up. Now I am eye to eye with everybody,"" Radi Kaiof, who has used the device, told CNN. Kaiof, a former Israeli soldier, was paralyzed from the waist down 20 years ago. He doesn't have feeling in his legs but is still able to move with the use of the robotic suit.  Watch Kaiof walk with the assistance of the suit » . With the assistance of crutches, which offer balance and support, people paralyzed from the waist down can walk, bend, sit and even climb stairs when they wear the suit. The futuristic invention offers an alternative to using a wheelchair for those who have functioning upper bodies and are capable of standing with the use of supports. It is the creation of Dr. Amit Goffer, an engineer and founder of Haifa, Israel-based high-tech firm Argo Medical Technologies. Goffer was inspired to create the device more than a decade ago after he became disabled in an accident. The medical technology that could help paraplegics do what was once considered impossible isn't available for purchase yet. The device wasn't ready for testing until late 2007 and currently is in clinical trials in Tel Aviv. More trials are planned for the United States and Europe, and if the product receives the necessary approvals, it could hit the market in 2010. The price of the device hasn't been set yet, but is expected to be comparable with the typical average yearly expense of using a wheelchair. The robotic suit improves the quality of life of people paralyzed from the waist down, according to Goffer, who wanted to give paraplegics an alternative to using a wheelchair. It also benefits their overall health since it keeps their bodies active all day long, he says. But when it comes down to it, the invention is all about helping people regain respect. Dignity is ""the No. 1 problem"" for people who use wheelchairs, says Goffer. For Kaiof, the former soldier, the robotic suit has changed his life. Before he tried it on, his daughter had never seen him stand before. When he stood before her for the first time, she couldn't believe just how tall he was, he recounted to CNN.","Robotic suit developed in Israel helps paraplegics walk again .

"(CNN) -- Vacation season is nearly over, and kids are returning to school with the telltale tans and smiles that mean they had a wonderful and relaxing holiday. Kristy McCloskey and her husband were stuck in Ecuador after a volcanic eruption covered the town with ash. Some of our iReporters weren't so lucky. We asked CNN.com readers to send us stories of their worst vacation nightmares, and rain at the beach seems ideal compared with the tales we received. Here's a sampling of the worst of the worst -- but don't worry, most of our iReporters can look back on their vacation horrors and laugh. Well ... almost. Bruce Bush's vacation in Hawaii started off perfectly. His family loved the ""sandy beaches, hot weather and a tropical paradise I had never seen,"" he wrote in his iReport. But Bush, who had been sick for much of the vacation, was diagnosed with cancer in a Waikiki hospital three days before his family was scheduled to fly home. ""The doctors wanted to admit me right away and start treating me,"" he said. But something didn't feel right about the situation. So Bush's parents (he was 17 at the time) declined treatment and decided to wait out the rest of the vacation and ask his regular physician about it when the family arrived home in Indiana. ""By the time we went home, I'd already started feeling better,"" Bush said. The cancer diagnosis? A terrifying mistake. Bush had thought his illness was mononucleosis the entire time, and his doctor at home confirmed the diagnosis. iReport.com: Mistaken cancer diagnosis in Hawaii . ""My doctor was looking at the report all confused, and he said of course your white blood cell count was up -- that's what happens when you get sick!"" Bush said. Bush's parents didn't tell him about the cancer diagnosis until the family had returned home and his own doctor had refuted it. ""It was a crappy vacation for me just because I was sick,"" he said. ""But for my parents, to know that your child has been diagnosed by doctors, and you're supposed to trust what these people have to say, I'm pretty sure they didn't enjoy the vacation. They were so relieved and happy that they stuck to their guns."" Donna Rogers and her family never even made it to the tropics. They took a cruise bound for the Bahamas and ended up spending their vacation on a ship with a broken propulsion system. ""It was Thanksgiving week, and my birthday fell on Thanksgiving, too,"" she said. ""I thought I'd be on the beach in the Bahamas with a margarita in my hand for my birthday."" Instead, Rogers' cruise ship was stranded in Norfolk, Virginia, for the entire week. Passengers could go to a mall in Norfolk and to bars and restaurants on the ship, she said, but not much else. And when passengers began to get angry and restless, Rogers said the captain gave a mutiny warning and local law enforcement boarded the ship. ""You knew you were still in the U.S., but you felt like you were in another dimension,"" she said. ""He said we were under maritime law, and any aggression toward the staff would be mutiny and would be dealt with accordingly."" iReport.com: The cruise to nowhere . Rogers and her family were eventually able to leave the ship, and they spent the rest of their vacation with relatives in Virginia. The cruise line offered passengers a refund and a discount on another cruise, but Rogers says she would have to think seriously before getting on a cruise ship again. ""When cruises go bad, they go bad exponentially,"" she said. The cruise line in question declined to comment. Thanksgiving and birthdays aren't the only special occasions that can be spoiled by less-than-perfect vacations. Kelly Flores and her husband found themselves in the middle of a hurricane on their honeymoon. The couple was supposed to fly to St. Lucia, stopping briefly in Puerto Rico to change planes. ""Upon arriving in Puerto Rico, we discovered why our plane was not full and why our flight [to St. Lucia] had been cancelled,"" Flores wrote in her iReport. ""Hurricane Georges, category four, was heading directly for Puerto Rico and would be there by nightfall."" Despite trying immediately to leave -- ""get us on the next flight anywhere,"" Flores remembers telling the airline staff -- the newlyweds were stuck. Flores, a Virginia Beach, Virginia, native, says even though she was used to hurricanes, this one was the worst. iReport.com: Hurricane on a honeymoon . ""When you're not home, everything's different, and it was much scarier,"" she said. ""The hotel asked everyone to go to the ballroom. ... We could hear the steel shutters banging and hear the storm, and when we heard glass breaking, they got everybody into the older section of the building that was all concrete blocks."" After the storm passed, Flores and her husband made it to St. Lucia, where they stayed a few extra days. But the ""coup de grace,"" as she put it, was on their flight home. ""We met a couple who flew out the same day we did and we asked if they got hit by the hurricane, and they said no. They were supposed to go through Puerto Rico, too, but their airline put them through Miami instead because of the storm,"" she said. ""It's very frustrating."" And frustrating doesn't even begin to describe the feelings of many other iReporters who wrote in to tell us about their worst vacations ever. Mark O'Connor and his family suffered through airplane delays that made their trip to Dublin, Ireland, take two days. Once they arrived, they survived flooding and respiratory infections. iReport.com: The worst Christmas ever . Kristy McCloskey and her husband had to wear face masks during their entire trip to Ecuador. Ash from a recent volcanic eruption, which ""looked very much like snow,"" destroyed the air quality and caused many businesses and the airport to close, delaying their return by three days. iReport.com: Volcanic eruption in Ecuador .

"(CNN) -- After months of speculation and rumors, the Samsung Galaxy S III has finally been revealed, and yes it is more powerful that you could have ever imagined. Likely to be one of ""the"" phones of the year, the new handset offers just about all the technology you could wish for in a smartphone. There's the face recognition, the large screen, and plenty of other features that you'll be dying to show off to your friends and colleagues at every opportunity. Read more: Samsung unveils Galaxy S III smartphone with face, voice recognition . For Samsung it means they truly have a flagship device that can be sung about from the top of the mountain. It's a device that has the power and capabilities to take on the iPhone 4S, the next iPhone, and pretty much any phone that comes out over the course of the rest of the year. Things could change, but it's hard to imagine anyone aside from Apple with the capability to create a viable challenger to what Samsung has produced. Great news, you might say. It will sell by the bucket load, and become the de-facto phone for all replacing the iPhone and all that get in its way. Not so fast. The problem the Samsung Galaxy S III will likely face, stopping it becoming the biggest-selling phone of the year, is that all this power, all this might, all this expertise, is likely to be too much for the people who just want a phone. The iPhone is successful not because it features the best screen - it doesn't; not because it features the best design - it doesn't; and not because it uses any of the latest cutting technology - it doesn't do that either, but because it is the perfect phone for everyone. Give the iPhone to a 5 year old and they'll be able to use it. Give the iPhone to a grandparent and they'll be able to use it. I am not so sure that can be said about the Samsung Galaxy S III and Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. There is no doubting that the features are impressive and the phone stunning in what it can do, and Samsung has created an amazing product. Nine years ago, Samsung was making clamshell phones with small mono displays and 10-key dial-pads. Today it has made a phone that will be seen as a benchmark for manufacturers. Just think about that for a moment. Of course having a phone for everyone doesn't need to matter for Samsung. Unlike Apple, Samsung creates and sells a range of different phones for different people in multiple sizes and shapes. This is the phone for the flag bearers, this is the phone for the early adopters and what Samsung is hoping, will be the phone that its other customers will want to look up to, and eventually have. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stuart Miles.","Miles: Samsung Galaxy S III is the phone for the flag bearers .

"(CNN) -- He predicted it would be an emotional occasion, and so it proved. Ivan Ljubicic could have chosen to bow out from tennis on a grander stage, but the Monte Carlo Masters was the perfect place for him. ""I picked this one as my last because in 1999 I beat (Russia's Yevgeny) Kafelnikov, which was my first big victory, my breakthrough. So I felt like it was the right moment, the right place to finish it off,"" the 33-year-old told CNN. His first round defeat to fellow Croatian Ivan Dodig this month brought the curtain down on a stellar career which took him from his war-torn homeland to the international stage, becoming one of the game's most polished performers, on and off the court. ""As impressive as his achievements were on the court, Ivan will also be remembered for the way he carried himself away from the court,"" the head of the ATP Tour Brad Drewett said after the former world No. 3's tearful exit in his adopted home -- a haven for the rich and famous, and a far cry from his birthplace in the former Yugoslavia. ""A true gentleman and ever popular amongst his peers, we thank Ivan for his first-rate contributions to the sport throughout his career, and wish him the very best for the future,"" Drewett added of Ljubicic, who will now spend more time with his wife and two young kids. Federer hails 'wonderful friend' Ljubicic . Ljubicic bagged 10 ATP Tour titles during a 14-year career, his last coming in 2010 at the Indian Wells Masters in California when he beat American former world No. 1 Andy Roddick in the final. It was a deeply satisfying result for Ljubicic who, at the age of 31, became the oldest first-time winner of an ATP Tour Masters 1000 title in history. But his success wasn't limited to individual events. Together with Mario Ancic, Goran Ivanisevic and Ivo Karlovic, Ljubicic was part of Croatia's victorious 2005 Davis Cup team, becoming the only unseeded country to win the event. The dramatic 3-2 victory over Slovakia sparked wild celebrations in Zagreb's main square and followed on from a bronze medal he and Ancic won in the doubles at the Athens Olympics the previous summer. Both occasions were proud moments for Ljubicic who was forced to flee his home as a 13-year-old in May 1992 as Croatia battled to maintain the independence it declared the previous year. ""I was living in the Serbian part of Bosnia, so it wasn't a pleasant place to be at that moment,"" he recalls. ""I left with my mother and my brother. My father stayed, but he managed to get out in November the same year."" It was during this time that Ljubicic was invited to attend a tennis club in Moncalieri, a town near Turin in northern Italy. ""It was the beginning of my tennis career,"" he says. ""My parents thought it was a good idea, so I left Bosnia in 1993 and stayed for three years and in 1996 I started to have some good results."" An appearance in the Wimbledon juniors' final the same year was followed by his first sponsorship deal, marking his arrival in the professional ranks. A decade later, Ljubicic would reach the pinnacle of his career, rising to third in the world rankings behind Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal -- an achievement which remains a tremendous source of pride. ""I felt like I was No. 1 because at the time it was impossible to get to these guys. It is something I am really proud of. I felt like the No. 1 of normal people,"" he said. With their opposing personalities and playing styles, he says Federer and Nadal have created a unique era in tennis which will be difficult for a new generation to repeat. ""In the past we had a little bit of that with Agassi and Sampras but they were both American. Now we have a Swiss guy and a Spanish guy,"" Ljubicic said. And with current No. 1 Djokovic ""coming from another world at the moment"" -- these are great times for tennis, he thinks. Ljubicic recalls practicing with an 18-year-old Djokovic back in 2005 and wasn't immediately struck by the Serbian's game technically. But what he did observe, even at that young age, was a steely determination. ""Mentally he was ready. You could see it when you met him. He was so ready to be the best player that you could see it was going to happen, one way or the other,"" Ljubicic said. He predicts the top three will continue to dominate for another couple of seasons but with youngsters like Canada's Milos Raonic, Australia's Bernard Tomic and American Ryan Harrison coming through, a more varied set of grand slam champions looks set to emerge. For Ljubicic, the labors of the tennis court may now be over, but family responsibilities at his home in Monte Carlo will more than fill that void. ""I have two kids now -- a three-and-a-half-year-old boy and a girl who is four months,"" he said. ""We're going to spend a lot of time together. This period before they go to school is special and I want to spend as much time as possible with them.""","Ivan Ljubicic retires from professional tennis after a stellar career which included 10 titles .

President Asif Ali Zardari postponed a trip to Russia to huddle with senior members of his Pakistan Peoples Party to nominate a candidate. Pakistan state television reported Makhdoom Shahabuddin, a longtime member of parliament who has served in several administrations, was selected. The candidate served as Gilani's textile minister. Shadabuddin is considered a Zardari loyalist likely to adhere to the party agenda if elected. The Supreme Court declared Gilani disqualified retroactive to April 26, the day he was convicted of contempt charges stemming from his refusal to call on Swiss authorities to reopen old corruption charges against Zardari. ""Since no appeal was filed against this judgment, the conviction has attained finality,"" said the ruling, read in the court by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry. ""He has also ceased to be the prime minister of Pakistan with effect from the said date (April 26), and office of the prime minister shall be deemed to be vacant accordingly."" The speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly had 30 days from the day of the April verdict to ask the Election Commission to pursue disqualification proceedings if she viewed Gilani's conviction as cause for dismissal. In a five-page decision released last month, Speaker Fahmida Mirza said she did not believe the prime minister's refusal to follow the Supreme Court's order justified disqualification. The speaker's ruling seemed to give a boost to the prime minister, who decided not to appeal the court's conviction. The Supreme Court essentially overruled the speaker's decision Tuesday. The commission issued a ""notification of disqualification"" of Gilani after the order. ""The president of Pakistan is required to take necessary steps under the constitution to ensure continuation of the democratic process through the parliamentary system of government in the country,"" the Supreme Court order said. Hours after the court issued its ruling, Gilani had vacated the sprawling prime minister's residence in Islamabad with his political future in doubt. Explainer: What's next for Pakistan . Federal Information Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira said senior party members have decided that Zardari, who is the party chairman, will make a final decision on how to proceed after he meets with coalition partners. A presidential pardon has not yet been discussed. Supporters of Gilani and the party say the court's ruling was politically motivated because of bad blood between the Supreme Court's popular Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and Zardari. Pakistan has been beset by militant activity and political tumult for years. Fighters from the Taliban and al Qaeda use the northwestern territories as bases for attacks in Afghanistan, and U.S. drones regularly strike militant positions. The United States and the Afghan government have been concerned that the warfare and instability could hurt the government. But the crisis and a possible departure of the prime minister wouldn't have a seismic effect on the nation's stability and political system because the country's civilian government is dominated by the Pakistan Peoples Party. A new prime minister would simply take the place of Gilani as a representative of the party. The current government is approaching the end of its term in February, the first time since Pakistan's independence in 1947 that an administration would complete a five-year term.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Transportation Security Administration is failing to adequately report, track and fix airport security breaches, according to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general. As a result, the TSA ""does not have a complete understanding"" of breaches at the nation's airports, says a report from the inspector general. The report, published earlier this month, was requested by New Jersey Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg after a series of breaches at Newark Airport, including a knife bypassing TSA screening, passengers walking around security checkpoints and a dead dog transported without being screened for explosives. TSA responded to those incidents with ""corrective action,"" according to the inspector general, but not all the problems received the same treatment. The TSA took action to fix only 42% of the security breaches documented at Newark Airport, according to the report. ""There's no consistency because there is no clear guidance on what to report and when to report,"" Charles Edwards, acting inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security, told a congressional hearing on Wednesday. ""One of our recommendations is that they have to have a comprehensive oversight program where they provide clear guidance on how each of the airports need to be reporting and then TSA needs to follow through."" Most of the incidents examined occurred in 2010, and the report says since then efforts to fix security breach vulnerabilities have improved. Five other large U.S. terminals were visited by inspectors for comparison but the airports' names were withheld from the public report. Of the six airports visited, records were found detailing efforts to fix the causes of only 53% of the breaches. Newark was the lowest-scoring. The highest-rated airport reported corrective action in 88% of the breaches. ""I'm going to tell you right now the next incident is going to come from the ground. It's going to come from the shadow of the aircraft, it's not going to come through the passenger terminal. I'm telling you that,"" said Rep. John ""Chip"" Cravaack, R-Minnesota. The inspector general also noted that while the agency did have ""many programs and initiatives that report and track identified security breaches"" they were ""not all inclusive or centrally managed."" This lack of comprehensive, centralized data was cited as preventing the use of information to ""monitor trends or make general improvements to security."" Problems with how incidents were categorized in reporting also were outlined in the report. TSA workers at one airport reported ""an improper bag handoff incident"" in a database as a ""sterile area access event"" while another airport reported four similar incidents as ""security breaches."" Management at the agency concurred with the inspector general's report. ""TSA acknowledges that it can further develop and expand its oversight programs for gathering and tracking airport security breaches,"" wrote administrator John Pistole. ""TSA currently collects thousands of records of incidents and security breaches occurring at airports and other transportation facilities,"" TSA spokesman David Castelveter told CNN in an e-mail. ""TSA is coordinating appropriate revisions to relevant Operations Directives to develop a single definition of 'Security Breach,' addressing (the inspector general's) recommendation."" CNN's Lizzie O'Leary and Jim Barnett contributed to this report.","Inspector general says the TSA ""does not have a complete understanding"" of breaches .

"(CNN) -- A ship carrying about 200 people capsized in the waters between Australia and Indonesia, rescue officials in both countries said Thursday. A merchant ship was diverted to the scene and is taking on survivors, said Jo Meehan of the Australian Marine Safety Authority. An Australian naval vessel has also arrived on the scene and is preparing to take on survivors. In addition, an Australian Defence Forces aircraft at the location has dropped four life craft capable of carrying a total of 60 people, she said. Indonesia said it is sending two warships to assist Australian rescue efforts. Three shipwrecked fishermen lived on clams, seaweed for 10 days . ""We never know the exact number of people onboard as they get onboard illegally,"" said Gagah Prakoso, a spokesman for Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency. The vessel is 110 nautical miles northwest of Christmas Island. The Australian territory is closer to Indonesia and in the latter's designated search-and-rescue area, said Susan Usher of the Western Australian Police. She would not characterize the people aboard the vessel nor did she know their fate. Christmas Island has been the scene of another recent boat capsizing. At least 28 people died in December 2010 when a boat carrying asylum seekers crashed into cliffs near the coast of the island. Most of the people on the boat were from Iran and Iraq, a rescue worker said at the time. U.S. Navy rescues Iranian in capsized boat .","The ship overturns midway between Australia and Indonesia .

"(CNN) -- Republican Gov. Scott Walker's convincing win Tuesday in Wisconsin was not just a victory for the governor himself, but a major triumph for conservatives in the fight to curb public employee unions. For the country's sake, however, it will be far better if this struggle remains a fight rather than all-out war. In the run-up to Election Day, the Wisconsin recall vote was widely touted on the right as the second most important election of 2012. It was ignited when Walker pushed through a budget repair bill to curb the public employee unions. One key provision prohibited the unions from engaging in collective bargaining about anything other than pay (firefighters and police were exempted). Another provision said that a civil servant can no longer be forced to join a union and pay dues; there must be freedom of choice. That set off a firestorm of protests, turning the state capital upside down. Hundreds of vociferous protesters occupied the Wisconsin Statehouse, Democratic legislators bolted to Illinois to try to deny a quorum, and tens of thousands took to the streets. For a while, it looked as if Walker had gone too far. Wisconsinites needed just 540,000 valid signatures to trigger a recall against him; they gathered more than 900,000. Public polls in May 2011 showed Walker with a dismal 42% approval rating vs. 55% disapproval. The mainstream media portrayed the recall as a huge showdown over collective bargaining rights and were often sympathetic to the protesters. Walker seemed headed toward defeat this June. But in the many months that followed, the mood clearly changed. One of us (David Gergen) spent two days recently in visits to Madison, Green Bay and Milwaukee. Sentiment was often strong for Walker, especially among small-business owners. People agreed that new laws have helped to reduce government costs at a state and local level and that the economic outlook is somewhat better. Some told stories of teachers who were happier now that they didn't have to pay union dues and had more freedom. The Wall Street Journal has reported that membership in the state's second largest public union, the American Federation of State, Country and Municipal Employees, fell from 62,818 in March 2011 to 28,745 this February; the union disputes the figure, but no one disagrees that the unions have been losing members. As Election Day approached and polls started to show Walker with a solid lead, some Democrats increasingly tried to argue that the vote wasn't really a referendum on on Walker's reforms but rather about a host of more local issues. Don't be fooled: This recall was and is centrally about the public sector union fight, and it is important. Walker survived handily in the state that gave us one of the nation's legendary progressives, ""Fighting Bob"" La Follette, as well as the first public-sector, collective-bargaining agreement, and it is hard to deny that the nation is speaking. And with Walker surviving comfortably, a state that favored Barack Obama by 14 points in 2008 and seemed headed for the president's column again should turn deep purple. Opinion: In Wisconsin, deep anger isn't going away . The winds of change are blowing. Public employee unions have traditionally been well-regarded since they started up a half-century ago. A New York Times poll in February 2011 showed that a considerable majority still looks upon them with favor. But in recent years -- from ""rubber rooms"" for teachers who can't be fired in New York City to the prison workers unions in California that helped to drive prison spending to nearly the same level as all higher education in the state -- resentments have been stirring against the power and alleged abuses of public sector unions. Too often in the past, critics argue, governors and mayors have signed on to sweetheart pension and health care deals for the unions -- the same groups who helped them get elected. Now with huge bills mounting and governments broke, a backlash is growing, led by Republican governors. Gov. Chris Christie's dust-ups with the public sector unions in New Jersey have won no awards for congeniality, but he is pushing forward and his approval has recently been as high as 59%, an astounding number in a relatively blue state. Gov. Mitch Daniels in Indiana has also enjoyed public support for his efforts to trim union power. In Ohio, voters went the other way in a November 2011 referendum, rejecting Gov. John Kasich's public sector reforms. Some see the Wisconsin vote on Walker as a rubber match victory for the reform side; Walker himself has compared his efforts to Ronald Reagan's battle with the air traffic controllers -- a pivotal moment in Reagan's presidency. Republicans are not alone in this struggle. Notably, New York's Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, has been waging a vigorous campaign to reduce the state's financial commitments to union pension and health plans, and Gov. Jerry Brown has been forced in the same direction in California. Democratic mayors, such as Rahm Emanuel in Chicago, have charged forward, too. Clearly, many of the arguments against the public employee unions have great merit. Too often in the past, just as in the auto industry, management signed onto lavish deals underpinned by rosy economic scenarios that in today's environment just aren't affordable. Trims have to be made, starting with new employees. Among ardent school critics, it is now an article of faith that teachers' unions are also blocking serious progress in K-12 education; a film coming this fall, ""Won't Back Down,"" is much anticipated by people who want an overhaul of the system and who see it as a good depiction of the problem. But there is a difference between fixing what is broken in public employee unions and trying to destroy them. There was a time in our history when public unions were suspect -- Franklin D. Roosevelt himself once wrote that ""the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into public service."" In today's world, however, with growing inequalities in pay and business able to exercise so much power in politics, firefighters, police officers and teachers deserve a right to be represented, too. For those of us who support charter schools and other K-12 changes, it is equally important to recognize that engaging in all-out war with teachers' unions will wind up punishing children more than anyone else. However many charter schools there are, the fact will remain that the vast majority of lower-income students will be taught by teachers who belong to unions. And that will be true as far as the eye can see. It is far better to find ways to collaborate than to waste time in search and destroy. Emanuel is pointing the way forward in Chicago. He is cracking down on abuses -- a sanitation worker, for example, who was paid some $38,000 in the first four months of this year for overtime alone. But Emanuel is extending a hand, not a fist. ""I'm not looking to beat labor. I want them to be a partner in solving"" the city's problems, he told reporters. Walker's victory on Tuesday will galvanize those battling to curb the excesses of public employee unions. From them could come great progress -- as long as we don't forget to honor those who serve the public well. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the writers.","Wisconsin Gov.

"(CNN) -- McLaren's Lewis Hamilton set the pace in Friday practice ahead of his home British Grand Prix, on a day which saw heavy rain batter the Silverstone track and left organizers with a big headache. Hamilton's lap on one minute 56.345 seconds in the afternoon session was 0.129 seconds faster than that of Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi, after Romain Grosjean of Lotus went fastest in the morning. ""I had some fun out there today,"" the 27-year-old said in a McLaren statement. ""I got to do a good few laps too, which was good, because I was concerned that the fans wouldn't get to see much action. ""There were so many of them out there today. I can't remember seeing so many people at a racetrack on a Friday before -- it was incredible. British Formula One fans are the best in the world. ""I would like to have gone out and done even more laps -- but we simply didn't have enough tires to do that. Perhaps that's something we can look at for the future."" But those fans were told to stay away from the famous circuit Saturday if they had been planning to use public car parks. The downpours have left these areas flooded and Silverstone managing director Richard Phillips gave this warning. ""Tomorrow there will be 20,000 to 30,000 people we won't be able to properly cater for. ""It's going to cost us a lot of money. ""I unreservedly apologize to people. I feel very responsible for it, this is something I've been very proud of over the years and I almost could cry now."" Tires take center stage in Formula One . Over 40 millimeters of rain has fallen in 12 hours and made conditions treacherous for the drivers, with Bruno Senna smashing into the wall after losing control of his Williams midway through the second session. Two-time world champion and current title leader Fernando Alonso also lost his front wing after clipping the barriers. ""Unfortunately we didn't have a very productive day in the end,"" the 28-year-old Senna said in a Williams press release. ""The weather was poor weather with puddles on the track during second practice. On my second run, I aquaplaned on some deep water at the high speed Becketts section of the track and from that point I was a passenger until the car hit the wall. ""It was quite a heavy accident but I am ok. There is a lot of damage to the car but the Williams team will, I'm sure, do a great job of getting it back into shape for tomorrow (Saturday)."" Red Bull's reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, currently fourth in the 2012 standings, bemoaned the wet conditions. Regulations limiting the number of wet and intermediate tires teams can use combined with the weather meant most of the action was restricted to the second half of the afternoon session. ""If there's too much standing water on track we can't go out, as we aquaplane pretty quickly,"" Vettel, who finished second in last year's race, told the sport's official website. ""I think Senna went off and it shows how quickly it can happen. It's a real shame for the fans sitting in the grandstands waiting for the cars to come out. I feel for them. ""We got in a bit of running in the end, but for us it's not so useful, as you can't really try anything in these conditions. I think weather will be the most important factor in determining the rest of the weekend."" The teams will return to the track for practice and final qualifying Saturday ahead of Sunday's ninth grand prix of the year.","McLaren's Lewis Hamilton tops rain-soaked British GP practice .

"(CNN) -- Apple says it has fixed a glitch that was causing apps downloaded from its online store to crash this week. ""We had a temporary issue that began yesterday with a server that generated DRM code for some apps being downloaded,"" Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said. ""It affected a small number of users. The issue has been rectified and we don't expect it to occur again."" ""DRM"" stands for ""digital rights management,"" the system that gives a user access to copyrighted content. Users who had trouble launching an app can delete and download it again, Muller said. The problem came to light Wednesday when Marco Arment, the creator of mobile app Instapaper, blogged and tweeted that an update to that app was crashing and fading to black immediately after people downloaded it. He documented more than 100 apps that also appeared to be having the same problem, including ""Angry Birds,"" Huffington and GoodReader, before saying it was getting too hard to keep up with complaints that were coming in. In the interim, GoodReader had issued a 24-step procedure to work around the problem.

"Lake Mary, Florida (CNN) -- Shortly after joining the Lake Mary Police Department in 2007, Zach Hudson was dispatched to the home of two elderly women. What he saw left him appalled. The two women -- a mother in her 90s and a daughter in her 70s -- had no food and no electricity. Each month, they alternated what they spent their small amount of money on: One month it would be medicine, the next it would be food and bills. ""They were struggling horrifically,"" Hudson recalled. ""They had to cut their medications. They were doing the things that seniors often do to try to make up the financial difference."" In his 10 years as a Florida police officer, Hudson had witnessed countless senior citizens in tragic circumstances. But this was the last straw for him. ""I'd had enough,"" he said. ""And I realized that something had to be done. And that's when I started to conceptualize the Seniors Intervention Group."" Since 2009, Hudson's group has tended to the basic needs of nearly 1,000 seniors in Seminole County, Florida. With the help of hundreds of local volunteers, seniors are provided with essential assistance such as food, money, transportation, vehicle maintenance and help around the house. ""If you're 80 years old and you have to get up on a footstool to change your light bulb and you fall, it could kill you,"" said Hudson, 40. ""When it's 100 degrees outside and you're faced with either doing your yard or being fined, and you can't pay somebody to do it, what do you do? Well, you get out there and do it and suck it up, right? ""But sucking it up killed this (one) gentleman. A very kind elderly man walked outside to do his yard, and he didn't survive. And that's happening all the time."" Hudson said seniors facing diminished income in a difficult economy often have to make life-and-death choices for where and how to spend their money. For example, a light bulb that illuminates a doorway -- or a repair to a front door -- might easily fall below food and medicine on a senior's list of priorities and make them more vulnerable to crime. If a licensed worker is out of a senior's financial reach, they might be willing to pay cash to a stranger who knocks on their door offering to clean their yard or perform basic services. Too often, Hudson says, these strangers are not who they say they are. ""As cops and firefighters, we see people at their worst. That's just the way it is,"" Hudson said. ""And when you see seniors on a regular basis ... and they're constantly being scammed or victimized ... you start to ask yourself: 'Why? What can we do? I'm tired of walking away from this elderly person's house every day and not being able to fix the problem.' ... ""If you have a crime, then (police) can handle it. If you have a fire, the fire department can handle it. But what do you do when somebody can't pay their electric bill and, as a result, that won't run their oxygen pump? How do you deal with that?"" Forming the Seniors Intervention Group was a natural offshoot of Hudson's job as community relations officer for his department. The group became a nonprofit in early 2010, and it expanded to include the entire county this year. By partnering with faith-based organizations, local businesses and other nonprofits, the group can call upon hundreds of volunteers to make house calls. Seniors are either referred by local first responders or reach out for help directly. Assistance could be as minor as retrieving a pill that has fallen behind a piece of heavy furniture or as major as rebuilding a senior's home. All of the group's services are free and covered by private donations. About once every month, the group schedules a large ""operation"" in which dozens of volunteers descend upon a local neighborhood to do massive group service, such as yard cleanup or a sweeping installation of energy-efficient lighting. Hudson says this is often a great way to identify individuals who need more help. ""That operation ... always leads to finding other things, whether it's floor issues, window issues, (air conditioning) issues, whatever the case might be,"" he said. ""It's a neat opportunity for us to get on the ground, take a good look around and see how else we can help."" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . Hudson's dedication to public safety might not be unique among police officers, but his compassion for seniors is rooted in a more intimate history. He was raised primarily by his grandparents and great-grandmother in a senior community. ""Elderly people rescued me in a lot of ways,"" he said. ""They taught me respect. They taught me so many things. And this is simply an opportunity for me to give back to them in their time of need, because that time is here and it's now."" And it's something that is only going to get worse over the next 20 years, according to the Pew Research Center. Each day in the United States, about 10,000 Americans turn 65. By 2030, when all baby boomers will have passed the milestone, 18% of the nation's population will be at least that age, Pew projects. ""We need more organizations, more businesses, more churches, more police departments, more fire departments to get on board, see the big picture, see the problem,"" said Hudson, who hopes to see his nonprofit model replicated nationwide. ""This is just the beginning."" For seniors like Ralph Anderson, the group's efforts have been life-changing. The Vietnam veteran had worn a hole in his bathroom floor with his wheelchair, leaving him vulnerable to an accident. It was also difficult for Anderson to leave his home, so he had to often rely on other people to walk his dogs. But he was introduced to Hudson's group last month, and volunteers have since replaced and tiled his bathroom floor, fixed his leaky kitchen faucet and installed a wheelchair ramp at the front entrance of his home. ""It means the difference between feeling like I'm a burden on someone and being able to do something for myself,"" Anderson said. ""Since they're putting this little ramp (in), I can take the dogs out to walk them. I don't have to wait for someone to come help me."" Hudson says that helping Anderson and other seniors is a pleasure and a privilege. ""(This) is an opportunity for me to embrace the very people that embraced me growing up. ... This is my chance to take care of them as they have taken care of me."" Want to get involved?

"(CNN) -- Indonesia celebrated a unique birth this weekend in the form of a baby Sumatran rhino -- only the fifth known to have been born in captivity ever. The rare arrival took place at the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary in the Way Kambas National Park in Sumatra province, making Indonesia the third country to have successfully bred the species in captivity. There are less than 200 Sumatran rhinos remaining in the world, according to the International Rhino Foundation (IRF), making it the most endangered of all rhino species. Aside from a dozen or so in Malaysia's Sabah province, the Sumatran rhinos reside in three national parks in Indonesia. The critical endangered species is most threatened by poaching for its horns and destruction of its natural habitat. These factors have contributed to an estimated reduction in its numbers of more than 50% over the last two decades, the IRF said. The father of Indonesia's newborn calf is actually one of three Sumatran Rhinos bred in captivity at the Cincinnati Zoo in the United States. Andalus was born in 2001, some 112 years after the first known captive birth at Calcutta Zoo in India in 1889. Saturday's birth was welcomed by rhino conservationists, following two miscarriages by Andalas' partner, Ratu, since their pairing in 2009. ""It's really a big present for the Sumatran rhino breeding efforts as we know that this is a very rare species which have some difficulties in their reproduction,"" Masyhud, a forestry ministry spokesman, told reporters, in quotes carried by Agence France Presse.","Sumatran rhino born in Indonesia, the fifth known to have been born in captivity ever .

"(CNN) -- Saudi Arabia named Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz to be crown prince Monday, the state news agency reported, putting him next in line to the throne of the oil-rich kingdom. His appointment comes a day after burial services for Crown Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz, whose death was announced Saturday. Salman, 76, who was already defense minister, retains that post and becomes deputy prime minister as well, the Saudi Press Agency reported Monday, citing a royal order. He is a brother of the late King Fahd and Crown Prince Nayef, and a half-brother of King Abdullah. He became defense minister in November. Salman's official biography on the website of the kingdom's Interior Ministry says he had memorized the Quran by the age of 10. Nayef, a hard-line conservative credited with pushing back al Qaeda, was interior minister as well as crown prince. Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz is replacing him as interior minister, the Saudi Press Agency said. Nayef was named crown prince in October by his brother, the king. Saudi state TV, which reported his death Saturday, broadcast Quran readings as an expression of mourning for the prince, who died in Geneva, Switzerland. He was in his late 70s. ""It is a shock. We all knew his health was frail, but his death is a shock,"" Saudi Foreign Ministry spokesman Osama Nogali said. ""We still don't know the reason behind his death."" Abdullah attended the funeral, along with Gen. Hussein Tantawi, the head of Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces. U.S. President Barack Obama released a statement Saturday offering his condolences. ""Under his leadership, the United States and Saudi Arabia developed a strong and effective partnership in the fight against terrorism, one that has saved countless American and Saudi lives,"" he said. He praised Nayef for supporting a broad partnership between Saudi Arabia and the United States. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden similarly offered his condolences and hailed the former leader as an important ally in the fight against terror. Nayef had been Saudi interior minister since 1975, overseeing the kingdom's counterterrorism efforts. He also was deputy premier. A classified U.S. Embassy cable leaked by the website WikiLeaks described Nayef as a hard-line conservative who was lukewarm to King Abdullah's reform initiatives. Nayef led the crackdown against hard-line Islamists who took control of Mecca in 1979 and also oversaw the smashing of Saudi-based al Qaeda cells in the early 2000s. In recent years, his son, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, led the kingdom's fight against al Qaeda as the elder Nayef seemed to have taken more of a back seat. CNN's Nima Elbagir, Rima Maktabi, Hamdi Alkhshali, Mohammed Jamjoom, Caroline Faraj and Kevin Flower contributed to this report.","NEW: Salman bin Abdulaziz is a half-brother of King Abdullah .

Baseball fans also hear his voice as the lead-in of ""The Baseball Experience,"" a multimedia presentation at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, according to Beane's website. ""(Carl) adored the opportunity ... to contribute to the culture of Fenway Park, a place he loved passionately,"" Red Sox President and CEO Larry Lucchino said in the statement. Beane was driving his 2004 Suzuki when he suffered a heart attack, causing him to lose control of the car, according to the Red Sox statement. His vehicle then collided with a tree and a wall, authorities said. No one else was in the car and no other cars were involved in the accident. Beane was transported from the scene and pronounced dead at Harrington Hospital in Southbridge shortly after the crash, according to authorities. ""No one loved his role with the Red Sox more than Carl did his,"" Lucchino said. The Red Sox will hold a tribute to Beane at Fenway Park on Thursday before a game against the Cleveland Indians. ""All of Red Sox nation will remember his presence, his warmth, and his voice,"" Lucchino said.","Red Sox P.A. announcer Carl Beane's car crashed after he suffered a heart attack .

"(CNN) -- In 1922 a team of British explorers set off on a historic first attempt to climb the world's highest mountain. They never reached the top of Mount Everest, but their incredible feat of scaling within 2,000 feet of the summit was considered so groundbreaking they were each awarded an Olympic gold medal. Bowed but unbroken, climber Lt. Col. Edward Strutt made a pledge that at the very next opportunity one of the gold medals would be taken to the top of the world -- the summit his team never saw. Almost 90 years later, that dream is finally being realized as British climber Kenton Cool attempts to carry one of the medals to the peak of Mount Everest. CNN caught up with Kenton at base camp, where he is tweeting about his climb in real time. Follow Kenton's Samsung Olympic Games Pledge online . With less than 100 days until the London Olympics, it's a touching tribute to the British men who captured the nation's imagination. ""I have a picture at home of those 1922 expedition members and they were so famous back then,"" Kenton said. ""It was a bit like looking at a picture of the Manchester United football team. They were world-famous people yet they've been lost to history a little bit. I wanted to bring them back to the forefront of peoples' minds."" The team were forced to turn back after an avalanche killed seven Sherpas who were helping carry equipment. But International Olympic Committee founder Pierre de Coubertin -- often referred to as the ""grandfather of the modern Olympics"" -- still awarded 21 gold medals to the expedition. On being handed the 1924 Paris Olympic medals, second-in-command Strutt made his heartfelt pledge. But the vision was buried in the passage of time, and, as Cool points out: ""Then the war came along."" Cool, who has already scaled Everest nine times, hopes to reach the summit in mid-May. ""It's such a romantic, true story,"" he said. He admitted that even with his experience, Everest was still a ""beast"" to climb -- and a life-threatening one at that. ""Coming down is at least as dangerous if not more dangerous as going up. So the emotions will be welling up inside me and I know there will be a few tears,"" he said. ""Everest is a very different beast now to what it was in 1922. And of course we have all the knowledge of how to climb it. But it still doesn't take away from the fact that Everest is a very dangerous mountain. ""She's a very fickle person and if she wants to she'll change her outlook on things and she'll kill people just like that."" However, unlike the original explorers, Kenton will have the benefit of modern technology. Their feat is perhaps even more extraordinary considering the clunky oxygen tanks, woolen jackets and fur hats they had for survival. Crucially, in one of the most brutal environments on earth, none of these garments were waterproof. ""Today we get Internet access, we can look at weather forecasts, weather patterns. We've got state-of-the-art technology when it comes to clothing, titanium oxygen tanks, to super lightweight boots,"" Cool said. ""As soon as you get above 7,000 or 8,000 feet you enter the death zone. It's a ticking time bomb. You've got a limited amount of time which the human body can survive up there, so yes things are stacked more in our favor now than in 1922 but it's still a mountain which deserves an awful lot of respect."" Glyn Hughes, honorary archivist at Britain's Alpine Club, has kept extensive records of the 1922 expedition. ""They were as prepared as their knowledge at the time allowed them to be, but that knowledge was extremely limited in a lot of areas,"" he told CNN. ""They were very well provisioned. They had wonderfully rich foods, nothing like you have now when you go climbing -- very heavy, very rich and totally inappropriate."" Despite the original adventure receiving worldwide acclaim, Glyn said it was a gallant failure, with the death of the Sherpas casting a shadow over the expedition. ""There's actually a lot of guilt because porters were killed but none of the climbing members were,"" he said. ""A number of them said they felt dreadful about this. They would have felt better if at least one of them had died with the porters."" Kelly Morsehead, the great-granddaughter of one of the original climbers, will be following Kenton's challenge closely. Henry Morsehead had tried to scale the mountain without oxygen, but eventually had to stop his climb due to frostbite. He never received his gold medal after it was lost in the post. ""To even attempt such a feat is complete madness. As the famous words go, they wanted to climb Everest because it was there. That is what they said was their mission, which is absolutely baffling and awe inspiring,"" Kelly said. ""It's a chance for everything to come back together again. And to fulfill what's almost rightly theirs -- to get that final step with the medal being at the top of the summit.""","British climber Kenton Cool attempts to carry Olympic gold medal to Mt.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan's had enough of people's false accusations while she's trying to get her career back on track after five years of legal troubles, her publicist said Tuesday. ""We've reached a point where it's just not going to be tolerated anymore,"" Steve Honig said. ""People need to understand that there are consequences."" Lohan and her lawyer, Shawn Holley, will visit the Los Angeles County sheriff's West Hollywood substation Tuesday to request an investigation of Marisa Sullivan Dugas, the woman who accused Lohan of battery. ""There have been a few incidents like this within the last few months, and we've reached a point where it's just not going to be tolerated anymore,"" Honig said. ""People need to understand that there are consequences. You can't just make accusations, file false police reports, and expect you'll walk away from it and nothing's going to happen to you. This woman's going to learn a very tough lesson in these next few weeks."" Dugas said Lohan shoved her at the Standard Hotel's club Thursday night, but she did not file a criminal report with the sheriff until Saturday. ""It's egregious,"" Honig said. ""Lindsay wasn't even there. This is not something that's exaggerated. It's something that was completely fabricated."" Lohan was at home watching television at the time of the alleged nightclub scuffle, Honig said. ""If I was this young girl, I would be busy at work on some sort of an apology right now, and hoping that it was received,"" Honig said. Dugas, in a phone call with CNN on Tuesday, declined to talk about the case, although she said she was dying to tell her story. Honig accused Dugas of shopping her story around to media outlets before filing an official report. ""This is just another very unfortunate incident of someone trying to take advantage of Lindsay to get their 15 minutes of fame, and get some money out of it as well,"" he said. Dugas, who describes herself as ""a nice person,"" denies wanting money for interviews, although she said she's been offered ""a lot."" Sheriff's Sgt. Chris Bowman said Monday that a detective has the battery report and would check the story's validity. ""It's just an allegation,"" Bowman said. The allegation comes less than two weeks after Lohan's supervised probation came to an end. She's no longer under the threat that any criminal complaint could become a probation violation leading to jail time. But bad news coverage could reinforce concerns that film and TV producers have about hiring Lohan for projects at a time that she's trying to prove she's dependable and ready to stay out of trouble. Lohan is preparing to portray Elizabeth Taylor in a Lifetime movie, which starts filming next month. She also has a role in an upcoming episode of the hit Fox TV show ""Glee."" A judge warned her last month that avoiding future trouble could be a challenge. ""I know it's hard when people are following you all over the place, but that's the life you chose,"" Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephanie Sautner told Lohan, advising her to ""live your life in a more mature way, stop the nightclubbing and focus on your work."" Her recent hosting job on NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" earned high ratings, and her photo spread in Playboy's January issue set sales records for the magazine. CNN's Jane Caffrey and Douglas Hyde contributed to this report.","NEW: ""It's just not going to be tolerated anymore,"" Lohan publicist says .

"(CNN) -- Diplomats sought new ways to forge peace in Syria on Friday as the killings continued in the restive land. Kofi Annan, the special envoy to Syria for the Arab League and the United Nations, urged countries to use their pull on the combatants to stop the fighting. He is also planning an international meeting to discuss next steps on Syria. ""It is time for countries of influence to raise the level of pressure on the parties on the ground and to persuade them that it is in their interest to stop the killing and start talking,"" Annan said in Geneva, Switzerland. ""I urge all parties to heed the call for a cessation of violence in all its forms, first and foremost for the sake of the Syrian people, the children and women in particular. I think they have suffered for far too long and continue to suffer. But if our efforts are to succeed, we shall need the united and sustained support of the international community. This is essential."" The diplomatic wrangling comes as violence continues to rage across the country. Since the uprising began in March 2011, violence has killed more than 15,000 people in Syria, mostly civilians, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The United Nations has said that at least 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict. At least 128 people died Thursday in one of the deadliest days of the 15-month conflict, and another 87 deaths have been recorded Friday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees said. Thirteen people died in Homs, 11 in Aleppo and 10 in the Damascus suburbs. The Local Coordination Committees said that more than 10 massacres have occurred in the past few days, including recent ones in Inkhel and Douma. News also emerged Friday of a recent mass killing and constant shelling in Daret Azza, in Aleppo province. Syrian state-run TV says ""armed terrorist gangs"" kidnapped ""innocent civilians"" and ""desecrated their bodies,"" an act it describes as a ""barbaric massacre"" in the area. It said that more than 25 people have been killed. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said 26 people shot and killed in the area were members of a pro-government militia called the Shabiha, who are themselves blamed for killings of civilians. Syria consistently blames terrorists for the violence. Opposition groups say the violence began when a government crackdown on peaceful protesters generated a nationwide uprising. CNN cannot confirm specific reports of violence in Syria because the government has restricted access to the country by international journalists. Annan and Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the head of the suspended U.N. observer mission in Syria, described a bleak scenario to reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. Annan said that in the past few days, he has been in ""intensive consultations with a number of ministers and officials in capitals around the world about the possibility of convening a meeting of ministers to discuss what further actions could be taken to implement the Security Council resolutions."" ""We can not just step back and do nothing, and this is why I say, if we have alternatives, let's go with it,"" Annan said. Annan favors the inclusion of Iran in such a meeting. ""The composition of the group will be such that I hope that apart from Security Council members, the permanent members of the Security Council, it will include governments and countries with influence on one or the other parties, coming together and deciding that they will cooperate and work together, realizing that it is only when the international community comes together and sustains its pressure and effort that we get results. Today, honestly speaking, that is not happening,"" he said. Annan was asked what actions he would like to see taken at the upcoming conference. ""We either have to find ways of getting the plan implemented, if we think it is still worthwhile pursuing it, and if the plan is not worthwhile, what other options are we going to look at and begin to take a look at them,"" he said. ""There may be recommendations emanating from the group that the council would want to act on, but they as a group will not take that kind of decisions. I hope they will decide to use their collective influence on the parties to push them in the right direction as well as perhaps coming up with ideas that the council can work on."" Both men discussed the deteriorating humanitarian situation. Annan said that up to 1.5 million people are affected somehow by the warfare. He said that at least 92,000 people have fled to other countries in the region. Mood said the ""level of destruction"" is massive in violence-stricken flashpoints, such as neighborhoods in Homs, Daraa and Hama. ""I am also particularly concerned about the continued military occupation of hospitals, health facilities and schools, also preventing access to medical attention for those in need. Which means the need for the humanitarian response plan to be effective and the scale of rebuilding and reconstruction that is before us once there is a cessation of violence is enormous,"" he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said one of its teams tried to enter neighborhoods in Homs to help people caught in the crossfire, but Mood said ""civilians continue to be trapped in the line of fire."" ""There is a need to call on all parties when they are pursuing their objectives by military means to distinguish very clearly between civilians and combatants. It is not always easy. And all parties must abide by the obligation to keep civilians out of harm's way. And obviously it is the government that has the primary responsibility to civilian populations to protect them from all forms of violence. The latest attempts by the (Syrian Arab Red Crescent) and the ICRC to have a breakthrough related to evacuating the civilians -- children, women, elderly -- out of Homs have regrettably not yet succeeded,"" Mood said. Mood has been leading a mission to monitor what is a failed cease-fire and the government's adherence to a six-point peace plan that has not taken hold. But the mission had to be suspended because of rising violence. He said the observers are still in Syria and are conducting administrative activities. The Local Coordination Committees said that more than 3,600 people have died since the Annan plan began this year. ""The observers in Syria, at the moment, they are mainly in their team sites and at headquarters,"" Mood said. ""That does not mean that we are doing nothing. It means that, from their team sites, they have view of surrounding areas, the cities. We are also continuing the engagement by telephone with the different parties, and we also have some patrols going to local hospitals and assessing the situation. So the normal administrative activities are ongoing, but patrols and exploring new areas and going into new projects is not on the agenda while the activities are suspended. Obviously, given the fact that the mandate is for 90 days and that it doesn't expire until the 20th of July, my focus is to be able to continue to implement the mandated tasks as soon as the situation allows. And a less risky level of violence makes that possible."" Annan said the observers are ""keen to resume their work."" ""In the short time that they have been there, they have engaged not just with the parties but with communities at all levels of society in the cities and towns where they have been deployed,"" Annan said. ""Their commitment to the Syrian people has not faltered. But the circumstances must allow them to do their work. And we all know that they are unarmed men and women who are doing courageous work."" Annan hasn't lost hope about the mission. He said he's seen other situations where plans are implemented and progress is reached after long delays. ""I have seen situations where plans have not been implemented for a while, and then suddenly there are shifts, shifts take place on the ground in strategic alliances, and you can see progress. And I hope we can see some of the positive shifts in positions of government, their willingness to pressure, or to take certain actions to give us movement,"" he said. Annan was asked when he'll know the crisis will spiral out of control. ""If it does continue to escalate, there will come a moment when not only the U.N. but everybody will see very clearly that the situation is not sustainable, is not controllable and is beyond control of everyone. And we don't want to get there. his is why we are trying to press and push to see if we can get the parties to take steps to end the violence before we get to that stage. I don't think we are there yet, but we may not be far from there."" Meanwhile, Russia's foreign minister says Syrian leaders are ready to work with the rebels to synchronize a pullout of forces. Russia is a friend of Syria's, and world powers believe that it has tremendous pull with President Bashar al-Assad's regime. ""Among the most important positions in our vision for the forthcoming conference on Syria is that the government forces and armed forces of the opposition should make a synchronized withdrawal of forces from towns and centers of population under control of international observers. The Syrian government has told me today they are ready to do this,"" Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told Rossiya 24 TV. ""It's now important that the other side gets ready for the move and that the U.N. mission in Syria draws up the necessary (withdrawal) plans and pursue their implementation."" Russia has no plans to send naval forces to Syria with soldiers on board, Lavrov said Friday in response to recent media reports. .

"(CNN) -- It's not as futuristic as greenhouses on Mars, but farmers on terra firma are using space-based technology to certify organic crops. Satellites have been used to prove that crops were fertilizer-free in a year-long project by Ecocert, one of Europe's leading organic certification agencies, and the European Space Agency. Instead of just detailed overhead photos, infra-red and thermal images and other data was collected and deciphered to gain a ""spectral signature"" of the crops and soil. From that Ecocert say they can determine if a plant is organically-grown or not. The trials proved over 80% successful, according to Dr Pierre Ott of Ecocert ,and compared to physically going to fields to collect, test and certify them, much more time effective. While the technology for organic certification needs to be improved -- the Ecocert test only worked on wheat and corn grown in large fields -- satellites are already sweeping huge swathes of the world's arable land. From Californian vineyards and Chinese rice fields to Colombian coffee plantations and Kenyan crops, satellites imagery is being used to monitor land and water use and promote environmental protection. ""Satellites have become commonplace in agriculture,"" says Geoff Wade, director of natural resource industries for global information software company ESRI. Originally used to calculate subsidies owed to farmers in the European Union, the technology has developed at a rapid pace. ""They are so good now,"" says Wade ""In the last few years six-inch imagery is commonplace. The level of detail of six-inch imagery on a field is incredible. People can genuinely use satellite imagery to fertilize correctly, or manage water stress."" Through software developed by ESRI and applied by eLeaf, a company that supplies data on water use and vegetation, individual farmers and small-holders are able to get the benefit of the precise information about the state of their crops. In an ongoing eLeaf project, funded by the International Fund for Agricultural Development, farmers in Ethiopia, Sudan and Kenya are sent a text message on when to irrigate or fertilize crops. Another project to promote environmental protection in South Africa measured the water consumption of natural vegetation compared to invasive species and agriculture for food production. While the satellites and information technology are hugely expensive the cost of the information to the end users and farmers is not. ""Depending on the resolution of the images, it can be anything from a few cents to a few euros per hectare,"" says Patrick Sheridan of eLeaf . There is still some way to go before satellites can take the place of farmers and be used to totally manage crops, water supplies and tell the difference between organic and non-organic crops. The main obstacles to better and cheaper data are improving the resolution of images so more crops in smaller spaces can be analyzed, plus the revisit times of the satellites. ""But it's still really good,"" enthuses Wade. ""You'd need lots of people to visit crops every week to do what a satellite can do."" For Sheridan the biggest role satellite geo-information will have in the future is in providing data on water conservation and management. ""In a few years, we'll have nine billion people living on this earth and in a lot of regions water is already scarce, but in about 50% of these people will live in water stress positions. We can tell governments 'Are you doing ok?' (in water management) or is there room for improvement, and that is really in quite high demand.""","Satellites used to certify organic crops in Europe in pilot project .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of years after the first athletes competed at the ancient stadium in Greece, a high priestess swathed in white lit a flame from the sun to mark the start of a new Olympiad on Thursday. The Olympics are as much about tradition and legacy as they are sporting events, with none so vivid as the lighting of the torch which will now wind its way from Olympia to the Games in London. The solemn ceremony, held in the ruins of the 2,600-year-old Temple of Hera, saw actors in ancient Greek costume use a mirror to harness the sun's rays and light the Olympic torch. It marks the start of the flame's week-long journey to Britain, where it will begin an 8,000-mile (12,875-kilometer) route across the country before entering at the new stadium in east London. Taking center stage in the lighting ceremony was Greek actress Ino Menegaki as the traditional high priestess. Among the dignitaries present were International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge and London organizing committee chairman Sebastian Coe. The first relay runner to take the flame was Greece's Liverpool-born open water swimming champion Spyros Gianniotis. He then passed it to 19-year-old British boxer Alexander Loukos, who grew up in east London where the Olympic Stadium is now situated, but whose father hails from Greece. Making its way to Britain, the flame will first take in Greek archaeological sites including the Acropolis and Olympic Stadium in Athens, site of the first modern Games in 1896. Arriving on May 19 at Land's End in the far southwest of England, it will then wind its way through 1,019 communities, carried by 8,000 torch-bearers. The final leg will run from Hampton Court Palace, the former home of King Henry VIII, before arriving at the opening ceremony on July 27. The flame will burn until the Games end on August 12 -- a tradition that was revived at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.","Actors dressed in ancient Greek costumes light the Olympic torch at original stadium .

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic has pulled out of the hometown tennis tournament run by his family, following the devastating death of his grandfather. The world No. 1 said he was too emotionally drained to defend his Serbia Open title next week after losing his grandfather Vladimir last Thursday. The 24-year-old, who has won two out of the three tournaments held in Belgrade, made the difficult decision not to defend his title after consulting with family. ""I will take some time, try to restore my emotional energy,"" he said. ""This is certainly one of the toughest decisions in my career, but it is impossible for me to play in the next few days and to think about tennis, when there are some other things in my head."" Djokovic: My late grandfather is with me in spirit . The clay-court tournament, to be held from April 30 to May 6, was founded by Djokovic's family in 2009. They purchased the ATP Tour license from the Dutch Open and worked hard to gain government support for the country's first professional tennis tournament, which is run by Djokovic's uncle Goran. Novak won the Belgrade event in its opening year and says on his website it is the most cherished title in a stellar career that now includes five grand slam wins. He will take a breather from competing for the first time since hearing the news of his grandfather's death, having suffered a brutal straight-sets defeat to Rafael Nadal in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters on Sunday. The Spaniard claimed his eighth straight title at the tournament, ending a run of seven defeats in finals to the man who replaced him at the top of the world rankings, including January's record-breaking six-hour epic at the Australian Open.

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams fended off a stirring fightback from Agnieszka Radwanska to win her fifth Wimbledon singles title with a 6-1 5-7 6-2 victory Saturday. It was the 30-year-old American's 14th grand slam crown and her first since winning at the All England Club in 2010, but Poland's Radwanska made her fight every inch of the way. Suffering from a respiratory problem and trailing after a one-sided first set, Radwanska recovered from a break down in the second to give Williams a real Centre Court scare. After leveling at one set all, Radwanska took a 2-1 lead in the decider before Williams romped to victory with a run of five straight games. She celebrated by climbing into the players' box to embrace her sister Venus and other close connections including her physiotherapist Esther Lee. Williams spent almost a year on the sidelines, being struck by first injury then serious illness after being laid low by dangerous blood clots. Historic victories, crushing defeats at Wimbledon . A visibly emotional Williams showed how much victory meant to her in her post-match interview. ""I can't describe it. I almost didn't make it a few years ago. I was in hospital and I thought I'd never be here again, so this makes it so worth it,"" she said. ""It's all the sweeter. I was so down but you never give up. You have to continue,"" she added. Williams has capped her steady return to the top with an emphatic performance on the grass courts, particularly since the quarterfinals where she dispatched reigning champion Petra Kvitova. A semifinal win over Victoria Azarenka of the Belarus took Williams into the final, but Azarenka will have the consolation of going to the top of the new world rankings Monday. Radwanska will rise to number two off the back of her fine run and has enhanced her growing reputation. ""I am very proud to have got to the final. I am still shaking but I tried, it just wasn't my day,"" the 23-year-old told BBC Sport. ""I have been unlucky here, playing in the wind and the rain, but I still played some great matches."" Williams, who wins $1.78 million, is the first woman over 30 to win Wimbledon since Martina Navratilova in 1990 and has now matched the Wimbledon singles tally of her elder sister Venus. They later paired up to win their fifth Wimbledon women's doubles title, beating Czech duo Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka, 7-5 6-4. The match finished under the lights just before 2300 local time and set the seal on a triumphant day for Serena. She will now look to do the double again at the London Olympics which begin later this month at Wimbledon. The intervening match on Centre Court saw unseeded pair Britain's Jonny Marray and Denmark's Freddie Nielsen beat Sweden's Robert Lindstedt and Romania's Horia Tecau 4-6 6-4 7-6 6-7 6-3 in a thrilling men's doubles final. Marray, 31, is the first Briton since 1936 to win that title at Wimbledon, an omen perhaps for Andy Murray, who is attempting the same record in terms of years in the men's singles final against Roger Federer Sunday.","Serena Williams wins fifth Wimbledon crown .

"(CNN) -- The Dalai Lama says he supports the principles behind Arab Spring protests. ""The world belongs to humanity, not this leader, that leader, kings or religious leaders. The world belongs to humanity. Each country belongs essentially to their own people,"" he said in an interview Wednesday on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" Politicians at times forget that, even in democratic countries like the United States, he said. ""Sometimes they are short-sighted,"" he said. ""They are mainly looking for the next vote."" When asked about the Arab Spring, the exiled Tibetan leader said he thought it was ""in principle, very good."" ""Now they achieved the basic goal, now time come they must be united, all forces, no matter what their political thinking or something, now they must work together, that is very important,"" he said. In a wide-ranging interview, the Dalai Lama discussed his thoughts about topics ranging from China's changing political landscape to whether he is tempted by women. The Dalai Lama is the traditional religious and temporal head of Tibetan Buddhists. He was made head of state at age 15 in 1950, the same year that Chinese troops occupied Tibet, enforcing what Beijing says is a centuries-old claim over the region. The Dalai Lama held negotiations with Chinese officials on Tibetan self-rule with little success. In 1959, he fled Tibet for exile in India after a failed uprising against Beijing's rule. As China has deepened its economic, political and cultural influence in Tibet, the Dalai Lama has acknowledged that full independence is no longer realistic. But he has continued to advocate greater rights for Tibetans. In Wednesday's interview, he said that the dozens of reported self-immolations by Tibetans living under Chinese rule in recent months are ""extremely sad."" The Dalai Lama, who last year stepped down from his political responsibilities with the Tibetan exile movement, said Chinese leaders needed to think ""more realistically"" in order to resolve the problems in Tibet and other restive parts of the country. And he called for an end to censorship in China. ""Chinese people also have the ability to judge what's right or what's wrong. ... Chinese people should know the reality,"" he said. But the spiritual leader also showed a lighter side. Even though he's taken a vow of celibacy, the Dalai Lama said he still feels temptation when he sees women. ""Oh yes, sometimes (I) see people (and think) oh, this is very nice,"" he said. But even in his dreams, he said, he reminds himself of his spiritual role. ""I'm Dalai Lama. I always remember, I am monk, I am always monk,"" he said. He said he doesn't watch movies or listen to music, has never taken drugs and doesn't drink. But he recalled one time when he tasted wine. ""I was very young, I think 7, 8 years, very young. One evening, late evening, I'm just playing. Then one person I see carrying two bottles, and I immediately run to him. And then, my finger, (I) put (it) in the bottle. Very sweet,"" he said, laughing. When asked what world leaders he admired, he mentioned former South African President Nelson Mandela. He also praised former U.S. President George W. Bush, even though he didn't always agree with his policies. ""Not as a president of America. Some of his policies may not be very successful,"" the Dalai Lama said. ""But as a person, as a human being, very nice person. I love him."" CNN's Paul Armstrong contributed to this report.

"London (CNN) -- Building a home with a floor beneath ground on a plot next to a flood-prone river might seem like a recipe for disaster. But not when it's designed to float. The ""amphibious house"" was recently granted planning permission for construction on a island on the River Thames in Marlow -- a small town 35 miles west of London. The upper part of the house is constructed from lightweight timber, according to its creators Baca Architects, while a concrete basement level sits inside a ""wet dock"" consisting of a base slab and four retaining walls. Should the worst happen the house turns into a ""free-floating pontoon"" with vertical guideposts running up the building's exterior preventing it from drifting off downstream.

A terraced garden will also surround the property encouraging incremental flooding while also helping manage run-off when water levels start to subside. Richard Coutts, director of Baca Architects said in a statement: ""From the outset, we sought the expert advice of the (UK) Environment Agency to determine the most appropriate construction model to mitigate flood risk on the site and provide a safe dwelling, sympathetic to its setting and fit for the challenges of the 21st century. ""Amphibious design is one of a host of solutions that can enable residents to live safely and to adapt to the challenges of climate change,"" he added.","Plans for amphibious home on banks of UK's River Thames gets planning consent .
