"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . Plastic microbeads found in facial scrubs and toothpastes could be gone within two years. The NSW government has called for all microbeads to be removed from personal care products sold in Australia by 2016. During the release of a health review into Sydney Harbour, New South Wales Environment Minister Rob Stokes urged the beauty and personal care industry to phase out the pollutants. The NSW government has called for a nationwide ban on microbeads found in beauty products . The microbeads are small enough to bypass the sewerage system and pose a danger to seabirds and sealife who confuse the beads for food. 'These microplastics are already having an impact on our marine environment,' Mr Stokes said. The call came from State Environment Minister Rob Stokes when he presented a health report into the harbour . 'We need to address this looming environmental issue...we know it has potential health concerns.' The Sydney Institute of Marine Science identified microplastics and flame retardants as an 'emerging contaminant' but said its effect on the harbour had not been assessed. 'Studies that identified potential threats from emerging contaminants, quantified stormwater impacts on ecosystem function and identified safe and efficient means for restoring or remediating historically polluted sediments would be immediately useful to harbour management,' it said. The team behind the report found microbeads at the bottom of the harbour for the first time, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. These particles are appearing in higher levels than initially thought by the researchers. An industry working group will convene in the coming weeks with the aim of voluntarily phasing out the pollutant, following similar actions overseas. The team behind the report found microbeads at the bottom of the harbour for the first time . The microbeads have been banned from products in the United States in the state of New York, and it is a growing concern in the United Kingdom. When ingested by tuna, mussels, crabs and other fish, they could pass on the potentially harmful chemicals to humans. The report also identified the impacts of urban run-offf and storm water drains also needed to be examined.","Environment Rob Stokes called for a ban within two years on Thursday .

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . Consumer advocacy group Choice are leading the charge against the Federal Government's controversial internet filter proposal by producing a crowd-funded advertisement mocking it. Through the proposal, the government hopes to stem the tide of music and movie piracy. Choice's satirical advertisement features a fictitious Minister for the Internet launching his hand-made internet filter. Scroll down for video . Choice have released a satirical advertisement mocking the government's internet filter proposal . In the 30-second video, the minister sits behind his desk with the poorly built filter on his desk and a framed photo of Queen Elizabeth II perched on a bookshelf behind him. With Australia's national anthem swelling, he attempts to deliver his rehearsed lines about the benefits of the filter but fails to do so while it continuously falls apart on him. 'Your government has come up with a fool-proof plan to stop internet piracy,' the Minister for the Internet says. 'Every connection in Australia will be fixed with one of these. 'The increased price we all pay for the internet will be worth it for this 100 per cent effective solution.' It features a fictitious Minister for the Internet who introduces a dodgy, hand-made internet filter to viewers . During the minister's speech, a part of the internet filter falls off. At the end of Choice's video, it urges people to log on to the group's website to sign a petition against the filter. The 30-second video is part of a campaign Choice is leading against the proposal, which they believe would make the internet more expensive without effectively addressing piracy. 'We believe the government has its policy settings wrong when it comes to combating online copyright infringement,' CHOICE campaigns manager Erin Turner said. Choice campaigns manager Erin Turner said the consumer advocacy group does not believe introducing the filter will reduce internet piracy . 'Australians are frustrated with not being able to access and pay for timely and affordable content. 'It’s this frustration that is driving some consumers to seek a better deal on legitimate overseas sites like Netflix, and unfortunately driving others to illegal downloading.' Ms Turner pointed to other countries as examples of expensive models that were not 'meaningfully addressing the problem'. 'Forcing Internet Service Providers to monitor and prevent copyright infringement through the use of an internet filter is not the answer,' Ms Turner said. 'Looking at international examples, we know that the policies proposed are high-cost with low results. 'Policies like this in France and New Zealand have cost significant amounts of money. 'Our fear is that a high-cost system will lead to all consumers paying more for the internet, without meaningfully addressing the problem.' The advertisement coincides with a review of the government's competition policy due out late this year where Choice detailed new evidence of the artificially high prices Australians pay for identical goods and services purchased from identical websites. In the 30-second ad, the filter is seen breaking apart while the fake minister gives a rehearsed speech about its benefits . This included paying 33 per cent more than U.S. consumers for the top 10 new release movies in Apple’s iTunes store. The latest Choice research came on the back of a comprehensive submission to the IT pricing Inquiry in 2012, which detailed more than 200 examples of hefty mark-ups Australia pay on popular digital products. Ms Turner said the solution to the piracy issue lay in removing the barriers that restricted Australians from purchasing legitimate content from the global market. 'We should be using the pressure of genuine competition to deliver more timely and affordable content to local consumers, not punishing Australians and entrenching outdated business models,' she said.","The ad is part of the consumer advocacy group's campaign against the internet filter .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A drunken homophobic thug splashed a noxious fluid over six strangers during a horrific attack outside a gay nightclub, a court heard today. Jonathan Lynn, 31,  emptied the contents of an Evian bottle over a group of young gay friends just after 4am in Vauxhall, south London. It left his victims fearing they were blinded and disfigured for life. He pleaded guilty at Inner London Crown Court to assaulting the four, causing three of them actual bodily harm, outside the Lightbox nightclub on June 7 and possessing an offensive weapon, namely a noxious fluid. Jonathan Lynn, caught on CCTV outside the Lightbox club, Vauxhall, where he attacked a group of revellers Inner London Crown Court . He also admitted assaulting a woman passer-by, twenty-something Melissa Thompson, who was also splashed in the eyes and twenty minutes later, Ashgar Jafi, also in his 20's, who was sprayed with the liquid after the defendant stepped on his foot as he waited in the nightclub queue. Model Parish Frith, 23, was involved in a verbal exchange with Lynn at 4.27am after the victim approached two girls outside the club and was challenged by the defendant. Lynn, of Worcester Park, south-west London, said: 'This is my bird.' But they were, in fact, strangers, who did not know Lynn and one girl told the victim: 'We don't really get on with gays. F*** off.' He was splashed with the contents of the bottle along with his friends, Benjamin Moore, 21, and Yousef Khan and Ryan Cleary, also aged in their early twenties. 'The defendant has carried out a serious unprovoked homophobic assault on gay men,' explained prosecutor James Keeley. 'Mr Frith replied that he was not interested in women and that he was gay.' Lynn, from south-west London, was remanded in custody until Thursday when he will be sentenced . Lynn replied: 'We don't like gays,' and as Mr. Frith walked away shouted: 'Oi! Come here.' 'The defendant called Mr Frith back and as he approached he was at arm's length distance when the defendant produced a bottle and splashed the contents in Mr Frith's face, which went into his eyes, nose, mouth and throat,' explained Mr. Keeley. 'He said it tasted disgusting, he was inhaling fumes, couldn't breath and felt his face was burning and melting. He did not know if he was going to die or end up with no face.' Mr Frith suffered painful ulcers to his tongue and to the back of his throat and a month later had no sense of taste and difficulty eating and continues to take anti-depressants to deal with his loss of self-worth. Lynn pleaded guilty at Inner London Crown Court (pictured) to assaulting the four, causing three of them actual bodily harm . His friend Mr Moore also suffered injuries. 'The liquid hit Mr Moore full in the face, it went into his eyes, he panicked, his eyes were streaming and his face felt like it was on fire. 'He describes it as the worst moment of his life,' said Mr Keeley, adding the young man was left with an ulcer in the cornea of his left eye and continues to receive treatment at Moorfields Eye Hospital for blurred vision and burns in his cornea. 'The liquid went into Mr Khan's face and eyes. It was burning the right side of his face. Mr Khan believes this was a homophobic attack on him and his friends.' The asthmatic victim did not seek medical treatment as he tried unsuccessfully to keep his sexuality a secret from his family, who he now feels have 'disowned him'. The fourth friend was the subject of the less serious charge of common assault. 'A small amount of fluid hit Mr Cleary's eye. It stung Mr Cleary's eye. The defendant is described as vicious in his actions in that he wanted to hurt both men and then walked away with no remorse.' Passer-by Miss Thompson was leaving the club at the time. 'She felt a splash in her right eye and felt pain in the back of her left eye. She was panicking and thought she was going blind.' Mr Jafi had a verbal exchange with Lynn after the defendant stepped on his foot twenty minutes later. 'The defendant sprayed him in the face with the contents of what looked like a Sprite bottle.' Lynn, who has served time for robbery and was on licence from prison at the time after receiving seven years in December, 2009 for possessing 1.5 kilos of cocaine and £30,000 in criminal property, was arrested in pub four days later. His lawyer Piers Mostyn told the court: 'He had previously been a victim of an attack in the area and took it with him for self-defence, a friend having left it at his address. He did not go out intending to use it. 'The defendant vehemently denies having any homophobic views and expressing those views. He was very drunk and remembers very little of what happened.' Lynn was remanded in custody until Thursday when he will be sentenced. Mr Frith told Evening Standard shortly after the attack: 'As we walked away I heard a man shout: ""Oi! Come here."" At first I thought it was the doorman saying he'd changed his mind and we could go in. 'Then I saw this white guy with a beard and his hand coming up with a water bottle and he squirted really hard into my face. It went straight into my eyes and it sprayed into my friend's mouth. 'My face was burning so much, I thought it was acid. I thought I would never see again and my face was melting. 'He poured every last drop onto us and then turned around and walked away, like it was mission accomplished. 'The chemical burnt the cornea in my left eye and the vision hasn't cleared since. The doctors said it should hopefully return, but there is no guarantee. 'My friend's tongue was swollen and it looked like someone had scratched part of it away. It was horrible.'","Jonathan Lynn, 31, emptied an Evian bottle over a group of  gay friends .

"By . Ellie Buchdahl . Fears of a neo-Nazi takeover have sparked a land war in a North Dakota town as residents say a hate crimes fugitive has launched a stealthy buy-up of properties. The mayor of Leith says residents of the 19-person town are demanding more information about Craig Cobb's recent investments in real estate. Craig Paul Cobb, 61, was arrested in 2010 in Canada on federal charges of willful promotion of hatred, has purchased 13 lots in the mostly abandoned Grant County town. Hate criminal: Craig Cobb was arrested in Canada in 2010 on federal charges of willful promotion of hatred . Residents claim they have proof that he plans to fill the town with other racists and haters. Cobb, who has been called one of the most extreme white supremacists and neo-Nazis in the country, has been living in a small house in Leith since he arrived in Grant County last year. Residents have known he was buying up other lots last year but say it was not until the past few days that they learned of his scheme to let people fly Nazi flags and target city elections with the aim of introducing racist, neo-Nazi laws. According to North Dakota daily newspaper The Bismarck Tribune, Cobb posted on the white supremacist website Vanguard News advertising the plots and inviting like-minded extremists to join him. The post read: 'A few well know (sic) WN (White Nationalists) know of this plan; fewer still know the exact place. Suffice to say, you could also make it into the Bakken area to go for a job there too. I want people to move now and quietly get going here without letting the cat out of the bag . 'I want people to move now and quietly . get going here without letting the cat out of the bag,' he wrote. In response, Leith residents are buying . up vacant lots to keep them out of Cobb's hands. Ghost town: The 19 residents of Leith now fear its small population make it the perfect target for an extremist hoping to set up a racist enclave . Cobb was arrested in 2010 in Canada on federal charges of willful promotion of hatred. He was living in Montana under dual citizenship until his arrival in Grant County. He began to buy properties from absentee owners for a few hundred dollars each. When county court employees asked Cobb why he was buying so many, incredibly Cobb said he was aiming to rename the town 'Cobbsville', according to Tax Director Muriel Ulrich. County records show that Cobb has since transferred ownership of two lots: one to Tom Metzger, a former grand dragon of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan in California, which founded the White Aryan Resistance, and another to Alex Linder, originator of the Vanguard News Network website. Mayor Ryan Schock said his phone has been 'ringing off the hook' since the paper broke the story on Wednesday night. 'Everybody’s wound up,' Mr Schock said. Concerns were raised when two men from Wisconsin arrived in Leith before dawn on Sunday to clear trees and do work on a run-down house Cobb had purchased. The men identified themselves to Grant County Sheriff Steve Bay as Michael Bencz and Tim Westergard on Sunday evening and weren't found to have any criminal warrants or apparent association with Cobb, the sheriff said. Bay said he was still investigating Bencz and Westergard and said he would be keeping a close watch on Leith. He said he had asked the Border Patrol for information, and had been told that Canadian authorities had no interest in extraditing Cobb on the hate crime charges. Fixer-upper: Michael Bencz said he saw Cobb's ad for a property in Leith and wanted to turn it into a home on the prairie rather than a racist's ranch . Speaking to the Bismarck Tribune, Bencz said he found Cobb's property on Craigslist and made a down payment on it because he was looking for a prairie home in a quiet and peaceful place. He denied any relationship with Cobb, or white nationalist beliefs. 'If he thinks he can do a conversion, he’s barking up the wrong tree,' he said. Cobb has not returned any phone calls or text messages to the cellphone number he posted on Craigslist with his Leith property listing. Mixed race couple Bobby and Sherrill Harper, who live in Leith, said they had already been vilified in a white activism Internet site . stormfront.org as a result of the Tribune story, with one writer saying, . 'A … race-mixing white woman like her has no place in a White nation.' Mrs Harper said: 'I'm not sorry it's out there. The more people who know, the better.' Mark Potok, an expert on extremism . and editor of the Intelligence Report and Hatewatch blog, a project of . the Alabama-based civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Center, . said people should be concerned. 'He's one of the most vicious neo-Nazi activists around,' Potok said. Potok said Cobb is trying to turn Leith into 'Pioneer Little Europe' - a concept used by white supremacists. Vacant lots: Cobb bought up 12 properties in Leith and advertised them on white supremacist sites . Others such as April Gaebe, who attempted to set up a white community in Kalispell, Montana, have tended to be thwarted far earlier. 'This is much further advanced than anything we've seen,' Potok said. Potok believes Cobb picked Leith because North Dakota is 90 percent white and Grant County is 97 percent white, according to the U.S. census. Other factors that make it attractive are cheap land, few people to stand up to a takeover and employment in the Bakken oil patch. 'Most of these guys don't have two dimes to rub together,' Potok said. 'He can't take away the community,' Potok said. 'People will resist this. My best guess is that it will fall apart as a result of being exposed.' Mrs Harper said she's learned a lot about extreme racism in just a few days and welcomed Potok's prediction. 'I can only hope that he's right,' she said.","Hate crimes fugitive Craig Cobb buys up 13 lots in Leith, North Dakota .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Two English schoolgirls thought to have been abducted by their Thai mother while on holiday, have been found safe after a three-month search. Annie and Alina Day, aged 11 and six, from Sevenoaks, Kent, disappeared after flying out to see their mother Onwarat Gamlem, 36, for a half-term holiday in Thailand. They were reported missing on June 1 when their mother failed to return them to their father, Robert Day, who was granted full custody in a 2010 divorce settlement. Annie and Alina Day, aged 11 and six, from Sevenoaks, Kent, disappeared in June after they flew out to see their mother Onwarat Gamlem. They have now been found safe and well . Miss Gamlem was arrested at a Bangkok apartment on Friday morning after a nationwide warrant was issued on charges of child abduction, according to Mr Day. He has been reunited with the girls and told Pattaya radio station Fabulous 103FM: 'I've got them. They're with me now.' Mr Day is said to be sorting out paperwork and attending meetings with lawyers in Thailand, and does not know when he will be returning to the UK with the children. His sister Charlotte Dillow said: 'Both of the girls have missed so much - the last few weeks of school were especially important for Annie as she is due to start her new secondary school in September. Robert Day pictured with his girlfriend (name unknown) and his two daughters. He has now been reunited with them after a three-month search in Thailand . The two English schoolgirls, thought to have been abducted by their mother (not shown) have been found . Police tracked down Onwarat Gamlem - formerly known as Wiganda Day and Onwarat Suphikunphong - on suspicion of abducting her daughters . 'She missed the leavers service and end of term celebrations, and sports day which they both would have loved taking part in.' Miss Gamlem vanished along with her two girls and three-year-old son from another relationship after apparently removing the SIM cards from their phones to avoid any possibility of tracing them. The girls' Grandmother Betty Day, 70, said: 'Robert went out on Sunday May 25 with both girls. 'They all do it once a year for two-and-a-half weeks during half-term. 'When they were married, she went and left and got a divorce and Robert got full custody. 'The girls were born in Thailand but they go to school here. Their whole life is in England and their mum didn't even want anything to do with them.' Numerous search attempts were made to find the sisters and in recent weeks, trucks holding billboards displaying their photos have been paraded through Pattaya daily with a loud speaker. They also played two songs - Ananya's favourite song, Beautiful Girl, and the well-known Santa Claus is Coming to Town, which Mr Day hoped would draw public attention. Police and Interpol tracked down Gamlem - formerly known as Wiganda Day and Onwarat Suphikunphong - on suspicion of abducting her daughters. The girls' school confirmed they had not been in lessons since before the start of the May half term. They are pupils at Sundridge and Brasted Church of England Primary School, in Sundridge, Kent.","Annie and Alina Day, aged 11 and six, disappeared during half-term holiday .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A stunning rural landscape hailed as one of the finest views in England by the National Trust could be ruined by a 242ft high wind turbine. The outlook from Creech Hill towards the imposing King Alfred's Tower on the Stourhead Estate has become an iconic image of the Somerset Levels. It features in the book 'England's 100 Best Views' and features Iron Age forts, a Roman temple and ancient woodlands. Mocked up plans for wind turbine on Gilcombe Farm. Right showing King Alfred's Tower, left is where the turbine could be . Under threat: Creech Hill lies seven miles to the north west of the Stourhead Estate, which is owned by the National Trust . But the skyline is under threat after plans were submitted for a towering turbine which would provide enough power for 400 local homes. The proposals come from Swansea-based firm Seren Energy run by Steve Hack,a Friends of the Earth board member. He admitted the site is contentious, but said the overall impact on the area will be minimal. 'As far as South Somerset is concerned there are relatively limited opportunities for turbines,' he said. 'But this is relatively simple as far as good conditions and delivery are concerned and there are not that many people who live very close to the site. The overall impact on the local population is going to be low.' But local residents and the National Trust fear the development will tarnish the treasured landscape. The view: King Alfred's Tower can be seen on the hill at Stourhead in the distance.  The turbine would appear to the left just of this image . Swansea-based Seren Energy have put in an application for the lone turbine, which is says will power 400 local homes . A National Trust spokesman said: 'Stourhead is an incredibly special place and we want to make sure its setting, the wider landscape and views, both to and from, are protected. 'We believe that appropriately designed wind has an important part to play in a mix of British renewables, but it must work in harmony with the landscape. 'We are now carefully considering this planning application and the scale and location of the proposed wind turbine.' Creech Hill lies seven miles to the north west of the Stourhead Estate, which is owned by the National Trust. King Alfred's Tower, also known as The Folly of King Alfred the Great or Stourton Tower, is a folly built in the 18th century that looks out over the Somerset Levels. It lies near the location of 'Egbert's stone' where it is believed that Alfred the Great, King of Wessex, rallied the Saxons in May 878 before the Battle of Ethandun. The tower was also intended to commemorate the end of the Seven Years' War against France and the accession of King George III. It was designed by Henry Flitcroft, a Palladian architect, in 1765 and completed in 1772. The tower was damaged in 1944 when an aeroplane, a Noorduyn Norseman, crashed into it, resulting in the death of the five aircrew. Then it was designated as a Grade I listed building before being restored in 1986. It is home to King Alfred's Tower - a 160ft tall folly tower marking the spot where King Alfred rallied the forces of Somerset, Dorset and Wiltshire, before his decisive defeat at the Battle of Edington in 878AD. It was erected in the mid 18th century by banker Henry Hoare II, then owner of the Stourhead estate, and dominates the landscape in the Cranborne Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In his book 'England's 100 Best Views', the National Trust's chairman Sir Simon Jenkins describes the vista from Creech Hill towards Stourhead as the best view of the Somerset Levels. He wrote: 'Creech Hill stands seven miles to the north and is closer to the Levels. It looks up to Stourhead behind it, and looks across to Cadbury to the left. 'It directly overlooks the golden limestone town of Bruton, deep in the Brue valley and with only its church and dovecot visible from a distance.' Seren Energy has submitted plans to South Somerset District Council to erect the turbine at Gilcombe Farm, a 300-acre family organic farm. But Dick Skidmore, a former Mendip District councillor now living at Bruton, is one of many locals who have written to the planning department to object. He believes the turbine will 'degrade a rural landscape particularly in a tourist area'. He is also worried that photographs submitted with the application were misleading and that the Ministry of Defence will insist on it having a warning light on top. Pen Selwood Parish Council has already raised its opposition to the turbine because of its proposed position in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. In a response to the application, it said: 'Whilst we are not sure this wind turbine will be visible from this parish, Pen Selwood Parish Council is opposed to all applications that could cause any detrimental effect upon the visual amenity of the village which is within an AONB.' It goes on to say: 'Concern has also been expressed that this development would set a precedent for other, similar, developments and that if we are not careful these structures could spring up throughout the area and would blight the countryside around us.' A decision from South Somerset District council is due on  September 19.","View from Creech Hill has become iconic image of the Somerset Levels .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . An enormous 18th century map of London which charts the rebirth of the city after it was rebuilt in the wake of the 1666 Great Fire has emerged for sale. The 13ft-wide map, which took almost a decade to complete, gives a fascinating insight into London on the cusp of its transformation into the greatest city in the world. It reveals how the city was tiny in comparison to the modern day equivalent, with the map revealing Buckingham Palace as a country estate surrounded by open fields while Hyde Park was on the very outskirts of the city. Fascinating: This huge 18th century map of London which charts the rebirth of the city after it was rebuilt in the wake of the 1666 Great Fire has emerged for sale . Historic: The fascinating map was created by 18th century cartographer John Rocque, and at the time was the most detailed map of London ever made, as well as being the first large-scale map of the city to be made after it was devastated by the fire . It also shows Tyburn, where Marble Arch now stands, the site of public executions in the city for 600 years, and details the Old Palace of Westminster, a medieval complex destroyed by fire in 1834. Unlike today, just two bridges are seen to span the Thames - Old London Bridge and Westminster Bridge. The fascinating map was created by 18th century cartographer John Rocque, and at the time was the most detailed map of London ever made, as well as being the first large-scale map of the city to be made after it was devastated by fire in 1666. Rocque, a Huguenot who had moved to England from France with his parents in 1709, began the painstaking project in 1737 and did not finish it until 1746. River crossings: The map shows how during the Georgian era there were just two bridges across the Thames - Westminster Bridge (left) and Old London Bridge (right) Multiplied: A look at a map from today shows how the two bridges have been joined by a further nine, making it easier for Londoners to cross the river . In detail: Westminster Bridge crosses to the old Palace of Westminster (left), destroyed by fire in 1834 and replaced by the Houses of Parliament we know today (right) It was created to a scale of one mile to 26 inches and made using a ground-level survey with the help of a compass and a chain, before the details were engraved onto  24 separate copper plates which were then coated in ink and pressed onto paper. The 6.5ft tall map provides a snapshot into what London looked like in the Georgian era and is now considered among the most important British maps ever made. 'You really have to stand in front of it to understand the scale of it - it is huge,' said Christie's map expert James Hyslop. 'It's basically the first large-scale map of London made after the Great Fire. Historically it's a really interesting snapshot of how Georgian London looked. The way things were: Buckingham Palace is shown on the map as a country estate surrounded by open fields . Official residence: Other buildings have crept closer to the home of the British monarchy, but the green spaces of Green Park and St James's Park remain . 'It is a wonderful document to study - Oxford Street has open fields to the north of it and there are dozens of boats on the Thames. It's amazing to see how far we have come in just a few hundred years. 'The scale is 26 inches to a mile so the level of detail is incredible. 'John Rocque was a Huguenot who came to London in the early 17th century and was a bit of a jack of all trades when it came to maps - he was a surveyor, publisher and engraver. 'This map was quite an expensive undertaking and took nine years to complete. It was far too big to print in one go and so it was made on 24 separately engraved plates.' Just a few hundred copies of the map were printed and only a handful are known to exist today. How things change: Covent Garden Market, as it appears on the 18th century map. The market had existed at the site since 1654 . Sprawling: The former fruit and vegetable market in the central square, which was reopened as a shopping complex in 1980 after the market's relocation in 1974, is now a popular shopping and tourist site . The map, titled 'A plan of the cities of London and Westminster and borough of Southwark' is tipped to be sold for £40,000 when it goes under the hammer at auction house Christie's after it was put up for sale by a private collector. Mr Hyslop said: 'This is one of the original editions of the print which would have been limited to the low hundreds. The survival rates are very low and there are a handful in institutions. 'When it was first printed it would have been in a gentleman's library and at some point over the years it has found its way to a private collector. Changes: Newly built Grosvenor Square is shown on the western edge of the city, before the open fields and market gardens of Hyde Park, here called Hide Park (left). The fields around the square have long since been replaced with homes and businesses, and the square is now the centre of the exclusive Mayfair district . Infamous: The site of the gallows at Tyburn, where public executions were held for 600 years (left), is now home to Marble Arch (right). The structure was originally built to stand at the entrance to Buckingham Palace, and was completed in 1833, but it was moved to its current location in 1851 . 'It has passed through the hands of many people but it is likely that it has always remained in London. 'The sheer size of this map combined with its incredible condition is what makes it so valuable. It really is impressive. 'This is one for someone who loves London and has a wall big enough to mount the map on. 'Anyone who sees this map is amazed by it. It is a beautiful work of art and a wonderful piece of history that tells the story of London almost 300 years ago.' Dedication: A scroll on the map  thanking the Mayor and Aldermen of the city for their help with John Rocque's epic cartographic undertaking .","Huge map of London is expected to be sold for £40,000 when it is sold at London auction house Christie's .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Four friends of Prince's Trust manager Nick Bonnie (pictured with his girlfriend Leah), who collapsed after taking ecstacy during a 'lad's weekend' away could face jail after admitting charges relating to his death . Four friends of a Prince's Trust manager who collapsed after taking ecstasy during a 'lad's weekend' away could face jail after admitting charges relating to his death. Nick Bonnie, who had worked for Prince Charles's young persons' charity for eight years, is believed to have swallowed a pill from what police described as a 'bad batch'. The 30-year-old from Stroud, Gloucestershire, and five of his friends were taken to hospital after becoming ill at the Warehouse Project nightclub in Manchester on September 27, last year. Mr Bonnie, who had attended one of the Queen’s garden parties at Buckingham Palace, was pronounced dead the following morning. His friends James Churchill, 30, Simon Lloyd-Jones, 29, Dean Neale, 30, and Paul Tabb, 31, all from Stroud, have admitted charges relating to the death. The group have been warned by a judge at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester they could be sent to prison when they are sentenced later in the year. Churchill admitted three charges of supplying controlled Class A drug MDMA, three allegations of supplying cocaine and  a charge of perverting the course of justice. Neale admitted one charge of possessing MDMA, possessing cocaine and perverting the course of justice by providing a false witness statement, while Lloyd-Jones has also admitted perverting the course of justice. Today, Tabb had been due to stand trial charged with perverting the course of justice but changed his plea to guilty. The particulars of the charge were that 'on September 27 with intent to pervert the course of justice by providing a false account to the police in relation to the incident concerning the supply of drugs to Nick Bonnie.' Facing jail: Simon Lloyd-Jones, 29 (left) has admitted perverting the course of justice in relation to Mr Bonnie's death,  while Dean Neale, 30, (right) admitted one charge of possessing MDMA, possessing cocaine and perverting the course of justice by providing a false witness statement . Friends: Paul Tabb (left) today admitted perverting the course of justice, having previously pleaded guilty to possessing MDMA and cocaine. James Churchill has admitted three charges of supplying controlled Class A drug MDMA, three allegations of supplying cocaine and a charge of perverting the course of justice . He had admitted possessing MDMA and cocaine at an earlier hearing. All four men are on bail and are due to be sentenced on October 3, when it is expected a victim impact statement from Mr Bonnie's mother Pauline, who works in drug rehabilitation, will be read out. Speaking at the time of Mr Bonnie's death, his mother and father, Andy, said: 'This news has devastated the lives of us, Nick's two brothers Thomas and Ryan, and his beautiful devoted girlfriend, Leah. Our family and friends, Nick's friends, work colleagues, all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment with the Princes Trust, are equally devastated. 'Bad batch': Mr Bonnie, who had worked for Prince Charles's young persons' charity for eight years, is believed to have swallowed a pill from what police described as a 'bad batch' 'Stupid mistake': Mr Bonnie's parents said that he had 'lived life to the max', but that 'one stupid mistake' had cost him his life' Tragedy: Mr Bonnie's family said they were 'devastated' by the charity worker's death . 'Nick was born in King's Stanley and went to the local primary school. He progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around Australia before gaining his degree at university in Plymouth. He returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before embarking on the true vocation of his life, working with the Princes Trust. 'He has helped many young people in the early stages of his employment there and helped raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role. He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace. 'Nick played local football for King's Stanley youth teams up until the age of 16, Leonard Stanley Under 18s, Brimscombe & Thrupp and finally, Cashes Green. Nick was a keen sportsman, avid follower of Liverpool FC and only last week completed the ""Tough Mudder"" challenge for Help for Heroes in Wales. 'Nick was known by many as having a big heart, big personality and the most infectious smile in Stroud. 'Our thanks go out to all those who have taken the time to send messages of support to our family. Our lives and all those who were blessed to share a part in his life, are broken. Our life will never be the same without Nick and he will never be forgotten. 'Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life, lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life. 'We hope that after reading this, we may have gone some way in helping anyone/ everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever.'","Nick Bonnie, 30, died after swallowing an ecstasy pill from 'a bad batch'

"By . Belinda Robinson . She has been the face of ABC World News for the past five years – but tonight Diane Sawyer will end her reign as one of America’s best known anchors. The 68-year-old announced her departure a day earlier than most were expecting and tweeted: ‘See you tonight for my last anchoring - great adventures ahead!' It is the fourth time that ABC has swapped anchors since the death of ABC veteran Peter Jennings in 2005. Scroll down for video . Departure: Diane Sawyer sits on the set of 'World News With Diane Sawyer' she will say her final goodbye on August 27 2014 . Tweet: Ms Sawyer tweeted 'See you tonight for my last anchoring - great adventures ahead!' Anchors: Peter Jennings, left, Diane Sawyer and Tom Brokaw sit together during The Coro Foundation's 3rd Annual Commitment To Leadership Dinner at Tavern on the Green in New York City, New York . Earlier this year, ABC announced that her replacement will be David Muir, who often sits in the anchor chair when Ms Sawyer is off. He will officially take over the hot seat on September 2. According to sources, Ms Sawyer felt that the time was right to make her exit and has done so on her own terms. She confided in just a handful of close friends about her plan to leave and is leaving with little fuss or fanfare. It is being suggested that she wants to slow down and take things easier. Replacement: Her replacement will be David Muir, left, who often sits in the anchor chair when Ms Sawyer is off . But she has already signed up for a new 'adventure.' She will be heading up an investigative unit for ABC News but will not receive the bumper $20million salary that she reportedly got when she was the face of World News. Nevertheless she will remain at the heart of the news operation, working alongside reporters and editors who have been carefully chosen for the job. Many of her new colleagues are said to be already working for Nightline and Good Morning America. During her long career, Ms Sawyer has had several high profile roles. In 1984, she became the first female correspondent on 60 Minutes, a CBS News investigative-television news magazine. 60 MINUTES: In 1984, she became the first female correspondent on 60 Minutes (clockwise from far left)  Ed Bradley, Mike Wallace, Harry Reasoner, Morley Safer and Diane Sawyer pictured here in 1986 . During her five years with 60 Minutes, the program regularly ranked among the top-five most-watched in the country . She moved to ABC in 1989 anchored the news magazines Primetime and 20/20 and later co-anchored Good Morning America. The well-loved anchor has had many career highs including interviews with past and present world leaders including President Obama, Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro. She has also landed scoops which include the first interview with Jaycee Dugard about her years of captivity and abuse at the hands of Phillip Garrido. And the reporter and anchor managed to land an exclusive interviews with Amanda Knox. Scoop: After being held captive for 18 years, Jaycee Dugard talks to Diane Sawyer in her first interview since being discovered and freed . Interview: Diane Sawyer interviewed First Lady Michelle Obama for ABC Television Network . Exclusives: Amanda Knox spoke to Diane Sawyer during an exclusive interview . And in the ongoing ratings battle among news broadcasters ABC World News has been scoring well against NBC's Nightly News. In fact, according to Nielson, the network's ratings are at a five-year high. Ms Saywer managed to attract an average audience of about 7.36 million viewers to World News last week. In the coveted ‘news demo’ spot which is of concern to advertisers, ABC's World News led the pack. It had 1.918 million viewers of adults 25-54, followed by NBC's Nightly News With Brian Williams with 1.860 million and CBS Evening News With Scott Pelley with 1.635 million. Ms Sawyer is expected to jump back into the anchor chair for prime-time specials and big interviews. And ABC is said to be quietly hoping that her exit will draw viewers to watch tonight’s broadcast, as she says her final goodbye.","The 68-year-old announced that she was leaving a day .

"By . David Martosko, Us Political Editor for MailOnline . Obama is quietly forming a coalition to support airstrikes on ISIS in Syria after the execution of US journalist James Foley, according to a report on Wednesday. Obama said Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina that his Defense and State Departments are 'urging countries in the region and building an international coalition, including our closest allies, to support Iraqis as they take the fight to these barbaric terrorists.' He did not specifically mention recruiting partners for bombing raids over Syrian air space. But The New York Times reported hours later, citing unnamed sources, that the U.S. was engaged in a 'diplomatic campaign to enlist allies and neighbors in the region to increase their support for Syria’s moderate opposition and, in some cases, to provide support for possible American military operations.' Scroll down for video . Whose planes? President Obama has authorized surveillance flights over Syria, a move that could pave the way for US airstrikes against ISIS militant targets -- and for international coalition-building at the State Department . 'A cancer': Obama boasted Tuesday that an international coalition of willing partners would help root out ISIS once and for all . The Times named seven countries 'likely to be enlisted': Australia, Britain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The White House this week began facing tough questions about whether it would pursue ISIS into Syria as part of a plan that has so for focused exclusively on hamstringing its fighters in Iraq. A knowledgeable State Department source would not confirm that any country has been asked to provide materiel, personnel or logistical support for any U.S. military mission operating in or over Syria. International coalition-building has become the most recognizable hallmark of Obama's foreign policy. He warned Tuesday in his lackluster and sparsely applauded address at the America Legion's annual convention that 'history teaches us of the dangers of overreaching, and spreading ourselves too thin, and trying to go it alone without international support.' 'In times of crisis,' the president preened, 'no other nation can rally such broad coalitions to stand up for international norms and peace.' According to the Times, Britain and Australia are the most likely nations to step up first, followed by Turkey, whose military bases near its long Syrian border would be invaluable for staging, refueling and supplies. But Obama also branded ISIS 'a cancer,' bragging that 'tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being.' That laid-on-thick rhetoric suggests either a confidence that a coalition will materialize, or a brazen acknowledgment that America will be left to bomb ISIS on its own in Syria – as it has already in Iraq. Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the U.S. military Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on August 21 that ISIS 'can be contained,' but 'not in perpetuity.' 'This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,' Dempsey said. 'Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.' The administration appears to be gearing up for airstrikes, and floated  the case of the Turkmen to the Times. The al-Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) operates both in Iraq and in Syria (shown), and moves personnel and materiel freely across the invisible border between the two countries . About 12,000 of the Shiite ethnic group inhabit the Iraqi town of Amerli, which ISIS has been attacking for the last two months. ISIS, a Sunni group, sees the Turkmen as infidels, and its militants have indiscriminately killed countless of them. Like the Yezidis before them on Mt. Sinjar, the group is a ready-made rationale for American humanitarian assistance and airborne offensives. And according to the World Population Review, between 750,000 and 1.5 million Turkmen live in Syria. A State Department source said he couldn't reject the possibility that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Syria could be framed as those near Mt. Sinjar were, as an effort to protect an oppressed group. The Pentagon has already begun to send surveillance drones on flights over Syria to gather intelligence on ISIS's positions and troop strength. Bashar al-Assad, Syria's strong-arm dictator, has warned that the U.S. must ask permission before intruding into his country's airspace for any reason, including strikes against ISIS. Tensions between Washington and Damascus could worsen if the U.S. were to insert itself into Syria. While ISIS has taken up arms against Assad in a bloody civil war that has raged since 2011, so have the Turkmen. Weakening one while strengthening the other is likely not the dictator's idea of a good outcome. But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki insisted during a press conference on Tuesday that 'we're not going to ask permission from the Syrian regime.'","New York Times report suggests Obama won't go it alone if he attacks ISIS inside Syria's borders .
ISIS oppression of Shi'ite Turkmen group in Iraq could be a rationale for striking the terror group as it attacks Turkmen in Syria .
Britain, Australia and Turkey are mentioned as  allies who might 'support' the White House, but Obama has no confirmed takers .
There are no direct indications that 'coalition' partners would actually engage ISIS from the air along with Americans .
The US government also won't confirm that any nation has agreed to back the White House if Obama pursues ISIS into Syria ."
"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . Cleared: David Cox, 49, who hit a motorbike and sidecar killing a married couple, has been cleared of causing death by careless driving after a court heard he choked on a sweet moments before the crash . A driver who hit a motorbike and sidecar killing a married couple has been cleared of causing death by careless driving after a court heard he choked on a sweet moments before the crash. Kevin Byrne, 48, and his wife Carol, 49, both died in the crash on April 21 last year as they were making their way home to Rhayader in Powys, Wales, after a motorbike rally. Driver David Cox, 49, had blacked out and said he had no 'accurate recollection' of his car crashing into the couple’s Yamaha as he drove the other way down the A458 Shrewsbury to Welshpool road in Shropshire. Shrewsbury Crown Court heard moments before the collision Mr Cox suffered a coughing fit after getting a sweet given to him by his mother stuck in his throat. His Vauxhall Astra crossed onto the opposite side of the dual carriageway before veering right and hitting the bike. The couple were both pronounced dead at the scene. Prosecutors claimed that Mr Cox’s coughing fit started 'quite some distance' from the scene of the crash, and that he had failed to slow down or pull over and stop. However, he told police he had been coughing and choking for 'about a minute' after being given a sweet by his mother, who was a front seat passenger . He was cleared of two charges of causing death by careless driving following a four-day trial and broke down in tears as the jury returned the verdicts on Friday. Today, he refused to comment on the case back at his semi-detached bungalow in Atherstone, Warwickshire. Thomas Kenning, prosecuting, had told the court that Mr Cox had chosen to try and keep steering the car after the coughing episode before losing control. 'The central issue was whether the defendant was in control of the car or was he driving without due care and attention,' he said. Tragedy: High school sweethearts Mr and Mrs Byrne were on their way home to Rhayader in Powys, Wales, after a motorbike rally when their bike was hit. They were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash . 'The prosecution say that when he was coughing or choking he should have taken measures to prevent the car going into the on-coming lane.' However, giving evidence, Mr Cox sobbed in the witness box as he said he couldn’t remember the accident. He also told the jury he was upset because of the loss of life and because he was unable to remember the detail of what had happened. At the time of their deaths, the couple’s devastated family paid tribute to the devoted pair, who had first met as pupils of Llandrindod Wells High School, and went on to marry in July 1985.. In a statement issued through West Mercia Police, their two children Danny and Jodie, aged in their 20s, said: 'Kevin and Carol weren’t just brilliant parents, son, daughter, brother, sister, aunty and uncle - they were truly everyone’s best friends. 'Everyone could count on them, no matter what. Nothing was ever too much trouble. 'Mum and Dad always went to bike shows all around the country, up to 10 times a year and they loved it whatever the weather. Once summer was over, they would start planning next year’s events. 'They loved seeing the other bikes and bands. Dad would always come back with a trophy which he’d be so proud of. His bike was his pride and joy.'","Kevin Byrne, 48 and wife Carol, 49, died in the crash in Shropshire last April .

"By . Lucy Crossley for MailOnline . The new Tesco boss has been urged to split the business into three separate stores based on its Finest, Everyday Value, and ordinary brands to tackle the threat from Aldi and Lidl. The supermarket giant has been hit by profit warnings as its businesses suffered outside the UK, while British shoppers have been turning to lower cost rivals. New chief executive Dave Lewis, who is due to start in October, has now been advised by an industry analyst to split up the company into a discount chain to take on the German-owned stores and a higher-end version rivalling Waitrose or Marks & Spencer, as well as the regular branches. Suggestion: The new Tesco boss has been urged to split the business into three separate stores based on its Finest, Everyday Value, and ordinary brands to tackle the threat from Aldi and Lidl . Threat: Share prices at Tesco have fallen as the supermarket struggled to kick-start a strategy to fend off the growth of discounters, led by Aldi and Lidl . The supermarket group is now worth £10billion less than a year ago, and analyst Bruno Monteyne said he believes that breaking up the chain is the only way to halt Tesco's decline. Mr Lewis will join Tesco after more than 25 years experience working at consumer goods group Unilever. In a research note, Mr Monteyne of Bernstein Research, suggested that breaking up the brand would enable Tesco to use different approaches to entice different customers into its stores. 'Rip out 20 per cent of the range, have cheaper shelving and cheaper products in the more deprived areas and give customers a better deal,' he wrote, according to The Independent. Incoming: New chief executive Dave Lewis will take over the role in October, following the departure of Philip Clarke . Tesco's share price has fallen 33 per cent in the past year to 247p on 22 August. The retailer has been hit by profit warnings as its businesses suffered outside the UK, while shoppers in its home region began turning to lower cost rivals. The supermarket group is now worth £10billion less than a year ago after its shares plunged as it struggled to kick-start a strategy to fend off the growth of discounters, led by German-owned Aldi and Lidl, and suffered from perceived over-expansion in its boom years. It recently lost its chief executive Phil Clarke with a new one Dave Lewis due to take over in autumn. 'In London, where people want someone behind the counter who knows the difference between a parma ham and a serrano ham, that requires more investment.' Tesco announced last month that CEO Philip Clarke, who had worked his way up to the top job during 40 years with the company, would be replaced by Mr Lewis following a profits warning. During Mr Clarke's tenure he had invested £1bn cutting prices, refreshing stores, increasing staff numbers and service levels but the business had continued to lose market share. Share prices dropped as Tesco struggled to kick-start a strategy to fend off the growth of discounters, led by Aldi and Lidl, and the chain suffered from perceived over-expansion in its boom years. A former Tesco executive himself, Mr Monteyne said that by splitting up the brand Tesco would be able to charge different prices around the country, enabling it to compete with discounters in poorer areas, and more upmarket shops in affluent towns. 'By Tesco promising to have the same prices in the most affluent areas as the poorest areas, it’s basically tied its hands behind its back by committing to an uneconomical model,' he said. A study for The Grocer magazine earlier this month found that Lidl was almost a third cheaper than the major supermarket chains, and that both it and Aldi have made dramatic gains in market share. In the 12 months to July 2014, Aldi’s market share rose 32.2 per cent, while Lidl’s grew 19.5 per cent. Retail experts said their success will intensify the competition, forcing bigger chains to ‘up their game’ and slash prices. The Grocer’s ‘shopping basket survey’ found Lidl charged 29.5 per cent less than Tesco for 33 popular lines, and that while a weekly shop at Tesco cost £63.73, the equivalent at Lidl was £49.23. As well as the threat of Aldi and Lidl, Tesco's overseas operation has also suffered. The company has exited both the Japanese and US markets, and in the last financial year, trading profit for its European operations fell as sales in the likes of Hungary, Poland and Turkey, all declined. MailOnline has contacted Tesco for comment.","New Chief Executive Dave Lewis is due to start at Tesco in October .

A teacher who was left fighting for her life after she was allegedly attacked at home by her husband has died. Mother-of-two Rukshana Miah, 35, was taken to hospital after the alleged assault in north Reddish, Stockport, on August 18, but died on Saturday. A Home Office post mortem examination concluded her death was as a result of compression on the neck. Her husband, Abdul Kashem Miah, 36, was charged with attempted murder, and police and prosecutors are now reviewing the charge in the wake of Mrs Miah's death. He appeared at Stockport Magistrates’ Court last Wednesday and is due to appear before a judge at Manchester Crown Court on September 10. Mrs Miah's family said in a statement: 'Rukshana was a wonderful daughter, mother, sister, aunty, cousin and friend who will be greatly missed by us all.' Her colleagues at Broadoak Primary School in Ashton-under-Lyne also paid tribute to the popular teacher. 'Rukshana Miah was a wonderful and talented teacher at Broadoak Primary School in Ashton who touched the lives of everyone she met,' said headteacher Des Howlett. 'Rukshana was the heart of the school, an outstanding teacher who was devoted to the success of the children that she taught. She always wanted to be the best and for her children to be the best and her belief that anything was possible if you work hard enough had an impact on everyone she met. 'Ruk was full of life and passion for the children that she taught and friends that she made. That same wonderful smile greeted every challenge, every child and every joke alike and her many friends knew that their friendships were firm and valuable. 'She made us laugh and will continue to do so as we share memories and remember her jokes. We were and always will be extremely proud of having Rukshana as a teacher at our school and as a friend. She was a natural teacher and a great friend and colleague. We are all very proud to have known her. 'Ruk herself would always say that her greatest achievement was her children and her love and pride for them shone through every day. She was a fantastic mother who knew that time was precious and so was always doing something with them or taking them to places. They were her life and made her laugh whether she liked it or not. She brought them up to be respectful and polite but they have Ruk’s own wonderful cheekiness and sense of fun. They will continue to be a credit to her. Couple: Police have charged Mrs Miah's husband Abdul Kashem Miah, 36, with attempted murder and are reviewing the charge against him in the wake of her death . Mother:Mrs Miah's colleague Des Howlett said she was a 'fantastic' mother and a 'wonderful teacher' 'Her loss is absolutely devastating. Ruk was the best of us and will always be remembered. Our thoughts are with Ruk’s children and family at this terrible time. Broadoak will be a sadder place without her, we have lost one of the best.' Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington of Greater Manchester Police confirmed that officers had launched a murder investigation following her death. 'Sadly Ruckshana's injuries proved fatal and a murder investigation is now underway,' he said. 'Devastated': Detective Chief Inspector Howard Millington said it was 'simply heartbreaking' that Mrs Miah's two children would be growing up without a mother . Home: Mrs Miah was attacked at her home on this leafy residential street in Stockport . 'Her family are clearly devastated and we would ask they be given time and space to grieve and come to terms with her tragic death.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Even as a brave paramedic neighbor tried desperately to stop his bleeding, Craig Sytsma knew he would die from the wounds he'd suffered during a vicious dog mauling on a rural Michigan road. The 46-year-old father of three, who was bitten some eight times by two hundred-pound cane corsos while jogging in Metamora Township in July, was 'screaming' and begging' for help in his final minutes. One neighbor, a medic, used a belt as a tourniquet to stop Sytsma's bleeding. She had to pause the rescue efforts momentarily while the massive dogs came back. 'I'm bleeding out,' a desperate Sytsma told his rescuer, according to the Detroit Free Press. 'I'm dying.' Victim: Craig Sytsma, 46, was mauled by two massive cane corsos while jogging along a rural Michigan road . Valbona Lucaj and husband . Sebastiano Quagliata, who owned the dogs, are being held on $500,000 bond each on second-degree murder charges. A neighbor witnessed the vicious attack, and shot at the animals several times until he hit one and scared them off . He 'was losing a lot of blood and begged her to not let him die,' police wrote about the rescuer, Helen Barwig. It took another neighbor, Barwig's boyfriend Edward Elmer, firing his .44-caliber Magnum at the dogs to end the attack. He struck one of the animals in the leg. Sytsma only had time to tell Barwig that his name was Craig before losing consciousness. He was rushed to a local hospital but soon died of is injuries. His dramatic final moments were revealed in response to a request by the Free Press under Michigan's Freedom of Information Act. The police records show the two dogs had run loose for months in the small rural community, attacking at least two neighbors months before they killed Sytsma. Some neighbors began to arm themselves, including the man whose shots eventually scared the cane corsos as Sytsma laid dying. Sytsma, 46, was a dedicated father of three. He survived colon cancer and kept an active lifestyle to keep the disease at bay . The dog owners, Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata, were warned by their veterinarian that the dogs were dangerous but did nothing to control the animals and stop their frequent kennel escapes. Lucas, 44, and Quagliat, 45, are both charged with second-degree murder in Sytsma's death. The duo, who are both undocumented immigrants, remain locked up at Lapeer County Jail, each held in lieu of $500,000 bond. They are expected back in court on Friday. The dogs were euthanized on Aug. 4, along with a third adult cane corso not involved in the attack. Eight puppies were to be offered to an animal rescue group. The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said. 'Animal . control should have done something,' said April Smith, who was bitten in May 2012 while walking her two dogs with her side. The two cane corsos that mauled Sytsma were euthanized on Aug. 4 . Scene: Sytsma was running on this road when he was mauled by the two dogs . 'It should have never gone this far. The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.' Sytsma was a a divorced father of three who had beaten colon cancer the year before. He jogged as a way to keep the disease at bay, according to the Free Press. He also played hockey and golfed, as well as regularly riding his mountain bike and playing beach volleyball. But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28. Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it. 'I’d say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan Sytsma said. Victim: April Smith, pictured, was attacked by one of the dogs in April 2012 .","Craig Sytsma, 46, was mauled by two massive and aggressive dogs while jogging in a rural road in Metamora Township, Michigan .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . A Texas brewery has launched a 99-pack of beer which is so big it needs at least two people to carry it out of the store. Austin Beerworks has put the huge box of their Peacemaker beer on sale, which comes in a seven foot long box, for the price of $99. The box also weighs 82 pounds and consists of three rows of 33 cans. Scroll down for video . The 99-pack of Peacemaker beer brewed by Austin Beerworks, and takes two people to carry, which has gone on sale in Texas . The Austin-based brewery released a light-hearted promotional video for the box, showing two men struggling as they attempt to buy a pack . The brewery admitted the idea for a 99-pack of beer was at first a joke, but several retailers expressed interest in the packs. It is thought that they will first be on offer in the Austin area. Makers say the massive packs are designed so that once it is opened, the beer can be covered in ice. Michael Graham, co-founder of the Austin-based craft brewery said: 'We made it at first as a joke. He told CBS: 'We conceived of it just to be silly, but we never thought there would be any real interest from retailers and consumers. 'I guess we underestimated the power of a stupid idea.' Early sales seem to indicate they have gone down well with customers with the brewery posting on their official Facebook page that they had sold out . The brewers admitted that at first they were joking about making a 99-pack due to its impracticality but they had serious demand for various stores . The launch of the 99-pack comes with a promotional video, which shows the beer being produced in the brewery and explains that they have decided to create their first multi-pack. It goes on to say that how they thought about a regular-sized 12 pack, a 29 pack and even a 42 pack, before saying they landed on the perfect size of a 99-pack. The video then shows two men taking one of the huge packs from a supermarket shelf and then struggling to carry it out of the store and load it into a car. It then ends with the line: '99 beers for 99 bucks and good luck getting them home, you're going to need to bring a friend.' The video explains that it is the first multi-pack the company have produced, and at first only thought about making a 12-pack . They then go to explain that they tried a variety of different size packs before coming to the perfect size of a 99 pack . The video ends with the line: '99 beers for 99 bucks and good luck getting them home, you're going to need to bring a friend.' The brewery now have plans to ship around 20 packs of the beer per week. And early sales seem to indicate they have gone down well with customers with the brewery posting on their official Facebook page that they had sold out. The wrote: 'Today was a crazy day. Sounds like most of y'all had a good time. Thanks for stalking us from place to place and being nice to us. For those of y'all that didn't have a good time, we're really sorry. We knew there was no way to get 99-packs to everyone who wanted one, but we could have done a few things better. 'We're going to make more 99-packs for next week and are open to any suggestions about how to do it better next time. You're also free to yell at us and call us dirty names.'","Austin Beerworks has launched the new 99-pack of its Peacemaker beer .

The discovery was made just after 11am this morning at the Dartford Crossing in Kent, which led to heavy congestion on approaches to the area. A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokeswoman said the person taken to hospital was not believed to be in a life-threatening condition. One person has been taken to hospital after 13 people were found in the back of a lorry, pictured, amid reports of suspected illegal immigrants . One person was taken to hospital after the discovery was made just after 11am this morning at the Dartford Crossing in Kent . Kent Police confirmed they were called to a report of suspected illegal immigrants but that the immigration service was managing the investigation. The discovery comes after 35 immigrants were found in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex earlier this month. One of them, 40-year-old Meet Singh Kapoor, from Afghanistan, was found dead. The group included 13 children, who are all believed to have fled Afghanistan after suffering persecution. Two lorry drivers - Stephen McLaughlin, 34, of Limavady, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, and Timothy Murphy, 33 of Elmgrove, Londonderry - have been charged with conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK. Across the English Channel in Calais, hundreds of migrants, mainly from Africa, are camping or living in squats, which has led to violent clashes erupting on the streets. Local officials have called on Britain to do more to share the burden of immigration, with the deputy mayor of Calais, Philippe Mignonet, appealing to the historic 'Entente Cordiale' between the two nations. The discovery led to heavy congestion on approaches to the area. The discovery comes after 35 immigrants were found in a container at Tilbury Docks in Essex earlier this month . Mr Mignonet said earlier this month that the port town had been saddled with an image of a 'theatre of war' as he called on David Cameron to 'come and see what we face'. The use of Calais as a stepping stone to Britain has long been a problem for France. In May, three makeshift migrant camps were evacuated and destroyed amid insanitary conditions and an outbreak of scabies. One person was hospitalised after 13 suspected illegal immigrants were found at Dartford Crossing (file pic) Earlier this month Essex Police found 35 Afghan immigrants in this shipping container at Tilbury Docks, Essex . In 2002, the French government closed the Sangatte Red Cross centre, near Calais, after repeated lobbying by then home secretary David Blunkett. This month, it was reported that Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart was planning a state-funded camp away from local residents amid the 'unbearable strain' of the high numbers of migrants .","One person was taken to hospital after the people were found at 11am today .

"By . Kate Lyons for Daily Mail Australia . A teenager is in an induced coma after he was punched to the ground when a party spilled out of control. Police were called to a party in Bayswater in east Melbourne on Saturday night after a group of gate-crashers attended the party and fights broke out. By the time police arrive the party had spilled out onto the street and approximately 100 party-goers and other youths were involved in fights on the street. Scroll down for video . Jaiden, 15, is in an induced coma after he was punched and struck his head when a Melbourne party spun out of control . A witness told police a 15-year-old boy, Jaiden, who at the request of his family is known only by his first name, was walking away from the crowd along the footpath when he was punched by a youth running past him. Jaiden, from Carrum Downs in Melbourne's southeast, was knocked to the ground by the blow and struck his head on the footpath. The party which was held in a community hall, was advertised on social media and it's believed gate crashers turned up to the event. Police say there were a number of fights inside the hall that spilled onto the street. Officers broke up the fights but some of the crowd returned and continued fighting. Detective Rick Rittinger from Knox CIU said Jaiden was hit without warning. 'It was a case of the offender running past and stopping the victim and continuing running. There was no altercation, nothing said,' he said. Jaiden fell to the ground and hit his head on the footpath. He called his mother, Karen, to pick him up from the party but once in the car, the Carrum Downs teenager began having seizures and she rushed him to a nearby hospital. He was transferred to the Royal Children's Hospital and placed in an induced coma. The Rowville Secondary College student remains in the coma with bleeding on the brain. Police were called to a party, which had spilled out onto the street on Saturday night . Jaiden was treated by paramedics at the scene and collected by his mother, but his condition deteriorated as she drove him home and she took him to the hospital . His mother told of how Jaiden was an athlete with a placid personality who never would have provoked such an attack. 'My son who had the world at his feet now has a long road to go to get back to where he was,' she said at the Royal Children's Hospital. 'Young people need to know this is not on. People are getting hurt for nothing.' Jaiden was due to head to Italy in September for a trial to play soccer professionally, in the Italian Soccer Management Schools program. It offers advanced training from professional coaching staff to promising young players from across the world, reported Nine News. He had also been pursuing local options through his school, Flinders Christian Community College as well as playing with the Bentleigh Greens Soccer Club’s junior side. The Greens are a semi-professional side based in Cheltenham that play in the National Premier Leagues Victoria. 'He absolutely had not only the ability but the desire,' said his mother. Jaiden's brother Anthony also told Nine News ' he's the nicest kid you could meet in the world', while his family made a plea for the attacker to come forward. 'Be honest, please. You might not realise that the outcome of your action is what it is,' his mother said. Police are looking for a male with blue jeans, a hoodie and possibly blonde hair, aged in his late-teens to early 20s. The incident comes just days after the Victorian government announced it would introduce mandatory 10-year jail terms for perpetrators of one-punch attacks which result in a death. Police are yet to speak to the victim but are appealing for anyone who may have information about the incident to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or via www.crimestoppers.com.au. Police are yet to speak to Jaiden (above) who is in an induced coma, but are investigating the incident .","Jaiden, 15, is in a coma after an attack on Saturday .

Sunday, Iceland lowered its warning code for possible volcanic . disruption to the aviation industry to orange from red, the highest . level on the country's five-point alert system, after concluding that . seismic activity had not led to a volcanic eruption under the glacier. Red alert indicates an eruption is imminent or underway with a significant emission of ash likely. Trembling times: Although the earthquake has not caused an eruption, there are fears of a repeat scenario of the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud in 2010 . Bad boom: The 2010 eruption of a volcano under the Eyjafjallajokull glacier, pictured, severely disrupted European air travel for several weeks after ash spewed into the atmosphere . Met . Office scientists believe the earthquakes are a result of magma flowing . out from under the crater of the volcano, causing a change in pressure. ‘We still can't say whether it will cease, continue like this for a while or erupt. It's impossible to say,’ Erlendsson said. There . have been thousands of smaller quakes over the past week at . Bardarbunga, and areas around the volcano, in the centre of the North . Atlantic island nation, have been evacuated. However, before an eruption air travel will not be affected, a spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said last week. 'The . (UK) Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be . sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air,' he . said. 'If the eruption does . occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of . the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and . experts whether to fly.'","Iceland volcano hit by 5.7 magnitude earthquake overnight .

"By . Sara Malm for MailOnline . Mystery man: The man was jailed for a robbery in 1997, and has since claimed he hails from Canada, South Africa and Kazakhstan (stock image) A foreign national has avoided deportation from Sweden for more than ten years, by claiming he has forgotten where he is from. The 44-year-old man committed aggravated robbery in Stockholm in 1997 and was jailed for five years, after which he was set to be deported. However, while in prison, the man claims to have suffered amnesia and does not know which country he is from – or at least cannot make up his mind about it. In 1997, the man was involved in an . armed robbery of a jeweller’s shop in the Swedish capital, and found . guilty alongside at least one other man. During . the trial, he claimed to be from the former Soviet Union, his family . hailing from Kazakhstan where he said they lived under threat. He . was sentenced to five years and immediate deportation for life. Although he was released from prison after three years, in 2000, he remained in . custody as neither the police or the Swedish Migrationboard could . identify him. In a 2002 . interview the man claimed his name was Edward Brown. He said he thought he was . born in South Africa to a Polish mother and South African stepfather, . but his amnesia made him unsure. A . year later, in 2003, still being held by police, he told Svenska . Dagbladet: ‘I just want my freedom, it is my human right. 'And then I . will not stay in Sweden, I will make my way home to Canada.’ He told the paper he did not remember telling the court he was from Kazakhstan in 1997, not did he know how he suffered amnesia. Catch 22: Swedish Police have been unable to identify the man or prove his amnesia is fake, and can therefore not deport him (stock image) He was released later that year, telling police he was definitely from the former Soviet Union, and has since been working as an artist in Karlstad, a small town in south-east Sweden. As Swedish Police have been unable to identify him, nor prove whether he is telling the truth about suffering amnesia, they are still unable to deport him - and do not know where to send him. The 44-year-old has made several attempts to overturn the ruling to deport him, but they have been denied. Now, 17 years after his robbery conviction, the Swedish Migration board has applied for the Migration Court of Appeal to take up the case and affirm the deportation.","The 44-year-old cannot be deported as it's not clear where he is from .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . The 18-year-old was jailed for 16 years for the attack on a 91-year-old woman . A teenager has been jailed for raping a 91-year-old woman after forcing his way into her home. Lee-Joseph Dixon inflicted the 'life altering' attack as he was making his way home from an all night party. The 18-year-old from Ely, Cariff, ignored the frail pensioner's plea to leave her alone and forced himself upon her in the early hours of the morning. Newport Crown Court heard how Dixon had 'not one ounce of pity' for the vulnerable woman after he knocked on her door at 4am. The teenager will spend eight years behind bars and serve the remainder of a 16 year sentence on licence. The court heard how Dixon began randomly knocking on doors as he walked  home from a party on May 24. When the woman answered barefoot and in her dressing gown, he forced his way in and raped her. She was found still shaking and clutching the phone when police arrived at the scene. The pensioner spent two weeks in hospital before being transferred to a care home. She was unable to return to the house she had lived in since she was a child following the attack. Prosecuting Kelly Huggins said the rape had 'devastated' the woman. 'The Crown Prosecution Service worked alongside South Wales Police from an early stage in their investigation. 'Together, we were able to swiftly build a strong prosecution case against Dixon, leading to his guilty plea. 'While it is right that Dixon has today had to face up to his actions in a criminal court, we should not forget that his reprehensible behaviour has had a devastating effect on his victim. Newport Crown Court (pictured) heard how the teenager randomly knocked on doors at 4am before the woman answered . 'She has understandably found it hard to return to the relatively independent life she had enjoyed prior to this horrific incident and our thoughts are with her.' Today the victim's son said he was surprised the attack did not kill her. 'We are struggling to come to terms with how a young man can do such an horrific violating act to an old woman in her own home where she is meant to feel safest.' Detective Inspector Stuart Wells of South Wales Police's specialist crime investigations squad said the incident was one of the most distressing cases he had ever worked on. 'This was a very serious incident which understandably caused a lot of public concern....an elderly lady suffered a dreadful attack in her own home. 'This has been a life altering experience but one where the victim and her family have shown remarkable emotional strength in dealing with what happened to her.' Dixon pleaded guilty to rape, but said he had no memory of the attack. He will spend eight years behind bars and serve the remainder of his sentence on licence. The 18-year-old will be on the dangerous sex offender's register for the rest of his life.","Lee-Joseph Dixon randomly knocked on doors after night of partying .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . A 25-year-old Ohio man has admitted to raping at least half a dozen women he met on online dating sites — and told detectives he was 'surprised' more victims hadn't come forward yet, cops say. Police in Columbus say that Terry J. Smith Jr. was already on another date on Monday, just a day after he allegedly raped a 21-year-old woman he met on the dating website Plenty of Fish. That second woman, 25, later told cops she also had been sexually assaulted. Smith was booked on two counts of rape and kidnapping for both assaults. While he was questioned, Smith told cops that he'd been victimizing women for a while and there were other assaults 'more serious than this,' the Columbus Dispatch reported. BUSTED: Terry S. Smith Jr., 25, was arrested in Columbus, Ohio, on two counts of sexual assault and kidnapping. He named at least six other female victims . BAIT: In his Plenty of Fish profile, Smith says he enjoys 'cuddling' and 'cooking for her' on the first date. But police say that he's sexually assaulted more than half a dozen women he met through the online dating website . 'He said he was really surprised the other girls hadn’t come forward,' Sgt. Terry McConnell told the Dispatch. Smith named six other victims to Columbus police, but admitted there were more, according to WBNS. The women went to his house voluntarily and some had consensual sex with him, police said. 'But once they’d got to the house, he’d take it above what was agreed upon,' McConnell told the Dispatch. He is being held on $1.5 million bond at the Franklin County jail. One of the victims said Smith told her his actions were a 'fetish.' The woman, who had consensual sex with him once before he forced himself on her, said he threatened to shoot himself if she didn't go to his house. She called police, who went to the house but found nothing wrong. Police records indicate he told another woman that he'd shoot himself about a month earlier. One of Smith's victims, who he met using the pictured Plenty of Fish profile, said Smith forced himself on her even after they'd had consensual sex. He told her he had a 'fetish' 'He’s not aware of what he’s doing is wrong,'  the victim told the Dispatch. 'He just thinks it’s something he likes to do, like role playing or something.' One of Smith's friends, Tony Dunn, told WBNS that Smith was open about scoring dates off sites like Plenty of Fish, OK Cupid and Craigslist. 'I knew he was sleeping with them — it all seemed consensual,' Dunn told the station. 'There was nothing out of the ordinary.' But then on Sunday, Smith sent him a Facebook message claiming he 'grew a conscience.' 'I feel horrible about everything I've done,' he wrote, according to WBNS. 'I think I'm spent on being the punisher.' In his online dating profile, Smith says he enjoy 'ghosthunting' and has a 'bit of old-fashioned country boy' in him. For a first date he says he'd 'cook her dinner and cuddle up watching some horror movies.'","Terry J. Smith Jr., 25, has been charged with two counts of rape and kidnapping .

"By . Margot Peppers for MailOnline . A new restaurant is taking the term 'farm-to-table' to a whole new level by letting diners watch baby farm animals being born in a purpose-built birthing room. At Farmhouse Restaurant in Fair Oaks, Indiana, customers are invited to visit a separate barn where live births happen every hour, with 80,000 baby pigs born each year and 150 calves born every single day. And diners need not worry about the animals ending up on their plates; since it is only a dairy farm, the employees at Farmhouse get their meat and poultry from neighboring farms instead.

The Birthing Barn features stadium seating surrounding a room encased with glass, so that hundreds of visitors can catch a glimpse of the miracle of life. The restaurant, which is run by co-owner Carl Bruggemeier, sits on the 23,000-acre Fair Oaks Farms and boasts up to 500,000 visitors each year. The goal of the birthing room, he says, is to expose people to where their food comes from. 'Most of us go into a grocery store and don’t really know where things come from or how they got there,' he told Today.com. 'We don’t even give it much thought.' Animal friendly: Diners need not worry about the animals ending up on their plates; since it is only a dairy farm, the employees at Farmhouse get their meat and poultry from neighboring farms instead . By contrast, more than 55per cent of the menu at Farmhouse comes directly from the farm, and Mr Bruggemeier says the eventual aim is for that figure to be 80per cent. In the same vein, the restaurant kitchen is behind a transparent glass wall, so diners can watch while their meals are being prepared. Some of the meals featured on the menu include a pork tenderloin sandwich, slow-cooked country short ribs and bacon-wrapped meatloaf. Sustainable: 55per cent of the menu at Farmhouse comes directly from the farm, which sits on 23,000 acres . Super fresh: The dairy they use comes straight from their farm animals . Not only does the restaurant take special care to keep their customers informed about the origins of their foods, but it is also entirely eco-friendly. The facility runs on energy produced by cow and pig manure, or 'poo power' as it is dubbed on their website. 'Sustainability isn't just something we claim, it's how we live,' reads the site. What's more, a visit to the farm is an experience in itself; tourists can explore a 7,000-tree fruit orchard, which provides much of the menu at the restaurant. Learning more: Visitors can also take part in the 'Pig Adventure', where they can perform a hands-on sonogram and interact with some of the pigs . They can also take part in the 'Pig Adventure', where they can perform a hands-on sonogram and interact with some of the pigs.

"By . Reuters Reporter . On Monday, a resident of Novoazovsk in south-eastern Ukraine said she saw a column of armored vehicles approach the town and start shooting. 'It all started at 8am this morning, tanks appeared, no fewer than seven of them,' the woman, who gave her name only as Lyudmila, told Reuters by telephone. 'Right now I can hear rumbling, explosions ... the residents are hiding.' In Kiev later that morning, Ukrainian officials said the column was an incursion by Russian troops which it alleges are fighting alongside pro-Moscow separatists, a claim Russia quickly dismissed as disinformation. Scroll down for video . A resident of Novoazovsk in south-eastern Ukraine said she saw this column of armored vehicles . Armoured column: Ukrainian officials said the column was an incursion by Russian troops . That is a now-familiar ritual: the five-month conflict over eastern Ukraine is one of claim and counter-claim by opposing sides, often centering on what role Russia is playing. With the battlefield mostly too dangerous for reporters to safely move around, verifying who is doing what is usually impossible. On Tuesday, in a continuation of the pattern, Kiev said it had captured a group of Russian soldiers who had entered Ukraine on a 'special mission', while Moscow said they were there by mistake. However, the armored column that appeared on Monday in the far south-eastern corner of Ukraine, where it abuts the Russian border, was unusual because the spot was far removed from any territory held by the separatists. It was therefore difficult to see how the column could have appeared in Ukraine without having come across the Russian border, unless it made an amphibious landing from the nearby Azov Sea which is improbable given the number of heavy vehicles witnesses said they saw. A Reuters reporter was able to observe the situation in the area where the column was seen, first at the start of August and then most recently on Sunday afternoon, a few hours before the first sightings of the column were reported. Those observations, combined with interviews with rebel leaders, Ukrainian soldiers, and other research, indicated two things. It is difficult to see how the column could have appeared in Ukraine without having come across the Russian border . Before the armored column appeared, the area had come under artillery fire . It was not possible to establish whether the people driving the column and firing the artillery were Russian soldiers or separatist rebels . First, that until late on Sunday there were no rebel formations within about 30 km (20 miles) of the area where the armored column first appeared, and had not been for weeks beforehand. And secondly, that before the armored column appeared, the area had come under artillery fire at times when the nearest rebel positions were beyond the range of most types of weapon that could have delivered the strike. It was not possible to establish whether the people driving the column and firing the artillery were Russian soldiers or separatist rebels. But there were strong indications that whoever it was doing those things operated out of Russian territory - something very unlikely to have happened without Moscow's consent. Ukrainian soldiers sit in a military camp near Luhansk, Ukraine . A Ukrainian soldier looks through his binoculars at a military camp near Luhansk, Ukraine . Fighting a civil war: Ukrainian soldiers eat at a military camp near Luhansk, Ukraine . The question of Russian involvement is at the core of Western governments' response to the Ukraine crisis, and could be crucial to how the conflict plays out. The European Union and United States have already imposed sanctions on Russia in part based on allegations Moscow is arming the rebels. The West has warned of more sanctions if Russia provides further help. A Ukrainian national guard unit stationed on the outskirts of Novoazovsk, on the road towards the Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka border crossing, showed a Reuters reporter a crater left by an exploding munition near their position. They said the artillery fire was coming from over the border inside Russia, about 10 km (six miles) to the east. 'There were about 500 salvos from Grad (multiple rocket system) and mortars. There have been and are no rebels here whatsoever. They're just firing straight from Russia,' Roman, the commander of a Ukrainian national guard unit, said on Sunday, before the armored column appeared in the same area. Reuters saw no direct evidence of this, and Russian officials have repeatedly denied that their military is in any way involved in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, between pro-Moscow separatist rebels and government forces. A spokesman for the Russian border guard service, when asked to comment, said: 'This is stupid. Russia doesn't fire at anyone.' The Russian defense ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment. But with no rebel presence within range inside Ukraine, it was not clear what other source there could have been for the artillery fire. Even if rebels has somehow snuck into the area and fired the artillery, it seemed impossible they could have done that without using Russian territory to move about, given the distance from the nearest rebel-held locations.

The crater seen by the Reuters reporter on Sunday, before the clashes with rebels, was in the corner of a field behind a defensive trench dug by the Ukrainian national guard unit. A metal fragment that appeared to come from a munition was found in the hole. Reuters showed the photographs of the crater to four European weapons experts who said the crater was either made by an artillery rocket, most probably a Grad, or by a shell from a self-propelled 122 mm gun. According to one of the experts, Konrad Muzyka, Europe and CIS Armed Forces Analyst with IHS, a consultancy, the maximum range for the 2S1 Gvozdika, the Soviet-designed self-propelled 122 mm gun in use in ex-Soviet states, is 15.3 km. That is extendable to 21.9 km when rocket-assisted projectiles are used, he said. Muzyka said the maximum range for the most commonly used Grad rocket, designated as 9M22U, was 20.33 km. He said other variants have ranges of up to 40 km, but they are less widespread. The rebels' self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DNR) says its forces are pushing south from their main stronghold in the city Donetsk, but the settlements they said they had taken by Monday which were closest to the Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka crossing were Telmanovo, about 30 km (20 miles) away as the crow flies, and Novokaterinovka, about 60 km (40 miles) away. That may have overstated the rebels' reach: a Reuters reporter who drove through Telmanovo twice on Sunday saw no sign of a rebel presence in or near the town. One of the experts who reviewed the photographs, British-based independent weapons researcher Eliot Higgins, said he believed the crater was caused by a Grad rocket. He said the shape of the crater suggested the munition was fired from the north-east, the direction of the border with Russia. The Ukrainian unit said most of the artillery struck in the area between their post and the border. Reuters was unable to inspect the other craters left behind by the strikes because of the risk the artillery fire could start up again. Members of the unit said Russian artillery had been landing on the Ukrainian side overnight from Thursday to Friday, and again on Friday night. On a previous visit to the area, on August 1. Ukrainian border guards at the crossing point between Russia and Ukraine showed a Reuters reporter broken windows and holes in the roof of their building. They said the damage was caused by mortar rounds fired from Russian territory. 'There isn't a single insurgent around here for 50 km,' said one of the border guards, Artur Zakharov. 'A mortar can travel 6 (km).' Asked by Reuters on Monday how the rebels could fire artillery so far from their positions, Andrei Purgin, DNR deputy prime minister, said: 'In the conditions of modern warfare, 20 km is no kind of distance for artillery.' 'This is not a war of fronts, it's a civil war. Movements of troops can take place here practically instantaneously. All of us here are insurgents. You come home, you grab your weapons and you go and shoot.'","Ukrainian officials said the column was an incursion by Russian troops .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A violent thug who threatened to drag a British Olympic skier 'by her hair', leaving her too scared to train, has today walked free from court. Biathlete Amanda Lightfoot, 27, said she stopped going out jogging after the terrifying confrontation with Mark Laidler, the former partner of her friend Hayley Claire Thomson, also 27. The Team GB star from South Shields, Tyne and Wear, tried to intervene in a row between the pair when 35-year-old Laidler hit Miss Thomson over the head when she returned from a night out in Newcastle. Amanda Lightfoot, 27, (pictured left at the Sochi Winter Olympics) said she was too afraid to train in South Tyneside following the terrifying confrontation with Mark Laidler, 35 (right) Miss Thomson, who was lying in her bed when she was struck, then retreated to her spare bedroom where she texted the athlete in fear, South Tyneside Magistrates Court heard. The next day, concerned Miss Lightfoot - who competed at this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi - arrived at the pair's home to support her friend. But trouble flared again and Laidler kicked a table at his partner, hitting her on the right arm, before telling Amanda: 'You'd better shut up or I'll drag you out by the hair'. After the terrifying confrontation, the court was told the athlete applied for a restraining order against the defendant because she regularly went running in the South Tyneside area - and was fearful he would approach her. Laidler admitted two charges of assault by beating against her former lover and a common assault - the verbal attack - on Miss Lightfoot. District Judge Helen Cousins gave Laidler an eight-week prison sentence suspended for 12 months and only granted a restraining order in respect of Miss Thompson. In a victim statement read in court, Miss Lightfoot said: 'He threatened to drag me out of the house by my hair. I was terrified he was going to hit me.' Frightened Miss Thomson added: 'The relationship was often violent. He was physically and emotionally abusive. I felt frightened and scared.' The court heard the first assault against Hayley happened at the home she shared with Laidler in Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, after she enjoyed a night out in Newcastle on April 8. The Team GB star, who became the first British female to compete in the Olympic biathlon in Russia earlier this year, asked for a restraining order against Laidler after he threatened to 'drag her out by the hair' Jeanette Smith, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Thomson had been out with friends in Newcastle and arrived home at about midnight, scared and frightened because of an earlier row. 'She found the door was locked and rang Laidler's phone to be let in. He was swearing. She said she didn't dare say anything. She got into bed next to him and was struck in the head and the ear. She said her ears were ringing. 'When her friend arrived the next morning, the defendant was very abusive and told Miss Thomson to get her stuff and get out. 'He kicked a table towards Miss Thomson, hitting her in the arm and was verbally abusive to her friend.' She was treated in hospital for swelling and pain to her neck. Paul Kennedy, defending, said: 'This incident was the culmination of this relationship starting to break down over a period of months. 'He had lost employment and was not able to bring money into the property. He said in the weeks leading up to this incident he had asked her to leave the property as the relationship was effectively over. He can only apologise. He is ashamed about his behaviour.' Laidler, of Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was also ordered to pay compensation of £200 to each victim, court costs of £320 and an £80 victim surcharge. Miss Lightfoot became the first British female athlete to compete in the gruelling biathlon event for eight years when she contested the 7.5km sprint in Russia. The biathlon combines cross country skiing with shooting, testing competitors' mental and physical abilities under extreme pressure.","Amanda Lightfoot intervened after Hayley Cole Thomson was hit in a row .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Every day, thousands of people are joining are uploading videos of their attempt at the ice bucket challenge to join the social media craze. But with so many clips dominating Facebook feeds, users are thinking of ways to stand out. So when mechanic Colin Meyrick received his nomination, he decided to ditch the ice - and instead opted for engine oil. Scroll down for video . Different method: Colin Meyrick, 46, from Llanhilleth, Wales, agreed to have 30 litres of engine oil poured over him at Cooper Car Sales in Ystrad Mynach, in a bid to raise money for Macmillan Cancer Support . The 46-year-old from Llanhilleth, South Wales, agreed to have 30 litres of the liquid poured over his head on one condition - all the money raised would go to a cancer charity in memory of his late mother. Within hours of thinking up the idea in the pub, Mr Meyrick and his colleagues at Coopers Car Sales in Ystrad Mynach had already raised more than £1,000. Garage owner Lewis Phillips said: 'We were in the pub talking about the craze and Colin made a throwaway comment that he'd do it with car oil. 'I said to him 'I'll give you £300 if you do it' and he said he would, as long as the money goes to Macmillan Cancer Support. 'His mum Maver Meyrick passed away earlier this year after a long-term battle with cancer so he wanted to raise money for that cause. 'We already had £700 by the time we left the first pub, Redz in Bargoed, as there was an 18th birthday party in the back room. Soaked: Mr Meyrick jokingly said he would use engine oil instead of ice at the pub, with his friends jumping on the idea. Within hours they had already raised more than £1,000 . 'On the same night we moved on to the Neuadd Wen in Aberbargoed, the Railway Inn in Abertillery and the Top Hotel in Llanhilleth. By the time we got home we'd already raised £1,100 in sponsorship.' The total amount raised has now topped £1,200 and representatives from Macmillan will be visiting the garage on Monday to collect the cash. Mr Phillips added: 'The sponsorship support was phenomenal, everyone wanted to donate. Colin spends most of the day covered in oil anyway so it wasn't that different for him after the challenge. 'He took it in good spirits and was back in the pub again within the hour. He's chuffed to have raised that much money. 'We are so grateful for the support and would particularly like to thank Bodyshine Repair Centre, TG Car Sales, Albion Repair Centre and Pengam Partmart.'","Colin Meyrick, from Llanhilleth, Wales, had 30 litres of oil poured on him .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . A secret-sharing app which allows people to post anonymous confessions is vulnerable and puts the identity of users at risk, it has been revealed. Secret has attracted gossip lovers who can post their own embarrassing admissions online while judging the deepest secrets of their friends and contacts. But 'white hat' ethical hackers  Benjamin Caudill and Bryan Seely were able to identify the names of people behind the  posts by using personal email addresses and 'dummy' accounts. According to hackers, Secret - the app allowing users to post confessions anonymously - is vulnerable and puts the identity of the users at risk . Users can join the app by simply providing a phone number, email address or Facebook account. Once a member, you are then able to see and comment on secrets posted by your friends, and friends of friends, because of an algorithm that tracks contacts. Examples of the messages include: 'Am applying for jobs while still at work' and 'Secretly excited for the new Taylor Swift single, I am a 30 year old [sic] dude.' By filling their contact list with fake profiles and one genuine profile, the hackers were able to identify the secrets admitted by the genuine friend. Using this method, the pair were also able to see that Secret's chief executive David Byttow had posted via the app: 'Is Lucy the cutest dog?' Sometimes companies bring in hackers to try and highlight flaws in their systems. Mr Caudill said his attempted breach was an experiment. The messages are shared with Facebook contacts and friends using an algorithm designed by Secret, allowing other users to comment on the posts . Mr Caudill told the Washington Post: 'We were able to manipulate the process of adding friends to the app and replace real ""friends"" with dummy accounts we created, causing the application to believe we have a large group of friends and that any one friend's secret would be anonymous. 'In actuality, only one real person was added – the victim – so any secrets from friends would be identified as theirs.' Byttow, who is also the co-founder of Secret, admitted in an interview last week: 'We do not say that you will be completely safe at all times and be completely anonymous.' Some of the admissions published by users are serious, while others are more light-hearted . The potential flaws in the supposedly 'secret' apps have come to light in recent months, with the identity of users at risk of being revealed. Snapchat, the popular photo sharing app, settled with the Federal Trade Commission and accepted 20 years of monitoring by FTC regulators over charges that it deceived users. What the company promised users - that photos shared with friends will disappear once they are seen - isn't always true.","Users join Secret app via phone number, email address or Facebook profile .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . An Italian doctor has laid bare the country's wasteful public sector after being permitted to work for just 15 days in the past nine years. The unnamed medic, 50, has used a series of reasons to shirk his duties in the casualty department of a hospital near Catania, Sicily, since 2005. These include attending three and five-year university training courses, calling in sick, taking paid leave for 'family' reasons and obtaining a doctorate. Location: The unnamed medic, 50, has used a series of reasons to shirk his duties in the casualty department of a hospital near Catania (pictured), Sicily, since 2005. These include attending university training courses . Now, he is the subject of an inquiry at the hospital after being cited as the latest example of how thousands of Italian civil servants are able to avoid work by finding loopholes in the rules. Speaking of the doctor's time off, Sicilian . paper Giornale di Siracusa said: 'We are all paying for this, from . his training courses to his illnesses, to his family leave. However, the medic said he was ‘perplexed’ by the public outcry, adding, ‘Everything I did was legal and proper. 'Even the hospital confirms I have . acted correctly. Going on courses is normal and I am being punished for . developing my understanding.' Inquiry: The doctor, who says his actions were 'legal', is the subject of an inquiry at the hospital (file picture) The doctor first disappeared off on a reportedly taxpayer-funded university course after starting work in 2005, before returning to the hospital three years later, on October 31, 2008. He then immediately obtained paid family leave until May 2009, according to The Telegraph. After starting back at work, he lasted 15 days before calling in sick until July 2009. He then obtained a place on another university course lasting until June this year. He is now reportedly planning to stay off work until December 2016 to complete a phD, said ANSA. The case highlights Italy's notoriously wasteful public sector, with a staggering 26,000 people hired as forestry workers in Sicily alone, more than in British Columbia in Canada. It has also been dubbed particularly shocking at a time of cuts as Italy slides back into a recession . Hospital director Franco Luca admitted that the doctor's absences were allowed within the rules. But he added that he hoped the inquiry would help to reduce time off that was 'not strictly necessary or indispensable'.","Doctor, 50, has been permitted to work for just 15 days in past nine years .

The battle for survival in the seas: a plucky seal seems to be trying to distract a great white shark (the one that menaced the seaside town of Amity in the hit film Jaws) in an attempt to free a fellow seal in the fish's mouth. In fact, the seal is using a clever survival tactic. By sticking close to the tail and body of the shark, the mammal is actually able to stay well clear of the shark's gaping maw. Often used in the wild, this impressive survival instinct is used to outmanoeuvre and eventually tire the predator into submission, making for a clean get away for the animal in danger. Scroll down for video . The plucky seal stays by the tail and keeps itself out of reach of the shark's deadly jaws, a clever survival tactic . The incredible pictures were shot near Seal Bay, South Africa, by the experienced wildlife photographer, David Jenkins, 42.

Viewers of this week’s Great British Bake Off saw one contestant’s ice cream pudding reduced to slush in an apparent act of sabotage by bespectacled grandmother Diana Beard, causing her rival to storm off and also be eliminated from the competition. But yesterday the mystery of the Great Baked Alaska Meltdown took a tasty new twist – and this time it was the BBC which was feeling the heat. Stroll down for video . Upset: Diana Beard, 69, pictured at her home in Shropshire, says she has been unfairly blamed for a rival's failed Baked Alaska on last night's show - it later emerged that she never returned to the show . Wednesday night's show descended into chaos when bearded competitor Iain Watters binned his pudding after the ice cream melted in the 25C heat and stormed out of the tent . Diana Bird - who at 69 is the show's oldest ever contestant -  was clearly seen removing his pudding from the freezer despite being warned by another that it belonged to him - but Mrs Beard said today she was the victim of a 'stitch up' Meltdown: This is the moment Iain Watters decided he had to bin his Baked Alaska after it collapsed . Grey-haired Mrs Beard, 69, wept as she . claimed the corporation had cast her as the villain, deliberately . editing the show to make it look as if she had left the dessert out of . the freezer for several minutes. Adding . to the pressure-cooker atmosphere, last night it emerged that she will . take no further part in the show. This, however, is because of illness . rather than ‘Freezergate’, after she lost her sense of smell following a . fall. The scandal is the . biggest to hit Bake Off since last year’s Custardgate drama, when one . contestant tearfully admitted taking another’s custard to use in a . trifle.

He was eliminated after he presented it in a bin to judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, then stormed off set. That . led to Mrs Beard, from Shropshire, being pilloried as a cheat in cruel . online comments. There were more than 550 complaints to the BBC. What happened to Iain's baked Alaska and is the BBC to blame for its destruction? She, . however, insisted the recording had been edited to make it seem as if . she had left the meringue and ice cream dessert out for minutes, rather . than seconds. ‘They deliberately misled viewers and exploited me for the . sake of entertainment,’ she said. ‘The BBC should be ashamed. ‘The . cake was out of the freezer for 40 seconds and I was asking who it . belonged to.

Fellow competitor Jordan Cox, 33, . said some freezers had not worked properly in the heat and added: ‘Poor .

The sister of Charles Manson murder victim Sharon Tate has described her elder sibling's killers as 'little creeps, nothing special' as she pledged to fight for the rest of her life to make sure they remain behind bars. Debra Tate was just 16 when her sister Sharon, the actress wife of Roman Polanski, who was eight and a half months pregnant, was slaughtered by Manson and his 'family' on August 8, 1969. Three of Tate's friends - Jay Sebring, Abigail Folger and Wojciech Frykowski - were also brutally stabbed to death at her Beverly Hills home while the murderers wrote 'DEATH TO PIGS' in their victims' blood on the walls in the hope of starting a race war that Manson named 'Helter Skelter'. Scroll down for video . Sharon Tate was eight-and-a-half-months pregnant when she was stabbed to death by Charles Manson and his followers at her Beverly Hills home. Her sister Debra described her killers in a recent interview as 'nothing special and little creeps' Debra Tate, sister of slain actress Sharon Tate, reacts after convicted mass murderer Charles Manson was denied parole at his 12th parole hearing for the 1969 Tate-Labianca murders on April 11, 2012 . Stephen Parent was a fifth victim that night - he had driven to the property to see caretaker William Garreston and had stayed on for a beer at the guest house. He was shot multiple times when he wound down the window at the electric gate as he left. In a new interview with People, Debra Tate, now 61, relived the moment 45 years ago that her family found out Sharon had been brutally murdered, saying: 'It made me what I am.' Debra is known as an outspoken advocate for victims' rights as she and her family continue to attend every parole hearing to keep the Manson family behind bars. Manson, now 79, was denied parole for the 12th time in 2012. None of those convicted has ever been paroled and one of the killers, Susan Atkins, died in prison last year after being denied compassionate release when she was terminally ill with cancer. Debra, who recently released a new photo-book of her sister called, Sharon Tate: Recollection, scorned the mythology that has built up around the Manson family. She said: 'They're not supernatural, they're not the devil, they're nothing special, they're just little creeps.'

Debra described the life-changing moment that she found her 26-year-old sister, who was fast becoming a Hollywood 'It' girl following her role in Valley Of The Dolls two years earlier, had been killed. She told People magazine that her mother was eating coffee cake with a neighbor while her younger sister Patti, 11, watched cartoons. Debra had been taking a shower when her mother wrenched open the door and collapsed in front of her as she said that Sharon was dead. Ms Tate, who lived in Riverside, California and has a daughter, said that her sister's murder changed her family forever. Her mother Doris fell into years of depression only able to rouse herself when it came to parole hearings to keep her eldest daughter's killers behind bars. Debra's father, a 23-year Army veteran Colonel Paul Tate grieved in silence - working on the case but never speaking with his family about their terrible tragedy and barring them from attending the Manson trials. Charles Manson, pictured in 2013 (left) and following his arrest, led a group of followers who he called his 'family' on a murderous rampage which he hoped would start a race war called 'Helter Skelter'. He has been denied parole 12 times . Earlier this month, one of the women who killed for Manson has given her first on-camera interview about why she felt compelled to murder innocent people. Patricia Krenwinkel, who is serving a life sentence in the California Institution for Women, says she took part in the cult killings because she was a 'coward' and 'wanted to feel loved'. Krenwinkel was convicted along with Manson and two other female followers, Susan Denise Atkins, and Leslie van Houten, in seven murders. She admitted during her trial that she chased down and stabbed heiress Abigail Folger at the Tate home and participated in the stabbing deaths of Leno and Rosemary LaBianca the following night. Another defendant, Charles 'Tex' Watson was convicted in a separate trial. All were sentenced to death but their sentences were commuted to life when the U.S. Supreme Court briefly outlawed the death penalty in 1972. Krenwinkel has had parole denied several times.

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . Comedy legend Bill Kerr, one of Tony Hancock's radio sidekicks in the 1950s, has died aged 92. Born in Cape Town in 1922 (on the same day as Judy Garland), Kerr was raised in Australia and made his first appearance on stage when he was still in his mother's arms. He joked: 'I was such a hit, I retired in 1922 and made a comeback at seven.' He became so successful he was nicknamed 'the Jackie Coogan of Australian vaudeville'. In 1933, he made his first film, Harmony Row, where he was billed as 'Willie' Kerr. In 1947, Kerr moved to England and from November 2, 1954 began appearing opposite Tony Hancock (who he called 'Tubs'), Sid James and Moira Lister in the iconic radio series Hancock's Half Hour. Writer Alan Simpson also appeared uncredited but could not be considered a main character. Hancock's Half Hour, written by Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, began on radio in 1954.

Tony Hancock: Eventually he pushed everyone away... and died alone in a Sydney hotel room; Bill Kerr (right) as a tramp in Salad Days at the Duke of York's Theatre . Kerr played Hancock's lodger and stayed with the show for all six series as the cast were joined by Kenneth Williams, Andrée Melly and from series four for 16 episodes Hattie Jacques as Griselda Pugh, Hancock's secretary. Besides Hancock's Half Hour,  he performed with such comedy greats as Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers (who both guest-starred in the show). When the show transferred to television, Kerr did not go with it. He did appear in the first series of Citizen James, a vehicle for Sid James. Kerr also appeared in The Dam Busters, Doctor Who and the 1960s TV soap about a woman's magazine Compact. In 1979, Kerr went home and reinvented himself as a character actor and had a key role in the 1981 First World War epic Gallipoli and 1982's The Year of Living Dangerously. He appeared on the Australian stage during the 1980s, in musicals such as My Fair Lady, where he received excellent reviews as Alfred Doolittle. In addition to his serious roles, he also continued to appear in comedies including the film The Coca-Cola Kid (1985) and Let's Get Skase (2001). On January 26, 2011, Kerr received the 2011 Walk of Honour in Wagga Wagga, which was unveiled on May 17, 2011. His son Wilton said that he died while watching the sitcom Seinfeld on TV at his home in Perth, Western Australia. 'He said he wasn't feeling too well quite recently and he was just quietly watching television in his room. 'Mum ... said she could hear him laughing to Seinfeld, and that was one of his favourite shows.'","Kerr was the last surviving member of the original main Hancock cast .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Graffiti has plummeted as youths take their anger away from spray cans and onto Twitter, Scotland's top police officer has claimed. Sir Stephen House said social media has offered disaffected people a new platform to vent ideas which a decade ago 'would have been sprayed on the side of a building'. Scottish officers have now seen vandalism, malicious damage and similar crimes halve in just five years, from 28,000 to less than 14,000. Messy: Graffiti on the walls of Bristo Square in Edinburgh. Scotland's top police officer has said daubings are becoming less common as disaffected youth take their grievances away from spray cans and onto Twitter . Changing habits: Sir Stephen House (pictured) said the number of traditional offences of vandalism is falling . Sir Stephen told the Scottish Police Authority: 'Social media in some instances has replaced graffiti as a way of making your views heard. 'We have had to deal with offensive comments made on Twitter. My view is that ten to 15 years ago, that would have been sprayed on the side of a building.' The downward trend probably deserved to be studied for a university thesis, he added. Despite the claim, graffiti has continued to be used as a way of getting political messages across. In protests against the rise in tuition fees in 2010, students defaced London monuments including Nelson's Column and the statue of Winston Churchill with messages including 'Education for the masses' and '**** the police'. And 'artistic' graffiti has also seen a comeback, thanks partly the popularity of the mysterious Banksy, whose career began in Bristol and has brought him worldwide fame. Political slogans: The statue of Winston Churchill in London's Parliament Square after student protests in 2010 . Student anger: The lions of London's Trafalgar Square also did not escape political slogans in 2010 protests . Political: The memorial to the 7/7 bombings in London was defaced on the attack's ninth anniversary this year . Many artistic pieces of graffiti no longer form part of crime figures after councils and police began working with graffiti artists, handing them underpasses or walls where they can paint without fear of prosecution. When it came to gang slogans, Sir Stephen pinned the drop in offences on computer games. 'We have a lot of success against gangs,' he said. 'Some of it has been that the Xbox and PlayStation generation is less of a gang generation. They are not out in the street so much. 'You can correlate that with things like the general view that youth fitness is not where it was. 'Why? Because they are not out playing football to all hours of the day and night. They are inside on the Xbox, but they are not outside, they are not doing the damage.' But he added: 'That takes us back to social media. People staying indoors may be committing some sorts of crimes like cybervandalism, but it is not visible to the rest of the community.' Vandalism or art? Banksy's success has inspired others and taken his career as far as New York (pictured) Politics: Campaigners defaced a string of pre-election Conservative billboards. Messages like this one now spread quicker on Twitter - though a photograph of a real-life vandalised poster always helps . Sir Stephen told the Authority, the force's oversight body, that traditional vandalism, fire-raising, malicious damage, and similar crimes, had fallen dramatically in recent years. There were 13,453 such offences, most of which are against property, in April-June 2014, committed across Scotland in the first financial quarter of the year. That is down nearly eight per cent on the same period a year before, and the figure has more than halved since 2009-2010, when it stood at 28,146. The chief constable added some of the fall was due to the force focusing on 'local policing and high-visibility patrols'. He said: 'We have seen a significant drop in anti-social behaviour and we see fewer complaints of drinking in public complaints. 'Some of these things tend to go with vandalism, graffiti and damage to property.' Paint: Despite graffiti artists being given designated walls, parts of cities remain daubed with gang slogans . Sir Stephen also praised architects and designers for helping to make it harder to commit vandalism - and harder to break things. He said: 'I think we should also give credit to intelligent design as well. Things are harder to vandalise than they used to be. 'It is most cost-effective to build something that is difficult to vandalise, say a bus shelter, than it is to replace it.' Police are now investigating more Twitter crimes - although a recent investigation of racist abuse against an Irish-born Glasgow councillor, Feargal Dalton, fell through after officers failed to obtain information from the social media giant. Sir Stephen stressed that abuse was abuse wherever it occurred. He said: 'When challenged, some people say 'I didn't say that, I put it on Twitter'. Well, it is the same as saying it.' Police Scotland itself now has 571,610 followers on Twitter - a rise of four per cent over the summer.","Scotland's Chief Constable revealed offences have halved in just five years .
'Social media has replaced graffiti for making your views heard', he said .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . A five month-old baby girl was killed by a stray bullet which authorities fear was fired into the air as a celebration, it has been reported. Saudi Arabia banned 'joy gunfire' two years ago but the practice has continued despite an apparent crackdown and another accident which killed 23 wedding guests. Its latest alleged victim was taken to hospital in the Saudi city of Khamis Mushayt but died after spending 24 hours on a life support machine, her father told local media. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: A five-month-old baby has reportedly been killed by a stray bullet in the Saudi city of Khamis Mushayt (file photo). Saudi Arabia banned 'joy gunfire' two years ago but the practice continued despite a crackdown . Arab News reported that the baby, a Moroccan national named Tufaha, was with her mother on the pavement outside a travel agent where her father Saeed was buying tickets to Morocco. The bullet is said to have descended vertically from the sky, lodging in the baby's forehead and destroying her skull. 'My wife had found Tufaha covered in blood', the girl's father told Arab News. 'A young Saudi man had helped transfer my baby to the Al-Hayat National Hospital Asir, while I was still inside the office, oblivious to what had happened.' The girl's father said he later received a phone call from his wife shouting and screaming and rushed to the hospital's intensive care unit. He was followed by detectives, forensic experts and security agents who he said tried to stop him from seeing his daughter's body. Toll: The girl's father told local media he was inside a travel agent in the city when she was hit (file photo). He added police would be reminding people through local mosques that 'joy gunfire' has been illegal since 2012 . Killed: The incident happened in the south eastern Saudi city of Khamis Mushayt, near the border with Yemen . 'Policemen told me later that a stray bullet that had come from within one square kilometer had settled in my child’s forehead,' he added, saying officers would be spreading warnings through the city's mosques. Once a popular sight at weddings, 'celebratory shooting' was outlawed by Saudi Arabia's authorities in 2012 over fears it was killing bystanders. But some people have continued the practice despite the dangers. Just a month after the ban, 23 people died near the Saudi oil community of Abqaiq when gunfire brought down an electrical cable which landed on a metal door and electrocuted the wedding party. Police have launched a crackdown on the tradition, deploying undercover patrol cars and shutting down some wedding ceremonies, according to local media and the BBC. Tradition: Celebratory gunfire is not limited to the Arab world but has been an enduring tradition among some tribal communities. Pictured: Bagefer tribesmen in Yemen attend a wedding ceremony with their guns in 2007 . Stray bullets are nothing new - they were blamed for 20 deaths in 1991 when Kuwaiti citizens fired their weapons into the sky to celebrate the end of the Gulf War. Three more deaths reportedly ensued when Iraqi football fans shot into the air in Baghdad to celebrate the team defeating Vietnam in the 2007 Asia Cup. And guns firing into the air  are not limited to the Arab world. Last month Indian media reported an eight-year-old girl had been killed at a wedding after the father of the groom fired his gun into the air in celebration. Children have also been killed by 'celebratory firing' in the U.S., which has 30,000 gun deaths a year. Last year ten-year-old Aaliyah Boyer died in the early hours of New Year's Day in Elkton, Maryland, after a neighbour fired a gun into the air during the festivities. From celebration to anger: Firing guns into the air has been a tradition in many parts of the world, including Kosovo (left) in the wake of the 1999 war and the West Bank (right) during a rally for the Palestinian Fatah party . Six months later a seven-year-old boy was killed by a stray bullet as he walked to a July 4 fireworks display with his father in Midlothian, Virginia. Brendon Mackey collapsed in the car park of a restaurant at about 9pm and doctors only realised he had a gunshot wound once he was being treated in hospital. British firearms expert David Dyson told MailOnline: 'If a bullet is fired into the air it will come down somewhere - it won't have the velocity or energy that it had when it left the barrel of the gun, but as is clearly evident, the energy can still be sufficient to cause death. 'When the bullet falls it may not have the stabilising rotational effect imparted by the rifling of the barrel, and can tumble. 'There is therefore an unknown element in that you can't predict whether the bullet will land sideways for instance, although the shape and type of the bullet has an effect.'","Baby's father was at a travel agent in the Saudi city of Khamis Mushayt .

"By . Josh Gardner . and Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . Miley Cyrus stole the show at this year's VMAs but instead of twerking and sticking out her tongue, the pop star grabbed the attention of the audience by promoting her pet cause - youth homelessness. The blonde singer won the Video of the Year award for her song Wrecking Ball but rather than take to the stage and mouth platitudes, Cyrus sent in her stead a young man named Jesse to read a speech about the subject close to the star's heart. 'My name is Jesse,' the 22-year-old said.

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . Arie Eddy, 18, has been struggling to find a job for almost three years and only managed to secure one job interview during that time . As youth unemployment continues to rise across Australia, more and more young people are struggling to find work. In Victoria the number of individuals under the age of 24 without work has hit a 15-year high, while in Queensland unemployment is also on the rise according to the ABS. Arie Eddy, from Warrnambool on the south-west coast of Victoria - about 260 kilometres from Melbourne, has been searching unsuccessfully for work for almost three years. 'It constantly makes me feel worthless. It makes me feel like I don't have any purpose and every day is hard to get through. I feel like I have no need to be around if I haven't got a job,' Arie told The Age. After leaving school in Hamilton at 16 to move south in search of a new life, the 18-year-old joined the military. However four months in he was forced out because he suffers from severe asthma. Victorian Council of Social Service chief executive Emma King told the publication the situation is also dire for graduates. 'They are continually told they don't have enough experience. We have a very competitive job market, they have done all the right things in terms of education,' she said. Over the past few years Arie estimated he'd applied for more than 780 jobs, but only secured one interview and remains unemployed. Youth unemployment rates are on the rise in many states, with the worst hit being Tasmania, followed by QLD . As a requirement of his youth allowance from Centrelink Arie must apply for 20 jobs each fornight, but so far it has been to no avail for the young Victorian. The Age report he receives $545 per fortnight from the government, but that is barely enough to survive once rent, bills, food, petrol amd asthma and depression medication are all taken care of. Arie said at least 30 of his friends are also struggling to find work, and his family in Hamilton are suffering financially too. While on youth allowance the government requires its recipients to apply for at least 20 jobs each fortnight . Now, after the hospitality course he was taking part in at TAFE was scrapped when funding was cut, he is considering following in his family's footsteps and getting into security. Arie's grandmother and aunts work in the industry and in six months time he will begin studying a Certificate II in security thanks to a course his employment agency has organised. With 95 percent of the cost taken care of, Arie is positive about the experience and hopes it will help turn his luck around and finally secure him a job. Despite Victoria's youth unemployment rates being at their highest in more than a decade, Tasmania is classified as the worst state for young people to find jobs. Queensland follows not too far behind.","Arie Eddy, from Victoria, has been unemployed since he was 16 .

"By . Paul Donnelley for MailOnline . A prisoner strangled his wife during a visit to the sex cell after she told him that she was leaving him. Ivan Milovanović, 35, is serving three years and ten months in the Penitentiary-Correctional Institution in Niš, southern Serbia for drugs trafficking. He is said to have throttled 29-year-old Bojana Bacević when she told him that she was emigrating, reports the Belgrade-based daily Blic. Ivan Milovanović, 35 and serving three years and ten months behind bars for drugs trafficking, is said to have throttled 29-year-old Bojana Bacević during a conjugal visit when she told him that she was leaving the country . The jail has two 'love rooms', adapted cells where couples can have their conjugal rights for two hours once every two months. 'There are no guards and no CCTV and Milovanović and his wife had used the room several times in the past,' said a prison spokesman. He added that none of the guards nor the prisoner using the other 'love room' heard anything suspicious. 'When guards returned two hours after letting them into the room they found the visitor dead on the bed. 'The prisoner says he lost his temper when his estranged wife told him it would be the last visit,' the spokesman added. Despite having left him Bojana Bacević still visited Ivan Milovanović for sex in the Penitentiary-Correctional Institution in Niš, southern Serbia . Milovanović was in jail for the fourth time, all drug trafficking-related offences. The victim's sister Bobana Radić claimed the couple had already broken up but that she kept seeing him because she felt sorry for him. 'She hated to think of him being lonely and abandoned so she kept going, but she was planning a new life,' she told local media. 'He was a mean, violent man and I think he would have got angry when she broke the news to him,' she added. She also alleged that Milovanović had told her he was going to kill her sister because she would be taking their daughter with him. After the murder, Mrs Radić was asked by social services to take the daughter but was unable because both she and her husband are unemployed and so the child was placed with her grandparents. Bojana Bacević told her estranged husband that she was moving abroad. He could not handle this final rejection even though the couple had already separated and strangled her .","Ivan Milovanović was serving 46 months behind bars for drugs offences .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . A woman watching the football at home with her family said she got the surprise of her life when one of their snacks wasn't quite what they had bargained for. Jessiica McDonald, from Darwin in the Northern Territory, said she and her family were having a few quiet drinks on Sunday afternoon when her dad opened up a packet of beef jerky. 'We were just having a few beers watching the footy, and he grabbed a packet of jerky out', Ms McDonald told Daily Mail Australia. A Darwin family got a nasty surprise when they discovered a dried cane toad in their beef jerky . Without even realising it her dad then reached into the packet, and apparently pulled out a cane toad and took a bite out of one of its legs. 'He said it was really crunchy and had a really nasty taste', Ms McDonald continued. 'It wasn't beef jerky at all.' She said fortunately she was not the one to take a bite, but her father wasn't so lucky. Describing it as 'absolutely putrid' the Darwin woman told NT News her family were disgusted by the gruesome discovery. Her father was apparently so engrossed in the football he didn't realise what he had eaten until it was too late. Jessiica McDonald described it as 'absolutely putrid' and said her father bit into the toad without realising . Cane toads produce poison through its parotid gland and some parts of its body are poisonous for many species including humans. Ms McDonald said her father hadn't suffered any illness from ingesting the toad. However as cane toads continue to populate the Northern Territory, some cooks have decided to take the opportunity to create their own delicacy from them. The cooks have started using the legs of the pest species in six different dishes and are dubbing it the 'new feral fine food'. Some cooks in the Northern Territory have taken to cooking up the poisonous pests . Darwin food blogger Emma Lupin said earlier this year the cane toad was overlooked as a food source. Ms Lupin's blog – Growing and Understanding Local Produce – is part of a community project that focuses on using locally grown foods. She and other members of the GULP community have come up with many recipes that incorporate the pest, and have developed ways to kill the animal so it releases the least amount of poison possible. She and other members of a food blog have created dishes that incorporate the cane toad's legs .","Jessiica McDonald was watching the footy at home with her family .

"By . Freya Noble for Daily Mail Australia . For some people a song, a smell or a certain place can evoke nostalgia and stir up strong memories from the past. For Lorelei Vashti, it's her dresses that hold the key. In her new book Dress, Memory: A Memoir Of My Twenties In Dresses, Ms Vashti explores the tumultuous decade of her life through her relationship with special items of clothing. 'A big part of the book and writing it was trying to understand why I had this relationship with clothing', she told Daily Mail Australia. In her new book Dress, Memory: A Memoir Of My Twenties In Dresses by Lorelei Vashti explores her emotional relationship with her clothes with this dress representing her 24th year . The book chronicles Ms Vashti's life through her twenties as she makes the link between important milestones in her life and the dress she was wearing at the time. Originally from Queensland but now based in Melbourne with quite a few other stops in between, she has collected dresses to mark her experiences around Australia and the world. But she admitted it was extremely difficult to decide just which frocks would make the cut. 'It's almost like my wardrobe is a bit of a zoo and they're all different animals... The zoo of dresses they all called to me they were howling and hooting and tweeting,' Ms Vashti said. 'I really chose the dresses that had a big impact, where I thought I had really changed', she revealed. The book chronicles her life for a decade and the events and milestones associated with certain dresses, starting with this frock which she associates with her 20th year . This dress marks her 25th year, and was originally a child's cape which she altered so it would fit . Each dress is associated with a particular crossroad or milestone in the 34-year-old's journey through her twenties, though this one she refers to as her Once Upon A Time dress which relates to her younger self . In her twenties she 'sunk into this obsessive behaviour' where she could not leave the house in an outfit that didn't 'feel right'. 'During those early years I didn't really understand I was getting depressed and it really hit me, this became a behaviour that was really obsessive.' This notion is explored through the book and Ms Vashti said: 'I think it's definitely something a lot of women would relate to and it's really personal... It's a very emotional thing.' 'I was almost killed by my wardrobe', she added, referring to it in both a mental and physical sense - she had many mishaps with cheap clothes horses and wardrobes which often toppled over and saw her buried beneath piles of dresses. Named the Rockefeller Thai Wedding, this frock associated with her 28th year was worn to at party at the Rockefeller Centre in New York and two years later to a friend's wedding in Thailand . Ms Vashti purchased this vintage dress for her 30th birthday and describes it as 'a mix of 1940s and 1980s' Dresses like this elegant lace one which is number 22, have been kept for decades and Ms Vashti has become more attached to them since she wrote the book . Many of the 34-year-old's favourite frocks were handmade or passed down from her mother and two older sisters, and these are the ones that hold the most memories. The one that is most special to her is a paisley shift dress which Ms Vashti's mum originally wore when pregnant with her eldest daughter. 'I love that one, it's just so saturated with meaning. I remember clearly my elder sisters wearing it out to parties in the '90s,' Ms Vashti said. She gave birth to her own daughter just four months ago, and revealed 'I even wore it when I was pregnant!', though admitted the '60s dress was a little short when her belly filled it out and now served as more of a top than a frock. Her favourite dress of all was one her mother first owned (left)  which went through both her sisters' wardrobes before it landed in her hands (right) Ms Vashti, pictured here in New York's Central Park in 2007, associates certain frocks with specific memories . Now with a daughter of her own, she hopes that some of her vast clothing collection will be passed down another generation . While Dress, Memory - which evolved from her blog of the same title - was an attempt to let go of the dresses she had become so attached to, Ms Vashti said the exact opposite occurred. 'They've got more meaning now than ever... It totally backfired on me - I feel like a fool!' she laughed. Now with a bigger collection of dresses than ever, Ms Vashti said her own mother's penchant for keeping clothes for decades had a huge impact on the way she thought about what she wore. 'It influenced me immensely - it's almost like I saw these clothes modelled on real life models (mother and sisters) before I wore them,' she said. In the book Ms Vashti tells of her time spent in a band in her early twenties, and the dresses she used to wear on stage . The book originally evolved from a blog, and tells of the huge impact her own mother's wardrobe had on her relationship with clothing . Ms Vashti had many mishaps with cheap clothes horses and wardrobes which often toppled over and saw her buried beneath piles of dresses . There is a lot of focus on how each dress made her feel when she stepped out of the house . 'I was able to see how they moved and I think I was excited by the way I could see them come to life.' The author speaks, and writes, about the dresses almost as if they are a part of her, intrinsically linked to the woman she was each time she wore a particular one. 'For the actual process of writing I put on those dresses and sat down and typed remembered what it was like to be that girl,' Ms Vashti said. By the end of the book it is evident how much the 34-year-old has grown, and she had one more thing to add for her readers. 'You wont always be that 22-year-old girl wondering whether you will feel right.'

"By . Associated Press . The first openly gay football player to be drafted by the NFL has prompted backlash after the moment when he kissed his boyfriend was broadcast across ESPN. Michael Sam celebrated his selection by the St. Louis Rams by hugging and kissing his partner, former Missouri varsity swimmer Vito Cammisano, knowing that the ESPN cameras were there waiting for his reaction. For some viewers, it showed joy and others took it as an offense. For the networks that carried and repeatedly aired the scene, it was business as usual. The call: Both Sam and his boyfriend Vito Cammisano cried tears of joy as they received the good news and would soon share a kiss that made pro sports history . Celebratory: Sam and his boyfriend kissed in front of the ESPN cameras which were broadcasting the moment nationally . Historic: Sam was in his agent's San Diego home when he received the call on Saturday . Producer Seth Markman, who oversees NFL draft coverage for ESPN, said that in the extensive preparation for Sam's possible draft, they never thought that it was a possiblity that they should account for- in spite of the fact that straight players regularly kiss their significant others once being drafted. ‘We never had one discussion about, ""What if he's drafted, his partner's there and they kiss?"" Honestly, it never came up,' Mr Markman said. Together: Both Sam and his partner were athletes at the University of Missouri . He suggested a possible generational split over how much it matters. 'When I got home last night and saw the attention (it was receiving), it kind of threw me,' he said. 'We're a young production crew and quite honestly it was just another moment in the years we've done this. 'In the truck, we were only saying, . ""Wow, this is great emotion here.' No one stepped up and said, 'Oh, wow, . do we really want to be showing this?'"" The . same holds true for the NFL Network, which had an agreement to show the . video taken by ESPN at the San Diego home of Sam's agent and first . aired by Disney-owned ESPN. 'We . had no discussion on the NFL Network side about how or how much or how . little we would show, if or when Michael was selected,' said Mike . Muriano, NFL Network senior coordinating producer. 'We . were certainly not blind or deaf to the cultural significance,' but . draft day can be similarly life-changing for all the players and those . close to them, he said. 'We try to tap into that with all these kids.' Timing . amplified and extended the story's play on both networks, since it came . near the draft's conclusion and the networks could stick with Sam . instead of quickly moving on to another pick. If . the display of affection had been edited by ESPN, Markman said, it . would have been inconsistent with more than three decades of draft-day . coverage that includes a long string of players kissing their . girlfriends. Happy man: Sam announced that he was gay months before the draft, but now that he has been selected, he will be the first openly gay member of the NFL . Context: Though gay marriage and homosexual kisses have become more commonplace in certain entertainment shows, some argue that the hyper-masculine world of football is not ready for the shift . 'We're there to document the moment, not make a political statement,' he said. GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said she was thrilled that ESPN and the NFL Network carried the couple's display of affection. 'As media and corporations continue to embrace and support LGBT people, it's almost second nature that there isn't a mechanism to think twice about, ""Could that be controversial, is that overstepping?""' Ellis said. The growth of gay marriage and news coverage of ceremony-sealing kisses by gay and lesbian couples has become increasingly commonplace. The quick pecks between Sam and Cammisano — they even shared cake, wedding style — were similar, but different. Context is everything, and the context is the hyper-manly sport of football, where muscles and toughness reign and, until Sam, the only sexuality openly displayed was hetero. 'The definition of masculinity shifted . today, whether consciously or not, because during the hyper-masculine . NFL draft, a man kissed another man on national television. The NFL and . the media are expanding everyone's consciousness,' said Wade Davis, a . former NFL player who is the executive director of You Can Play Project, . an advocacy group aimed at getting homophobia out of sports. Landmark moment: Sam and his boyfriend Cammisano partied Saturday night away in Las Vegas after the draft . To write off negative reaction as bigotry is to oversimplify it, Davis said. 'People are used to seeing two people being intimate during the NFL draft. Just not these two people,' said Davis, who is gay. 'It's not necessarily people being homophobic. I think people push back naturally because it's so much out of the norm.' Sam's embrace of Cammisano was instinctive, not a plotted-out statement, said Howard Bragman, the vice chairman of Reputation.com and public relations expert has been working with Sam. 'Once you make that leap as a gay . person (to come out), you want to live your life openly and freely and . not use a filter of what's appropriate according to social norms,' Bragman said Saturday. 'If today is about anything, it's about being able to do that and being authentic.' SEC Defensive Player of the Year: The highly decorated Sam disappointed at the scouting combine, causing his draft stock to plummet . Reaction to the video was mostly positive, Muriano said, although he acknowledged that the expression of gay affection is at odds with some people's beliefs. Some online postings deplored the kiss as inappropriate for family viewing; others were even harsher in their distaste. But it's inevitable, Muriano said, that for football and sports in general 'it's an image that will last.' Sam, who was not certain to be drafted and was taken with the 249th overall pick out of 256, still has to prove himself to make the team, but he's already helping to make a difference off the field. When Markman's wife explained to their 7-year-old son that dad was busy working on something that was controversial, Sam's kiss on TV, the boy replied: 'Is it because they're not married?'","ESPN has been the source of outrage after airing Michael Sam's celebratory kiss with his boyfriend after being drafted to the NFL .

"By . Joshua Gardner . A now-retired Super Bowl-winning NFL running back went on a Twitter tirade on Saturday after openly gay 2014 draft pick Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on television. Derrick Ward, 33, who was a member of the New York Giants Super Bowl XLII-winning team, didn't hide his disdain for ESPN's decision to air Sam's smooch with boyfriend Vito Cammisano after learning he would become a St. Louis Ram. 'Man U got little kids lookin at the draft,' Ward complained. 'I can't believe ESPN even allowed that to happen.' Scroll down for video . Outrage: Derrick Ward, once a running back for the Houston Texans and New England Patriots, took to Twitter Saturday to complain about the kiss shared between NFL draftee Michael Sam and his boyfriend on Saturday . PG13? Ward initially complained that the kiss should not have been aired on TV, where children could see it . While Ward's complaint began with him chastising the sports network on which the kiss aired, the conversation soon went in other directions thanks to a flurry of responses he elicited, some supportive and others critical of the retired footballer's opinion. Just six minutes after his original post, Ward responded to those critics. 'Everyone who comments on my page saying what dude did was fine is getting blocked. So far I've blocked 10 people,' he tweeted. The former Tampa Bay Buccaneer and Houston Texans running back continued to defend his words into Saturday night. 'The paring (sic) your tongue into the other persons mouth is a little over board,' he wrote. 'But people seen that as oh I'm bashing him because he's gay. Who cares!!!' Not all of Ward's followers disagreed with his stance. Several hours into his tirade, he wrote: . 'But for real though most of u need to read the bible. It'll explain a lot in that book. #knowledge' To which @Numerologynow replied: . 'I DON'T NEED THE BIBLE to know what @ESPN showed on TV was Disgusting - America is going the way of Rome #HISTORY' Context: Though gay marriage and homosexual kisses have become more commonplace in certain entertainment shows, some argue that the hyper-masculine world of football is not ready for the shift . Split decision: Ward immediately began to defend himself as critics--and supporters--gave their 2 cents . #knowledge: Ward suggested that his critics read the Holy Bible . While his followers appeared split as to whether to applaud or condemn Ward's candor, Ward refused to back down. His last tweet on the subject, posted Sunday morning after 2am reads:'Twitter. The people that twisted my words around are the same people who are on twitter 24/7 trying 2get some1 famous 2 say the wrong thing.' While Ward appears to be the most outspoken critic of Michael Sam connected to the NFL thus far, his condemnation of the on-air kiss was not the first. Current Miami Dolphin Don Jones tweeted 'OMG' and then 'Horrible' in reaction to the kiss, according to the Miami Herald.","Former Super Bowl champion Derrick Ward, 33, spoke out following Sam's lip lock with his boyfriend after he was drafted .

'It was a like a rush, sweating, heart beating real fast,' grandmother Ava Farley told CBS. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Ava Farley and her grandson Clintay Jones, 10, said they started feeling strange after eating some mushroom pizza this weekend . Unfortunately her 10-year-old grandson felt even worse after consuming his meal. 'I started feeling like dizzy and like crazy,' said Clintay Jones. 'He started cussing, going off, talking crazy, ran out the door butt naked,' Farley said of her grandson's behavior. The pair had such an adverse reaction to their food that they were rushed to the LA County/ USC Medical Center. After doctors evaluated the Farley's urine they found traces of marijuana intoxication.They questioned the boy and grandmother to see if marijuana was a drug used in their home. 'They questioned him like, ‘Have you had any of this? Did you do this? Is there anything in the house? Is this normal?’ No, all we had was pizza,' Farley said. This pizza resembles the 'laced' pizza that the family ate over the weekend . Eva Farley (left) and her grandson Clintay Jones (right) had to be rushed to the hospital . Farley's granddaughters also ate the pizza but they took the mushrooms off leading Farley to believe it was the mushrooms that were coated with marijuana. CBS did not name publicly name the pizza shop but they spoke to the shop's owner, Eduardo Selbereo, who said he finds the accusations to be ludicrous. 'No, that’s incredible, because nobody smokes marijuana right here,' Selbereo said. The pizza shop has a good health record with a 95 out of 100 from the LA County Department of Health. Farley says she may sue the shop, regardless of their health record. 'I think that it’s a threat to the community,' the grandmother said.

"By . Associated Press . A drunken, unruly airline passenger groped three women before air marshals arrested him and the London-bound plane turned back to Philadelphia, according to court documents. Robert John Coppack, 40, of La Verne, California, will remain in custody until a detention and probable cause hearing Monday in federal court. According to an FBI affidavit, two women sitting with Coppack complained about his behavior on the overnight US Airways flight Tuesday, prompting the crew to steer him toward the back of the plane.

Offloaded: Robert John Coppack was moved to the rear of the plane, where he was restrained until the aircraft returned to Philadelphia and taken away. He is now in custody . Turning back: The flight only got as far as Cape Cod before it was forced to turn around . Coppack then groped a retired flight attendant as he walked down the aisle, the affidavit said. Coppack, who told his seatmates he had been drinking vodka, was also aggressive and verbally abusive, the affidavit said. He was detained on board by an air marshal on the flight, and later charged with intimidating the crew and interfering with their work. Neither a public defender assigned to his case nor relatives listed at his California address returned calls for comment Wednesday. Flight attendants sent him to the back of the plane, and that’s where federal air marshals met him.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Citing beer cans and used condoms that constantly litter his lawn, a Northwestern University professor has quit his job because of the campus’s hard-partying culture. Dr. Mark Waymack was an Adjunct Associate Professor in Medical Humanities and Bioethics at Northwestern at the school’s medical school, but not anymore. He’s moving on from the prestigious university and, along with his prophylactic covered yard, he blames the administration’s lenient attitude toward student antics. He’ll also be relocating from his home of 18 years that sits very near the Evanston, Illinois campus. Partied out: After living near the Evanston, Illinois campus of Northwestern University for 18 year, Dr. Mark Waymack has decided to quit his job at the school and blames its hard-partying, raucous students . ‘My perception is there’s a culture of tolerance or perhaps indifference on the institution’s part that students will be students,"" Waymack wrote in a letter of resignation that was read at a local council meeting. ‘I hold you and your office accountable for this sort of behavior.’ That behavior, says Waymack, apparently includes hanky panky in his backyard. ‘The used condoms tend to show up in the back yard, actually,’ Waymack told CBS Chicago, and ‘the vomit, the beer cans in the hedges. I think they horse around late at night.’ And speaking of antics of a sexual nature, an archaic ‘brothel law’ began to be enforced once again in 2011 in an attempt to limit the number of occupants in student housing as a means of cutting down on off-campus partying. And in October 2010, a party became so out of control—with unconcealed public urination, belligerent screaming about blow j**s, and liberally strewn vomit—that neighbors took their anger to the school’s dean. Partying down: Pictured is one of Northwestern's annual Dillo Day festivals. Waymack says these occasions often mean his year will be strewn with beer, vomit, and condoms the next day . The Dean of Students responded in kind with a letter sent to all off-campus students, which Gawker subsequently published. ‘Messages have been circulating between residents and City officials including the Mayor, Alderman, Chief of Police and University officials including President Schapiro,’ wrote the incensed dean. ‘Reports have flooded our offices about NU students being rude, urinating and vomiting on people's property often within the view of the property owner and their children. After the parties, piles of garbage, cups, bottles and kegs were strewn about yards and parkways- often in clear view from the street for more than 24 hours, and some properties have still not fully cleaned up. Put simply... this is unacceptable behavior and is not the way to begin a new year with your fellow Evanston residents.’ Too fun? Northwestern has long been known for its excellent academics but in recent years its gained a party school image as well, even instituting so-called 'brothel laws' to curb partying . The dean went on to ask, 'Didn't they learn ANYTHING from their parents or from the 12 years of school that preceded their relocation to Evanston?' The school had little to say about Waymack's departure, however. 'The university tries to be a good neighbor and hopes our students are good neighbors as well,' said a spokesman. 'We wish him well in his future endeavors.' Apparently, the dean's 2010 email didn’t resonate to future students. At least not strongly enough for Waymack's liking. The professor plans to move on from Evanston and from his Northwestern job, but will retain his position as an associate professor of philosophy at Chicago’s Loyola University.","Dr. Mark Waymack blames an administration that turns a blind eye to the Evanston, illinois university's hard-partying students .

"By . Katy Winter . The rise of health-conscious female role models such as Miranda Kerr, 31, Kelly Brook, 34, and Kim Kardashian, 33, has sparked a huge increase in the numbers of women working out multiple times per week. A survey of over 2,000 gym-goers people has shown a 62 per cent increase in the number of women working out over the last 12 months. While still an activity dominated by men, the proportion of women amongst this group of gym-goers rose significantly, from 9 per cent to 14.6 per cent. Scroll down for video . Stars like Kelly Brook regularly post photos of themselves working out, lifting weights and eating healthily on their social media accounts . Kim Kardashian posted this snap of her muscular and toned derriere on Instagram recently . Participants were asked how long they . had been working out for and the number that had worked out regularly (but . only within the last year) compared with those who have worked out . regularly (and have done so for a long period time) was a difference . of 62%. And as well as hitting the gym more often these women are increasingly using supplements, such as protein shakes, to maximise the effectiveness of their workout. Dubbed the ‘Protein Princesses’, these females are working out (which incorporates exercise classes, gym sessions, running etc) between four and five times a week and are typically in their mid twenties, with an average age of 24. Unlike men, their main motivations aren't to build muscle, but to burn fat and get the toned and lean bodies typified by their favourite female stars. Other motivators include the rise of celebrity-endorsed fitness supplements and the surge in popularity of so-called ‘fitspiration’ images on social media websites, with celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Millie Mackintosh, 24, regularly snapping themselves mid-workout in skimpy gym gear. Unlike men, Protein Princesses like Milile Mackintosh are working out to burn fat and get toned and lean bodies . The poll, which covered 2,312 fitness fans in total, revealed that the most popular supplements women take are whey-protein products such as protein shakes, on-the-go protein snacks and vitamin and mineral supplements. It also revealed that the biggest pull factor when it comes to selecting a brand is the product’s taste and flavour. A spokesman for Bodybuilding Warehouse, who conducted the survey, said of the study: 'The rise in women working out up to . five times a week and complementing their work-outs and healthy eating . regimes with protein supplements could well be down to the increase in . celebrities posting results of their fitness regimes on social media and . the rise of celebrities now spotted with protein shakes in their hands. Inspired by stars posting pictures after every workout, Protein Princesses work out around five times a week . 'The wide variety of new snack protein products such as protein coffee and muffins now available, means that getting much needed protein into an everyday diet is fun and even easier. I’m thrilled that more women are getting active and enjoying the many benefits of exercise and healthy living.' Jéan LK, Head Trainer and owner of www.Timed-Fitness.com, says: 'The number of women who are immersing themselves fully into a health and fitness lifestyle is growing. Mainly because of the greater awareness of the benefits of exercise and how it relates to everything from our social lives, food and fashion. 'Working out 5 times a week is fine. You just have to be very aware of your body to make sure you are not over doing it. 'You have to make sure you are well rested, hydrated and on top of your nutrition. Plan out your workouts so you are not doing the same things all week. 'You can split your workouts into body parts, upper / lower body sessions, cardio / weight days or try different things between gym days like yoga, Pilates, swim etc. 'Supplements are fine you just have to be aware of what's in it. We are seeing great results from Spirulina (Organic burst) which is a super food that is great source of digestible protein and contains all the essential amino acids as well as vitamin b6 and iron so is great as a post work out drink or tablet to aid in recovery. 'I would stay away from diets and focus on a balanced nutrition plan, eating a minimum of three meals and two healthy snacks that include lean meats and fish and vegetables including complex carbohydrates. Stay away from processed food and sugary drinks.'","There is a 62% increase in women working out between 4-5 times a week .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . This chilled out brown bear looks like he has all the necessities of life, as he relaxes in the river with a tasty, freshly-caught salmon. The beast looks rather like he is sitting back in a swimming pool with an ice cream cone - and he deserves his rest after a hard day of competing with others for the best fishing spots. The hungry bears waited at Brook Falls in the Katmai National Park, Alaska, as the salmon made their way up the river. Scroll down for video . Just like eating an ice cream: This giant grizzly bear enjoys a bit of respite from fishing and tucks into a freshly-caught salmon in the cold waters . Look out!

Location, location, location: Two bears fiercely right it out for a prime fishing spot, as a better spot means more fish and a happier bear . But there were violent clashes as the giant animals all looked to secure the best spots for themselves - resulting in some incredible photographs. As the fish try to jump from the water the bears attempt to pluck them out of the air with their jaws or grab hold of their slippery skin with their paws. They waste no time gobbling them down when they succeed, remaining in the water to eat before getting back to work.

The photos were taken by Brice Petit, a 32-year-old from Geneva, Switzerland, who has spent years photographing brown bears in Finland and polar bears in Spitzberg, but had never been to Alaska - home of around 30,000 grizzlies - before. He said: 'Large dominant males do not leave their favourite places without a real confrontation which the younger would be wrong to try. Depending on the bears, size, age, weight there are several fishing techniques. 'Some wait patiently at the foot of the fall until the salmon runs between their legs, a simple technique and effective that requires minimal effort.

Vicious fight: Two bears clash amid tumultuous white waters as they both seek the best spot for catching the delicious salmon . 'Others stand at the top of the fall and catch salmon in flight with open jaws and legs ready to strike as the first fish passes. 'What is also surprising is the delicacy with which the bears eat their salmon. 'They always begin by removing the skin - which they eat - but with their jaws and legs it seems impossible to do so accurately. 'It is very likely that with a chef's knife I could not do as well in my kitchen.' Setting the scene: There are around 30,000 brown bears in Alaska.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . and Associated Press . A father who was accused of gunning down the drunk driver who killed his two sons on a rural road in 2012 has been found not guilty. David Barajas, 32, and his family broke down in tears as the decision was read in court in Angleton, Texas on Wednesday. It had taken the jury just three hours to reach their decision. 'I am relieved but still in pain,' Barajas said after the verdict. 'My two boys are dead and nothing will bring them back.' The bereaved father had faced a murder charge for shooting dead Jose Banda after the 20-year-old driver killed his sons, 11-year-old Caleb and 12-year-old David Jr. The boys had been helping to push their family's broken-down car when they were struck near Alvin, Texas in December 2012. Scroll down for video . Relief: David Barajas, who was accused of killing a driver who fatally knocked down his two sons along a rural Texas road in 2012, gets a kiss from his wife Cindy after he was acquitted of murder on Wednesday . Pained: Barajas, between his wife Cindy and his attorney Sam Cammack on Wednesday, said that while he was relieved about the verdict, he was still struggling with the loss of his two sons . Prosecutors had claimed that Barajas, overcome with rage, then returned home, retrieved a gun and fatally fired at the driver, who had a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit. They argued that while Bandas may have caused the deadly crash, he did not deserve to die in a 'revenge' killing. But the prosecution had faced a challenge in the courtroom, as none of the witnesses had been able to identify Barajas as the shooter and no gunpowder residue was found on Barajas' hands. Prosecutors had also faced overwhelming sympathy for Barajas. Many residents in Alvin, 30 miles southeast of Houston, supported him, while some have said they might have done the same thing in a similar situation. Happier times: Barajas, pictured with his family, lost his sons  Caleb (center) and David Jr. in the 2012 crash . Victims: David Barajas Jr., 12, (left) died at the scene and his brother Caleb, 11, (right) died later in hospital . Gunned down: Jose Banda, pictured with his baby girl and girlfriend, was shot in the head along the rural road in Alvin, Texas following the crash. But no gunpowder residue was found on Barajas' hands . A murder weapon was also never recovered. Bullet fragments were found in Bandas' car, but investigators testified that an empty holster found in Barajas' home would not have carried a gun that could have shot the bullets. Another investigator, Kent Nielson, testified that he found at Barajas' house a home security system that had a missing hard drive. Investigators have said security cameras outside of Barajas' home could possibly have captured video of someone entering or leaving the home after the crash. But when questioned by Cammack, Nielson said he didn't know if the security system was working on the night of the accident. Barajas' attorneys had faced a battle too as they never offered another suspect who could be responsible for the killing. One of his attorneys, Sam Cammack, told jurors his client did not kill Banda and was instead focused only on saving his sons the night they were hit. Barajas would not have had the time to go back and retrieve a gun, he said. It's over: Barajas, center, is escorted out of the Brazoria County Courthouse after he was acquitted . Respite: Cindy Barajas embraces a friend after a jury acquitted her husband of murder . Scene: Police gather at the scene where Banda fatally struck the two boys in Alvin in Devember 2012 . Collision: The boys had been helping push their father's broken-down car when they were hit by the driver . Dominick Sanders, the lead investigator with the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office, told jurors during the trial that the search of Barajas' home failed to find any evidence 'that made a direct link from (Barajas) to the crime scene'. Cammack asked Sanders if he could tell jurors who shot Banda and Sanders said he didn't have any direct knowledge on who did it. 'What in the heck are we doing here?' Cammack said. During the testimony, dash-camera video from a deputy's patrol vehicle was also played and Cindy Barajas, the boys' mother, could be heard screaming, 'No, not my babies.' If he had been convicted, Barajas would have faced life in prison.","David Barajas had been accused of shooting dead Jose Banda, 20, after he knocked down his sons, 11-year-old Caleb and 12-year-old David Jr.

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . It is often said that if you buy property in a prime inner-city location you are sure to see a healthy return on your investment. But a new analysis of house prices across Australia shows that it is often the cheaper locations in middle-ring and outer-ring suburbs that see higher rates of house price growth. A report compiled by property investment website hotspotting.com.au identified the suburbs around Australia where homeowners have seen the best returns on their investment over the past 10 years. Scroll down for video . Australia's top property picks by suburb, their median house price and the average annual growth in house prices over the past decade . Researchers analysed the average annual growth in median house prices over the past decade in suburbs in capital cities and towns in regional areas. But the analysis shows that few so-called 'prime suburbs' in Australia's capital cities have leading capital growth rates. 'Most people can't afford to buy in those suburbs so the market for those areas is quite thin,' said Terry Ryder, founder of Hotspotting. 'Quite a small percentage of people can afford to buy property there. 'People might aspire to buy there but that doesn't translate into demand, and demand is how prices get pushed up.' In Sydney, the 20 most expensive suburbs all have median prices above $1.7 million – and only one of these suburbs makes the top 20 list for long-term capital growth. The only exception was Melbourne, with half of the city's 20 most expensive suburbs making the Top 20 list for long-term price growth. But the report said it was not the 'ritzy south-eastern precinct' around Toorak which dominated the top 20 list – it was million-dollar suburbs east of the CBD such as Deepdene, Mont Albert and Kew. This house is for sale at 11 Nicholls Way in Pemulwuy. The western Sydney suburb was the best for long-term capital growth in the city . In comparing capital cities, Darwin was the growth leader with most of its suburbs recording double-digit growth averages. Sydney and Canberra were the poorest performers, with the worst suburbs in Darwin charting growth rates large enough to make the top 20 lists in Sydney and Canberra. The report analysed data from Australia Property Monitors, excluding suburbs with fewer than 30 annual sales. It also excluded Hobart as there was no price data dating back 10 years. SYDNEY . Sydney property has seen a big price growth in the past 12-18 months, but the long-term growth rates of Sydney suburbs remain among the worst in the nation. The best suburb in Sydney was Pemulwuy in the west, which recorded a median house price of $666,000 and an average growth of 10.2 percent over 10 years. By contrast, the city's most expensive area Bellevue Hill, in the eastern suburbs, had a median house price of $3.35 million but an average growth of just 4 percent over 10 years.

The city's most expensive area Chandler, in the east, had a median house price of $1.2 million but an average growth of 5.4 percent over 10 years.

This house is for sale at 60 Quay Street in Bulimba, Brisbane . The house is on the river and has three bedrooms and two bathrooms . DARWIN . The report said that a genuine shortage of dwellings in Darwin had led to the city having the highest residential rents and highest capital growth rates of any Australian capital city. The best suburb in Darwin was Berrimah in the inner-east, which recorded a median house price of $947,000 and an average growth of 15.2 percent over 10 years. The city's most expensive area Larrakeyah, in inner Darwin, had a median house price only just higher than Berrimah at $950,000 but it recorded an average growth of only 6.3 percent over 10 years.

This house is for sale at 3 Leveque Street in Harrison . It has four bedrooms and is listed for $690,000 . REGIONAL . Long-term capital growth rates were on average much higher in regional Australia than they were in metropolitan areas, thanks in large part to the mining boom. Fifteen towns in the regional top 20 were resource centres or towns that have been boosted recently by mining activity. The top town for long-term capital growth was Newman in the East Pilbara, with a median house price of $780,000 and an average growth of 22.2 percent over 10 years. But the report warned that mining towns are no longer in favour with property investors, because most mining towns have suffered marked decreases in property values and rentals in the past 12-18 months either through dwelling oversupply or a sharp decline in demand from buyers and tenants.","New analysis of house prices across Australia shows cheaper locations in middle and outer suburbs often see highest rates of house price growth .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . Emma White, 36, was dancing along to the Wii programme when she lost control of her bladder . A mother has credited her Wii console with saving her life after it alerted her to symptoms of cervical cancer. Emma White, from Faversham, Kent, was dancing along to the Wii programme when she lost control of her bladder. The 36-year-old was celebrating her daughter’s birthday on Boxing Day last year when the embarrassing incident happened. Concerned because she had never experienced incontinence before, Ms White went to see her GP, who found she was bleeding from her cervix . Within a week, tests revealed the mother-of-six had cervical cancer. A scan revealed she had a tumour the size of an egg sitting on the cervical . wall - and this was pushing against her bladder. Ms White said: 'I was devastated - I have six children to care for. 'I knew something was wrong when I wet myself, I’d never experienced incontinence in the past. 'I’d also suffered from irregular periods, so after months of putting it off, I decided to go to my GP. 'Thankfully it took just six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before a scan showed my tumour had completely gone.' Ms White first blamed her tell-tale signs of cervical cancer - such as irregular periods - on recently having given birth to daughter Everlyn-Ray in March 2013. The former nursery practitioner said: 'My partner Gary and I were over the moon when we found out I was pregnant with Everlyn. 'But my labour was different this time and my cervix didn’t dilate properly. 'I look back now and think there’s a strong possibility I already had the cancer when I gave birth which terrifies me. 'It took until November for me to realise that it had been over six months and my body still wasn’t back to normal. 'I just kept thinking I was going to get better so delayed going to the doctors. 'On my daughter’s birthday on Boxing Day it’s a tradition for our family to have a dance off on the Wii. 'I’d never had any accidents before so it was a complete shock. Ms White said she knew something was wrong when she exprienced loss of bladder control, as she had never suffered from it before. She also had symptoms such as irregular periods and back pain. After the cancer diagnosis, she underwent six weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy . 'We all laughed and I joked that I couldn’t get married wearing a tena lady.' In hindsight, she says there were other symptoms, too. ‘I was also suffering with lower back ache - which is also a sign of cervical cancer - even before I had Everlyn.' Despite that, I was up to date with all my smear tests and never dreamt this could happen to me. 'I want to encourage other women to not delay going to the doctors like I did.' She said: 'I thought doctors would suggest a hysterectomy which I was happy with. I just wanted to live to see my children grow up. 'But they decided the best course of action for me was to undergo six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Ms White (with partner Gary) said her children were instrumental in keeping her spirits up during treatment. She will find out next month if it has been successful. Her children, clockwise from top left, are: Jake, 14, Trevor, 17, Ella-Rose, 13,Ruby, 8, Everylyn-Ray, 17 months, and Bettsie, 11 . About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. The symptoms aren't always obvious and may not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage. In . most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. It usually occurs . after sex although any unusual bleeding should be investigated. Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine. If . the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including . constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain and . swelling in the legs and kidneys. The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It . is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early . abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the . cervix (neck of the womb). 'My treatment included internal radiotherapy called brachytherapy. Ms White will find out next month whether the treatment has been successful and if she has the all-clear. She said: The treatment was really tiring and at times, I felt like giving up. 'But as soon as I got home and saw my children again, I knew I had to fight. 'I really don’t think I could’ve done any of this without them.' Her children, Trevor, 17, Ella-Rose, 13, Bettsie, 11, Ruby, 8, Everylyn-Ray, 17 months and stepson Jake, 14, were all affected by the devastating news. Ms White said: 'I want to thank my amazing family, children and friends from the bottom of my heart. 'Even in my darkest moments they all managed to brighten my day. 'One of my friends is taking part in a Shine Walk for cervical cancer in my name soon; I’m so honoured and proud of her. “I also want to thank the incredible support I received from both the Macmillan nurses and Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust.' Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust said: 'Every year 3,000 UK women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 300,000 women will be told they have abnormal cells on the cervix that may require treatment. 'Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust offers information and support to women, their friends and family affected by cervical cancer and abnormalities. 'We urge all women who are eligible for cervical screening to attend when invited. It could, quite simply, save their life.'

"By . David Martosko In Houston . Bashir offered an alternative version of the Lord's Prayer . Down the street from the George R.Brown Convention Center in Houston Texas, National Rifle Association members fumed at reports that MSNBC host Martin Bashir mocked their plans to attend a Sunday morning prayer breakfast after the group's annual convention wraps up. On his cable network show Thursday, British import mocked gun-owning churchgoers and the Second Amendment organizers who have successfully blended a gun-rights social platform with evangelical Christianity. 'There is also a prayer breakfast at this weekend's conference,' Bashir said, 'presumably to include the NRA's version of the Lord’s Prayer: ""Thy kingdom come, help me keep my military-style gun""; ""Give us this day our daily dead""; and other various phrases like that.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bashir, who identifies himself as a committed Christian and once worked for the BBC on its popular Songs of Praise hymn-sing show - Great Britain's most popular religious television program - lamented that other Christians don't see a threat in the gun-rights movement. 'This is not a freak organization,' he explained. 'You describe Ted Nugent in the way you do, and some of these speakers, and yet they are paid to attend.' 'There are large numbers who will be hearing this [prayer breakfast]. Yet they spew this kind of venom about an issue that is as saddening and shockingly disturbing for us all, after what happened in Newtown and all the other massacres that we reflect on.' Dr. Bob Reccord, a family-values political leader who once oversaw more than 5,000 evangelical missionaries for the Southern Baptist Convention, will be the prayer breakfast's keynote speaker on Sunday morning . Wayne LaPierre (R) is the NRA's long-time executive vice president. Together with president David Keene (L), a former top dog at the influential American Conservative Union, he has marshaled gun owners into a powerful political force that stands against Congressional Democrats and President Obama on gun control issues . At the Lobby Bar in the Hilton Americas-Houston hotel, NRA members flipped their lids when MailOnline played a brief video of Bashir's comments shortly after the Twitter-tracking website Twitchy distributed it Thursday night. 'I wish someone would slap some sense into that idiot,' said a Dallas native named Bob who said he was attending the NRA convention for the first time. 'Nothing gets me more worked up than self-righteous religious people who think they have all the answers,' he said, 'I go to church every Sunday, and I'll be at the prayer breakfast.' Then, with sudden, beer-infused bravado, Bob stood and intoned, 'He can have my prayer breakfast ticket when he pries it from my cold, dead hands!' Conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck, a former Fox News personality who now has his own online pay-per-view shows, will headline a 'Stand and Fight Rally' at the NRA convention Saturday night . Convention-goer Janet Bero waited in line to have her German Luger pistol appraised by hosts of the NRA's Antiques Guns and Gold Showcase, an Antiques Roadshow-like television program focuses largely on firearms . Tickets for the event cost $35 each. The 'cold, dead hands' line is a hat-tip to the late actor Charlton Heston, who uttered the memorable quip at the NRA convention in 2000 when he was the organization's president. Referring to then-presidential candidate Al Gore as a gun-control advocate, Heston closed his keynote speech that year by saying, 'As we set out this year to defeat the divisive forces that would take freedom away, I want to say those fighting words for everyone within the sound of my voice to hear and to heed - and especially for you, Mr. Gore - ""From my cold, dead hands!""' Charlotte, a middle-aged mother of two who flew to Houston from Nebraska, told MailOnline that Bashir 'is the kind of Brit we should deport before [President Barack] Obama pushes his immigration legislation through.' 'It'll be too late by then, won't it?' she chuckled. And Jim from Oklahoma City predicted that the MSNBC host's 'rants will fall on deaf ears anyway. I bet no one here for the convention has ever watched MSNBC. Have you? I sure haven't.' 'He's preaching to the choir,' he said, before adding, 'D'ya think his church has a choir?' All three NRA members asked MailOnline not to publish their last names. Dr. Rick Rigsby (R) is a former Texas A&M University professor who also served as character coach and chaplain for the college's football team, the Aggies . The biggest buzz at the 2013 convention surrounds gun control legislation that Second Amendment activists say threatens their freedoms under the U.S. Constitution. This attendee's gun-decorated shirt reads 'I don't dial 911' The NRA convention kicked off Thursday night with a sold-out fundraising dinner and auction to benefit the NRA Foundation, a charitable organization allied with the NRA that provides grants to support education programs about shooting sports. Saturday night's headliner, conservative broadcaster Glenn Beck is a Mormon who has been outspoken in his support for gun rights. The prayer breakfast will include remarks from Dr. Bob Reccord, a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention's offshoot that oversees the work of more than 5,000 Christian missionaries. He now leads the Council for National Policy, a conservative group founded by preacher Tim LaHaye, who authored the controversial yet popular Left Behind series of novels whose subject was a post-Rapture world after the second coming of Jesus Christ. Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz (L) and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), both outspoken pro-gun politicians, will speak during Friday afternoon's Leadership Forum at the NRA convention in Houston . A giant logo in the form of a sheriff's badge greets National Rifle Association members at the George R. Brown Convention Center in Houston. The NRA is America's largest gun rights lobby group . Liberal activists have described the Council as a right-wing version of the Council on Foreign Relations, an influence-building amalgamation of prominent family-values conservatives who serve as kingmakers in U.S. politics and build support for far-right policy. The far-left blog Daily Kos once dubbed the group 'Sith Lords of the Ultra-Right.' Other speakers at the prayer breakfast will include Buck Knives CEO Chuck Buck and Dr. Rick Rigsby, whose claim to fame is a 14-year stint at Texas A&M University as a 'character coach' and chaplain for the school's football team.","'I wish someone would slap some sense into that idiot'

"By . Helen Pow . An 84-year-old man has allegedly shot dead his chronically ill wife and daughter-in-law before turning the gun on himself in a tragic 'mercy killing.' Dan Crabtree, 80-year-old Carol Crabtree and 62-year-old Rita Delehanty were found dead in the elderly couple's home in Hacienda Heights, California, on Wednesday morning. Jim Crabtree, 55, the couple's son and Delehanty's husband of 25 years, said all three suffered from chronic illnesses, which is what led to the apparent murder-suicide. 'This is the classic ending of three people with terminal illnesses,' he said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Dead: Dan Crabtree, 84, pictured, allegedly shot dead his elderly wife Carol, right, and daughter-in-law before turning the gun on himself in a tragic 'mercy killing' He explained that his wife suffered from mid-stage Alzheimer's, his father from early-stage Alzheimer's and his mother from debilitating chronic joint pain that forced her to use a wheelchair. His wife's health was so bad that he had to wash and dress his wife every morning before dropping her off at his parents' home so he could go to work. On Wednesday, he did the same, without any sign of trouble but, hours later, they were all dead. Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives were still trying to determine the reason. Authorities found the three after a 911 call brought deputies to the quiet suburban neighborhood in Hacienda Heights. Sheriff's Lt. Dave Dolson said investigators found the couple and their daughter-in-law with gunshots wounds. Delehanty was dead in the living . room, Carol Crabtree's body was in a powered wheelchair in the back . bedroom and Dan Crabtree was barely alive on the backyard porch. A . shotgun and handgun were found near him. Tragic: Jim Crabtree, pictured left, said his 62-year-old wife Rita Delehanty, right, was also found dead in his parents' home in Hacienda Heights, California, on Wednesday morning . Supportive parents: Though Dan and Carol Crabtree, pictured right, were suffering from poor health, they agreed to care for their son's wife, Rita, pictured left some years ago, so he could work . 'We believe it's a murder-suicide,' Dolson said. 'All evidence right now points to the fact that the husband likely shot and killed the daughter-in-law and his wife, and then shot himself.' Investigators believe it was Dan Crabtree who may have made the 911 call indicating someone was shot at the house, Dolson said, but detectives didn't know the motive. 'At this point we really can't nail it down,' Dolson said. 'We may never.' Though Dan and Carol Crabtree were suffering from poor health, they agreed to care for their son's wife so he could work. His wife would have breakfast with . her in-laws each morning, and Jim Crabtree would go to his job as a . registered nurse who trained paramedics for the Los Angeles County . Department of Health Services. Later in the day, his parents would drop . his wife off at her home about a mile away, and paid caregivers would . take care of her until Crabtree returned.

"By . MailOnline Reporter . Amy Tatsch thought the worst had already passed when she was rescued off a Florida beach after being bitten by a 6-foot bull shark. But as she soon discovered, her struggle had barely begun. The mother of six, who was boogie boarding in waist-deep waters when she was bitten, says the next 13 days of her life were a 'blur' as her wound got infected from the ocean's bacteria-filled water. 'I really didn’t think I was going to make it back out with the amount of blood I saw,' Tatsch, 38, told ABC News about the attack that cut down to the bone on her lower right leg. Survivor: Amy Tatsch, a mother of six, was boogie boarding when a 6-foot bull shark tore off a huge chunk of her lower right leg . Doctors say that sharks' razor-sharp teeth aren't the only reason why their bites are deadly. Infections, which are common in shark bites, can at times be even scarier. 'Sea water is actually quite dirty,"" Dr. Daniel Segina, who treated Tatsch, told Florida Today. 'Not necessarily polluted dirty, but you have animals that live in the ocean and there is sand and dirt that float around in that environment,' he added. 'The contamination factor of a wound that is suffered in that type of aquatic environment is very high."" Segina, a traumatologist in Melbourne, Florida, said he doesn't use chemicals to clean up the wound. 'Just sterile water,' he told ABC News. 'For the most part, it’s been shown to be the most effective.' In Tastch's case, her infection resulted in severe pain after she the bite let her leg barely recognizable. She lost a muscle and her Achilles tendon was torn. She also needed a plasma transfution. Tatsch's injury got even worse once it became infected due to bacteria-filled ocean waters. It took her five surgeries and copious rounds of physical therapy before she could walk again weeks later . Her accident was nearly three months ago, but she's only just started walking without crutches two weeks past. She's yet to go back on a boogie board. 'But I have gone back in the water,' she added to ABC News.","Doctors say the ocean's dirty waters can infect bite wounds and lead to pain worse than the bite itself .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Nine Japanese porn stars will have their breasts broadcast live on television - while inviting random fans across Tokyo to participate in the 'hands on' experience. Loosely transcribed as 'Boob Aid', the well-known adult movie stars will bare their breasts for charity while the public line-up over a 24 hour period on Saturday. The adult actresses told local media on Monday they could barely contain their excitement about the 'Stop! AIDS' campaign event — which will be televised live — but asked, perhaps somewhat optimistically for the fans to be 'delicate'. Across 24 hours fans will line up to meet their favourite porn stars... The event will raise money for the Stop! AIDS campaign which raises money and awareness about the virus . 'I'm really looking forward to lots of people fondling my boobs,' actress Rina Serina told the Tokyo Sports newspaper.' 'But I would be very happy if you would please be delicate.' The event will be broadcast on adult cable television and the willing participants  will donate to the anti-AIDS campaign in exchange for a feel. Earlier this year sexist heckling of a Tokyo politician hit the headlines in Japan, highlighting old-fashioned views towards women that still permeate Japanese society. Actress 'Serina' who will be taking part said she never thought her breasts would be used for the greater good. 'I never thought my boobs could contribute to society,' she said. Fellow porn actress Iku Sakuragi had no qualms about being groped by hundreds of pairs of hands. 'It's for charity,' the 21-year-old said. 'Squeeze them, donate money — let's be happy.' Lawmakers from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling party sparked a public outcry in June when they subjected a Tokyo politician Ayaka Shiomura to sexist taunts, shouting 'why don't you get married?' at her during a debate on motherhood. Japan has one of the lowest rates of female workforce participation in the developed world and a lack of childcare facilities. Poor career support and deeply entrenched sexism are blamed for keeping women at home. The 24-hour event begins at 8pm on Saturday  and is backed by the Japan Foundation for AIDS Prevention.","Nine Japanese porn stars will have their breasts felt by fans for charity .

Footy star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin was allegedly called an 'ape' by a rival support during a game on Sunday. A 70-year-old supporter was evicted by police from Melbourne's Etihad Stadium on Sunday after fans allegedly heard him abuse the Sydney Swans forward during a match against the Western Bulldogs. The fan also allegedly abused another player during the game. The abuse is almost identical to the racial slur against fellow Swans forward Adam Goodes, who was called an 'ape' by a 13-year-old Collingwood fan during a match last season . Supporters in the ground complained about the man's 'offensive behaviour' to police, and he was escorted and given a penalty notice in relation to the incident. Witnesses say they heard the word 'ape' directed at the Franklin. However the Sydney Swans club confirmed that none of its players heard the slur. Franklin was one of the game's best, kicking six goals in the 63-point thumping of the Western Bulldogs in front of a crowd of 22,000. The 70-year-old man, from Newport in Melbourne's southwest, was evicted from the ground about 4.35pm, about halfway through he match when Sydney were already well in front. Scroll down for video . The Sydney Swans said that none of its players hear the allegations of racial abuse . Adam Goodes was also the subject of racial abuse during a match with Collingwood last year . An AFL Australia spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the man 'was not a club member' of the Western Bulldogs and that the incident was a matter for the police. It is the second time in a year that a Sydney Swans player has been racially abused, after legendary AFL footballer Adam Goodes was also called an Ape by a 13-year-old fan. The incident was further inflamed when Collingwood president Eddie McGuire said that Goodes should be used to promote the musical King King in Melbourne. Goodes,  the 2013 Australian Of The Year, went public over both incidents and earlier this year said McGuire's comments had ended their friendship. Two incidents of racial abuse were also reported at AFL matches last year, including one involving North Melbourne's Sudanese-born Majak Daw. Television reports said Daw, who escaped to Australia with his family from civil wars in Sudan, was racially abused by a Hawthorn supporter during a match at the MCG.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . A Queensland newsreader has apologised for causing offence when he shut down a viewer's ice bucket challenge on-air, insisting he didn't want to see the viral charity resemble the online drinking game 'neknominate'. Lincoln Humphries, a presenter for WIN Television on the Sunshine Coast, garnered widespread attention after saying 'everyone, everywhere' should give to other charities instead of following the ice bucket sensation, which raises awareness for ALS - a motor neurone disease (MND). He called for people to donate blood and give to a range of worthy causes, explaining his reasons for not partaking in the ice bucket challenge, before putting on sunglasses, crossing his arms and saying: 'Deal with it'. And although his segment has received some praise, other viewers weren't too impressed - prompting the newsreader to issue a public apology. Scroll down for video .

Shane Warne jumped on board electing to get doused in ice-cold water by his 14-year-old son Jackson . 'I support Project ALS to the utmost extent; and applaud their ingenious methods of spreading awareness and raising an immense amount of charitable funds for a worthy cause.' '(But) My gripe, and it is expressly my own, is the ice bucket challenge's departure from an awareness raising, charitable gem of an idea, to becoming the next 'neknominate'. The neknominate online drinking game that swept across social media involved people nominating others to film themselves sculling alcohol before nominating others to do the same. He said the segment which never went to air was a response to a nomination shared between him and a friend on Facebook. 'The segment never went to air in any form on television,' he said. 'It was a personal response to an ice bucket challenge which I shared on my personal wall and that of my mate.' The response to the ice bucket challenge as published in full on Lincoln Humphries Facebook . Mr Humphries, a Sunshine Coast sports presenter, became an overnight sensation when he declined the nomination and a video of his segment spread online. In the tirade he told 'everyone, everywhere' to stop 'pouring fresh water' over their head and 'wasting ice'. He encouraged people to show their support for The Red Cross and Cancer Council, instead. 'Ice is for keeping fresh produce fresh, beers cold and your nipples hard,' he said. He also said charity was not about 'putting yourself through mild discomfort with a bucket of ice and water.' Mr Humphries said he was 'pushing for a national, annual MND day'  to ensure the cause lasts. 'The fundraising has been nothing short of astounding,' he said. 'But we need to make sure it's something with longevity and real meaning.' He criticised people who poured ice and water over their head because it was a waste of the resource other countries are short on . He suggested a number of other charities as alternatives to the ALS challenge . After getting two nominations from fellow The Voice Australia coach Ricky Martin and from Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch, Kylie Minogue completed the challenge in true Kylie style . Jessica Mauboy took to Instagram on Saturday to share a picture of herself standing in a cosy white robe, doused in icy water . He said donating a day to the cause, like Daffodil Day which he is a strong supporter of, would help to maintain its longevity. '(It's) to ensure this isn't forgotten before the ice melts, so to speak, like so many Internet fads before it,' he said. It comes as a string of celebrities, both in Australia and around the world, have posted videos on social media showing their support for the ALS Project. Since the ice bucket challenge went viral earlier this month, everyone from Oprah Wingrey to Iggy Azalea and  have taken part in the stunt.

Balotelli was part of the Azzurri squad which was knocked out of the World Cup in the group stage and has faced a summer of speculation about his future with Milan reportedly ready to cash in on him. But Milan goalkeeper Abbiati insists the striker can go on to become as important to the Rossoneri as Ibrahimovic, who scored 42 goals in 61 games and won the Serie A title during a two-year stay with the club. Recovery: Mario Balotelli can bounce back from Italy's struggles at the World Cup, says Christian Abbiati . Improvement: The AC Milan keeper also believes Balotelli can become as important as Zlatan Ibrahimovic . Silverware: Ibrahimovic scored the goals which led Milan to the Serie A title in 2011 . Serial winner: The Swedish striker has since gone on to win two Ligue 1 titles with Paris Saint-Germain . Wanted man: Balotelli has been linked with a move away from Milan with Arsenal reportedly interested . Abbiati told Gazzetta dello Sport:'He will be back in the squad bursting with enthusiasm after the World Cup. He wants to prove that things are different from how it went in Brazil. 'Can he become Milan's new Ibrahimovic? If he understands that he has to give his best in every training session, then yes. 'I am sure that with new coach Filippo Inzaghi he will succeed.' Milan finished eighth last season amid a managerial change and talk of dressing room unrest, but Abbiati believes the appointment of Pippo Inzaghi this summer can help the club get back on track. 'Inzaghi has brought a crazy enthusiasm, the team follows him as one. Inzaghi is a concrete example and credible because he is the first one that people respect.' Boss: Former Milan striker Pippo Inzaghi replaced Clarence Seedorf as coach of the club this summer .","Christian Abbiati backed Mario Balotelli to star for AC Milan next season .

"By . Scarlett Russell . The daughter of Sweden's Princess Madeleine and New York banker Christopher O'Neill was baptised earlier today at Royal Chapel at Drottningholm Palace outside Stockholm. Princess Leonore Lilian Maria will be known as the Duchess of Gotland - in reference to Sweden's largest island. She was born on 20th February in New York.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Big-hitting Australian cricketer Mitchell Johnson was at his destructive best in Zimbabwe when he smashed the glass of the Harare Sports Club commentary box with a damaging six. Johnson, 32, timed the shot to absolute perfection when he belted it back over the head of  Zimbabwean seamer Tinashe Panyangara and straight towards commentators Neil Manthorp and Pommie Mbangwa. Mbangwa, a former Zimbabwean paceman, was left to pick the flying shrapnel out of the inside of his shirt during the second last over of Australia's record breaking innings. Scroll down for video . Pommie Mbangwa, left and Neil Manthorp where left shocked at Mitchell Johnson's damaging shot . Pommie Mbangwa was left shaking his shirt for signs of stray glass down the front of his top . The shot caught commentator Manthorp completely off-guard and with little idea of how fast the ball was traveling. 'Beautifully struck', he said, before reacting on impact. 'Oh, it's hit the commentary box window and there's glass all over the place.' Johnson's display of power hitting was replicated right throughout the Australian batting line-up which belted a first innings total of 6-350 - enough to crush Zimbabwe by 198 runs in their one-day international fixture. The all-rounder was one of a number of Australian batsmen clubbing sixes across the park including Glenn Maxwell 92 and Mitchell Marsh who hit 83. The ball which Johnson drove off Tinashe Panyangara and into the stands . Johnson said he thought the ball was headed for the box from the moment it left his bat . The ball on its way to the commentary box . The window was the same one West Indian Chris Gayle hit two years ago . Mbangwa, who was too busy shaking shards of glass out of his shirt, later joked about Johnson's damaging shot - tweeting to his followers that he had chicken and glass shards for lunch. 'Well, that was an interesting last 10 overs. Braaied chicken and glass shards for lunch. Thanks Mitchell.' An apologetic Johnson later tweeted back: 'Didn't mean to give you guys a scare up there in the Com box @SuperSportTV Need Chris Gayles arms to get it higher!!' Johnson was referencing the damaging West Indian batsmen Chris Gayle, who two years smashed the same pane of glass. He said he had an inkling the ball was headed for the commentary box from the moment it left the bat. The commentators react to the ball hitting the re-enforced glass window . Neil Manthorp offered to give the Australian bowler a souvenir piece of glass . Mitchell Johnson's tweet following the match Australia won convincingly . 'I thought it was going to hit, and I was just wondering what it was going to do,' he said. 'I didn’t see it shatter, I just saw some of the commentators brushing away a bit of glass, so it was a good thing it didn’t shatter everywhere and the ball didn’t go through. 'I think another window up here (outside the players’ dressing room) had that shattered look to it, and I’m glad no-one got injured out of it.' The damaging batsmen, who has also been in good form with the ball, said he was 'just trying to adjust' to the conditions of being out in the middle. 'I didn’t see the first ball that was bowled to me from the other end, I was just trying to adjust to being out in the middle again but that one felt really nice, right out of the middle.'","Mitchell Johnson hit the six into the Harare Sports Club commentary box .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . David Cameron has nominated Lord Hill of Oareford, pictured, as Britain's next European Commissioner . Brussels chief Jean-Claude Juncker was accused of behaving like a dictator last night after warning he would snub David Cameron for not sending a woman to represent Britain in the EU. Mr Juncker indicated Britain could expect a lowly European Commission post because of the Prime Minister’s nomination of Lord Hill of Oareford. Sources said the incoming commission president, opposed by Mr Cameron, had repeatedly told countries he wanted to improve the gender balance of his top team. Downing Street yesterday rejected the call, saying Lord Hill would be an ‘excellent commissioner’. Lord Stoddart of Swindon accused Mr Juncker of behaving like a dictator. The independent Labour peer said: ‘His behaviour is unacceptable and the Prime Minister should not kowtow to this jumped-up bureaucrat with delusions of grandeur. ‘Unfortunately, Mr Juncker’s attitude is all too common among EU officialdom which, in general, has contempt for democracy.’ Tory MPs also rounded on Mr Juncker. Peter Bone said: ‘How dare he tell us who the best person is for the job. It just demonstrates why people increasingly believe we should have nothing to do with this stupid, politically correct, elitist group of bureaucrats. ‘Mr Juncker should simply butt out. He needs to understand that the more they make these ridiculous decisions … the more clamour there will be among the British public for us to simply get out.’ Fellow Tory Mark Pritchard said it would be an outrage if Britain was refused a major economic portfolio in the commission because of the gender of its candidate. He added: ‘Perhaps Mr Juncker has forgotten the UK is a net contributor to the EU budget, therefore we should be getting one of the big jobs.’ Mr Juncker has been clear since his selection in July that he wants more female commissioners. In an interview with Austrian newspaper Der Kurier this week he said countries which failed to heed his warning could not expect senior jobs. David Cameron has been warned that Britain will not get a top Brussels post unless the PM sends a woman . ‘A commission without a significant number of women is, in my view, neither legitimate nor credible,’ he said. ‘That is why I am continuing to insist with several heads of state and governments that they send me a female candidate … should there still not be a sufficient number of women, I will need to redress the balance through the portfolio allocation. ‘Female commissioners will then certainly have very good chances of landing an important portfolio or of getting one of the most sought-after posts of vice-president, acting as my deputies.’ Brussels sources acknowledged Mr Juncker’s comments were aimed partly at Mr Cameron. But No 10 yesterday said the commission president had not directly raised concerns about Lord Hill’s gender in recent weeks.","The PM has been warned that Brussels wants more female Commissioners .

"By . Louise Boyle for MailOnline . A self-proclaimed, pro-surfer and model who allegedly tried to kill an elderly woman with her car has been re-arrested. Jill Hansen, 30, was handcuffed by police on Saturday afternoon after she reportedly violated a protective order at the Women's Community Correctional Center in Kailua, Hawaii. She is due in court on September 5 over the violation. Hansen pleaded not guilty to the attempted murder of a 73-year-old woman in a Wakiki parking garage in May along with vehicle break-in and car theft. Jill Hansen, 30,  is charged with attempted murder for trying to run over an elderly woman with her car. She was arrested again on Saturday (pictured) for violating a protective order . Hansen allegedly smashed into an elderly woman with her car in May putting the 73-year-old in hospital . Police said Hansen ran into Elizabeth Conklin with her car and backed up to hit her again. The elderly woman was taken to hospital in a serious condition with a head injury, cuts and bruises. Hansen was arraigned in Circuit Court in May via closed circuit video link with Oahu Community Correctional Center. She is being held on $1 million bail. Authorities initially believed the attack stemmed from an earlier road rage run-in, however Ms Conklin said there was no such encounter, instead assuming Hansen was trying to steal her car. 'I parked in my normal parking place, and I got out and all of a sudden I woke up in an ambulance,' Conklin told ABC News. The 73-year-old thanked Chris Khory, the worker who stopped Hansen, for saving her life. Khory told Khon2 that after knocking Conklin down, Hansen got out of her sedan, looked at the victim lying on the ground, got back in the car and reversed, preparing to hit her again. Hansen, a self-proclaimed pro-surfer, was arrested on suspicion of intentionally striking a 73-year-old woman in a Wai­kiki parking garage with her car in May . Khory, who works at a nearby apartment complex, said he quickly grabbed a nearby crowbar and ran over and smashed Hansen's back window. Stunned, Hansen got out and fled, leaving behind her car. Police used it to track her down, arresting Hansen six hours later in the Manoa area, and later charged with attempted murder. However, before she was arrested, Hansen posted a picture of a BMW 328 wagon - believed to be the same car as Conklin's - along with a message about how she had turned professional as a surfer. 'I am becoming a professional! I have worked SOOOO hard to get to today. I am so greatful [sic] for all the support of the surfers and the ASP (association of surfing professionals),' Hansen posted on May 14, along with the picture of the car. It is yet another run-in with police for Hansen. She has a pending assault case and in a separate case was ordered to undergo a mental health evaluation. There is also an active restraining order filed by her father. According to the court documents, her father says she used Facebook to find someone to murder him and his family. Lucky to be alive: Elizabeth Conklin, 73, who was thrown 20 feet across the parking garage of her Waikiki apartment complex said her attacker was after her car . She has multiple rants on the social media site. She claims to be a professional surfer and model and lashes out at critics. According to court records, Hansen has been cited three times for speeding since February, the most recent time in May. In that incident she was allegedly driving 72mph in a 35mph zone in Wahiawa. In addition, in 2011 she received fines for disregarding a stop sign, driving without a license and driving without insurance. In 2013 she was fined for driving without headlights. She has two convictions, one for speeding and the other for driving without a license in 2010, according to the state Criminal Justice Data Center. On May 21, Hansen attempted to slip out of jail in Honolulu by falling in line behind someone who was walking out the exit, police say. Jail guards immediately recognized the ruse and detained her again. 'She tried to slip out behind someone who was walking through the door,' jail spokesman Toni Schwartz told KHNL-TV. 'Thanks to the quick actions of our staff, they immediately grabbed her and stopped her from getting any further.' She is due back in court on September 25 to determine whether she is fit to stand trial fpr attempted murder. In an effort to get Hansen's attention and stop her from hitting the woman again, a bystander used a crowbar to break one of the car's windows .","Jill Hansen, 30, was handcuffed by police on Saturday afternoon after she reportedly violated a protective order .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . All state schools, including primaries, will be forced to teach sex education under Liberal Democrat plans to be announced today. Nick Clegg’s Schools Minister David Laws will commit the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘good citizens’. The move, backed by Labour but opposed by the Conservatives, would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer. Most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum. But thousands of academies, free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum, meaning they are free to drop the subject. Schools Minister David Laws (left) will say that sex eduction should be a central part of any rounded education. His announcement comes as Nick Clegg was pictured barefoot during a visit to a Sikh temple in New Delhi . Provision in primary schools is also patchy, with most not teaching anything until the final years. Critics of the move say sex education should be left to parents. They warn that much of the teaching in schools uses explicit material that is inappropriate for young children. But Mr Laws will say that sex education should be a central part of any rounded education, comparable to young people learning how to manage their money. He will say: ‘We believe that by educating children about sex and relationships in an appropriate way, we can help them to make informed choices in their personal lives.’ The Lib Dems want to reduce the age for sex education from 11 to seven. Although parents will retain the right to pull children under 15 out of sex education lessons, many do not know about the option and it is little used. Several attempts have been made to introduce compulsory sex education since the election but all have been blocked by Tory ministers, who argue schools should be free to decide with parents what they teach without undue government interference. The Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said sex education should be left to parents. But supporters say too many children are leaving school without proper knowledge of sex and relationships. An Opinium survey of 18-year-olds found 86 per cent said sex and relationship advice should be taught in schools. Nick Clegg went barefoot and wore traditional headgear yesterday on a visit to a Sikh temple during a trade mission to India. It is customary to remove your shoes at the Bangla Sahib Gurudwara in New Delhi and to cover your head. The Deputy Prime Minister also helped stir vegetables in the temple’s community kitchen. Mr Clegg later held talks with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi on the prospect of bringing top teachers from the UK to India and of British experts helping to clean up the Ganges. The delegation, including Mr Clegg’s unpaid India business adviser Lord Dholakia, hope to forge deals in aerospace, retail and science.

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . Councils will today call for a change in the law to prevent them having to sell voters’ personal details to junk mail firms. Local authorities have come under fire from privacy campaigners for effectively aiding the junk mail barons who bombard families with unwanted leaflets and letters. Details from the electoral roll are routinely sold on to direct marketing firms, estate agents, fast food outlets and others who contribute to Britain’s annual mountain of three billion items of junk mail. Details from the electoral roll are routinely sold on to direct marketing firms, estate agents, fast food outlets and others who contribute to Britain's annual mountain of three billion items of junk mail . Critics point out that cash-strapped councils make thousands of pounds a year by selling on voters’ details for as little as 15p a go. But, in a significant intervention today, the Local Government Association (LGA) calls for a change in the law to bring an end to the practice. The umbrella body says councils are obliged by law to sell on data from the electoral roll under the terms of the Representation of the People Act 2002. The organisation claims many councils do not even make enough money from the process to cover their costs. And it warns the situation is even deterring some people from signing up to the electoral roll, leaving them unable to vote. Peter Fleming, of the LGA, said: ‘Councils resent having to pass the electoral roll onto direct marketing companies. 'Junk mailers and cold callers are a pet hate for many of us. It demeans our democracy for the voters’ details to be sold off as a tool to help direct marketing firms make money. Critics point out that cash-strapped councils make thousands of pounds a year by selling on voters' details for as little as 15p-a-go . ‘In some cases people have not signed up to vote because they are concerned about their privacy being compromised. ‘Scrapping the open register would spare millions from being bombarded with junk mail and would remove a hurdle which stands in the way of our efforts to sign people up to vote.’ Under the existing law, councils are required to compile two versions of the electoral register. Details of everyone entitled to vote are included on a ‘full’ version of the register, which is not for sale to businesses. But a second ‘open’ version of the register is also created containing the same names and addresses, except for those who have opted out. This contains some 28 million names, which junk mail firms can purchase in electronic form for as little as £1.50 per 1,000 entries. The electoral register is available for anyone to inspect. But by selling on details in electronic form councils make it easy for junk mail firms to send out thousands of unwanted items at the push of a button. A study by the civil liberties group Big Brother Watch last year found that 300 councils had sold on information to some 2,700 companies and individuals over the previous five years. Daniel Nesbitt, research director at Big Brother Watch, said: ""The sale of the edited electoral register has to stop and the LGA is absolutely right to say so. ‘Registering to vote should be a basic part of our democratic freedoms, instead the practice of forcing councils to sell our personal details to anyone and everyone has left people confused about who can get hold of their private information. ‘The existence of the edited register is waste of everyone's time, councils don't benefit from selling it on and it leaves residents drowning in huge volumes of junk mail, there is no need to keep it and it should be abolished as a matter of urgency.'","Councils are currently obliged to sell on data from 'open' electoral roll .

Gifts galore: The crown princess met the crowd gathered to wish her a happy birthday . The former personal trainer, 40, held the stick while his daughter blew bubbles. He then revealed his playful side by blowing some bubbles himself. The little girl is second in line to the throne thanks to the rules of succession being changed to allow a Swedish monarch's first born to rule regardless of their gender.

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . Police forces across the country have signed up to a new voluntary code of conduct that will place limits on the stop and search powers used by officers. Home Secretary Theresa May has said the powers were being misused, which she warned could be 'hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public.' All 43 police forces in England and Wales have now agreed to sign up to the scheme, which places limits on the use of controversial 'Section 60' stops. Police forces across the country have signed up to a new voluntary code of conduct that will place limits on the stop and search powers used by officers (file picture) The changes have been brought in after Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) found that 27 per cent of stop and searches did not contain reasonable grounds for suspicion, meaning more than 250,000 of the one million searches conducted last year could have been illegal. In addition, black and minority ethnic (BME) members of the public were up to six times more likely to be searched than white people. Forces signed up to the scheme will agree to more limits on blanket Section 60 stops, which allow officers to stop people on the anticipation of serious violence without suspicion a person is carrying weapons, while better records will be kept of each instance and published online. The Metropolitan Police Service, the UK's biggest police force, which employs more than 31,000 officers, has signed up to the scheme and said it was introducing those two elements of the new plan from today. It comes after Section 60 searches were used as a tactic in combating violent crime at this year's Notting Hill Carnival. Last year 47,141 arrests were made as a result of stop and search, representing 20 per cent of total arrests by the Met, and of the 251,161 people who were stopped and searched from August 2013 to July 2014, 115,270 (46 per cent) were white, 72,016 (29 per cent) were black and 34,267 (14 per cent) were Asian. Men accounted for 94% of all searches. Home Secretary Theresa May has said the powers were being misused, which she warned could be 'hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public' Speaking in the House of Commons when announcing the shake-up in April, Mrs May said misuse of the power damaged public trust in the police. She said: 'While it is undoubtedly an important police power, when it is misused stop and search can be counter-productive. 'First, it can be an enormous waste of police time. Second, when innocent people are stopped and searched for no good reason, it is hugely damaging to the relationship between the police and the public.

Commander Adrian Hanstock, the Met's lead for stop and search, said: 'The Best Use Stop and Search scheme supports the Met's ongoing drive to make stop and search more intelligence-led and effective. 'The Met has made significant improvements to stop and search over the last two years to not only reduce the total number of people we search, but also to ensure that our officers focus on those areas and types of crime that the public are most concerned about. 'As a result, we are arresting more people than ever before following the more targeted use of stop and search and routinely find people in possession of weapons and stolen items. 'In line with the Best Use of Stop and Search scheme and our commitment to increase transparency and accountability, the MPS has today introduced a new approach to Section 60 authorisation and has introduced revised recording of stop and search outcomes. 'We recognise the impact stop and search can have on individuals and communities. Our work with communities and monitoring groups is helping to ensure we are more transparent than ever in how stop and search helps to reduce crime and keep people safe, but we of course recognise there is much more to do to improve confidence across all communities in the use of the powers.'","All 43 police forces in England and Wales have signed up to new code .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . He’s known as the Godfather of match-fixing. Brazen Wilson Raj Perumal has revealed that he made around £3million from rigging soccer matches around the world and claims that he would sometimes sit on team benches giving orders to players and coaches. The Singaporean, 49, admits that he probably fixed the outcomes of almost 100 matches in total. Fixer: Singaporean Wilson Maj Perumal, pictured on trial in Rovaniemi, Finland, in 2011, claims that he rigged around 100 football matches and made £3million . He told CNN in his first-ever TV interview: ‘I never really counted, but I think it should be between 80 and 100 football matches. ‘I was on the bench at times, and telling players what to do, giving orders to the coach. It was that easy. There was no policing whatsoever.’ Perumal said that when he was younger he had dreamed of a career in the armed forces. He said: ‘I had my boyhood dreams. I wanted to be a soldier but during my school days I got a criminal record and couldn't really pursue what I wanted to. And then I got attracted to betting when I was about 19-20 years old. ‘I kind of got hooked and I didn't want to lose… so I started fixing local matches.’ He began fixing matches in the late 1980s in Singapore and eventually joined what international police organization Interpol described as 'the world's most notorious match-fixing syndicate'. He boasted that his success rate was about 70 to 80 per cent. Astonishingly, some football associations welcomed him ‘with open arms’, he explained. Brazen: Perumal has revealed that he would sometimes sit on beam benches giving orders to players and coaches . Former Fifa match-fixing investigator Terry Steans was shown Perumal’s contacts list by the police and was amazed to see that he had relationships with officials and players from 38 countries – out of a possible total of 209. Perumal added: ‘I have no regrets. It was a phase of my life and I enjoyed it and I traveled around the world. I had a good time.’ For a time he masterminded this international enterprise - thought to have generated hundreds of millions in fraudulent winnings for crime organisations in the Far East - from a one-bed flat in Wembley, London. Then he was jailed for match-fixing in Finland in 2011. He was sentenced to two years but served a year, before being handed over to authorities in Hungary who were also investigating football’s betting scams. Perumal believes police were tipped off by others inside his organisation and has since exposed some details to media outlets and presumably to police. The Finnish scandal surrounded the club Rovaniemen Palloseura (RoPS) in the northern city of Rovaniemi. Perumal and nine RoPS players were convicted of match-fixing having taken bribes of up to £33,000 each. Before the Finnish venture, Perumal is alleged to have fixed matches in Africa, the Middle East and Central America. He is reported to have been behind the scandal of the Zimbabwe national team playing games in Asia in 2007 and 2009, which culminated in 98 Zimbabwean footballers and two coaches being suspended in 2012. And he is ensnared in the huge Europol investigation revealed in 2013, which involves club officials, referees and players and concerns 380 matches in 15 different countries between 2011 and 2013. Another incident was the international played between Togo and Bahrain in September 2011, when Togo were beaten 3-0 though it later emerged that they were not the real Togo team. Perumal arrived in London early in 2011, having skipped bail in Singapore, where he faced a charge of hitting a police officer with his car. He lived among Wembley’s Sri Lankan community and went by the name of Rajamohan Chelliah until the Finnish police swooped in the Arctic and the web started to unravel. He says that he has gambled away the fortune he made from match-fixing. Perumal now helps police combat match-fixing and has published an auto-biography called Kelong Kings.","Wilson Raj Perumal says he would sit on team benches giving players orders .

"By . James Rush for MailOnline . and Associated Press . Prosecutors have said Osama bin Laden's son-in-law should be sentenced to life in prison for his role as al-Qaida's spokesman after 9/11, when he made 'bone-chilling threats' against America. The US government has said a life sentence for Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, who was convicted in March of charges that included conspiracy to kill Americans and providing support to al-Qaida, would send out an important deterrent to would-be terrorists. Prosecutors, who described Abu Ghaith's words as 'inciting, murderous and hateful', said: 'Terrorism is a crime with high recidivism rates and rehabilitation is notoriously difficult.' Scroll down for video . Prosecutors have said Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, Osama bin Laden's son-in-law, should be sentenced to life in prison for his role as al-Qaida's spokesman after 9/11, when he made 'bone-chilling threats' against America . Papers have been filed in the US District Court in Manhattan a month before Abu Ghaith was due to be sentenced on September 23. Earlier this month, Abu Ghaith's defense lawyer Stanley Cohen told Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that 15 years in prison was a sufficient sentence. Abu Ghaith, a Kuwaiti-born imam, married bin Laden's eldest daughter roughly five years ago. He is the highest-ranking al-Qaida figure brought to trial on U.S. soil since the 2001 attacks. According to the papers filed by prosecutors, Abu Ghaith 'proudly sat at bin Laden's right hand' following the 9/11 attacks, repeatedly participating in al-Qaida recruitment videos. In their papers, prosecutors wrote: 'Abu Ghayth repeatedly made unambiguous and bone-chilling threats that al Qaeda would continue to conduct terrorist attacks using airplanes. 'Simply put, the defendant eagerly supported al Qaeda and its mass murder of Americans,' they said. Frames of a video made September 12, 2001 (pictured) were shared in court showing Abu Ghaith seated next to bin Laden and two other top al-Qaida leaders as they tried to justify the attacks . 'The significance of Abu Ghayth's spoken words is unmistakable. Inspirational and charismatic speakers like Abu Ghayth allow al Qaeda to refill its ranks of suicide operatives by driving more future terrorists to al Qaeda's murderous mission.' In a dramatic testimony during his trial, Abu Ghaith told how he was summoned to a dark cave in Afghanistan within hours of the destruction of the World Trade Center to speak with bin Laden, who told him: 'We are the ones who did it.' Abu Ghaith testified that a worried bin Laden asked him how America would respond. 'America, if it was proven that you were the one who did this, will not settle until it accomplishes two things: to kill you and topple the state of the Taliban,' Abu Ghaith said he replied. In his papers, Cohen said his client had no prior knowledge or role in the planning or execution of the 9/11 attacks or any other bombing or terrorist activity. 'His role was confined to speaking, after the attacks had already happened,' he wrote. Cohen said a sentence of 15 years would really be 25 years, since Abu Ghaith spent a decade in prison in Iran, much of it under extreme conditions which included abuse and torture. But prosecutors disputed those claims, saying Abu Ghaith formed a community with other Arab detainees and even married two women while incarcerated, fathering multiple children along the way.","U.S. says life sentence for Sulaiman Abu Ghaith would act as deterrent to would-be terrorists .

Alok Kumar, from Maanpur village, Sitapur district, was returning from his fields on Monday evening when he heard the girl's desperate cries. He followed the muffled sounds to the middle of a cane field, where to his shock he found the soil moving as the girl tried to dig her way out. Scroll down for video . Tanu was buried alive in a cane field in UP's Maanpur village, but was rescued by chance when a passing village man heard her cries . Video courtesy of Headlines Today . Mr Kumar started digging and unearthed a small girl who was in a semi-conscious state. He quickly pulled her out and rushed her to the nearby Maanpur police station. The girl, called Tanu, had strangulation marks on her neck, and after gaining consciousness, informed the police that she is from Semri Gaura village, where she lived with her mother Renu Awasthi. She was taken away from her home by a couple, reportedly her aunt and uncle, who allegedly tried to strangle her. 'Tanu has told us that a couple took her with them a few days ago and tried to strangulate her. They later buried her in the field. She, however, could not recognise them,' Sitapur police chief Rajesh Krishna told Mail Today. The young girl told police that she is a native of Semri Gaura village, where she lived with her mother . The Sitapur police got in touch with the Lucknow Police, who were able to trace Tanu's house. According to the neighbours, nobody had seen the victim and her mother since August 20. The house was found to be locked. As news of the girl's rescue flashed onto TV channels, the victim's maternal grandmother Rajrani approached the police. 'Renu came back to us after a few months of her marriage and stayed with us after that. About 15 days ago, Renu left our house along with Tanu without informing anyone,' said Rajrani, who lives in the Gomtinagar district of Lucknow. The victim's mother has also been missing since August 20 and the police are now searching for her. Tanu has been variously reported to be aged five, or seven. She has now been discharged from hospital and sent home with her grandmother.","Alok Kumar heard muffled cries coming from the ground in a cane field .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . and Associated Press . For the first time, white students are now outnumbered by ethnic minorities in American state schools. White children now make up 49.7 per cent of the 50million in America’s state schools, down from 63.4 per cent in 1997. There were 29.2million white students in 1997, with this figure dropping to 24.9million in 2014, which still makes them the largest single ethnic group. White children now make up 49.7 per cent of the 50million in America’s state schools . The U.S Department of Education predicts that by 2023, the number of white students enrolled in U.S public schools will have decreased to 23.5million, giving them a 45 per cent share of enrolment. The number of Hispanic public school students is projected to increase from 12.9million to 15.6million by 2023, meaning that they will make up 30 per cent of all pupils. In 1997 there were around just six million Hispanic students. The number of Hispanic students is forecast to overtake whites by 2043. The number of black students, meanwhile, has remained about the same at 7.7million since 1997. Their enrollment share is projected to decrease from 16 to 15 percent by 2023. The number of Asian/Pacific Islander students is projected to increase to 2.9 million, and their enrollment share in 2023 is projected to be 5 per cent. This Department of Education graph shows how white and black student numbers have fallen and Hispanic students increased since 2001 . The U.S Department of Education predicts that by 2023, the number of white students enrolled in U.S public schools will have decreased to 23.5million, giving them a 45 per cent share of enrolment . Despite diversity increasing, segregation in U.S schools is still a major issue – one that President Obama is particularly concerned about. The Civil Right Project at UCLA, using Education Department data, has found that segregation has been increasing since 1990, and that black students nationally are substantially more segregated than they were in 1970. Around the country, only 23 percent of black students attended white-majority schools in 2011. That's the lowest number since 1968 and far below the peak of 44 percent in 1988. And segregation is also affecting Latino students, the largest minority group in the public schools. They now are more likely to attend school with other Latinos than black students are with other blacks. Many advocates blame this on the federal courts for removing school districts from desegregation orders. The changing demographics of the school system -the withdrawal of white students from the public systems and the booming Latino population -also contribute to the changing colors of the schools. Civil rights data recently released by the Education Department showed glaring disparities remain in all aspects of education. Among the findings: minority students are less likely to have access to advanced math and science classes, and to have new teachers. Black students of any age -even preschoolers - are more likely to be suspended. And, there continue to be gaps between the performance on national assessments between whites and black and Hispanic students, with whites scoring higher. In a recent bit of good news, high school graduation rates increased 15 percentage points for Hispanic students and 9 percentage points for African-American students from 2006 to 2012, according to a recent GradNation Report. Hispanic students graduated at 76 percent and African-American students at 68 percent in 2012, the report said. The national rate is 80 percent.","White students now make up 49.7% of the 50m in America’s state schools .

The unnamed St. Louis Cardinals fan seems completely unaware that a baseball bat flung by his own player is heading straight for his face, despite dozens of spectators sat around him raising their hands to protect themselves. The bat, accidentally thrown mid-swing by Cardinals player A. J. Pierzynski, flies towards the fan and strikes him on the head - but other than appearing embarrassed he seems to be fine. Scroll down video . The unnamed fan is struck by A. J. Pierzynski's bat - but luckily it only hits him on the peak of his cap . Pittsburgh Pirates' Mark Melancon pitched to St. Louis Cardinals player Pierzysnki, who swung hard at the ball . Pictures from the match show Pierzynski has a tight hold on his bat as he prepares for the pitch . But as he swings and slices his shot, the bat comes flying out of the player's hands in the direction of the stand . The hilarious pictures show Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Mark Melancon tossing the ball at Pierzynski in the ninth innings of yesterday's National League match. The batsman swings and slices his shot, with the ball flying off behind him. But just as the ball disappears from shot, Pierzynski loses control of his bat, flinging it towards the crowd. As the bat soars towards the stand, the spectator's raise their hands over their head - some in an attempt to catch the bat, others trying to protect themselves from serious injury. At the same time Cardinals players sat on the team bench below the stand dive to the ground, fearing the projectile could be headed for them. Meanwhile one Cardinals fan, wearing a red shirt and black cap, is clearly not aware of the imminent danger and continues to stare out into the field. Cardinals fans begin to realise the imminent danger as the bat is flung towards them at high speeds . Spectators raise their hands over the heads and cower in fear, but one man seems completely oblivious . The bat crashes into the man's head, but luckily the handle only makes impact with the peak of his cap . I'm OK! The man, awoken from his daydream, holds up the bat as the woman next to him clutches her wrist . They both seem fine after the impact, and the bat can be seen resting next to the two Cardinals fans . With the bat just feet away from striking him, a blonde woman sat to his left tries to block it, but fails. The handle of the baseball bat connects with the man's cap, suddenly waking him from his daydream. Luckily he seems unhurt, and laughs as he clutches the bat. Meanwhile the woman sat next to him is holding her arm, suggesting the bat hit her too. Pierzynski, who does not look like he is enjoying the incident as much as the fans, then walks over to get his bat back for the next pitch. The Cardinals went on to lose 3-1. Pierzynski, who seemed less amused by the incident, then has to make a walk of shame over to the crowd . He collects the bat from a steward and trudges back to the field for the next pitch, thoroughly embarrassed .","St. Louis Cardinals player A. J. Pierzynski accidentally flings bat into crowd .

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . A cyber-attack took down Sony's PlayStation Network over the weekend, with the person claiming responsibility declaring that it was done in the name of terrorist group Isis. A Twitter user with the handle @LizardSquad said 'today we planted the ISIS flag on @Sony's servers' following the attack. It had coincided with a bomb scare on a flight carrying top Sony executive John Smedley in the United States. Cyber-attack: A Twitter user with the handle @LizardSquad said 'today we planted the ISIS flag on @Sony's servers' after the Sony PlayStation Network was disrupted . Lizard Squad also targeted games company Blizzard Entertainment and Xbox. The PlayStation Network was back up and running on Monday. Sony said on its PlayStation blog that its PlayStation network had been taken down by a denial of service-style attack, which overwhelmed the system with traffic, but did not intrude onto the network or access any of its 53million users' data. Lizard Squad originally said the attack was meant to pressure Sony to spend more of its profits on the network. 'Sony, yet another large company, but they aren't spending the waves of cash they obtain on their customers' (PlayStation Network) service. End the greed,' one post said on Sunday. Sony's network business has been hit by attacks before, with a security breach in 2011 dealing a major blow to plans at the time for a looser network designed to allow for the connection of a range of Sony devices. Disruption: Lizard Squad also targeted games company Blizzard Entertainment and the Xbox Live system . Sony describes its PlayStation Network as 'an online digital media platform that is especially designed for PlayStation enthusiasts'. It's essentially an online service that allows PlayStation gamers in different towns, cities and even countries to play against, or with, each other. Most games these days come with online modes - think of them as games within the game in which sometimes huge numbers of players battle it out for the highest score. Players use the Network to access this part of the game's functionality. It's also possible to watch TV shows and movies through the Network. Xbox Live is Microsoft's version of the Network. For a yearly subscription, it allows users to play online versions of their games and even access movie services such as Netflix. Since then it has invested heavily in the system and is now hoping the network can serve as a centrepiece of its plans to rebuild its business after years of losses in its flagship electronics operations. Lizard Squad said it had also targeted the servers of World of Warcraft video gamemakers Blizzard Entertainment, whose website was down, and threatened to attack Microsoft's Xbox Live network, which some users said they had problems accessing on Sunday. 'We don't comment on the root cause of a specific issue, but as you can see on Xbox.com/status, the core Xbox LIVE services are up and running,' Xbox spokesman David Dennis told Reuters. Blizzard Entertainment was not immediately reachable for comment, though its customer support Twitter account said the company's servers were stabilising. Lizard Squad also tweeted to American Airlines on Sunday to say they had heard that explosives were on board a flight carrying Sony Online Entertainment President John Smedley. That followed an earlier tweet from a game player's forum telling the airline: 'I'm gonna send a bomb on your plane be ready for me tomorrow.' A PlayStation spokeswoman in the United States said the FBI was investigating the diversion of the Dallas to San Diego flight. The FBI had no comment on the incident. American Airlines said on its Twitter account that it was 'aware of threats' made over the microblogging service and had alerted security.","A cyber-attack took down Sony's PlayStation Network over the weekend .

Barack Obama could once count influential academic Cornel West as an ally, but the Princeton professor has become utterly disillusioned with the U.S leader, labelling him as a ‘counterfeit president’. What’s more, that comment is just the tip of the iceberg, with Professor West - who lectures in African American Studies - also criticising Mr Obama’s policies on Wall Street, drones, national security and his response to the Michael Brown shooting. West explains that he was hopeful for the future when Mr Obama came to power in 2005, but now believes the optimism was misplaced. Scroll down for video .

The torturers go free. The Wall Street executives go free. The war crimes in the Middle East, especially now in Gaza, the war criminals go free.’ During Mr West’s savage attack he dismisses Mr Obama as a ‘neoliberal centrist with a smile and nice rhetorical flair… a brown-faced Clinton’.

He said: ‘It has been going on for a long time. The Obama administration has been silent. Completely silent.’ Furthermore, he is incredulous, the interview reveals, that Mr Obama sent a letter of condolence to Robin Williams before sending one to the Michael Brown family. Mr West believes that Obama has been far too preoccupied with occupying the middle ground instead of championing bold policies. He added: ‘He doesn’t realize that a great leader, a statesperson, doesn’t just occupy middle ground. They occupy higher ground or the moral ground or even sometimes the holy ground. But the middle ground is not the place to go if you’re going to show courage and vision.’","West said Obama is 'a neoliberal centrist with a smile and rhetorical flair'

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . A family that joked their house was haunted after they started hearing noises were shocked to find a deadly 10ft python that had been slithering around their home for a week. Rachel Leck and her son Xavier, 10, joked that creepy occurrences, such as a lamp being knocked over and glasses falling to the floor, were caused by a mischievous poltergeist. But as they sat down to watch a baseball game on the TV in their house in Midland, Ontario, Canada, on Sunday, Xavier spotted the huge snake draped over the sofa less than a meter from his mother. Scroll down for video . The 10ft reticulated python had been living in the family's home for up to two weeks when it was found . Got him: The snake rears its head as an animal control officer pick it up from under the sofa with a long stick . Two officers quickly try to wrestle the 10ft deadly snake into a protective box as it attempts to wriggle free . After successfully capturing the python, officers prepare to move the snake on to the care of a local zoo . 'The snake was dangling down and I was about to sit down on the couch,' Xavier said. Ms Leck added: 'I looked over about the same time he really yelled ""there's a snake in the house"".' 'I jumped up, grabbed my kid and ran out of the house screaming.' Ms Leck and Xavier alerted their neighbors, and six of them joined in the search for the missing snake, Simcoe.com reported. Midland Police and animal control were called to remove the huge reptile, who eventually coaxed him out from under the family's sofa. Animal control confirmed the snake as a reticulated python - a south-east Asian species which can grow to up to 23ft long. Rachel Leck said that as soon as she saw the snake, she grabbed her son and 'ran out the house screaming' Ms Leck thought her house (pictured) was being haunted by a ghost - but it turned out to be a 10ft python . The huge snake hid under the sofa (left) after it was spotted. Animal control officers eventually coaxed it out . Although attacks on humans are rare, reticulated pythons have killed people by strangulation in the past. Where they live: South-east Asia . Habitat: Forests, woodlands, grasslands, often near waterways . Maximum recorded length: 33ft . Weight: Up to 353lbs . Conservation status: Widespread and locally common . Threats: Habitat loss due to agricultural and urban development. Hunting for meat and skins, and collection for the exotic pet trade . Ms Leck said the snake could have been there for up to two weeks, and that it explained some strange happenings in the house such as furniture falling over and crockery smashing. 'We were joking that we had a ghost,' she said. 'I'm a bit creeped out by it,' 'I just see a big snake in my living room and I think I could be in danger…. It could be a cobra for all I know about snakes.' Inspector Ron Wheeldon said it was illegal to keep exotic pets in Midland and that 22-year-old man had been charged. Insp Wheeldon refused to identify the man, but said he lived about one-and-a-half blocks away from Ms Leck's home. The man could be fined up to $100. The python will be re-homed in a local zoo, an animal control officer said.

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . A senior federal nuclear expert has urged regulators to shut down the last operating nuclear plant in California until it is established it will be safe if the Golden State suffers another earthquake. Michael Peck, who was the on-site inspector of Diablo Canyon plant for five years, says in a confidential document that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is not applying the safety rules it set out for the plant's operation. The 42-page  file says that no one knows whether the facility's key equipment can withstand stronger shaking - and only yesterday the state was hit by another quake, striking with a magnitude of 6.0. Scroll down for video . Last reactor standing: The nearly 30-year-old Diablo Canyon is the last operating nuclear plant left in California . In the file, Mr Peck, an NRC employee, writes that continuing to run the reactors 'challenges the presumption of nuclear safety'. Diablo Canyon's reactors, which are nearly 30 years old, produce enough electricity for more than three million people annually. The former site inspector filed the document as an appeals notice to the NRC in July 2013. Usually the appeals process takes no longer than 120 days but there is yet to be a ruling. The NRC and plant owner Pacific Gas and Electric Co. (PG&E) insist the facility is safe and that it complies with its operating license, including earthquake safety standards. Michael Peck was the on-site inspector of Diablo Canyon for five years as part of his role with the Nuclear Regulatory Council . The disaster preparedness of the world's nuclear plants was thrown into the spotlight in 2011 following the meltdowns at Fukushima in Japan, which caused irreversible damage to the environment and forced 300,000 people to evacuate the area. A magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami destroyed the plant's power and cooling systems, leading the NRC to reevaluate plant safety in the U.S.. Yesterday a magnitude 6.0 quake struck northern California, injuring dozens and cutting out power to thousands of people, but causing no problems for Diablo Canyon. The conflict between Mr Peck and the NRC stems from the 2008 discovery of the Shoreline fault, which snakes offshore about half a mile from the reactors. According to Mr Peck’s filing, PG&E research in 2011 determined that any of three nearby faults – the Shoreline, Los Osos and San Luis Bay – are capable of producing significantly more ground motion during an earthquake than was accounted for in the design of important plant equipment. In the case of San Luis Bay, it is as much as 75 per cent more, Mr Peck claims. The analysis says PG&E failed to demonstrate that the equipment would continue to work if exposed to the stronger shaking, violating its operating license. It adds that the agency should shut the facility down until it is proven that piping, reactor cooling and other systems can deal with the stronger shaking. The NRC says Diablo Canyon’s reactors can withstand the largest projected earthquake from the faults, and says the largest threat is from the Hosgri fault, a crack discovered in the 1970s about three miles from the plant's site, by which time construction already underway. Mr Peck said in the document that continuing with the reactors 'challenges the presumption of nuclear safety' Mr Peck, who is now a senior instructor at the NRC’s training center in Tennessee, declined to comment on the filing. The NRC also said it would not comment on the document. PG&E spokesman Blair Jones said the NRC had looked into the threat of earthquakes on the reactor and had found Diablo Canyon to be 'seismically safe'. Mr Jones said that the core issue involving earthquake shaking was resolved in the late 1970s with seismic retrofitting of the plant. If the plant did close to strengthen its defense against earthquakes, it would not be the first in California to do so. The Humboldt Bay plant, which was within 3,000 yards of three faults, was shut down in 1976 to reinforce its ability to withstand possible earthquakes. Restarting it became more difficult and costly than projected and the plant never reopened.","Ex-inspector of Diablo Canyon says plant should be shut down temporarily .

"By . Tracey Cox . Single this bank holiday? Chances are you'll head to a friend's house for company and their take on why you can't find lasting love. Friends know best, right? Friends can be overly critical of a new flame, especially if you have had bad relationships in the past . Not necessarily. While great friends are indisputably brilliant sounding boards for relationship choices, seeking advice too early can actually sabotage relationships and ruin what could have been. The more often we get it wrong in love, the earlier we tend to introduce a potential partner to our friends. We don't trust our own judgment anymore but we do trust theirs, so drag them along to the pub for a once-over on date two or three. But while the reasons for wanting friend's approval are justified, timing is everything. There are some compelling arguments to holding off introducing that great new boyfriend or girlfriend for at least a few months. You need time to make up your own mind first . Anyone who's been in love - and had their heart broken - is well aware it's near impossible to see things clearly at the loved-up start. It seemed perfectly plausible at the time for him to only want to see you during the week and never on the weekend. When you find out he's married and look back, you realise the signs were there but you didn't seem them because you saw what you wanted to see, rather than what was there. This is the prime reason why we do parade new lovers in front of people who care about us - to get a second opinion. Tracey says that many of your friends will want you to stay single because it suits them . But second opinion's are only useful if you've had the chance to form your own. It's a very, very good idea to listen hard to your friend's opinions of a new partner a few months in, then weigh up the evidence, use your judgement and make a call. It's quite another to let them make up your mind for you. Their opinion can make you focus negatively on things that worry them, not you. Couples need time to smooth out the rough bits . Some couples meet and fit seamlessly together. Most met and mould but need to rub along together for a bit to smooth out the rough spots. It's called getting to know each other: you need time to figure our each other's communication styles and past influences. An author doesn't submit the first draft of a book to the publisher. It's nearly always the third (or 300th in some cases!). You work on it before handing it over for judgement: it's the same for new love. Give the relationship time to breathe and settle before letting your friends loose. They'll be protectively watching for any wrong move or jarring between you both. The friends who love you most are the most dangerous . The friends who were most upset when you got dumped by the last guy, are the ones who'll be uber-critical of the next. It's coming from the best possible place: they want to protect you from further pain. But it can result in them seeing character flaws that aren't actually there and being over-protective to the point where no-one measures up. There's another factor at play here: because they've helped you through other breakups, you feel obliged to take their advice. And part of their hypervigilant over-screening is (often subconsciously) driven by them not wanting another bout of teary 3am phone calls. Friends have their own agenda . It suits some friends to make sure you remain single - and not just your single mates who like having someone to keep them company or go on the hunt with. Some coupled-up friends get the best of both worlds when you're out there dating, by living vicariously through you. Then there are the ‘frene mies': the people we think are our friends but aren't. They like us, they might even love us, but it's love tainted by a toxic element like envy or jealousy. If they're already jealous of something you have but they don't (a great body, better job or apartment), you having the perfect partner as well just doesn't seem fair. Instead of giving the thumbs up to your choice, they subtly sabotage, sowing the ‘Is he really good enough for you?' seeds until your rose-coloured glasses are replaced with fault-finding magnifiers. Just as our friends advise us not to rush into love, it's advisable not to rush into getting their opinions too soon. With perspective, they're invaluable. Without it, they're dangerous.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . The  man originally chosen as UKIP’s candidate in Clacton today attacked rebel MP Douglas Carswell for 'riding roughshod' over him - and threatened to 'rip his throat out'. Roger Lord said he will fight Mr Carswell to be the UKIP candidate in the forthcoming by-election, which is expected to be held on October 9. The by-election was sparked by Mr Carswell's decision to defect from the Tories and quit Parliament yesterday. Mr Lord said he had been chosen as UKIP's candidate just three weeks ago and would not go quietly. He said: ‘I've been fighting UKIP’s cause since 1997. I’ve worked hard for that – now I’m standing up for everybody who’s going to be ridden roughshod by the establishment. ‘Now we’re going to take on the establishment. If we don’t get the answers down here in Clacton we’re going to rip his throat out. Simple as that.’ Scroll down for video . Rebel Tory MP Douglas Carswell (left) yesterday announced he was joining UKIP and would stand for the party in the forthcoming by-election. But Roger Lord (right) said he had already been picked as UKIP's candidate . Conservative strategists hope London Mayor Boris Johnson can stem the tide of support drifting from the Tories to UKIP . Mr Lord, a 57-year-old farmer, suggested that if he lost his battle to stand for UKIP he would join the Tories instead. He said UKIP's decision to support Mr Carswell as their candidate in the by-election had left a vacancy. He told Sky News: ‘Douglas Carswell has created a vacancy for a parliamentary candidate. He has apparently made me unemployed as a parliamentary candidate, so if offers come in from elsewhere and there’s a deal to be done, maybe I’ll do a deal.’ As to whether he would stand for the Tory party – as he was once on their candidates’ list before joining UKIP in 1997, he said ‘it’s a possible’. Mr Lord said Mr Carswell had only ‘jumped ship’ to UKIP because he knew he was going to lose  at the next election. He accused him of simply ‘looking after himself’. But Mr Carswell today defended his decision to join UKIP and rejected accusations that he had been disloyal to the Prime Minister. He said: 'I stab people in the front, not the back'. Mr Carswell returned to his Clacton constituency this morning with UKIP leader Nigel Farage amid speculation eight more Conservative MPs considered defecting. He said: ‘I like David Cameron, he's a nice guy, he's actually good fun. ‘I don't think I've ever stabbed anybody in the back, maybe I occasionally stab one or two people in the front but I've been frank and straight with people. Conservative sources in Westminster said London Mayor Boris Johnson could help defeat Mr Carswell by campaigning in the Essex seat. One source even suggested he could fight the by-election himself. One Tory told Sky News: 'If Boris had real balls, he'd fight Douglas Carswell in the Clacton by-election.' Mr Carswell is facing a fight to be nominated as UKIP's candidate after the activist originally chosen to fight the next election for the party said he would not give up . Mr Carswell announced yesterday that he would be standing down as Tory MP for Clacton to fight the by-election as UKIP’s candidate. The decision was described by UKIP leader Nigel Farage as the most honourable decision in his life time. But Mr Carswell’s announcement was thrown into doubt by Mr Lord resistance. It came amid claims up to eight more Conservative MPs have held intensive talks with UKIP about defecting. After the shock defection of Mr Carswell yesterday a source told the Daily Mail that the threat of a mutiny went far beyond just one MP. It is understood that Mr Carswell was among nine Tories wined and dined by millionaire UKIP donor Stuart Wheeler at a series of discreet lunches in Mayfair. ‘Stuart is quietly confident that more may follow Douglas,’ a source said, adding that the MPs were happy to talk to Mr Wheeler – a former Tory who defected to UKIP – ‘because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty’. ‘Stuart understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey,’ the source said. Mr Cameron was ambushed by the defection of Mr Carswell – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the Prime Minister’s policy on Europe. The MP announced he was joining UKIP and forcing a by-election in his Clacton constituency in Essex, which will be a nightmare for the Tories to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010. Mr Cameron was given no prior warning of the announcement and could only watch as Mr Farage triumphantly paraded Mr Carswell live on TV. The dramatic move has increased pressure on the Prime Minister to toughen his stance on immigration and Europe to stem the risk of further defections. Tory whips were scrambled to ring round Eurosceptic MPs to shore up support. A senior Tory source insisted that Mr Carswell appeared to be a ‘lone wolf’ and played down the prospect of further departures. Mr Carswell told reporters in London that he needed the permission of his 'boss' - the voters - before he could return to Parliament as a member of UKIP . UKIP is targeting a host of seats in the south and east of England in a bid to break into Parliament at the next election . South Thanet - Conservative . Clacton - Conservative . Boston & Skegness - Conservative . North Thanet - Conservative . Sittingborne and Sheppey- Conservative . Forest of Dean - Conservative . Aylesbury - Conservative . Great Yarmouth - Conservative . East Worthing - Conservative . Thurrock - Conservative . Grimsby - Labour . Eastleigh - Lib Dem . Portsmouth South - Lib Dem . And Mr Cameron angrily dismissed Mr Carswell’s move as ‘self-defeating’. ‘It is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people behave in this way,’ he said. ‘But it is also, in my view, counter-productive.’ Mr Farage claimed he had been involved in talks with a number of Tory MPs over the past six months who ‘very strongly support everything Ukip is trying to do’. He predicted that further defections will follow if Mr Carswell triumphs in the by-election, which is likely to be held in the week after the Tory party conference. ‘The real answer to the question about how many others will join, will all depend on this by-election,’ he said. ‘This by-election is going to be a High Noon moment.’ Mr Carswell’s announcement came hours after official figures showed Mr Cameron has almost no chance of keeping his pledge to cut net immigration to below 100,000 a year – last year it rose nearly 40 per cent to 243,000, largely on the back of new arrivals from the EU. Mr Carswell, an early supporter of Mr Cameron’s leadership bid, said the Prime Minister was ‘not serious about change’ when it came to the EU and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election. Speaking at a press conference in London alongside Mr Farage, he said: ‘The problem is that many of those at the top of the Conservative Party are simply not on our side. They aren’t serious about the change that Britain so desperately needs. Of course they talk the talk before elections. They say what they feel they must say to get our support... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics, on the recall of MPs, on controlling our borders, on less government, on bank reform, on cutting public debt, on an EU referendum – they never actually make it happen.’ Mr Carswell’s decision to trigger a by-election leaves the Conservatives facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming Ukip’s first elected MP. He has built a Tory majority of over 12,000 in what had been a Labour seat. Tory sources last night said the by-election would be held ‘sooner rather than later’ to prevent Ukip gaining momentum. Bookmakers immediately installed Mr Carswell as the odds-on favourite to hold the seat.","Original candidate Roger Lord vows to fight former Tory MP .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Boris Johnson has applied to become the Conservative candidate for Uxbridge and South Ruislip at the 2015 General Election, his spokesman has confirmed. The London Mayor submitted his name to Conservative Campaign Headquarters this morning - just 48 hours before the deadline. Uxbridge is a safe Tory seat set to be vacated by Sir John Randall, the veteran Conservative MP, who held it last general election with an 11,000 majority. The mayor of London Boris Johnson announced this morning that he had put his hat in the ring to take over from Sir John Randall in the West London seat . A committee of five members of the Uxbridge and South Ruislip Conservative Association will whittle down the number of candidates in the seat to three or four before putting it to a vote of the local Conservative association next month. The final decision will be made on September 12 at a special meeting of the association. Sir John Randall, has confirmed he will be stepping down ahead of the general election next year. Mr Johnson made the announcement today after returning from holiday in Croatia last week. The London Mayor announced his intention to return to parliament earlier this month, amid speculation that he is positioning to take over from David Cameron as Conservative leader in the future. Mr Johnson said he hoped to ‘make his case’ that he was the best person to represent the constituency, held by Sir John Randall with a majority of 11,000 at the last general election. John Randall - pictured here with his pet dog Mortimer - is retiring from the Commons next year, leaving his seat open for Mr Johnson . ‘I'm sure there will be plenty of excellent candidates and I hope very much to make my case to the association,’ he told the Evening Standard. Pressure has been growing on Mr Johnson over several months to finally say whether or not he will mount a bid to return to the Commons. He quit as MP for Henley in 2008 after being elected Mayor of London. But since Mr Cameron became Prime Minister in 2010 there has been mounting speculation that Mr Johnson would seek a route back to Westminster, after vowing to only serve two terms at City Hall. After Mr Johnson announced his intention to return to Parliament the Prime Minister said the decision was 'great news'. But Mr Johnson could also pose a threat to his old school friend if the Tories fail to win an overall majority next year. Explaining his decision to return to Westminster Mr Johnson he said: 'I have danced around it for an awfully long time. The Prime Minster said ages ago that he would welcome me back. 'It is also been pretty clear I cannot endlessly go on dodging these questions as I have tried to do. 'Let me put it this way. I haven't got any seat lined up yet. But I do think that in all probability, since you cannot do these things furtively, in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.' He suggested that it was not a foregone conclusion that he would win which ever seat he stands in, adding: 'It is highly likely that I shall be unsuccessful in that venture. 'You should never underestimate the possibility of things going badly wrong. 'But one thing that is absolutely clear, I will serve out my mandate as Mayor of London.' UKIP's candidate in the seat, Jack Duffin, said Uxbridge and South Ruislip needed 'anything but Boris's ideas' - pointing to the London Mayor's bid to close Heathrow, build a high speed rail line between Manchester and London and grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. He said: 'Boris has nothing in common with Uxbridge & South Ruislip and isn't interested in anything but his own career.'","London Mayor submitted his name to Tory headquarters this morning .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron has been challenged to get off the beach and campaign to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom - by Alex Salmond. Mr Salmond laid down the challenge after it emerged the Prime Minister did not interrupt his summer holiday in Cornwall to watch last night’s live TV debate on Scottish independence. The Prime Minister also failed to tune in to the first clash between Mr Salmond and Alistair Darling – despite claiming it would ‘break my heart’ to see the United Kingdom broken up. Today, Mr Salmond said the PM was the real leader of the 'No' to independence campaign, adding: 'Let’s have him in Scotland now, let’s see if he can do any better that Alistair Darling did.' Scroll down for video . David Cameron, pictured on the beach in Cornwall just hours before last night's debate, has been challenged by the Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond to travel to Scotland to campaign against independence . Mr Salmond enjoys a Mars Bar outside Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow Invercylde today after a deal was struck to save jobs at the site . Mr Darling, the leader of the Better Together campaign, visited a factory in Paisley today following last night's mauling by Mr Salmond . The revelation risks reigniting accusations that Mr Cameron is too complacent about crucial matters of state – including Britain’s deepening role in the Iraq crisis and the possibility of the breakup of the United Kingdom. Mr Cameron returns to Downing Street tomorrow – from his third holiday this year – with less than three weeks to go before next month’s historic referendum on September 18. He will arrive back in London amid growing confidence within the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign, following last night’s crushing victory for Mr Salmond  in the second and final debate on independence. Mr Salmond easily won the contest according to a snap poll for ICM. Some 71 per cent of voters said the SNP leader was the victor. Just 29 per cent thought Mr Darling had won the contest. Today, a confident Mr Salmond challenged Mr Cameron to campaign against independence in Scotland. It comes after Mr Salmond accused his debate rival Mr Darling of being the ‘front man for the Conservative Party’ in last night's debate. He said: ‘Alistair Darling is in alliance with the Conservative Party in this campaign. That is what the No campaign is. ‘Let’s have the real leader of the No campaign, David Cameron. Let’s have him in Scotland now. ‘Let’s see if Mr Cameron is prepared to come to Scotland and have the debate.’ Last night's victory is a dramatic turnaround for Mr Salmond who was left flailing earlier this month after Mr Darling successfully challenged him over the economy and the future of the pound. Mr Salmond's challenge came after he clashed with Alistair Darling (left) in last night's live television debate on the BBC . First Minister Alex Salmond gets his make-make up during an interval in the second television debate last night . Former Chancellor Alistair Darling was left reeling after Mr Salmond went all out attack . But last night Mr Salmond came armed with a number of currency options for an independent Scotland, but insisted keeping the pound was the best. Mr Darling meanwhile was left repeating his criticism that Mr Salmond had not offered a plan B if Westminster stopped Scotland using sterling. A 'Yes' vote in Scotland on September 18 would trigger a political earthquake at Westminster – and could even force Mr Cameron to resign. The Prime Minister has insisted he would not resign if Scotland voted for independence. But if Mr Salmond triumphs next month, there will immediately be pressure for him to go from within his own party. Former Conservative leadership rival David Davis said a ‘Yes’ vote would be ‘particularly humiliating’ for Mr Cameron. John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, added: ""A Yes vote would destroy Cameron's place in the history books. He would become known as the prime minister who gambled on keeping Scotland in the union and lost his gamble.’ Despite the threat to his premiership, Mr Cameron’s spokeswoman indicated that the Prime Minister did not watched last night’s independence debate. ‘The Prime Minister watched news reports of the debate,’ said the spokeswoman. Asked why Mr Cameron had missed a key moment in the independence battle, she said: ‘The key moment is when people go to vote on September 18.’ The PM only watched highlights of the first debate earlier this month, which was won by Mr Darling, and perhaps he was confident of another victory by the pro-union camp. Following last night’s debate, Mr Darling admitted the battle to keep Scotland in the union would be fought ‘right down to the wire’. But the former chancellor insisted he was ‘increasingly confident’ that Scots would vote against leaving the UK when they go to the polls in just over three weeks’ time. Today, as he visited a factory in Inchinnan, Renfrewshire, Mr Darling said the No campaign had been ‘right to focus on currency’, adding: ‘One of the things that is striking in the last three weeks is the amount of people who have come up to me and said “What about this plan B?” is quite remarkable.’ When asked if changes would be made to the pro-UK campaign following last night’s debate, he insisted: ‘Absolutely not.’ Postal votes for the September 18 ballot are being sent out from today, and Mr Darling added that as the ‘finishing post’ comes into sight, Scots are increasingly focused on the decision to be made. He said: ‘There’s a very clear choice here and I think people can see that, people are very focused now, especially as they can see the finishing post. ‘I’m increasingly confident we will win, but it is our job to win well and to win well we’ve got to carry on campaigning up untill 10pm on September 18.' Mr Salmond meanwhile told Sky News he had ‘argued persuasively’ on currency, setting out his position that it was ‘common sense for a common currency’. He argued that the Yes campaign was winning ‘decisively’ on the key issues of protecting public services and creating jobs in Scotland. The First Minister said: ‘He (Alistair Darling) had his chance and he muffed it last night. The currency bluff has been called. The Scottish people are calling that bluff. ‘The No campaign had their chance, their bluff has been called. People have, I think, overwhelmingly in Scotland now in poll after poll shown that we want to keep the pound. That is the decision that the Scottish people are being asked to make.' The Scottish First Minister went on the attack immediately in last night's debate - questioning what would happen to the NHS, welfare and oil under Tory rule from London after 2015. Mr Salmond also claimed the former Labour Chancellor had made the ‘biggest revelation’ in the independence debate so far after he admitted Scotland could use the pound without the rest of the UK’s permission after independence. But Mr Darling said this would leave Scotland at the mercy of a ‘foreign country’ telling it how much it could spend like Eurozone countries which have to get their budgets signed off in Brussels. Mr Salmond also admitted for the first time that there were other options for Scotland than keeping the pound. He said: ‘I'm looking for a mandate to share sterling in a currency union.’ But he added: ‘There are other options for Scotland.’ However Mr Darling said: ‘The thing about a currency union is both sides have to agree to it. We are talking about a huge risk if we assume it’s going to fall into line. ‘It’s not a matter for Alex Salmond what the alternative is. If it’s the Panama model I want to know. If it’s the Euro I don’t want that either. I want to know what plan B is.’ But after being pressed by Mr Salmond he admitted: ‘We could us the pound.’ Mr Salmond said: ‘Alistair admitted we could use the pound anyway. They cannot stop us using the pound – the most important revelation in this debate.’ The pair also clashed over North Sea oil and the NHS. The SNP leader said every other country in Europe would give their ‘eye teeth’ for North Sea oil. But Mr Darling said: ‘Once it’s gone it’s gone. What I don’t want to see is my country so dependent on something that is so volatile.’ He added: ‘He is asking us to take his word on everything. ‘We need answers to tonight, right here right now.

"By . Jemma Gillard for MailOnline . A young woman who could die without a life-saving transplant is determined to survive to see her twin sister get married. Stacie Pridden, 23, from Swindon was finally diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in 2002, after years suffering from mysterious blackouts and sickness. Now she is currently awaiting a heart and double lung transplant. Twin support:Stacie (right) is preparing to act as her twin sister Megan's (left) maid of honour at her forthcoming wedding . But as she awaits the  transplant, she is also preparing for another important event - acting as her twin sister Megan's maid of honour at her forthcoming wedding. Stacie says: 'My body has to hold out a bit longer and there is a fight ahead of me, but I don't doubt that I'll be there to help Megan walk down the aisle. 'I'm determined to be there to celebrate her big day.' Stacie pictured receiving treatment was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension in 2002 and is now awaiting a heart and double lung transplant . The determined young woman, who also has an older sister, Candice, 25,was born with three holes in her heart and later diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension, a rare blood vessel disorder in her lung. Stacie added: 'Being ill is all I've ever known. 'My dominant memories from my school days were fainting during class, being ferried to and from hospital, going through operations and being given all sorts of medication. 'I know that if I had been on my own, it would have been impossible to deal with, but luckily Megan's been by my side from day one.' Stacie (right) with twin sister Megan (left) and older sister Candice, 25, (centre). Stacie was born with three holes in her heart . Megan, 23, says: 'When we were at junior school, Stacie took part in a three-legged race and collapsed at the finishing line. After that she started fainting regularly and I began watching her carefully. 'I helped her calm down and catch her breath when she she became ill at school. I went to lots of hospital appointments with her, so I was aware of the health challenges we were facing as a family. 'Her illness means that our circumstances are very different, but we're alike in most ways. We share everything and have similar interests - mainly our obsessions with TV shows and films. There's honestly nobody I prefer spending time with. 'Stacie is my best friend and my twin sister all rolled into one.' Staying positive: Stacie was officially put on the transplant list when her condition significantly worsened after her 18th birthday . When she was 11, Stacie was admitted to to Great Ormond Street Hospital, where her illness was diagnosed and doctors first mentioned the need for a major transplant operation. She was officially put on the transplant list when her condition significantly worsened after her 18th birthday. Stacie explained: 'Being on the transplant list is quite difficult to describe - you can't help but keep thinking about when you're going to die. 'In the first years you're certain that the call will come, but the longer you're on the list, hope starts to ebb away. Although I've remained determined and optimistic, I've also come to terms with the fact that I might not get the operation I need. 'The important thing is not to give up. I've found that a powerful way to stay hopeful is to imagine all the things I will get to see and do in the future - one of my most important dreams is seeing both my sisters get married.' Stacie (left) and Megan (right) are not just twin sisters, but best friends too . Stacie will have that opportunity when Megan marries her partner, James Pryor, in 2016, following their engagement in January 2014. Megan says: 'Stacie's never been resentful of the fact that our lives have been so different. She's always taken a huge interest in my life and it was her I turned to for advice when I started getting serious boyfriends. 'I knew straight away that Stacie would be my maid of honour. 'Every day I pray that she will hang on. The thought of not having my sister there when I get married is devastating. 'It's such a huge event in a girl's life, to go through it without my twin by my side would be unthinkable.'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Scottish lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has vowed to move to England if Scotland votes for independence following last night's bruising TV debate. Ms Mone said she would take her business to London in the event of a 'Yes' vote in next month's referendum. Following last night's debate between Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling, Ms Mone took to Twitter to slam the dangers of walking away from the UK. She said an independent Scotland's deficit would be too high and was concerned about losing the pound. Ms Mone also attacked the divisive impact of the independence debate after receiving a barrage of abuse from nationalists online. Scroll down for video . Michelle Mone, co-owner of MJM International and creator of lingerie brand Ultimo, has said she will move her business to England if the country votes for independence . Ms Mone said she was worried about the size of the deficit, jobs, oil and the pound in an independent Scotland . Ms Mone's remarks came after Mr Salmond last night crushed Mr Darling in the second independence debate - just three weeks before the country goes to the polls on September 18. Mr Salmond easily won the contest according to a snap poll. Some 71 per cent of voters said the SNP leader was the victor. Just 29 per cent thought Mr Darling had won the contest. But asked by a follower on Twitter if she would stay in Scotland if voters chose independence, the mother-of-three replied: ‘I'm off if it is.’ She added: ‘I said 2 years ago that I would leave if it was a Yes.’ She said: ‘Last point. We are stronger as a nation together. We don't own the £1, oil etc. Deficit is too high, bad for biz/jobs.’ After receiving a stream of Twitter abuse in response, Ms Mone added: ‘Can't believe the amount of hatred this vote is causing. It's extremely sad & will no doubt cause damage either way to the country I love.’ One follower wrote: ‘The quicker we vote yes, the quicker u get to f*** ya tramp!"" Ms Mone replied: ‘Why are you ""Yes"" voters so angry & abusive? Be professional.’ Two years ago Ms Mone said she felt Scotland could not survive on its own as ‘everything would go up’. First Minister Alex Salmond has said that under independence business tax would be lowered. He also pointed out then to the BBC's Andrew Marr show that Ms Mone had made a similar threat before the 2007 Scottish elections. Ms Mone's remarks come after Alistair Darling and Alex Salmond clashed over independence in last night's second and final debate . Ms Mone, co-owner of MJM International and creator of lingerie brand Ultimo said previously: ‘I will move my business and I will move personally. ‘I don't think we can survive on our own and I think it would be really bad for business. ‘Everything would go up and I really don't think we need it at the moment.’ Ms Mone, from Glasgow, who was awarded an OBE in 2010, ranks among the UK's most successful businesswomen.","Ms Mone said she would take her firm to London if there was a 'Yes' vote .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Britain faces being dragged further into the crisis in Iraq after Nato revealed it would consider intervening if the country asked. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Nato Secretary General, said Iraq was an ally and any request for military assistance would be looked at ‘constructively’. He said: ‘Nato has a partnership with Iraq and if there is a request for further enhancement of that partnership, I think Nato allies would consider such a request constructively.’ Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Nato would listen 'constructively' to a request for help from Iraq . Mr Rasmussen added: ‘The international community has a responsibility to stop the advance of the so-called Islamic state.’ Mr Ramussen’s remarks, which came after he praised US bombing raids on ISIS fighters and the reconnaissance effort of British forces – raises the prospect of Britain being dragged into the crisis through the commitment to Nato. Nato decisions on whether to launch military action require consent from all member states, meaning Britain would not be committed against its will. Mr Rasmussen also hinted that France should scrap its shipment of arms to the Russian government over the Kremlin’s continued interference in eastern Ukraine. He said the French government should listen to Nato allies that have criticised the sale of £1 billion Mistral-class warships to Russia. French President Francois Hollande (left) has been criticised by David Cameron (right) for pushing ahead with an arms shipment to Russia . David Cameron has said the deal would be ‘unthinkable’ in the wake of Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. But Mr Rasmussen said: ‘I'm not going to interfere with a national French decision.’ ‘That's not for Nato - it's a bilateral arrangement between France and Russia but I have full confidence the French government will take its decisions taking into account concerns raised by other allies and taking into account the overall security situation in Europe.’","Nato Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen says Iraq is a partner .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Alex Salmond ripped off the gloves and came out swinging in last night’s debate – landing crucial blows on the NHS, North Sea oil and most-important of all: the pound. The First Minister had been left reeling by Alistair Darling’s questions over currency in the first debate earlier this month. But Mr Salmond left nothing to chance last night – setting out ‘three plan Bs for the price of one’ while lambasting the 'No' campaign's negativity. Here MailOnline recaps the four crucial moments from last night's second and final live TV debate before the Setember 18 poll. Scroll down for video . The First Minister wrong-footed Alistair Darling by mentioning 'three plan Bs' instead of using the pound . The First Minister insisted it was in the best interests of Scotland to enter into a currency union with the rest of the UK - sharing the pound and all Britain's debts. But won applause after reiterating his threat that if Westminster stopped Scotland sharing the pound, Edinburgh would not take its fair share of the debt. Crucially, he also wrong-footed the former Labour Chancellor after finally admitting Scotland could use alternative currencies to the pound. He ‘set out the options to point out there are other things we could do’, highlighting a flexible currency union such as Sweden and Norway's and the fixed exchange rate that Denmark and Hong Kong share. But Mr Salmond then added: ‘We cannot be stopped from using the pound anyway.’ The SNP leader claimed the biggest revelation from last night’s debate was Mr Darling’s admission that Scotland could use the pound if it wanted and there was nothing Westminster could do about it. But Mr Darling said this would leave Scotland having to get its books signed off by London – much like Eurozone countries now have their accounts audited by Brussels. He said: ‘Of course we can use the pound... we could use the rouble, we could use the dollar, we could use the yen. We could use anything we want.’ Mr Salmond said: ‘The key point we have heard tonight is that Alistair admitted a few seconds ago we could use the pound anyway. We didn't need permission. ‘Totally different from what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said a few months ago, when he said “If you walk out of the UK, you walk out of the pound”. ‘Remember that, we have heard it tonight. They cannot stop us using the pound - the most important revelation of this debate.’ But closing the debate Mr Darling insisted that uncertainty over currency could ‘bring a country to its knees’. The former chancellor said: ‘I know there are some who are thinking about giving independence a chance, but when we can't be told about currency, I don't think that can be trusted.’ Mr Salmond (right) managed to neutralise Mr Darling's attacks on what currency an independent Scotland would use . During the televised debate Mr Darling accused the pro-independence campaign of scaremongering on the future of the NHS with claims that a Yes vote is needed to protect the health service north of the border from privatisation under the Tories. Mr Darling said: ‘What we need is less of that scaremongering and a realisation we all want the NHS to do well, we all want it to be there at the point of need, but to do that you need funding. 'Frankly taking on risks, not even knowing what currency you've got, is the real threat to the National Health Service.' But Mr Salmond landed crucial blows over the risk to Scotland’s public services of remaining in the UK, which could be run from London by the English-dominated Conservative party. He insisted that spending cuts south of the border could hurt the health service in Scotland if the referendum resulted in a No vote . He said: ‘That is why, to have a health service we can all trust and rely on, we've got to have a health service where we have financial control as well as policy control, so we can keep the National Health Service as the greatest public institution in Scotland.’ Mr Salmond also went on the attack over ‘ludicrous’ welfare cuts being pushed through in Westminster, singling out the ‘bedroom tax’ for particular abuse. The SNP accused Mr Darling of being ‘in bed with the Tory Party’ over welfare reforms - with this denied by the Better Together leader, who argued that it made sense to spread the cost of providing social security across all of the UK. Mr Darling said: 'We know there are people with disabilities, we know we've got an ageing population that will require more medical care, we know we've got a falling working age population. 'Why take that burden on five million people when it could be pooled and shared across 63 million? It makes no sense whatsoever.’ But the First Minister said 100,000 disabled people in Scotland were being hit by the UK Government's welfare cuts. He acknowledged these were difficult times but ‘you don't take it out on the disabled, you don't take it out on families with children’. He also hit out at the ‘bedroom tax’ removal of the spare room subsidy for social tenants, calling it ‘the most ludicrous tax of all time’. Mr Darling was left reeling by his SNP rival's aggressive tactics . The former Labour Chancellor warned against being too reliant on North Sea oil after independence - but was ridiculed by Mr Salmond who said countries like Norway were doing fine on their own. Mr Darling said the SNP was wildly over-optimistic about how much oil was left in the North Sea and said Scotland was gambling on the ‘volatile and uncertain’ revenue from the fuel for around 15 per cent of its income. He added: ‘Once it's gone, it's gone.’ But Mr Salmond said North Sea oil and gas ‘will be with us way beyond 2050’. He said ‘every other country in Europe would give their eye teeth’ to have the resource. 'The key point we have heard tonight is that Alistair admitted a few seconds ago we could use the pound anyway. We didn't need permission.' 'This is our time, our moment, let's seize it with both hands.' The bedroom tax 'must be the most ludicrous tax of all time'. 'Every other country in Europe would give their back teeth to have North Sea Oil.' 'No-one will run this country better than the people who live and work in Scotland.'","Alex Salmond offered a series of options  if London rejects currency union .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron warned EU leaders there would be 'consequences' for electing Jean-Claude Juncker president of the European Commission earlier this year and came close to threatening to walk out . David Cameron is preparing to threaten to back Britain quitting the European Union if it refuses to return sweeping powers back to Westminster. The Prime Minister has always refused to say he would campaign to sever ties if he failed to achieve his promised reforms, but is understood to now be prepared to issue the warning. Mr Cameron has pledged that a Conservative government would hold a referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. His efforts to pave the way for a new deal were dealt a blow earlier in the summer when he lost the battle to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the next European Commission president. Mr Juncker is seen as an ‘arch federalist’ in Downing Street – supporting more powers for Brussels over national Parliaments. The PM wants to Britain to be freed from the commitment to an ''ever closer union'' as well as a shift to powers flowing away from Brussels rather than to it. Among the other reforms he wants to secure are a reduction in red tape for businesses and the right to free movement to take up work, not free benefits. But critics warn that a significant overhaul is unlikely and he faces a major battle to win over Mr Juncker after publicly denouncing his candidacy. No timescale has been set for outlining the beefed up stance but the Conservative party's autumn conference is being considered, according to The Times. A source told the newspaper: ‘The shift was almost made public at the time Juncker was appointed, but that timing might have looked like petulance.’ The revelation comes after London Mayor Boris Johnson – seen by many as a future rival for the Tory leadership if Mr Cameron fails to secure a majority at the next election – called on the Prime Minister to declare he was prepared to walk away from the EU. Mr Johnson backed a report which claimed a British exit from the European Union would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution. Mr Cameron was furious that Britain's objections to Mr Juncker (right) - seen here receiving the Prime Minister with a high five in Brussels earlier this year - were ignored by other European leaders. He is now preparing to threaten to leave the EU if his proposed reforms are blocked . The study, by the Mayor’s economic adviser, banker Gerard Lyons, says that leaving the EU is ‘definitely a viable option’ and comes a ‘very close second’ to staying in a successfully reformed Union. He has claimed the UK could negotiate a ‘generous exit’ from the EU – giving access the European common market without the current political ties. Mr Johnson said his preferred option was to stay in a reformed EU, adding: ‘I think we can get there; but if we can't, then we have nothing to be afraid of in going for an alternative future, a Britain open not just to the rest of Europe but to the world, where we have historic ties and markets with vast potential for all the goods and services that originate in London - and will continue to do so under any circumstances.’","The Prime Minister may issue threat at next month's Tory Party conference .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Foreign students should not be counted as immigrants by the Government, the former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine has said. The Tory grandee said people did not have a problem with foreigners coming to Britain to study – because most went home after university – but were concerned about the level of immigration. Lord Heseltine’s remarks appear to hold widespread support among the public. A poll released today shows just one in five people consider foreign students ‘immigrants’. The Labour party has also backed the peer's proposal. Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna this morning said: 'Our view is that legitimate university students from overseas should be removed immediately from the net migration target.' Former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine said foreign students should not be counted as immigrants by the Government . Almost 60 per cent of the public, meanwhile, do not want the Government to reduce the number of international students in Britain. Lord Heseltine told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ‘There's no question about abandoning the immigration target or of the need to have very rigorous controls. ‘The thing got out of control under the last Labour government and this Government is doing its best to try to regain the borders. But I think that students are really not what people perceive as immigrants.' The Tory peer added: 'You have got two huge assets: one is the prestige of Britain's universities and the ambassadorial role which students who graduate here take with them out into the world wherever they go after graduation. ‘And then you have got the huge financial stability that foreign students bring to the universities in this country, enabling them to maintain their standards of excellence.’ But Migration Watch UK's chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘Nobody is against genuine students who return home but Lord Heseltine has not realised that only one third of non-EU students actually do so. ‘The student route has become a massive hole in our immigration system. That is why the Government must stick to their guns on this matter.’ Home Secretary Theresa May is under pressure to reduce 'net migration' - the difference between the number of people leaving Britain and those arriving each year . David Cameron has said he is seeking to reduce net migration to the 'tens of thousands' by next year. Last month the Prime Minister announced tougher rules to be imposed on universities and colleges which sponsor international students to study in the UK. From November, the threshold for stripping educational institutions of their 'highly-trusted sponsor' status will be cut, so that they lose it if 10 per cent or more of the individuals they offer places are refused visas, rather than the present 20 per cent. International students are the largest group of migrants from outside the EU counted in the Government's immigration figures. But a poll of 2,111 people found just over one in five – 22 per cent – class overseas students as immigrants, and only the same amount would support a reduction in their numbers. When people are told that students are part of the Government's immigration target, ‘the most common reaction is surprise and even bafflement that international students are classified as immigrants at all,’ according to a report by the British Future think tank and Universities UK, the representative organisation of the country's universities. Almost six out of 10 – 59 per cent - of people say the Government should not reduce the number of international students, even if it makes it harder to reduce immigration numbers. The figure was even higher for Conservative voters, at 66 per cent. Meanwhile three in four – 75 per cent – are in favour of allowing them to stay on and work after they finish their degree, with support rising to 81 per cent for Tory voters. And 60 per cent think international students bring money into the local economy, compared to just 12 per cent who think they are a net drain. Steve Ballinger, director of communications for British Future, said: ‘It is true that people in Britain are concerned about immigration. ‘What they're not worried about are international students coming here to study at our universities. The vast majority don't see international students as immigrants at all. ‘Trying to get net migration down by targeting international student numbers would be unpopular and would fail to address the public's anxieties about immigration. ‘Instead it would cost Britain the widely-recognised benefits that those students bring, both to local economies and to our world-class universities.’","Peer claims people aren't concerned with foreigners coming to UK to study .

Feeling the heat: Mr Clegg mixes vegetables at a community kitchen during his visit to the Sikh temple . Mr Clegg's visit is the latest official trade mission to New Delhi, amid a concerted drive by the Coalition to drum up trade between Britain and India. The Deputy PM held talks with India's recently-elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Mr Clegg wants to capitalise on the new Indian government's focus on re-energising economic growth – and hopes to sign a number of multi-million pound business deals. Over three days, the 40-strong delegation, which includes Mr Clegg's new unpaid India business adviser Lord Dholakia, will meet counterparts in New Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. Senior Government figures have made a series of trips to India since the coalition came to power in 2010 in an effort to create a new 'special relationship' and strengthen trade with the emerging economic powerhouse. Chancellor George Osborne and then-foreign secretary William Hague visited in July, while David Cameron has made three trips to India as Prime Minister.

'There is already £16 billion of trade every year between India and the UK. India invests more in the UK than it does in the rest of the European Union combined, and no country in the G20 invests more in India than Britain does.

Alex Salmond and Alistair Darling will go head-to-head tonight over the future of Scotland in a crunch debate set to be dominated by the pound, oil reserves and the ‘Tory threat’ to the NHS. Mr Salmond is expected to raise the risks of not choosing independence – including the prospect of leaving the EU and a future Conservative government slashing health and benefit spending. The clash, live on the BBC tonight from 8.30pm, is the pair’s second television debate and is being seen as Mr Salmond’s ‘last opportunity’ to convince Scots to back independence. More than 700,000 postal voters – nearly a fifth of Scotland's electorate – will receive their ballots on Tuesday. A recent poll of polls found 57 per cent of Scots will vote No to independence on September 18, while 43 per cent plan to vote Yes. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond (left) needs a clear win in tonight's second independence debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling (right) - chairman of Better Together campaign . The leaders' first live debate on August 5 was widely seen as a victory for Mr Darling, after the former Chancellor cornering the SNP leader over Scotland’s future currency. Tonight’s 90-minute event will be staged at Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow in front of an audience of 200 people selected by polling and research consultancy ComRes. Prof John Curtice of Stratchlyde University wrote in the Sunday Times: 'With the Yes side still behind in the polls and postal voting forms about to land on doormats, the encounter will be [Mr Salmond's] last opportunity to get his message across to a mass audience.' Mr Salmond has been under sustained pressure to reveal his ‘Plan B’ after his preferred option of keeping the pound in a currency union with the remainder of the UK was ruled out by all the main UK parties. The First Minister has dismissed this as pre-referendum posturing, and insisted Scotland will keep the pound ‘come what may’. But tonight Mr Salmond is expected to go on the attack over the threats to Scotland’s public services by staying in the UK and running the risk of English voters forcing a Tory government on the rest of the country. The ‘yes’ to independence campaign wants to convince voters that only independence can protect Scotland from further austerity and privatisation. In an interview in the Guardian, Scotland’s deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘If we don't [vote yes] then a few months after the referendum we may find ourselves waking up to another five years of a Conservative government that we didn't vote for. She said the next Tory government would be ‘intent on implementing further cuts and austerity that will hit our public services and hit the most vulnerable in our society’. She added that Scotland would also be ‘looking at the prospect of an in/out EU referendum that runs the risk of Scotland being taken out of the European Union against our will’. ‘The key thing if we don't vote yes is that all these key decisions that shape our future will be taken not by us but by Westminster as we are left on the sidelines complaining and wishing it were different.’ Mr Darling was first to accept the 'ice bucket challenge' after he was nominated alongside Mr Salmond by actor James McAvoy . The First Minister took up the ice bucket challenge in Dundee yesterday, 48 hours after his rival Mr Darling . Last week the Scottish government's health secretary Alex Neil accused Mr Darling of being ‘defender-in-chief of Tory cuts’. But a Better Together spokesman said: ‘The biggest threat to our public services in Scotland, like our schools and our NHS, is the £6 billion extra spending cuts the impartial experts at the Institute for Fiscal Studies say would be needed if we vote for separation. The reality is that independence would mean austerity plus.’ Gordon Brown last week unveiled new research showing that each Scot currently receives £200 more in health care spending a year than the average Englishman. ‘The only person who could privatise the NHS in Scotland today is actually Alex Salmond,’ the former Labour leader told party activists during a speech in Glasgow. Last year Scottish health care spending was the equivalent of £2,116 per person – far higher than the £1,912 in England and £1,964 in Wales, figures showed. Furthermore, Scotland in total receives around £950 million more towards health care than it would if the allocation was worked out by population share.","Alex Salmond is expected to raise the risks of not choosing independence .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A taxi driver who knocked down and killed a father-of-two before dragging his body 90ft along the road has walked free from court. Mohammed Irfan, 42, was chatting to a female passenger in the back of his cab when he mowed down Shaun Hodgkinson on October 27 last year. Despite feeling the car go over the 26-year-old, Irfan continued driving along the road in Sandyford, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, before finally stopping and discovering his lifeless body wedged under the car. Mohammed Irfan, 42, (pictured right outside Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court) was chatting to a female passenger in the back of his cab when he mowed down father-of-two Shaun Hodgkinson (left) on October 27 last year . However, despite pleading guilty to one count of causing death by careless driving at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, Irfan walked free from court. Sentencing him to 24-weeks, suspended for two years, Recorder Christopher Goodchild said: 'You caused the death of a person by reason of careless driving by a lapse of concentration. 'This was not a case of a man driving at high speed, or under the influence of alcohol, or without the lights on. 'What it was, was an ordinary working man like you momentarily lapsing. But that lapse killed a man. 'I must take account that he should not have been where he was and he bears that responsibility.' The court heard how Irfan had been twisting around in the seat of his Toyota Avensis to chat to a female passenger and did not see Mr Hodgkinson lying in the road after he struck him at around 4am. Prosecutor David Bennett said: 'There was a conversation between the defendant and the rear passenger. 'At times she leant into the gap between the seating. She described him as twisting in his seat to speak to her over his left shoulder. 'Immediately after the roundabout near KFC she noticed something and realised it was a person lying motionless in the road. The incident occurred in Sandyford, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire (above) at about 4am and Mr Hodgkinson died at the scene after suffering a fractured skull, ruptured heart, punctured lungs and a ruptured liver . 'She assumed the defendant would stop but he carried on, running over Mr Hodgkinson. The taxi shuddered. 'He brought his taxi to a stop. He got out and had a look but got back in and said he could not see anything. 'She suggested he looked under the vehicle. He did and saw someone trapped under his car.' Mr Hodgkinson suffered a fractured skull, ruptured heart, punctured lungs and ruptured liver. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Ahmed Nadim, defending, said the incident was a 'catastrophic tragedy'. He said: 'It was a momentary lapse. If his liberty must be denied it can be denied in the context of a curfew.' Irfan, of Codbridge Stoke-on-Trent, was made the subject of a five month curfew and banned from driving for two years and until he passes an extended test. He was also ordered to pay £300 costs. He refused to comment outside court yesterday.","Mohammed Irfan knocked down and killed father-of-two Shaun Hodgkinson .

Tesco supermarkets prove to be the worst for hygiene after it was revealed that 29 of its stores failed inspections aimed to protect customers from food poisoning. It was one of five big supermarket chains that saw stores fall foul of basic checks from the Food Standards Agency (FSA), according to figures from between 2012 and 2013 that were published in the Sun. Asda, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Aldi also had stores that failed to meet expected standards, according to the data. Scroll down for video . Tesco supermarkets prove to be worst for hygiene after 29 stores failed inspections aimed to protect customers from food poisoning between 2012 and 2013, according to figures published by the Sun . Lidl and Waitrose were the only two 'big seven' chains which saw all stores pass. The FSA reviewed hygiene practices at a total of 11,106 supermarkets in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Of that number, 510 did not maintain standard levels of hygiene. The data, which is regularly updated on the agency's website, reflects the standards of food hygiene found on the date of inspection or visit by the relevant local authority. Each premises is given a rating between zero and five - with two or below indicating that it does not meet the expected standards. Of the 1,789 Tesco stores that were reviewed, five received a 'one' rating. Of the 440 Asda stores that were inspected, five failed. Four of Sainsbury's 994 stores did not pass. Just two of the 516 Morrisons supermarkets inspected were found inadequate and one of Aldi's 382 inspected stores failed. All other 'fails' received by big chain supermarkets, including the 24 other Tesco stores, were awarded at a 'two' grade. Lidl and Waitrose were the only two of the 'big seven' supermarket chains which saw all stores pass reviews carried out by the local council into their hygiene practices . None of the chains inspected received zero, which would mean that the supermarket is in need of urgent improvement. A spokesperson for Tesco said: 'We take food safety and store hygiene extremely seriously and ensure all our shops are checked thoroughly on a daily basis. While any reported low score is clearly disappointing , these stores represent just one per cent of our shop estate in the UK. 'We’d like to reassure customers that when any issues are brought to our attention they are dealt with immediately by store colleagues.' A spokesperson from Morrisons said: 'We insist on the highest standards of food hygiene in every store, deal with any issues raised immediately and are currently awaiting re-inspection.' A spokesperson for Waitrose said: 'We have very high standards of hygiene and cleanliness across all areas of our business and we're pleased this has been recognised.' An Asda . spokesperson said: 'We expect high standards in every one of our 583 . stores. While we agree the information when these inspections were . carried out is correct, we don't believe it to be up to date. 'We've . made improvements in each of these stores and we've requested a further . audit from the local authorities to get up to date scores - these . further inspections have yet to be carried out.' Sainsbury's said this year its stores had scored four or above, according to the Sun. A . spokesperson for Lidl said: 'The health and safety of our customers is . paramount for us and these results show that the business model is . successfully meeting our objectives.' Giles . Hurley, Joint Managing Director of Corporate Buying at Aldi said: . 'Following the FSA visit, all points raised have been addressed and we . are currently in the process of applying for a rescore to ensure that . the rating awarded to our premises reflects the high standards that we . hold ourselves accountable to.'","Of 1,798 Tesco supermarkets reviewed, 29 failed hygiene inspection .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Launched as a frivolous way to raise awareness and funds for The ALS Association, everyone from Bill Gates to David Beckham has completed the Ice Bucket Challenge - and nominated famous friends to take a drenching too. Now residents of Gaza have launched their own version of the internet craze in order to raise awareness of the desperate conditions facing many living in the conflict-stricken territory. But rather than tip buckets of water - a precious resource in the Gaza Strip - participants are filmed tipping rubble out of a bucket over their heads. Scroll down for video . Precious: Ayman al Aloul (pictured centre), the Palestinian journalist who posted the first Rubble Bucket Challenge said that he could not justify using water for the challenge when so little could be found in Gaza . Resourceful: Instead of water, he asks participants to tip buckets filled with rubble over their heads. The video, filmed in the middle of a Gaza street destroyed by bombs, was uploaded to Facebook on Friday . Support: The challenge has taken off on Facebook and Twitter, where users have shown their support using hashtags #RemainsBucketChallenge #rubblebucketchallenge and #dustbucketchallenge . Ayman al Aloul, the Palestinian journalist who posted the first Rubble Bucket Challenge said: 'I have to do something and to send a message all over the world about Gaza.' In the video, filmed on a Gaza street destroyed by bombs, Aloul said that he liked the idea of the Ice Bucket Challenge, but that he couldn't justify using water. He said: 'The use of water is more important than to empty over our heads. And even if the water is available it is difficult to freeze it. He explained that he instead decided to use rubble taken from the remains of buildings. The inaugural Rubble Bucket Challenge video uploaded to the group's Facebook page on Saturday. By Monday morning, nearly 2,000 people had liked the page. The Ice . Bucket Challenge - which asks every person taking part to make a . donation to a charitable cause - has raised nearly £40million for the . ALS Association, which works to fight the neurological disorder also . known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. Macmillian Cancer Support has adopted the fundraising idea in the UK. But Aloul's aims are more modest. He said that, rather than 'material aid', he wanted people to offer their 'solidarity and support' for the people of Gaza. He said that, while he could see the benefit in having high-profile people take part in his challenge, he wanted it to be seen as something for all people to take part in. He said: 'It is not for specific people but for all people who sympathize with the Palestinian people. He added: 'We do not have water but this is what we have. Perhaps I will not find water to wash up with when I get home.' The challenge has taken off on Facebook and social network Twitter, where users have shown their support by posting videos along with the tags #RemainsBucketChallenge #rubblebucketchallenge and #dustbucketchallenge.

Witnesses told how they heard Ms Baker scream 'I’m going to die' as one of the four-inch spikes pierced her upper right arm. Impaled: Yvonne Baker, 30, pictured with part of the original gate, was walking past Rochester Cathedral in Kent last June when she tripped and pierced her right arm.

The spikes were removed from Chertsey's Gate after the accident and have been redesigned to incorporate smooth, rounded tips - making them safer for pedestrians. The new set of spikes, designed by a specialist blacksmith, were installed this week. At the time of the accident, Ms Baker, a construction site manager from Borstal, Kent,warned that the spikes could fatally injure someone. She said: 'What would happen if a child falls on it or an elderly person tripped? Someone could die.

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A bombed-out building left resembling a doll's house after the front was ripped off by an Israeli air strike has revealed the extent of the property damage in Gaza City. The image emerged as violence erupted on the West Bank as Israeli and Hamas leaders struggle to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. Both nations are currently observing a five-day truce in Gaza to allow indirect talks to continue in Cairo, Egypt. However, Palestinians today took to the streets in a violent outburst after Israeli militants allegedly fired shots across the border. Scroll down for videos . Resembling a doll's house: Rooms are seen in a damaged home early morning in the Shejaia neighborhood of Gaza City during a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas . Outburst: Palestinians on the West Bank threw themselves to the ground as Israeli militants advanced to quell a violent uprising. Activists hurled stones at the soldiers after one 'shot across the border' despite a ceasefire . Chaos: Unarmed civilians ran up to military trucks armed with stones and slabs of concrete to throw at them . Anger: Leaders claim to be 'making progress' with talks but Palestinians took to the streets with fake missiles . Masked activists hurled stones and slabs of concrete at the soldiers who fired tear gas and pellets. An Israeli military spokeswoman said 'we have no knowledge' of the alleged cross-border shooting. The outburst comes as Palestinian officials meeting Qatar revealed they are 'making progress' with their negotiations. The talks, taking place in Egypt, are meant to secure a substantive end to the monthlong Gaza war and draw up a roadmap for the coastal territory, which has been hard-hit in the fighting. Hamas is demanding the lifting of the blockade Israel and Egypt imposed after the militant group seized power in Gaza in 2007. Israel wants the entire territory to be disarmed. Ceasefire: The violence erupted as both nations observe a five-day ceasefire to hold talks in Cairo, Egypt . Demonstration: Masked with hijabs, men found rubble from the bomb-hit streets to hurl at the border guards . An elderly Palestinian joined the younger faction to react against the 'Israeli occupation' of the West Bank . Demands: Palestine wants full control of the border crossings, while Israel wants the territory disarmed . The proposal is believed to include the lifting of some restrictions, which would let Palestine's Western-backed president Mahmoud Abbas assume responsibility for border crossings. Israeli officials have said little about the negotiations, saying only that the country's security needs must be met. Hamas negotiators met with the Islamic militant group's leadership in Qatar on Friday to discuss a proposal for a long-term truce with Israel, with an official saying the group was inclined to accept the Egyptian-mediated offer. A Hamas official said his group had all but accepted the offer and was currently finalizing the wording. Reconstruction: Hamas officials vow to negotiate support to rebuild the border zone, battered by conflict . Reaction: A man hurls back a tear gas cannister thrown by Israeli soldiers to control the mass outburst . An Israeli military spokesman said they had 'no knowledge' of the alleged shooting that sparked the riot . 'The proposed agreement states in many places that lifting the blockade will come through measures and mechanisms agreed upon between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and this means Israel will always have the upper hand, and might return the situation on the crossings back to the way it used to be before the war,' he said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because the negotiations were still ongoing. He said the emerging deal would end hostilities and answer some immediate Hamas needs, including providing materials for reconstruction. The Gaza blockade remains the main stumbling block. It has greatly limited the movement of Palestinians in and out of the territory of 1.8 million people, restricted the flow of goods into Gaza and blocked virtually all exports. 'Trapped': Palestinians claim the Gaza blockade traps them within the territory and blocks all exports . Devastation: The fighting has killed more than 1,900 Palestinians and 67 Israelis - all but three of them soldiers . Israel says the closure is necessary to prevent arms smuggling, and officials are reluctant to make any concessions that would allow Hamas to declare victory. Israel, meanwhile, has demanded that Hamas be disarmed, or at the very least be prevented from re-arming, a term that is a virtual non-starter for the militant group. Hamas has recovered from previous rounds of violence with Israel, including a major three-week air and ground operation in January 2009 and another weeklong air offensive in 2012. It still has an arsenal of several thousand rockets, some with long ranges and relatively heavy payloads. The current cease-fire is the longest to be declared since the war broke out last month. The fighting has so far killed more than 1,900 Palestinians, the majority of them civilians, according to Palestinian and U.N. officials. Israel has lost 67 people, all but three of them soldiers.","Hamas and Israeli leaders are 'making progress' with indirect talks in Cairo .

"By . Harcharan Chandhoke . To the casual observer of their pitiful batting collapse in the second innings at Old Trafford, India genuinely looked like they had given up on this series. If that is a harsh assessment on a collection of highly-paid professionals representing their country, they have done little to dispel this impression in the last few days. It began in the immediate aftermath of their humiliating defeat inside three days at Manchester, when the captain MS Dhoni joked that at least his team would get ‘two extra days to rest’ before the final match at The Oval. Dhoni is a famously laid back individual, but perhaps it was unwise to make light of this particular predicament. It certainly didn’t go down well with India’s rather hysterical 24-hour TV news channels, which – for the benefit of those who have never seen them - are very much from the Fox News school of journalism. Relaxed: MS Dhoni and his team have been paintballing during time that could have been spent training . Since then several players have made the pilgrimage to the other Old Trafford to experience the aura of Manchester United, while Virat Kohli (batting average 13.50 in this series) walked on the pitch at Stamford Bridge holding a Chelsea shirt bearing his name before a pre-season friendly this week. To continue the theme of apparent frivolity, the team has also enjoyed a paintballing session – when it might be thought that extra nets would be a more productive use of their time. It can only be hoped that outward appearances are entirely deceptive in this case. For while the abject surrenders of the last two Tests are depressingly reminiscent of the two 4-0 whitewashes against England and Australia in 2011-12, India actually go into the final Test of this series with something to play for. Form Moeen Ali started the series well and has progressed since then, he was in excellent form in the last Test . And they need not look far for inspiration in how to reverse the momentum of the last two games. Going into the third Test it was England who were under fire for regular batting collapses, getting into the losing habit and being led by a captain who preferred setting defensive fields to going for the jugular. Then Ravindra Jadeja dropped Alastair Cook in the slips when he was on just 15, and England’s Lazarus act began. A 1-0 deficit quickly – and astonishingly easily – became a 2-1 lead for the home team. Two weeks is certainly a long time in international cricket. There is no magic solution or mystery player India can unveil if they want to emulate their opponents and bring one final twist to this absorbing series. If they are to win this final Test they must do so with the same players who, at times this summer, have looked like little more than village cricketers. Training: Shikhar Dhawan and Ravindra Jadeja chat during a practice session at The Oval . It goes without saying that the first imperative is to avoid another batting capitulation. The batsmen are far better than they have shown in the last two Tests, and it is surely time for the big names to deliver. Cheteshwar Pujara has at least made starts in most of his innings this summer, and he has mainly been out to outstanding balls or – as in the case of the LBW off Moeen Ali in last visit to the crease - one of the most shocking of the several appalling umpiring decisions in this DRS-less series. Virat Kohli, however, has no excuses for his dreadful run of form. Almost all of his dismissals have come while fishing without conviction outside off stump. It has not so much been the Corridor of Uncertainty as the Passageway of Utter Perplexity. Smiles: Jadeja and Kholi share a joke but the last two Tests have been no laughing matter for India . With typically insensitive timing, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has this week nominated Kohli to receive the Padma Shri, one of the country’s highest civilian honours. He would need to score nothing less than a century for this news to appear as anything other than a joke. To secure an unlikely win, India will have to take 20 wickets. It is a hugely daunting task but they should at least be bolstered by the return from injury of the hero of Lord’s, Ishant Sharma. India’s bowling line-up has been chopped and changed several times over the last four games, but it seems obvious that Sharma should be selected alongside Varun Aaron – who showed genuine pace and aggression at Manchester – and Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who appears to be running out of steam in this five-match series but may be able to summon up one final effort. Victory: Ravichandran Ashwin is the most likely source of victory for India at The Oval . In any case, Kumar is crucial to the batting line-up, as is the spinner Ravichandran Ashwin – the only player to bat well in both innings at Old Trafford. After the huge clamour for his selection into a previously all-seam attack, he sent down only 14 overs while being out-bowled by Moeen Ali. But he may find the bounce and turn of The Oval – a venue that has often been kind to spinners – more to his liking. Provided they can post a competitive first innings total, then Ashwin will become the most likely source of a win for India. If they truly want one, that is.","India face England in final Test at The Oval .

The group were said to have been carrying a black and white standard - versions of which are sometimes used by the Islamic State - during a demonstration against the conflict in Gaza on Saturday. Members of the Kurdish community are then said to have approached the men, who were reportedly of Pakistani-origin, before ripping up the flag. Scroll down for video .

This prompted the police officers to intervene, and two men were subsequently detained. South Yorkshire Police said the demonstrators were holding a Palestinian flag which bears a declaration to the Islamic faith - which was mistaken by Kurdish residents as one used by ISIS militants. Sarwat Jaf, a Kurdish refugee who left Iraq in 2006, told The Times: 'They said they were helping the Palestinians and they waved a Palestinian flag, but after that they brought the ISIS flag as well . 'The Kurdish people did not want that. They said terrorists are killing people in Kurdistan.' Footage Mr Jaf recorded on his mobile phone shows the streets lined with police officers in the aftermath of the confrontation. A police helicopter is also seen hovering above the area of the incident. A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police said: 'There was a planned peaceful demonstration on Saville Street, Sheffield, on Saturday 9 August in relation to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. 'The organisers of the demonstration were pro-Palestinian and were flying the Palestinian flag and a black flag that bears the Islamic declaration of faith. 'This was mistaken for a flag representing the militant group Isis by some local Kurdish residents who took offence. 'The Gaza demonstrators were adamant that no offence was meant. Overall, the demonstration was peaceful. They confirmed that two people were arrested - reports from witnesses suggest they were Kurdish. Response: Officers were forced to intervene after members of the Kurdish community ripped up a flag they believed to be linked to ISIS . Detained: Two men were arrested following the incident - they were believed to be Kurdish residents . Mr Jaf believes that the group accused of holding the flag should not have been walking through a part of the city where many Arab and Kurd refugees live. Concerns about homegrown involvement in terrorism are constantly increasing, with many Britons taking to Twitter to show their support for extremist movements. Around 500 people from the UK are said to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight alongside terrorists, some of whom have recently been seen holding the heads of beheaded soldiers. Last week a nun has torn down a black and white flag similar to one championed by Muslim extremists from the gates of a  housing estate in  London, and branded those who hoisted it up as 'naive young hotheads'. Confrontation: South Yorkshire Police said the Kurdish residents mistook the Palestinian flag for one representing ISIS militants . Crowd: A police car flashing blue sirens is parked in the middle of the road, next to a group of people in Saville Street in Sheffield . Calm: The footage shows officers still talking to members of the anti-Gaza protest . The emblem was hung alongside the Palestinian flag in Poplar, Tower Hamlets, as part of a 'end the siege in Gaza' campaign. A group of Kurdish students called The Solidarity Against Islamic State held a demonstration outside Downing Street last night. They were trying to raise money for people in Kurdistan who have been displaced by the ongoing conflict. The situation in Iraqi Kurdistan has been described as 'catastrophic', with British Prime Minister David Cameron and French president Francois Hollande being called to intervene. Symbol: A black flag similar to the one used by ISIS was seen hanging alongside a Palestinian flag at the gates of the Poplar housing estate in Tower Hamlets, London .

"By . Stephanie Linning for MailOnline . Shocking leaked pictures appear to show how Japanese soldiers are trained to resist torture - by having their private parts tied to a tree. The photographs, which made their way on to the internet this week, apparently show officers from the country's Self-Defense Forces undergoing a series painful training exercises. A number of the images show the military recruits standing naked in a forest - their private parts tied together by a piece of rough rope that is attached to tree trunks on either side. One of the photos, which were leaked online this week, shows naked recruits standing in a forest - their private parts tied together by a piece of rough rope that is attached to a tree trunk . Another image appears to show an officer smiling as he leans towards a naked recruit with a lit match. The exercises are thought to be part of training for how to withstand brutal torture and interrogation techniques . The men look battered and bruised after being tied together with rough rope looped around their necks and torsos. Japanese military have offered no comment on the pictures . In another, an officer, who appears to be more senior, smiles as he stands next to one of the naked recruits with a lit match in his hand. Some of the officers appear to be laughing as they subject the naked recruits to the brutal tests. It is understood that the men are being put through the 'Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape' programme, known as SERE, which provides military personnel with training in evading capture and survival skills. Part of the programme is thought to simulate the harsh interrogation and torture techniques that they could face if captured by enemy forces. The images have prompted a heated debate in Japan, where the military has provided no official comment on the pictures.Their authenticity has yet to be confirmed. Social media commentators widely criticised the images, saying it appeared to be an amateur operation - and an example of a waste of public money. This picture appears to show the senior officers laughing as they subject the recruits to the degrading and painful exercises. The pictures have been met with heavy criticism in Japan . The Japanese Self Defence Force was formed from the unified military forces of Japan that were established after the end of the post-Second World War Allied occupation of the country. And though its activities were confined to the Japanese islands until recently, officers have engaged in international peacekeeping operations. It is believed to have stepped up activities in the face of tension with China, especially regarding the dispute over control of the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.","Photographs show Japanese military recruits standing naked in woods .

"By . Pa Reporter . Former England captain Michael Vaughan has admitted he was wrong to suggest Alastair Cook should be replaced as the leader of the national side. Vaughan was one of a number of former England captains turned media pundits to criticise Cook in the wake of the humbling defeat to India at Lord's in the second Investec Test.

'No question, I was wrong,' said Vaughan on BBC Radio 5 live's the Tuffers and Vaughan Cricket Show. 'Two and a half weeks ago, I said a break would've done him good. 'But the England and Wales Cricket Board stood by him, he was strong and said: ""I'm the man to carry this young team forward.'' Cook responded to questions over his form with knocks of 95 and 70 not out in Southampton. Jumping for joy: England bowler Chris Jordan leaps into the air after sealing victory in the fourth Test . However, he was given a major let-off in his first innings when he was put down on 15 by Ravindra Jadeja, a reprieve that Vaughan thinks altered the momentum in the five-Test series. Vaughan said: 'I think that one catch is the real twist of the whole series. 'If Jadeja had caught Cook on 15, I really felt at that time, it would've been a disaster for the side.'","Vaughan said Cook should take a break after England's defeat to India in the second Test at Lord's .

UEFA's director of competitions Giorgio Marchetti is on the stage and explaining how the draw will take place. Scroll down to (11.20) to read how this will be done. the draw will start very shortly, so stay tuned. There is a good reason though, folks for Dudek's appearance. The 2015 Europa League final will be held in Poland's National Stadium in Warsaw (yes, the one which flooded for England's clash there a couple of years ago.) The former Liverpool and Poland keeper is the final ambassador and will help conduct the draw. ...but at least it's relevant. UEFA's general secretary lets us know the new rules to this year's draw which include the winner taking part in next season's Champions League. Now that's a carrot to dangle in front of a few sides. A good indication that this draw will actually get underway soon... Because on comes to the stage Youri Djorkaeff who won a pretty big trophy in 1998 (no, not just the World Cup) but the UEFA Cup with Inter Milan... which to you young folk out there is basically the Europa League. Well, I suppose I will have to give you both. The good news is the presentation ceremony is underway at the Grimaldi Forum, but with no sign of UEFA general Secretary Gianni Infantino, the draw won't start just yet - instead we will get a seemingly endless highlights reel from last season's action (JUST GET ON WITH IT!) Tottenham were in action last night as they strolled to a 3-0 victory over AEL to win 5-1 on aggregate, but it was disaster for Hull who were eliminated by Lokeren on away goals, despite winning 2-1 at the KC Stadium and drawing 2-2 in the tie. All three British clubs in the draw today could face the Belgian outfit who are in pot four. The pots are decided by UEFA ranking, but how can Everton only be in pot three when they finished above Tottenam (top seeds) in the Premier League last season? It's a matter of consistency folks. Form over five years is taken into account and Spurs' constant European presence stands them in good stead. Is it fair? Maybe not, and on that note it's worth reading Martin Samuel's excellent column which covers UEFA's ranking system following yesterday's deja-vu Champions League draw. Legia Warsaw of course knocked Celtic out of the Champions League in the third qualifying round a few weeks back, but were penalised by UEFA for a technical infringement. Celtic then took their place in the play-off round, Warsaw were dumped into Europa League. But with Celtic being knocked out of the premier competition (again) these two sides could now meet again in the Europa League group stage. It could be a hostile encounter going by this banner seen from Warsaw's play-off win over Aktobe. (How do you get a banner that big inside a ground?) It's quite simple folks, in fact, it's A LOT more simple than the number system from the play-off round which just about left me shaking in the corner while laying in fetal position. One team will be taken from each of the below four pots to make one group. The major restriction is no side can play a side from their association - so that rules out a group featuring Tottenham (pot one) and Everton (pot three) - but one of them could face Celtic (pot two). Also for understandable political reasons, I believe Ukrainian and Russian sides will also be kept apart. UEFA's Giorgio Marchetti I'm sure will inform us a few moments before the draw. Outside draws anyone? Maybe they could take it on tour like the 'Bureau de Change' on The Day Today... nope, just me then. Who says the Europa League is boring? Having a look at the teams in the draw for the group stage today gives me hope we could have some cracking ties before Christmas this year. For instance, Celtic could line up against Tottenham or Everton this term while there are some big sharks swimming around in Inter Milan and the holders Sevilla. I'm looking forward to this draw...

"By . Jeff Powell . Follow @@jeffpowell_Mail . One of the secrets of Frank Maloney’s success – although not the biggest secret as it turns out - was that he was one of the lads. A cheeky South London chappie and a tough-nut Millwall fan, he invariably celebrated his triumphs as manager of world heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis by enjoying a night out with the boys at one or other of those flesh-pots which are euphemistically known as gentlemen’s clubs. The loyalty which is bred into most working-class road warriors was also fundamental to Maloney’s solid relationships with Lewis and all the boxers in his stable. Ecstasy: Maloney (right) as Frank, reacts after managing Lennox Lewis (left) to the World Heavyweight title in 1997 . Living a lie: Maloney (left, last year) admitted she has felt trapped in a man's body since she was a child and (right) with a young Lewis in 1989 . Winner: Maloney (front centre) celebrates after Lewis (arms raised) beat Donovan 'Razor' Ruddock for the Commonwealth heavyweight title at Earl's Court in 1992 . Belting: Maloney (right) with Lewis after the Londoner beat Gary Mason to win the British heavyweight title . Maloney was both a promoter and manager and the boxers he has worked with include... Lennox Lewis . David Price . Rendall Munroe . John McDermott . David Haye . Julius Francis . Jon Lewis Dickinson . They trusted him, they felt safe confiding in him and some of them over-achieved because his belief in them never wavered. He managed and promoted them with a passionate machismo, fighting their corner as fiercely as they battled in the prize ring. So no, I did not see this coming and I will be surprised if anyone else did outside the very immediate family circle. Frank – or Kellie as she now wishes to be known – is a good pal, an entertaining dinner companion, a boxing brain worth picking and will remain so. The Mental Midget – as dubbed by legendary US promoter Don King during one of their feuds – always has been a character larger than that diminuitive stature. Now that the Union Jack suit worn while working the corner of Lewis and David Haye on big world title fight nights has been exchanged for female attire that figure will become one of bizarre fascination, also. Maloney’s effervescent sense of humour will help cope with the curiosity, however morbid, and once the shock at the sex change has subsided she will chuckle along with the inevitable jokes which are already rife on the social media, . The major concern will be the fall-out for those three beloved daughters from two marriages. Glove story: Maloney is best known for managing Lewis, who rose to become world heavyweight champion . As for Kellie, nee Frank, the hide of a rhino developed in the concrete jungle of prize-fighting should deflect even the most wounding of the barbs. Maloney was derided at first for bringing Lewis back to his London birthplace from Canada,the country where he had spent most of his formative years and for which he had won his Olympic gold medal. The mood in Britain changed as Maloney’s prediction that he was bringing home this country’s first world heavyweight champion for more than a century began to look accurate. So persuasive was Maloney that the Americans began to believe in Lewis, also. So firmly that Riddick Bowe – the same Big Daddy who had dethroned the great Evander Holyfield - preferred to dump his WBC belt In a dustbin rather than defend that cherished, linear title in London. During their 12 years together Maloney guided Lewis onwards to the undisputed world championship and Lennox the Lion is still the most recent heavyweight to hold that distinction. Maloney’s negotiating skills allied to the exceptional power and natural talent of Lewis generated one of the most successful partnerships in the history of the British ring. Their friendship survived their professional split in 2001. Click here to read about Kellie Maloney's decision . Maloney guided Haye to his first world title, at cruiserweight before the Hayemaker took his swing at the heavyweight division, and also helped Scott Harrison and Paul Ingle to similar glory. There were dozens of British champions and Maloney looked to be on the brink of helping another domestic heavyweight to a world belt until David Price suffered consecutive stoppage defeats by American Tony Thompson . Maloney had been against Price rushing into that re-match and soon after, last October, the retirement announcement came: ‘I’ve fallen out of love with boxing and no longer feel I can continue to give it my best efforts.’ Now we know there were other demons haunting one of the most popular personalities in the hardest game. Perhaps, as Maloney retreated with greater frequency from the family house in Kent to a second home in Portugal, we might have suspected some kind of identity crisis. Smile: Maloney (right) with British cruiserweight Jon Lewis Dickinson following his victory over Shane McPhilbin in 2012 . Team: Maloney (right) with promoter Frank Warren (left) and their client Scott Harrison in 2003 . The power of three: Maloney (right), Warren (left) and the king of the promoters, the controversial and outspoken American Don King . But, no, there was not even an inkling of trans-sexual feelings, gender re-orientation or hormone treatment in preparation for an operation. Not in this corner. Nor so much as a hint of uncomfortable behaviour at public or social occasions. When Maloney was voted Promoter of the Year by the Boxing Writers’ Association of America - perhaps the most important of several individual accolades – I was invited to New York to make the presentation and he was saluted with affection by many of the biggest names in the sport in the US. The majority of what Maloney called ‘my special bond’ with such domestic champions as Julius Francis, the late James Oyebola, Rendall Munroe and Graham Earl - ‘they gave me some of my favourite nights in the ring’ - survived a heart attack five years ago. Now, as this 61-year-old attempts to begin a new and very different life, more support is likely to be forthcoming from the tough world of boxing than Kellie Maloney might imagine at this moment of revelation.","Frank Maloney announced that he is becoming a woman, Kellie .

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Life has changed for Moeen Ali this summer but he has risen spectacularly to every challenge thrown at him, from proving his worth as Graeme Swann’s spinning successor to dealing with the fallout from expressing an opinion on Gaza. Not many England players have made quite such an impact, on and off the field, in their first year of Test cricket, but then not many have the same potential to be both a key player and a positive role model for modern Britain. Moeen talked with a rare maturity at The Kia Oval on Wednesday, if slightly more warily than before his beliefs became a national issue, as he contemplated his extraordinary introduction to both Test cricket and the public consciousness. VIDEO Scroll down for 'Moeen Ali: This was my best moment in an England shirt' Controversy: Moeen Ali admits he did not realise how much would be made of his wristbands . Good sport: Ali warms up with a different shaped ball before the fifth Test at the Kia Oval . The impression that English cricket has a gem in its midst, formed when meeting him for the first time in a Birmingham school in May, was certainly reinforced as Moeen tackled his unexpected off- spinning success, his problems against the short ball, his faith and those pro-Palestinian wristbands. First Gaza and proof that Moeen is different from sportsmen all too often accused of lacking a hinterland. ‘I have a lot of opinions on a lot of stuff,’ said Moeen. ‘I wasn’t trying to be political. It was a humanitarian thing. I will speak about it at some point but I don’t think it’s the right time, before a Test. Role model: The part-time spinner is a role model within the English side, particularly for British Asians . ‘I didn’t think the wristbands would be such a big deal. I just totally forgot I had them on when I went into bat. I have to be a lot more careful. ICC didn’t allow me to wear them and I accepted that. I’ve had a lot of positive reaction and I’d like to thank the ECB for supporting me on it.’ A picture emerged after that third Test incident of Moeen seemingly at a political rally in his home city. The reality was a bit more prosaic. ‘I was actually on my way to ASDA with my family,’ he insisted while wearing Waitrose on his shirt. ‘A guy recognised me and asked me to pose for a picture. I do like to do charity work but on that day all I was doing was going shopping.’ It was his six second-innings wickets in Southampton followed by four more in the second innings at Old Trafford that mark out Moeen as much more than the part-time spinner that Alastair Cook and Peter Moores thought. Change up: The spinner has had to speed up his action to make an impact with the ball in test cricket . Stuart Broad was a notable absentee on Tuesday as England began preparing ahead of the final Test but he is still expected to take his place at The Kia Oval. Broad’s nose was broken in two places when he was struck by a 88mph delivery from Varun Aaron while batting at Old Trafford last week but England’s medical staff have given him the all-clear. He sat out Tuesday's net practice but England insist this was part of the plan and that he will be fit to take his place on Wednesday when Ben Stokes and Steven Finn get a final chance to force their way into the side. Broad was considering wearing a mask here to protect his face but it now seems he will wear a protective nose splint instead. ‘It’s not very pretty,’ Joe Root said. ‘He’s not got the boy-band looks you’d normally associate with Stuart. He’s milking it, as you’ve probably seen on all the social media, but I’m sure he’s desperate to play.’ Another absentee at the Oval was India captain MS Dhoni who, instead of practising, decided to indulge his hobby of shooting at a London range. Dhoni, it seems, is very much a law unto himself. Ahead of tomorrow’s final Investec Test he is on 19 wickets from four matches, just one short of the England record in a home series against India, held since 1967 by Ray Illingworth. ‘After the first Test, where I went for quite a few, I felt the need for change,’ said Moeen. ‘Ian Bell took me to one side and said, “Look, this is what you’ve got to do to be consistent in the Test side: bowl quicker and straighter, especially on a first-day pitch”. ‘Then I went into the nets and the umpire Kumar Dharmasena was there and I asked him, as a former off-spinner, how I could bowl quicker without it being flat. ‘And he said, “Just grab your pocket as quickly as you can with your non-bowling arm when you bowl”. As soon as I bowled one ball I knew it would work. Delight: After a tough Test at Trent Bridge, Ali has improved markedly, after taking advice from Ian Bell . ‘I’ve always felt I could take wickets, even at Trent Bridge where I didn’t bowl well, but it was about being consistent and getting the captain to keep me on for longer periods. My mentality changed after that first Test. ‘I don’t feel I’m there yet. But I do believe I’ve taken a big step towards being a decent Test spinner. I feel like I have more control, and that my captain and team-mates can trust me.’ Moeen, of course, is a batsman first as he demonstrated with a century against Sri Lanka at Headingley. But he has run into problems against the short ball against India. ‘When you get out a couple of times the same way you think about it,’ he said. ‘I’ve probably been thinking about it too much, whether to take it on or not. Running through: Ali has taken 10 fourth-innings wickets in the last two Tests to knock over the Indian line-up . ‘I’m just going to go back to basics and my own game now.’ When we spoke in May, Moeen talked passionately about the good he could do to improve the image of Islam in this country and to encourage British Asian youngsters to be more inclusive and embrace the English system. His views have not changed even if, sadly, he has been advised to be careful when talking about religion because, as was the case in one report, it can be misconstrued. ‘I’ve always supported England 100 per cent,’ he said. ‘I was born and raised in England and am more English than people seem to think. 'If a British Asian supports Pakistan or India I have always questioned it, but I think things are changing. Centre of attention: The off-spinning batsman has already become a key character in a young team . ‘I have never encountered prejudice and that’s what I want British Asian kids to know. That if you work hard, you can achieve anything. ‘That’s the kind of barrier I want to break down. That people think it’s tough or will treat you badly if you’re a practising Muslim or whatever. ‘That is the reason I like to play cricket for England — because I can break down barriers and inspire kids, not just Asian ones, to play.’ It is an attitude that has created a very impressive, modern young Englishman.

"By . Craig Hope for MailOnline . Follow @CraigHope_DM . CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's full match report from the Stadium of Light . It was the summer of love for 3-5-2. But as the last few rays of our sunshine season landed on the Stadium of Light, the celebrated system was cast in the shade. Yes, United escaped with a 1-1 draw, but this was another defeat for Louis van Gaal’s preferred formation. Tinker man: Louis van Gaal goes through his team tactics alongside assistant Ryan Giggs ahead of the game . Holy trinity: Manchester United's 3-5-2 formation allows (L-R) Robin van Persie, Juan Mata and Wayne Rooney to play in their preferred positions . With Holland at the World Cup in Brazil it had rightly been lauded as, against the odds, the Dutch finished third. Van Gaal rolled out the same system as he debuted in the United dugout during the pre-season tour of America – again, it was as if we were witnessing the formation which would define the campaign ahead, no doubt mimicked up and down the land. But then the real action kicked in and, after 45 unsatisfactory minutes against Swansea last week, Van Gaal reverted to four at the back. At Sunderland, though, it was back to 3-5-2. It did not work. Dutch of class: Robin van Persie almost scored the winner in his first United game under Louis van Gaal . Getting up and down: Antonio Valencia plays the right wing-back role in the new United system . Case for the defence: Phil Jones was Manchester United's best player, according to Gary Neville . For no matter the method of approach, United were repeatedly undone at the back, nerves, inexperience and baffling positional play all contributing factors. Be it air or land, they could not deal with the advances of the hosts. Tyler Blackett’s inclination was to operate as centre-half-cum-left-back, leaving Chris Smalling exposed. Phil Jones, likewise, on the right of that back three. The upshot was that Smalling was replaced just before the break, his hamstring having seemingly given up under the strain of attempting to marshal such a disorganised backline. Special Juan: Spanish playmaker Juan Mata opened the scoring at the Stadium of Light . Perfect 10: Juan Mata celebrates after scoring United's opener from his position in 'the hole' That's torn it! United's plans were thrown into chaos after Chris Smalling was forced off with a hamstring injury . Level headed: United's three man defence was largely absent as Jack Rodwell equalised for Sunderland . Jack in the box: New signing Jack Rodwell kisses the badge after scoring his first goal for Sunderland . Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young were the wing-backs charged with offering protection to the rearguard. But it was their errant passing which seemed to spread panic through their comrades at the back. Young, in particular, had little care for the duty of defending, Sunderland right-back Santiago Vergini strolling beyond him on one occasion before taking up a position unmarked on the penalty spot. Connor Wickham twice broke clear early on but failed to capitalise on the space afforded to him. There were other chances, too, the unattended Lee Cattermole blazing over from the edge of the area chief among them. But forget systems for one moment, Sunderland’s equaliser was simply a case of abdication of responsibility, Jack Rodwell peeling off Valencia to nod home with ease from Seb Larsson’s corner. Out of his depth? Ashley Young struggled with the defensive side of his wing back role . Histrionics: Sunderland manager Gus Poyet urges his team on from the sidelines . Under watchful eye: Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was on Wearside to watch Louis van Gaal's side . Invisible man: Wayne Rooney was a peripheral figure as a forward in Louis van Gaal's 3-5-2 system . Back to the drawing board? Louis van Gaal watches as his tactics fail to win three points . Frustration: Juan Mata kicks a water bottle after missing an opportunity to give United the lead . Even after the break the space in behind United remained open for business and Larsson duly scampered clear only to be denied by the recovering Blackett. On an attacking front they offered precious little also, Juan Mata – his opening goal apart - Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie all peripheral and at times frustrated figures.

"By . Declan Warrington . ‘The Celtic Warrior’ Steve Collins is to train London super middleweight Frank Buglioni after his split from Mark Tibbs. Buglioni, nicknamed ‘The Wise Guy’, turned to Collins in the belief the Irish great can inspire him to a world title. He will divide his time between working with Collins in both London, and Dublin’s Celtic Warriors gym, where Collins’ brother Paschal will also be involved. Wise guy: Frank Buglioni celebrates following his European title win . Relaxing: Former boxer Steve Collins is to train the super middleweight fighter . ‘When I met Frank I liked everything about him,’ Collins said. ‘He’s a hell of a fighter and has a great future. I believe he has the ability to go all the way and be a world champion. ‘He’s a very handsome young man who can fight. That’s a rare commodity. He’s got heart, a good chin and intelligence. ‘If you have all those three, you can build a champion.’ Collins, who travelled to the US to train alongside middleweight legend Marvin Hagler during his prime when he twice defeated both Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn, added Buglioni considered a similar move. ‘I think Frank wanted a change of scenery. I think he wanted to change from a British style and was looking to go for the American scene. ‘So I said to him: “America’s a long way. Why don’t you go to Dublin and check out The Celtic Warriors camp, because Paschal is the main man over there. And he’s come through the [American] system, spent five or six years with the Petronellis [brothers Goody and Pat], finished with Freddie Roach, so you might not need to go to America.” Former pair: The move comes following the split between Buglioni and his former trainer Mark Tibbs . ‘So he went to Dublin and absolutely fell head over heels. Loved the set up over there. Loved the coach, loved the sparring, and knew straight away that was for him. ‘Myself, and my brother Paschal are two heads working together. This will bring more attention to the Celtic Warrior camp in Dublin.’ Buglioni, 25, explained: ‘There are similarities between me and Steve as fighters. ‘Steve’s a giant of the sport and I feel he’s got the experience and knowledge to help me fulfil my goals.’ Tibbs added: ‘I wish Frank all the best. He deserves everything he gets out of the game.’","'The Celtic Warrior' Steve Collins is set to train Frank Buglioni .

"By . David Clough, Press Association . Stuart Broad was one of two notable absentees from practice at The Oval before the fifth Investec Test between England and India.

Draw 12/5 . Chelsea 11/10 . Referee: Jonathan Moss . Managers: Roberto Martinez (Everton), Jose Mourinho (Chelsea) Head-to-head league record: Everton wins 49, draws 47, Chelsea wins 54 . Team news . Everton . Everton will assess the fitness of two former Chelsea strikers, Samuel Eto'o and Romelu Lukaku, prior to the Londoners' visit to Goodison Park in the Barclays Premier League on Saturday. Eto'o has been short of match fitness, having only joined the club this week, while Lukaku has had a toe injury. Another player with Chelsea connections, on-loan winger Christian Atsu, cannot face his parent club. Out to prove a point: Romelu Lukaku (left) will hope to feature for Everton against his former club Chelsea . Midfielder Steven Pienaar (groin) is definitely missing but midfielder Darron Gibson is still pushing to return after 10 months out. Midfield duo Ross Barkley (knee) and Bryan Oviedo (leg), and striker Arouna Kone (knee) remain sidelined. Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Coleman, Hibbert, Distin, Jagielka, Stones, Baines, Alcaraz, Barry, McCarthy, Osman, McGeady, Besic, Naismith, Mirallas, Lukaku, Eto'o. Chelsea . Summer signing Diego Costa is a big doubt for Chelsea's Premier League clash with Everton on Saturday. The 25-year-old forward has missed the previous two days of training with a minor muscular injury and will be assessed on Friday afternoon. Ground to a halt: Diego Costa's good start to the season for Chelsea has taken a setback due to a muscle injury . Jose Mourinho has to make a decision on whether to include Fernando Torres amidst speculation over his future, while goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois could again be selected ahead of veteran Petr Cech. Provisional squad: Courtois, Cech, Ivanovic, Terry, Cahill, Zouma, Azpilicueta, Luis, Fabregas, Hazard, Oscar, Matic, Ramires, Mikel, Willian, Schurrle, Costa, Torres, Drogba . Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Everton have won four of their last five Barclays Premier League home games against Chelsea. Since the 2009-10 season, Chelsea have lost four times to Everton; only Manchester City (5) have beaten them more often in that period. If games had ended at half-time this season Everton would be top, Chelsea fifth. If games just encompassed the second half then Everton would be bottom with zero points. Chelsea have conceded just nine goals in 2014, fewer than any other ever-present PL side. Proving a point: Steven Naismith scored the winning goal on half-time during the sides' last Goodison Park meeting, as Everton defeated Chelsea 1-0 last September . Everton new boy Samuel Eto’o scored nine Premier League goals for the Pensioners in 2013-14 but all of them came at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have not lost their third game of the season since succumbing 2-0 to Middlesbrough in 1995. Diego Costa has had two shots on target this season and scored with both. Cesc Fabregas has assisted at least one goal in his last four Premier League appearances (five assists overall), a personal record for the Spaniard. Eden Hazard has embarked on more dribbles than any other Premier League player this season (22 – eight more than any other player).","Former Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o to be assessed .

Fury, who was originally scheduled for a bout with Dereck Chisora before his fellow Brit was forced to withdraw through injury, pulled out of the fight with Ustinov on Saturday morning after his uncle Hughie was taken to hospital. And Fury's other uncle and trainer Peter has clarified the reasons behind the boxer's . decision to withdraw from the fight.

Peter Fury told World Boxing News: 'On the afternoon of the 25th of July, I received a call just fter leaving the press conference for Tyson and Eddie Chambers' fight at the Phones 4U Arena in Manchester. My elder brother had gone for a routine operation to place a pin in his leg below the knee. 'The operation was a success as fully expected, however a blood clot developed due to having a cast on his leg and sadly it travelled through to his arteries making the situation far worse. 'Since the operation, Hughie has been in the intesive care unit at Lancaster royal Hospital where we are all by his side awaiting news. He is in critical, but stable condition at present and we are very worried. 'Hughie trained Tyson for both his fights with John McDermott and Dereck Chisora in the past and this situation has really affected Tyson and the whole family as we are praying for a positive outcome. 'We would like to thank everyone for all the nice messages of support and prayers for our family as they have been deeply moving and much appreciate. We are sorry to all the fans that we had to cancel the fights due to what is a terrible situation for all involved. No go: Tyson Fury (left) and Alexander Ustinov's fight is off after Fury's uncle was taken ill . 'As everybody knows, we are a very close family and nothing, absolutely nothing, comes before our brother and Tyson's uncle's well-being. We would also like to give special thanks to the doctors and staff at Lancaster Royal Hospital for their dedication in the work they do - especially in the ICU unit.' In a statement released by Queensberry Promotions, Hughie was said to be 'seriously ill' and Fury's camp therefore took the decision to 'pull him out of the fight rather than risk his health by sending him into the right with his mind not focused.' It is not clear what Hughie's condition is. Fury had only decided to take on Ustinov earlier this week after original opponent Dereck Chisora withdrew from Saturday's date after fracturing his hand in sparring. Ironically Chisora's injury came when he was sparring Ustinov. Warren said: 'I'm very, very, disappointed for the fans.  After Dereck Chisora pulled out because of his hand injury, we worked very hard to secure a world ranked opponent in Ustinov. 'It's sad that his uncle Hughie is in a serious condition and our thoughts are with him. We will be announcing the rescheduled date for Chisora v Fury next week.'","Fury's uncle, Peter, says Tyson was 'really affected by Hughie's illness .

"By . Tony Jimenez . Claudio Ranieri has promised to give young players a chance after being officially presented as the new coach of Greece. The much-travelled Italian signed a two-year deal in July to have his first crack at international coaching after the contract of his predecessor Fernando Santos expired following the World Cup in Brazil. Under Santos, Greece reached the last 16 for the first time before losing to Costa Rica on penalties. Greece is the word: Claudio Ranieri has signed a two-year contract to manage Greece . Must do better? Greece celebrate victory over Ivory Coast on their way to the last 16 of the 2014 World Cup . 'I'm very happy to coach the national team of Greece and, although I had other proposals, I chose this one operating on instinct,' Ranieri told a news conference on Friday. 'I came here to take the team as high as possible. Our immediate aim is to qualify for Euro 2016 in France - it won't be easy but we have the potential and the talent to succeed. 'It's a great challenge. I believe in young players and there will be ample opportunities for them to show their potential,' added the 62-year-old former coach of Monaco, Chelsea, Valencia, Parma, Juventus, AS Roma and Inter Milan. 'I am very interested in working with the younger players, who are the future of the team, and I will be in contact with the clubs in an effort to work with them on a regular basis.' Au revoir: Claudio Ranieri received a £4million pay off sacked as Monaco manager in May . Ranieri's first match in charge will be a home Euro 2016 qualifier against Romania on Sept. 7. The tie will be played behind closed doors after 2004 champions Greece were punished for previous crowd disturbances. Northern Ireland, Hungary, Finland and Faroe Islands provide the rest of the opposition in Group F. Ranieri has kept faith with the bulk of the squad that represented Greece at the World Cup and added several youngsters such as 21-year-old Olympiakos Piraeus striker Dimitris Diamantakos. The new captain will be chosen by the squad after the talismanic Giorgios Karagounis decided to retire. Well travelled: The Italian has managed numerous European clubs including Chelsea 2000 - 2004 . 'I will be telling the players that being captain is very important,' said Ranieri. 'You represent the whole team and the country. 'The next captain will be selected by elections. The individual should have the charisma to be able to bear the burden of having such a title.' Ranieri was sacked by Monaco in May.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan . Celtic are weighing up a move for £1.5million-rated Gambian strike prospect Modou Barrow. A 21-year-old striker with Ostersunds FK in Sweden, Barrow was the subject of a rejected £600,000 bid from Bolton Wanderers after spending last week on trial with the English Championship club. And Ostersunds president Daniel Kindberg claimed the Scottish champions are also interested in the pacy forward, following a glowing recommendation from former Hamilton boss Billy Reid — now the Swedish club’s assistant manager. Hot property: Modou Barrow has the quality to reach the top according to the assistant manager at Osterlunds . Keen to conclude a deal in the next fortnight, Kindberg claims Hull City, QPR and Everton will watch Barrow against Sundsvall tomorrow night after Bolton’s opening offer was kicked out. ‘We have rejected a £600,000 bid,’ Kindberg told Sportsmail. ‘We put Modou in the price range of £1.5m but it depends on the structure and sell-on clause. We also want to look after the player. ‘He has just arrived back from Bolton because we have an important game on Friday when we start the autumn part of the season. ‘We had a very encouraging report from (Bolton boss) Dougie Freedman about the player. We also have interest from Celtic, Middlesbrough and Swansea. ‘We have an English manager in Graham Potter and a Scots assistant in Billy Reid, who has been speaking to people at Celtic about the player. In the know: Celtic manager Ronny Deila should have a good knowledge of the Scandinavian game . ‘Celtic’s youth coach David Moss has been here with his team and Celtic have an exceptional scouting record. They know the Scandinavian market well. We are taking their interest very seriously. ‘Billy is an expert in getting talented players to the top level from his years in Scotland and has done a great job with Modou. We think he will take some big steps in the game.’ Reid, who oversaw the development of the likes of James McCarthy and James McArthur at Hamilton, was full of praise for the striker, saying: ‘Modou is sensationally quick and technically good. If anyone was going to be worth big money in the future, it is this guy. He’s got great potential.’ A prolific scorer as a teenager in the Swedish lower leagues, Barrow quit IFK Norrkoping for personal reasons, but scored six goals in nine games in the first half of the Swedish season, attracting interest from British clubs.

"By . Adam Shergold . David Moyes is not a man in any hurry. The next step he takes in football is a pivotal one and must be taken delicately. He was hurt by those chastening 10 months at Manchester United and by the manner of his dismissal four matches from the end of a dismal season. He revealed as much in a recent interview with Sportsmail when he said: 'The reason I went to United was because I thought I was joining a club that would give me time. That was the big thing. 'I wanted to take my time working out what I thought was needed.' VIDEO Scroll down for Ryan Giggs pays tribute to David Moyes . Next step: David Moyes is taking his time choosing his next job and current events at Old Trafford reflect well on him as Louis Van Gaal struggles to get the best out of an under-performing squad . Shell-shocked: Louis van Gaal has endured a tough baptism into English football, with his first three matches resulting in defeats to Swansea City and MK Dons, as well as a draw at Sunderland . Tough act to follow: Moyes described succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson as the 'impossible job' Average: Anderson (middle) and Jonny Evans (right) react after MK Dons went 2-0 up in Tuesday's Cup game . He was not afforded that patience but, as he takes time out from the hurly-burly of the game, his stock is slowly rising again. It's not through anything Moyes has done over the long, empty summer - his first away from football since the age of 16 - but by the unfolding drama at Old Trafford. The poor start to Louis van Gaal's tenure at United has reflected well on Moyes. Perhaps succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson was and remains the 'impossible job', as Moyes described it in that same interview. Just one glance at social media following United's shocking 4-0 loss at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup showed how Moyes's reputation has been boosted by Van Gaal's unconvincing start. His beaming smile was everywhere in memes and Twitter pictures, while one wag created a rather disturbing face morph of the current boss and his predecessor. Tough times: Moyes could only guide United to seventh place in the Premier League last season . Mocked: Manchester City fans revelled in United's failings as they won the title . Warm welcome: The Chosen One banner on the Stretford End became the centre of attention . Dissent: The infamous plane message flown over Old Trafford calling for Moyes to be sacked . 'It wasn't even this bad under Moyes,' was the general consensus, while the anti-United brigade revelled in mocking the latest milestone in United's decline. It was pointed out that Moyes never lost by more than three goals. Many pictured him having a little chuckle to himself as he watched the League One side fire in the goals. The Dons' kit suppliers even hired a mobile advertising truck to park outside OId Trafford. Next to a picture of Moyes's face, it read: 'Bring back the Messiah.' Of course, it is far too early to judge Van Gaal. He is known as a slow starter in new jobs, is grappling with an injury crisis and has his new signings, including £60m man Angel Di Maria, to come in. We're only three matches into the season and Van Gaal has a proven track record of winning wherever he has gone. To mock him is a very dangerous strategy. Rubbing it in: MK Dons' kit supplier Sondico parked this van outside Old Trafford on Thursday morning . Big money buy: United this week signed Angel Di Maria for £60m in an attempt to kick-start their season . Reinforcement: Marcos Rojo has also been brought in for £16m from Sporting Lisbon . But the point here is that Moyes is looking better with every United slip-up. Perhaps the man who guided United to seventh in the Premier League wasn't so hopeless after all. Moyes had more points on the board after two games - he won 4-1 at Swansea and drew with Chelsea - and he managed to get United to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup. There were plenty of fans who couldn't wait to see the back of him last season, but attitudes towards Moyes are softening with events currently unfolding. The blame is focused on him less and less. The sub-par squad bequeathed by Ferguson was the real problem and Moyes didn't have the luxury of expensive summer signings. Van Gaal has overseen spending of £131m on four players, so an improvement needs to be seen immediately, starting with Saturday's trip to Burnley. There can be no excuses. Perfect start: Moyes celebrates during his first Premier League game in charge, as United beat Swansea 4-1 . Contrast: Van Gaal reflects after United were beaten 2-1 by Swansea in his first Premier League game . VIDEO Van Gaal blames injuries, errors and luck . It all bodes well for Moyes's future prospects. He appears on the bookmakers' lists for every vacant managerial position and remains highly-regarded despite his bruising experience at United. He will find employment again sooner or later and he'll most likely do a stellar job given time and resources. Time heals wounds, histories are revised. It could be that the Moyes era at Old Trafford will come to be viewed in a very different light.","David Moyes is considering his next move in football after being sacked by Manchester United back in April .

"By . Chris Wheeler . Follow @@ChrisWheelerDM . Tom Ince has his pick of foreign clubs after Inter Milan emerged as clear favourites ahead of Benfica, Monaco and Olympiacos in what has turned into quite an international auction for the England Under 21 winger. None of which will be of much consolation to Blackpool, of course. They stand to lose up to £8million if the player moves abroad, bringing to an end an increasingly bitter relationship between the Championship club and 22-year-old Ince, his father Paul – the former England captain and Blackpool manager – and their advisors. Even though Ince’s contract at Bloomfield Road is about to run out, Blackpool would receive substantial compensation from a tribunal if he joins another English club because he is under 23. Wanted man: Inter Milan are favoruites ahead of Benfica and Monaco to sign Tom Ince this summer . That scenario cannot be ruled out amid interest from Tottenham, Everton and Newcastle, but they are unlikely to want to pay £8m – the estimated figure based on the £1.5m fee Crystal Palace paid Blackpool to take Ince on loan for the second half of last season. However, the compensation Blackpool receive will plummet to just £155,000 if Ince follows in his father Paul’s footsteps to the San Siro or joins another foreign club. Ince’s situation was already complicated because Blackpool had agreed to pay Liverpool a 35 per cent cut of any sell-on fee for the player when they signed him from Anfield for £500,000 three years ago. All smiles: Ince and father Paul (second right) flew into Milan's Linate Airport on Sunday and were given a tour of the club's facilities on Monday . With chairman Karl Oyston determined to bank a net figure of £6m from any transfer, that pushed the club’s overall valuation of Ince above the £8m mark and scared off a number of suitors last summer, including Liverpool themselves. Cardiff offered Blackpool £8.5m and Ince £35,000-a-week, but he turned down a move to South Wales to stay in the northwest with his newborn baby daughter. Decision: Ince initially stayed with Blackpool after turning down Cardiff . The final twist came when a furious Ince snr was sacked as Blackpool manager by Oyston via text message in January. It followed reports that the club were unhappy Paul had allegedly taken time off to drive his son to hold talks with Monaco before attending a two-day coaching course at St George’s Park. Tom did not play for the club again and joined Palace on loan shortly afterwards, scoring one goal in eight appearances. So do Ince’s plans to move abroad now amount to payback? He and his father would claim with some justification that the chance to play for Inter Milan, where Paul and the his family spent two years in the mid-90s following a £7.5m move from Manchester United, or any of the other foreign options on the table is simply too good to turn down. They flew into the city’s Linate Airport on Sunday night and were given a tour of the club’s facilities on Monday before discussing personal terms with Inter owner Erick Thohir and technical director Piero Ausilio. ‘This is an incredible story,’ said Paul. ‘It’s incredible that Tom is here at 22, and he was five back then. I spent a beautiful time here. ‘The important thing for Tom is to be . here today, to see the training ground, get to know the stadium and the . city. Then we will go back home and take a decision. I’m here now for my . son. I think we will know more in a couple of weeks.’ Move abroad: Paul Ince joined Inter Milan in 1995 and spent two seasons playing for the Italian giants . Tom admitted he is tempted by playing at the San Siro where he watched his dad star alongside some of the biggest names in world football. ‘I’m not an Inter player yet but I’m very happy to be here two or three days in the meantime,’ he said. ‘Inter have a fantastic squad and Italy is a great country where I have many fond memories. They are one of the most important clubs in the world.’","Inter Milan clear favourites to sign England Under 21 winger Tom Ince .

"By . Adam Shergold for the Daily Mail . It isn't quite the 44 damned days of Brian Clough's Leeds United reign 40 years ago, but it appears David Hockaday's time at Elland Road will not last a great deal longer. Just 65 days into Massimo Cellino's experiment with an unknown manager plucked from non-League, he has apparently already been given the Caesarean thumbs down. The unforgiving Italian owner, who famously got through 36 managers in 22 years at Cagliari, will pull the trigger once again unless there is an instant upturn in fortunes, starting with Wednesday's Capital One Cup derby with Bradford. Staying power: Dave Hockaday will not be sacked as Leeds manager despite recent poor results . Hockaday, hired from Conference side Forest Green Rovers in June, was understandably exasperated after his side finished with nine men in the defeat at Watford. But as he spoke of the 'green shoots and signs of recovery' Leeds are apparently showing, he did not come across as a man expecting to lose his job. 'I strongly believe that with the players I've got, I'm doing a decent job,' he said. 'Barring that moment of madness, we would have come away with something.' That moment came on 58 minutes when debutant defender Giuseppe Bellusci miskicked a clearance, allowing the livewire Fernando Forestieri through on goal. Bellusci dragged him down, was sent off and Troy Deeney scored from the spot to make it 2-1. He has apologised to the team — for what it's worth,' Hockaday said. 'It's something I can't legislate for.' Until then, Leeds had been just about a match for Beppe Sannino's in-form side. Afterwards, they lost the plot, conceding twice more — to Forestieri and Daniel Tozser — and saw Sam Byram sent off in stoppage time for stupidly lashing out at Daniel Pudil. Hockaday added: 'Even though it was 4-1 today, I don't really think anyone can go away and say they were that much better than you and they ripped the pants off you.' Yet Cellino deals solely in cold, hard facts and Hockaday has presided over three defeats from four, leaving Leeds a solitary point above the Championship drop zone. U-turn: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino had decided to sack the manager before changing his mind . The Italian was not amused and another defeat is likely to see time called on his experiment and Hockaday's contract ripped up. With hindsight, the writing has always been on the wall. The 2,000-strong travelling contingent at Vicarage Road reflected long-held frustrations when they sang 'We're s*** and we're sick of it' during the second half. It's been a long decade in the wilderness since Leeds dropped out of the Premier League and Hockaday was hardly the high-profile, proven appointment the fans expected when Brian McDermott left last season. Cellino admitted that Hockaday was working with an incomplete squad last week but some of those brought in don't look up to it. Bellusci endured a nightmare start and new striker Mirco Antenucci was badly off the pace. Slump: Leeds are perilously close to the relegation zone after losing three of their four opening games . When another, Billy Sharp, was subbed at 2-1 to avoid picking up an injury, the away fans jeered Hockaday. And this dismal performance was against a Watford side supposedly in a crisis of their own. When Lloyd Dyer scored at Rotherham in midweek, he celebrated by shouting abuse at Sannino, leading to rumours of a camp unhappy at the Italian's constant rotation. But he'll be sticking by his methods after this performance, which saw the Hornets soar to second in the table. Dyer was nowhere near the squad against Leeds but will return. Sannino said: 'I did not see that celebration. This belongs to the past. I need all of my players.' If only Hockaday could rewind history too. His troubles are very much in the present. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Stuart Pearce has restored passion and purpose at Nottingham Forest and they're flying high in the Championship after a 4-0 thumping of Reading. Winger Michail Antonio scored twice and set up another against his former employers, while £5m signing Britt Assombalonga now has four in four League games. 'The new signings have really hit the ground running,' said a delighted Pearce. Delighted: Stuart Pearce has made an immediate impact at Nottingham Forest since becoming manager . ELSEWHERE... Felix Magath could get the sack if Fulham lose to Brentford in the Capital One Cup tomorrow. They are rock bottom after a 5-1 loss at Derby. 'The result was very bad and so now is the time to change,' he said afterwards. We presume he meant team selection, not his job. Jose Baxter scored maybe the goal of the weekend for Sheffield United against Crawley, picking out the top corner with a 25-yard cracker at Bramall Lane. Morecambe's perfect start continued with a 2-1 win at Cambridge in League Two. Teenage striker Paul Mullin grabbed both goals in another impressive display.

The Eagles have conceded in second-half stoppage time on each of their last two trips to St James Park. Newcastle scored a goal in the closing five minutes in both games against Palace last season. Newcastle United are one of only two teams yet to score this season, along with QPR. Palace enforcer Mile Jedinak made more tackles (133) than any other player last season and already leads the way in 2014-15 with 15. Late show: Papiss Cisse (left) scored in the final minute to give Newcastle a 1-0 win and their fourth straight victory over Crystal Palace back in March . The Magpies have failed to score in seven of their last 10 Premier League games. Crystal Palace have won just two points from their last five Premier League games (D2 L3), this after winning 15 out of 15 in their previous five. Newcastle have scored only 14 Premier League goals in 2014, fewer than any other ever-present side. Since the start of last season, no team has picked up more red cards in the Premier League than the Magpies (7 – level with Sunderland).

Wales international Vokes has a long-term knee problem but was back doing some running on the grass at the Clarets' training ground this week. Recall: Danny Ings (right) will retain his starting spot ahead of the visit of Manchester United to Turf Moor .

Defenders Luke Shaw (hamstring), Chris Smalling (groin) and Marcos Rojo (awaiting work permit) are unavailable, while doubts remain over right-back Rafael (groin) and midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who is close to completing a move to Borussia Dortmund. Provisional squad: De Gea, Lindegaard, Amos, Rafael, Valencia, Evans, Jones, M Keane, Blackett, James, Fletcher, Cleverley, Anderson, Young, Mata, Di Maria, Januzaj, Van Persie, Rooney, Welbeck, Hernandez, Powell, W Keane. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Burnley’s only previous Premier League home game against Manchester United saw them win 1-0 thanks to a goal from Robbie Blake. Manchester United have won five of their last six encounters with Burnley, keeping a clean sheet in each victory. Manchester United have won only two of their last six Premier League games in August (D2 L2). United have the lowest cross completion rate in the Premier League so far this season (5 per cent - excluding corners). Angel Di Maria has assisted 11 goals in his last 11 league appearances. Previous form: Robbie Blake's volley for Burnley sealed a famous 1-0 win over Manchester United in the sides' only previous Premier League Turf Moor meeting at the start of the 2009-10 season . Robin van Persie has failed to hit any sort of shot in each of his last two Premier League appearances – the first time that this has happening in his Man Utd career. Burnley have played Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham, Chelsea and now Manchester Utd in their last five Premier League games at Turf Moor. Burnley have kept only three clean sheets in 40 Premier League games but one of them came at home to Manchester United in August 2009. The Clarets are one of two teams (along with Barnsley) never to draw a Premier League game 0-0. Of the seven ever-present teams in the Premier League, Manchester United have played in the lowest proportion of 0-0 draws (5.5 per cent).","Angel di Maria is fit to make his Manchester United debut .

"By . John Mcgarry . Wakaso Mubarak has pledged to win a long-term contract with Celtic and bring ‘glory and victory’ to Parkhead. With Stefan Scepovic poised to join the Ghanaian international in Glasgow, the 24-year-old winger was paraded by the club yesterday after completing his season-long loan move from Russian side Rubin Kazan. Celtic are now regrouping after a painful Champions League exit to Maribor on Tuesday and, ahead of today’s Europa League draw, Wakaso vowed to not only give the club a much-needed morale boost but to force Deila to make him a long-term acquisition. Transfer: Wakaso Mubarak signed for Celtic on a season-long loan, but says he plans to stay longer . ‘I am very happy to be here,’ he said. ‘I will bring glory and victory to Celtic. ‘In my mind I won’t be here for only one season. I know I will make it big and stay with Celtic for a long time.’ Wakaso becomes manager Ronny Deila’s fifth summer signing following the arrivals of Jo Inge Berget, Jason Denayer, Aleksandar Tonev and Craig Gordon. Sporting Gijon striker Scepovic should add to that list by signing a four-year deal today and sources in Spain last night suggested the Serb has agreed personal terms on a £2.2million move. Virgil van Dijk meantime remains the subject of interest from Sunderland, Newcastle and Seville although contrary to reports the Black Cats have not yet tabled a bid for the defender. World Cup: Wakaso Mubarak evades William Carvalho of Portugal at the World Cup in Brazil . As he prepared for a campaign in Europe’s secondary competition, Wakaso told Sportsmail: ‘I wanted Celtic to be in the Champions League but unfortunately they couldn’t make it - that is part of the game. ‘We have the Europa League to face and that is like the Champions League, so we need to manage that. ‘It is my ambition to excite the Celtic fans. I want to make it big here and help Celtic be very successful. ‘The history of Celtic boosts my morale and gives me even more motivation to do well. ‘The players who have passed through here also excite me. ‘I want to make history for my country and for the team because I am the first Ghanaian to play for Celtic and I have to set an example for the upcoming ones. I need to make history for the team, for my nation and for myself.’ Russia: Mubarak spent last year at Tubin Kazan, but was in Spain for the five preceding years . Handed the No 32 jersey after a career that encompassed Elche, Villarreal and Espanyol in Spain before he moved to Russia last year, Wakaso believes his long and winding road to Celtic Park has primed him for the challenge that awaits. ‘I’ve learned a lot and it always makes me feel I can make it great,’ he said. ‘To be great you have to work hard and I’m ready to do it. ‘I don’t really know much about Scottish football but I know a little about Celtic because I have been watching Celtic since I was young and I saw the amazing supporters they have here. And the kind of players that pass through here makes me feel and see that Celtic is a great team to be at. ‘I’m here to build my career up again like I was doing in Spain and to help the team.’ Celtic will discover their Europa League fate today and with Deila’s men almost certainly in pot two they will be hoping to avoid holders Sevilla, Inter Milan and Tottenham as top seeds. All eyes, however, will be on pot four where they could yet be drawn with Legia Warsaw.","Wakaso Mubarak signs for Celtic on season-long loan .

"By . John Mcgarry . Kris Commons isn’t the first so-called luxury player to find himself edged towards the periphery of a new manager’s plans. Yet the attacking midfielder’s current plight at Celtic is unique in two senses. Firstly, Commons is the reigning PFA Scotland and SFWA player of the year. Lifting those two individual prizes in May hardly taxed him to the point of exhaustion. Secondly, it almost always follows that a manager believes he can make do without the talent of such a player because he has others in the team who will compensate. VIDEO Scroll down for Ronny Deila: Celtic didn't deserve to be in the Champions League . Poor-fit: Kris Commons does not appear to fit in to new Celtic manager Ronny Delia's plans . Looking at the Celtic side which started against Maribor – without Commons – supporters were entitled to ask who exactly was going to provide the goals and flashes of game-changing brilliance on which such nights hinge. Jo Inge Berget? Unlikely. Stefan Johansen? Ditto. Anthony Stokes? No track record whatsoever at that level. Had Ronny Deila been able to call upon a seasoned No 9 capable of playing the lone striker role at that level to good effect, Commons’ omission would have been less glaring. Similarly, had his fellow Norwegians seemed capable of providing the offensive spark Commons showed in the corresponding fixture against Shakhtar Karagandy a year ago, there would not have been such a kerfuffle. But of the four forward thinking players Deila started with, only the ever-improving Callum McGregor looked a decent bet to hit the Slovenians where it hurt. With such a powderpuff look to the attack, little wonder Virgil Van Dijk was Deila’s most potent threat in the final third, with that only materialising in the dying embers of the match. Nightmare: Last year's PFA and SFWA player of the year did not even start against Maribor last week . It begs the question – what exactly has Commons done wrong? The answer though is very little – aside from having a face that seemingly doesn’t fit into the manager’s preferred 4-2-3-1 model. The tacit message Deila’s team selection spelled out against Maribor was that if you aren’t prepared to run, press and scrap to retrieve the ball in the final third like your life depends on it, then it’s going to be a struggle to accommodate you. Deila will argue that he hasn’t yet cast the 30-year-old on the scrapheap. Given he has featured to some degree in all bar one of Celtic’s nine competitive games this season, his argument holds some water. But it’s the game-time afforded to the former Scotland international in the past three matches – or rather the lack of it - that has given rise to the notion that he’s increasingly surplus to requirements. An unused sub in Maribor last week, Commons had the dubious privilege of playing the entire 90 minutes at Inverness last Saturday – a day for the jersey-fillers, if ever there was one. His worst fears were confirmed an hour and a half before kick-off on Tuesday – another place on the bench - and eventually a replacement it would transpire for Beram Kayal at the half-way point. Exit: Commons could be heading for the exit with West Brom, Leicester and Norwich all interested . Sportsmail yesterday revealed that that player is considering his future as a result of the latest demotion – and it’s believed he sought an explanation from Deila on the night. He is unlikely to have been comforted by what he heard. Now in the last year of his contract, the 30-year-old’s thoughts are no longer about securing the long-term extension – with one foot in the coaching camp - that was muted last season. Unless matters change radically, the temptation to explore options back in England even before Monday’s transfer deadline may prove tempting. If he does go either now or in January (Norwich, Leicester and West Brom are all watching the situation) there will be much angst among the fans. And understandably so. Upon signing for Celtic from Derby for £300,000 in January 2011, Commons scored 15 goals in half a season. Form: Despite some poor sspells, Commons has matured with age, and managed 30 goals last season . The following term – his very own annus horribilis – saw him hit the net just once and face-off with humour rumours of a bust-up with Neil Lennon by training in bandages and a neck brace. It proved to be no more than a blip: In 2012-13 he hit 19 goals then smashed 31 last term to sweep up the individual awards. Statistics that suggest he’s a ‘luxury player’ well worth making allowances for. Commons may be a yard shy in pace of ever being classed as absolutely top drawer but, despite his retirement from Scotland duty last year, he remains an international class footballer. Together with Van Dijk and Mikael Lustig, he is the closest thing Celtic have to a star man these days. Deila’s devotion to his system and insistence upon boundless energy is admirable to a degree but when it’s so slavish that a player of Commons’ ilk cannot be accommodated within it questions are naturally asked. If the player is handed another watching brief at Dens Park on Sunday, he will at least feel he has the answer to the most pressing query in his mind. With the transfer window closing the following evening, he may be of a view to seek a swift resolution to a growing problem.","Kris Commons could be on his way out of Celtic .

"By . Adam Shergold for the Daily Mail . It wasn't quite the 44 damned days of Brian Clough's Leeds United reign 40 years ago, but David Hockaday's spell at Elland Road did not last a great deal longer. Just 70 days into Massimo Cellino's experiment with an unknown manager plucked from non-League, he was given the Caesarean thumbs down. The unforgiving Italian owner, who famously got through 36 managers in 22 years at Cagliari, pulled the trigger after Wednesday's derby defeat by Bradford City. VIDEO Scroll down to watch one of Brian Clough's most legendary moments . Gone: Leeds sacked David Hockaday as manager after just 70 days in charge . Hockaday, hired from Conference side Forest Green Rovers in June, had vowed to fight on after the 2-1 defeat to the League One side in the Capital One Cup, the first time Bradford had beaten their illustrious neighbours for 28 years. He said: 'I'm not a quitter, I'm a fighter. I feel as though not just myself, but the team at the moment, things just aren't going our way. 'I don't have to say this but the players are 100 per cent behind the way we want to play. The president, everyone, they all want us to do well. We're getting a lot of bad press at the moment, some of it self inflicted, and we're making it very difficult for ourselves on the field at the moment.' Humbled: Leeds lost 2-1 to Yorkshire rivals Bradford City on Wednesday night . But Cellino deals solely in cold, hard facts and Hockaday has presided over three league defeats from four matches, leaving Leeds just above the Championship drop zone. The writing had been on the wall since Leeds suffered a 4-1 thrashing at Watford on August 23. That day the 2,000-strong travelling contingent reflected long-held frustrations when they sang 'We're s*** and we're sick of it' during the second half of a 4-1 defeat. Over and out: Leeds owner Massimo Cellino felt he had to act after disappointing start to the season . Infamous: Brian Cough was sacked after just 44 days in charge at Leeds United in the Seventies . Cellino had decided to axe Hockaday after the Watford defeat but dramatically changed his mind the following day, blaming 'one s*** mistake from Giuseppe Bellusci.' But it proved to be a brief stay of execution as the 56-year-old was sacked on Thursday. He said: 'I'd like to thank David for his efforts over the last two and a half months. 'But the results since the start of the season have meant we needed to act and make this decision. Slump: Leeds are just above to the drop zone after losing three of their four league games . 'After the defeat at Bradford I realised that my decision to keep David at the club following the defeat at Watford was wrong, and I had to change my mind on the coach's position. As a club we will now begin our search for a new head coach.' Former Middlesbrough defender Gianluca Festa and former Leeds captain and manager Gary McAllister are among the frontrunners to fill the hot seat and despite Cellino's reputation, there will be no shortage of candidates.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for MailOnline . Johan Mjallby felt regret and disappointment as he watched Celtic crash out of the Champions League to Maribor. Yet, by his own admission, there was no real surprise. The former Parkhead assistant manager resigned and returned to Sweden in April amid concerns the plc board were loathe to invest large sums on new players. After two years of delivering Champions League football, failure at the third time of asking was likely to end as most managerial reigns do. In the sack. End of an era: Johan Mjallby with former manager Neil Lennon, prior to the pair leaving Celtic this year . Training day: Mjallby takes charge of a training session in May, soon after he'd announced he was leaving . ‘It’s important for Celtic to play and be in the Champions League,’ Mjallby told Sportsmail. ‘But I felt a few months ago that this might happen because there probably wouldn’t be much investment in the team. ‘There was a big risk for us as a management team that we wouldn’t be able to take the team to the Champions League for a third time running. And that wouldn’ t have looked too good for us. Winner: Maribor's Marcos Tavares scored to send Celtic crashing out of the Champions League on Tuesday . ‘Because, as well as working with the club and working with the players, you must also keep an eye on what is best for you. ‘And that’s why leaving wasn’t really the hardest decision of my life that I had to take. I definitely made the right decision.’ Like his boss Neil Lennon, Mjallby saw the Champions League exit coming and jumped before he was pushed. The former defender is currently playing golf, spending time with the family and waiting for the phone to ring. By his own admission, his levels of boredom grow by the day. Yet the events of Tuesday night offered some form of vindication. In the aftermath of defeat to a modest Maribor team, around 200 supporters gathered on the club’s shiny new Celtic Way. ‘Sack the Board’ summoned up memories of the pre-Fergus McCann era. And for Celtic, the levels of dissent are now a problem. After successive defeats to modest Legia Warsaw and Maribor teams, there is little appetite for Europa League football. Furious: Celtic fans protested after their side were knocked out of the Champions League by Maribor . That could change after Thursday’s draw when Celtic could be paired with one of the top seeds from a group featuring Sevilla, Lyon, Inter Milan and Tottenham. From pot three, they could be pitted against Everton, Real Sociedad, Hull City or Rapid Vienna. Amongst the lowest seeds, meanwhile, Legia Warsaw offer the prospect of a grudge match. European nights at Parkhead are guaranteed until Christmas at least. Yet Mjallby believes the lifting strains of Zadok the Priest could have been a feature of Parkhead once more this season with more substantial reinvestment of profits last recorded at £21.3million for the six months up to December 2013. ‘The only question you can ask yourself sometimes is what you want for your club?’ Mjallby continued. Club hero: Mjallby was a  popular player for Celtic before becoming the Bhoys' assistant manager . ‘With no disrespect to the other teams, you are banking on Celtic winning a league which is not really competitive until you get a strong Rangers back. ‘Or unless one of the other teams find a way to be really competitive with Celtic. ‘So what do you aim for then? The Champions League. ‘Because if you achieve Champions League football, you know it’s going to be full houses, you know the crowds are going to be up. Farewell: Lennon left Celtic at the end of the 2013-14 season after four successful years at the club . ‘Right now, they are not getting full houses playing in the Scottish league like it was when I was a player there. ‘The worst crowd I ever had as a player was 56,800. ‘I know these are changed days. But that is why it is even more pivotal that you get into the Champions League. ‘Even if you spend money and get good names, it’s not a guarantee you will definitely make it into the Champions League. There is no such thing. But it gives you a better chance. ‘And at least then you show intent to the supporters that you are ready to really, really go for it.’ How much Celtic would have to spend to compete in the Champions League is the question. A £5m striker would have offered no cast-iron guarantees. Slowly stagnating in a one-team SPFL Premiership, however, Mjallby craved an injection of quality. Under pressure: Ronny Deila has made a poor start as Celtic manager and is feeling the heat already . There was no prospect of a £12m deal for Shane Long or spending £11m on Ross McCormack. With the broadcasting revenues in Scotland, it was out of the question. Defying the loss of key players such as Gary Hooper, Victor Wanyama and Kelvin Wilson to lead the team to the Champions League two years in a row, however, there was a feeling that the club’s transfer policy could be less rigid when the need arose. ‘We knew inside that there was never really a great chance the club would invest very much,’ added Mjallby. ‘In fairness, you can see why. ‘They have to look after the finances of the club and they have made quite a good job of it in the last few years. ‘But they did that with the help of us bringing Champions League football and Champions League money in. And all we wanted was to make the team stronger. ‘I think we should have had a bit more credit for what we did at Celtic. Because in four years we might have won a trophy or so more, but we did really well by taking the club to the Champions League twice. ‘That’s something we are very proud of.’ Europa League beckons: Celtic's defeat to Maribor means they'll play in the unfaniced competition this season . Mjallby and Lennon anticipated the sale of Fraser Forster. There was concern that Virgil van Dijk might follow suit. Comments from the Dutch defender yesterday suggest he still might. ‘We all agree in management that if you have a team and you win trophies then you want to make that team even stronger,’ said Mjallby. ‘You want to make it even better. That’s how it should be. ‘But we felt that this simply wasn’t going to happen. ‘We could see last year that we needed some reinforcements. ‘That’s not criticising the team we had because we were quite happy with the lads. But we were greedy. We wanted to take another step and make the team even stronger to make sure we could keep bringing Champions League football to the club. Both for ourselves and for the club, as well. And we just couldn’t see that happening.’ They may not have been alone in that. When Lennon followed Mjallby’s lead by resigning, Celtic approached Henrik Larsson – then Roy Keane - before settling for Ronny Deila as manager. In the first real indication that Larsson had concerns over the budget available, Mjallby revealed: ‘Obviously I spoke to Henrik and I know that Henrik spoke to Neil as well. Hero: Club legend Henrik Larsson was approached for the Celtic manager's job this summer but turned it down . ‘We all played together, so that’s natural. ‘He was obviously proud that Celtic were asking him the question, but you know Henrik. ‘He is a very stubborn man and he decided to really show the Swedish public that he could stay in the top flight with a small club like Falkenberg. ‘But it was at the back of his head I think that there was no Rangers there and he might lose a wee bit of the competitive edge he was used to at Celtic. ‘And, of course, we were struggling a  bit with the board not really being ready to spend – and maybe that was in the back of his mind, as well. ‘Maybe he was thinking, “This is not the right time”. But in the future, I can definitely see Henrik being Celtic manager one day.’ In contrast with Deila, Larsson appears to have dodged a speeding bullet. The Celtic board will do well to do the same in the weeks ahead.","Johan Mjallby said he was disappointed but not surprised by Celtic's defeat to Maribor .

"By . Mark Wilson For The Daily Mail . Amid the angry chants directed towards the board, another sound could be detected emerging from the Celtic fans who filed dejectedly out of Parkhead on Tuesday evening. It was the noise of thousands of heads being scratched. A low grumble of disaffected bemusement at precisely what Ronny Deila had been attempting to achieve with elements of his team selection, tactics and substitutions in the dire 1-0 defeat from Maribor. Some are still wondering more than 24 hours on. It remains far too early in the Norwegian’s tenure for any sweeping judgments about his future prospects in the role. Make no mistake, however, this was a decidedly bad night on a personal level for the affable 38-year-old. Not happy: Celtic fans protest after their side crashed out of the Champions League on Tuesday . Early exit: Celtic were beaten at home by Maribor after drawing the first leg in Slovenia . A lack of investment from above may have created the loudest outcry but Deila now finds himself under serious scrutiny from supporters dismayed at two exits from the Champions League in the space of three weeks. Ultimately, the reprieve UEFA handed down after the Legia Warsaw debacle merely proved a passport to further ignominy. The blame game is already being played with a greater intensity than Celtic managed against Maribor but Stefan Johansen is adamant the manager should not be left to carry the can. The Norway midfielder previously worked alongside Deila at Stromsgodset – where they won a first league title in 43 years for the club – and instead feels the burden of guilt lies with those on the pitch. ‘We are a team,’ argued Johansen. ‘We lose and we win together. We had a match-plan and the players were not able to do it. So it is not the manager’s fault. ‘Of course he needs time to put his stamp on the team. I have told the media that since he came, that it takes time. It is not his fault we are out. ‘The manager made it clear what he wanted us to do and we wanted to control the game but it was us players who did not manage it.’ Johansen’s stance is correctly loyal and not without merit. But questions about Deila’s decision-making are unavoidable in the wake of such a paper-thin performance. A clean sheet on home turf was all that was required after he seemed to get his set-up right in the 1-1 first-leg draw. Unfortunately, the composure seen in Slovenia was replaced by confusion in Scotland as Maribor pressed Celtic out of any fluency. Blow: Adam Matthews of Celtic looks dejected . Deila’s starting line-up was a source of debate from before kick-off. The decision to omit Kris Commons was an eye-catching indication of his current status but understandable in the context of maintaining a midfield that had been effective the previous week. The logic behind playing Efe Ambrose at right-back was less clear. The Nigerian international was all at sea during the first half, persistently out of position as if ordered to tuck inside and abandon the flank. His inclusion displaced Mikael Lustig to centre-back, where the Swede partnered Virgil van Dijk to decent effect before succumbing to injury. It all seemed unnecessarily complicated. Young Jason Denayer was implicated in the goal conceded in the first leg but had otherwise looked to have the makings of a decent double act with van Dijk. Joining him among the subs was Adam Matthews, a Welsh international right-back who would be expected to be more reliable in the role than Ambrose. An awful opening 45 minutes created a need for the ball to stick further forward. Deila reacted by bringing on Commons for Beram Kayal, which initially seemed to give the side a lift - albeit at the expense of lightening the central midfield. It was somewhat more puzzling when Jo-Inge Berget was replaced by Matthews. He took up a post on the right side of midfield, with Callum McGregor switched to the left. The final change was forced by the injury to Lustig. Derk Boerrigter was introduced rather than Denayer and another reshuffle was underway. Three minutes later, Marcos Tavares struck the goal that sealed Celtic’s fate. Berget had been grim in the first half but seemed to apply himself with real energy after the restart, contributing to an improved spell for his team. The Cardiff City loanee told Norwegian media he was surprised to be taken off. ‘I wanted to stay on the field,’ he said. ‘In the first half, we didn’t play well and nothing happened for us, but the second half was much better and I was enjoying it. ‘But the manager makes the decisions and he had a plan behind my substitution. I was certainly ready to play on and we had no agreement that I would be replaced.’ There is a sense that Deila is still grasping towards his best team and formation. Perhaps that will only be clear if and when he is able to import enough of his own players. Questions to answer:  Celtic manager Ronny Delia has endured a tough start to his reign at the club . Aleksandar Tonev, on loan from Aston Villa, has yet to be seen because of injury. Wakaso Mubarak has now been added to the squad after his loan from Rubin Kazan was finalised, while a deal for striker Stefan Scepovic remains pending. Will they be enough to make the difference come the Europa League group stages? The fact Legia – who routed Celtic 6-1 on aggregate - will be fourth seeds in that draw if they qualify suggests a wholesale improvement will be required. That was recognised by Johansen as he faced up to a season without the financially-rewarding thrill of Europe’s elite competition. ‘It is early in the season and, of course, everyone wanted to play Champions League but we need to improve as players and as a team,’ said the 23-year-old. ‘We are in the Europa League, we want to win the league and the Scottish Cup. We need to get our heads up as soon as possible. It is tough now and it is going to be difficult but we need to do that. ‘To be honest, we are not good enough (for the Champions League) right now. We have the Europa League now and we have to improve.’","Celtic failed to make the group stages of the Champions League .

"By . Nick Purewal, Press Association . Neil Warnock has revealed Steve Parish sounded him out about returning to Crystal Palace last November before the Eagles appointed Tony Pulis. Warnock is back for a second stint at Palace, after managing the Selhurst Park club between 2007 and 2010. Palace owner Parish missed out on Malky Mackay and Tim Sherwood before settling on appointing Warnock to replace Pulis, who quit on the eve of the season. Warnock said he was 'not bothered' to be Palace's third choice. Offer: Neil Warnock said he was approached about the job before Tony Pulis was appointed last year . 'Before Tony came there was a possibility that he wasn't going to come and we talked then but then he changed his mind and they did fantastically,' said Warnock. 'So Steve has always known that I am available. 'I didn't really have to tell him. 'It's just he just had to go through the candidates like he did. 'He said he never offered it to anybody beforehand and if I'm honest I'm not really bothered or what the betting was. 'I'm just glad that I'm here now and I'm not bothered how many were in front of me.' Warnock said he would only have come out of managerial retirement to help Palace stabilise their Premier League status, admitting he received wife Sharon's approval. Carefree: The former Leeds and QPR manager said he was not bothered about being the Eagles' third choice . The 65-year-old has not worked in football since a stint at Leeds last year, retreating instead to his Cornwall farm. Warnock's first act as Palace boss was to secure a season-long loan deal for Manchester United forward Wilfried Zaha, who returns to the Eagles after failing to make the Old Trafford grade. Zaha left Palace for United in 2013 for £15million - but Warnock rejected suggestions his return is any kind of failure. 'I wasn't really looking to get back into management, but it's not often you get a chance to repay a club that's really helped you, so it's great to have that chance,' said Warnock. Potential: Warnock spoke positively about Wilfried Zaha and said he believes he can do really well at Palace . 'I think there's still a lot more to come from Wilfried. 'When you're a young lad and you go to a big club like Manchester United, you can get lost because there are so many good players. 'People have criticised him for his attitude, but I've never seen that. 'I've always thought his attitude is spot on; if you're willing to spend the time with him he's always willing to learn. 'So I think we'll see a really different Wilfried and hopefully he can have a really good season.'","Neil Warnock says he was approached about managerial role last season .

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline . Follow @@riathalsam . QPR’S chairman Tony Fernandes took a bucket of ice over the head in the morning and Harry Redknapp absorbed a humiliating slap across the face in the night. Some of their players might yet land a worse treatment still. That certainly seemed the logical assumption as Redknapp vented his anger after the game. Make no mistake, this competition was not his burning priority. That much was obvious from the fact he made nine changes to his starting line-up from the Tottenham fixture at the weekend, when QPR lost their second Premier League match in two. VIDEO Scroll down for Harry Redknapp on QPR's desperate need for new players . Set piece: Burton Albion's Adam McGurk (right) puts his side ahead in the 77th minute .

Subs not used: Harriman,Green, Ehmer, Doughty. Booked: Simpson . Referee: Paul Tierney (Lancashire) Att: 3,999 . But no top-flight manager wants to see his side lose to a League Two club; no player wants to hear that they might be considered ‘lucky’ to be at a Premier League club, as per Redknapp’s post-match message. Yet the reality is this was an upset in name only. By deeds, Burton deserved to win, long before Adam McGurk scored a brilliant free-kick in the 77th minute. Encouragement will be in short supply for QPR now, except arguably for the inclusion and sporadic bursts from Adel Taarabt, back at the club and making his first start in 16 months. For the rest of them, Redknapp had only anger. He said: ‘I don’t regret it (his selection). We have a massive game again on Saturday (against Sunderland). You give lads a chance to play and obviously there are an awful lot of lads at Premier League clubs who are lucky to be there.’ He added: ‘We gave the lads who haven’t been playing an opportunity to show what they can and they showed me what they can do. It wasn’t an awful lot. ‘It was only Taarabt who did himself any good. There weren’t too many other pluses.’ Burton manager Gary Rowett said: ‘It was absolutely amazing, they were brilliant in everything they did. I thought we deserved it. ‘Harry Redknapp's priority is the Premier League but for a small club like ourselves there is always an opportunity if they rest players.’ Burton were excellent from the start. Adam McGurk hit a volley on the turn that dipped dangerously in front of Brian Murphy. Not looking good: Matt Phillips (left) and Taarabt wait to restart after going 1-0 down . The goalkeeper saved, but was beaten after six minutes when Alex MacDonald found space on the left and drilled low across goal. The shot went past Murphy and narrowly wide. Taarabt repeatedly looked for openings in retaliation, surging into a few gaps that existed and charging anyway when they didn’t. If nothing else, he gets people excited, even when he is flapping his arm at team-mates who, for one reason or another, have not lived up to his expectations. His shot that skidded wide was QPR’s only decent effort of the first 20 minutes. Burton, meanwhile, were increasing the pressure. Dominic Knowles shot straight at Murphy from close range – a superb chance – and then MacDonald shot wide. Would the misses prove costly? Tackle: Richard Dunne attempts to take the ball away from Dominic Knowles during a goalless first half . Strength: Karl Henry fends off Matty Palmer during the Capital One Cup second round clash . It looked that way in the 22nd minute when Junior Hoilett rattled a shot against the bar, but again the hosts surged on the half hour when MacDonald clattered his way through a challenge and drew a good save from Murphy. QPR responded with a perfect floated pass to Junior Hoilett, who lobbed the defender and then attempted to lob Jon McLaughlin, but the shot landed on the roof of the net. It would have been a special goal. Marcus Harness rounded off a frantic first half with a huge hit that deflected wide and McGurk opened the second half with a header over the bar. QPR’s agitation on the pitch and their bench was obvious. Joe Jordan, Redknapp’s coach and touchline enforcer, was fuming and at one point took it out on Gary Rowett, the Burton manager. Rowett backed away. The second half was not nearly so frantic or exciting. There were openings and tussles, but not much of either. Taarabt’s burst all but dried up. Then Richard Dunne clattered Harness and McGurk nailed the free-kick from 20 yards. It was what both sides deserved.

Now we've got another one. It’s about time,’ said Pardew. ‘When he joined I said I think he can play for England. My confidence in him was assured. What I have seen on the training ground makes me more confident. ‘The England manager has seen him make a high-profile move and then deal with it. That is part of the reason he has got in the England team.

"By . Kate Lyons for Daily Mail Australia . and Frank Coletta . Qantas has announced a $2.84 billion loss after a battle, the worst result suffered by the airline in its history. The massive after-tax loss was for the year ending June 30, compares to a $6 million profit a year ago. The result is considerably worse than anticipated, with analysts predicting a loss of between $800 million and $1 billion. The loss comes as Qantas is undergoing a transformation program aimed to streamline and modernise its operations. In February it was announced the transformation program will see 5,000 redundancies across the company, 2,500 of which have already taken place. Scroll down for video . Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce announced the company's profits this morning . Qantas Chief Executive Alan Joyce blamed the loss on the second year of market capacity growth in excess of demand, lower consumer confidence, and high fuel costs, which are up $253 million from last year to a total of $4.5 billion. The losses included a $2.6 billion write-down to the value of its ageing international fleet, which were purchased at a time when the Australian dollar was weaker against the U.S. dollar, such as A380s, purchased in 2000 when the dollar was trading at US$0.57 compared to US$0.93 now. Excluding the writedown and other one-off costs, Qantas made an underlying pre-tax loss of $646 million, compared to a $192 million profit a year ago. Chief executive Alan Joyce described the result as 'confronting', but said the massive loss represented the year that is past. 'We have now come through the worst,' he said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the company is undergoing the biggest transition since Qantas was privatised in 1995. Mr Joyce said the company was 'optimistic' that they would be able to deliver the company back to profitability and post a profit before tax in the first half of next year, saying that the transformation program was working. Qantas reported the worst loss in the company's history today, with an after tax loss of $2.84 billion, almost triple the most dire predictions from analysts . The airline posted a dramatic loss of profits after a brutal year of competition with rival airline Virgin Australia . 'With our accelerated Qantas transformation program we are already emerging as a leaner, more focused and more sustainable Qantas group,' he said. Unions and politicians have joined a chorus of criticism of Qantas management. Independent Senator Nick Xenophon has today asked the Australian Securities and Investment Commission to investigate the airline, suggesting Qantas has breached investment regulations. The Senator said Qantas management, led by Mr Joyce, had trashed the reputation of a great airline. 'I cannot believe what Alan Joyce says, I cannot understand why he is still in that position,' he said. 'Alan Joyce has made so many contradictory statements over the years and predictions, that have proved not be carried out. 'There's a case here for ASIC, as the corporate watchdog, to thoroughly investigate the statements made by Alan Joyce and his management team over the years. 'What's at stake here are 30 thousand jobs, the only people who should be sacked are Alan Joyce, Leigh Clifford the chairman and the board - they have presided over this.' Meanwhile, the airline has ruled out selling or floating its profitable frequent flyer business, Qantas Loyalty in order to fund its turnaround. The frequent flyer program reported its fifth straight year of double-digit growth and has increased membership from five to 10 million over the last year. 'After careful consideration, our judgment was that Qantas Loyalty continued to offer major profitable growth opportunities, and there was insufficient justification for a partial sale,' Mr Joyce said. However, Mr Joyce said they may consider the partial sale of the international business, which did not perform as strongly as the domestic business. Qantas Group has established a holding company so they can seek future investment, but would not speculate about how much of when Qantas International would be sold. The poor results were blamed on market capacity growth in excess of demand, lower consumer confidence, and high fuel costs, which are up $253 million from last year to a total of $4.5 billion .","Qantas has announced a $2.84 billion loss for the year ending June 30 .

'I can't even think of one law-maker in either party, either chamber, who would do this who is maybe 50 years old or younger.' Ms Bash - who was recently honored by ELLE magazine as part of its annual Women in Washington Power List - mentioned that she had spoken 'in private' both to Ms Gillibrand and to other female members of congress about such matters. Age matters: Ms Bash, pictured pregnant in 2011 (left) and in May (right) said, '[Ms Gillibrand] mentions very clearly that these are law-makers in their sixties, seventies and eighties, and it is very much generational' Ms Bash is currently CNN's chief congressional correspondent. She split with fellow CNN anchor John King in 2012, after less than four years of marriage and is now a single mother. Her comments come just days after Ms Gillibrand spoke openly of the sexism she has faced at various points in her political career. In her new book Off the Sidelines, the 47-year-old - who has two young sons with her husband Jonathan - recalls how a male colleague once said to her at the gym: 'Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!' On a separate occasion, a Southern congressman was walking her down the aisle in the House chamber when he said to her: 'You know, Kirsten, you're even pretty when you're fat.' New York Senator: Ms Gillibrand, 47, who has fluctuated between size four and size 20 throughout her career, has been called 'porky' and 'fat,' by male colleagues. Pictured in 2009 (left) and in April (right) Like Ms Bash, Ms Gillibrand acknowledged that the comments were derogatory, but probably not meant in earnest. 'I believed his intentions were sweet, even if he was being an idiot,' she said. The senator, who says she has fluctuated between size four and size 20 throughout her career, admits that regardless of other people's opinions, appearance is something that she does have to pay attention to. 'I've learned that how I look and feel is important, for reasons beyond health and vanity,' she writes. 'If I look and feel good, I'm more positive and confident and people are more likely to listen to me. If more people are listening, I have more power to fight effectively for what I believe in.'","Ms Bash confirms she has spoken to Ms Gillibrand and other female members of congress 'privately' about the matter .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A former council caretaker with a grudge against an elderly resident has been convicted of daubing a swastika and 'Jews Out' on her property. Stephen Loosemore, 50, scrawled the message in large letters after a four-year feud with frail Vera Morgan, 84, a court heard. He was caretaker of the block of flats in Redcliffe, Bristol, when he fell out with Mrs Morgan and her house-bound husband James, 85, who live four doors away from him. Stephen Loosemore, pictured, wrote 'Jews Out' in large letters on Vera Morgan's property in Bristol, a court heard . Vera Morgan, pictured, and Stephen Loosemore had been involved in a four-year feud, Bristol Magistrates' Court heard . Loosemore - who said he knew the couple were not Jewish, or German - admitted carrying out the act because he wanted to scare them after they 'upset' him. He daubed the Nazi Party emblem on her windows alongside the word 'witch' and scrawled 'Jews Out' on her front door. Loosemore admitted causing racially-aggravated damage at Bristol Magistrates Court and was handed a six-month community order. Ian Dawes, prosecuting, said: 'It's apparent the parties do not get on. 'The defendant was seen by a different neighbour painting on the front door of the complainant's address the word 'Jews'. Vera Morgan found the words 'Jews Out' (pictured) scrawled on her property in Redcliffe, Bristol, the court heard . 'A different witness then saw the same defendant walking away with a tin of paint.' The feud is believed to have started when Mrs Morgan complained about another resident at the block of flats and Loosemore got involved. He was investigated by the council in 2010 when Mrs Morgan accused him of pushing her over when she confronted him about her plant pots being damaged. In 2012 he was convicted of damaging a pot outside her home. Jennifer Stetson, defending, told the court: 'The complainant, it seems, made complaints about another resident. 'Mr Loosemore came to the resident's assistance and matters escalated.' Loosemore claims he was provoked by Mrs Morgan and says she made a comment about his dog, saying, 'you're the next one of be run over' after his previous pet suffered the same fate. Miss Stetson added: 'He doesn't think she's German and he doesn't think she's Jewish. He admits that at that point he did want to upset her, as he had been upset.' The court heard Loosemore - who is no longer caretaker of the block - suffers from depression and has an issue with alcohol. Bristol City Council said they would now review his tenancy in light of a second conviction for criminal damage against him.","Stephen Loosemore convicted of daubing Swastika on Vera Morgan's home .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . The last navy ship block has left Portsmouth dockyard heralding the end of shipbuilding in the historic city. Workers waved goodbye to the final piece of HMS Prince of Wales as it set off for Scotland on a barge yesterday. The yard was built more than 500 years ago and is Britain's most prolific naval base for building ships. It is owned by BAE Systems which announced last year that they would be moving projects to Scotland. HMS Prince of Wales will return to Portsmouth at the end of the decade along with HMS Queen Elizabeth. The final piece of HMS Prince of Wales was completed and sailed out of Portsmouth Dockyard yesterday after more than 500 years of ship building . The carrier, which left yesterday, is the last thing to be built at the naval dockyard which was constructed in 1495 at the behest of King Henry VII . The 920ft carrier weighs 65,000 tonnes and is due to arrive in Rosyth in four days. Paul Bowsher, Queen Elizabeth Class project manager for BAE Systems, paid tribute to workers who completed the Lower Block 02 part of the ship on time. He said: 'There have been a lot of teams working on this from BAE, the Aircraft Carrier Alliance and from the maintenance side of BAE. 'It has been a true team effort to get this section out. 'We have been doing the building side of it and completed it to the right quality and to schedule, which I am extremely proud of. 'The guys here have been working in very difficult circumstances as we have come to the end of the build here in Portsmouth. 'It has been fantastic that we have been able to finish with pride, but it is a very sad moment for us. 'We have seen our colleagues over the recent months moving on and taking on new roles within the dockyard. 'We are still trying to help others into roles, but it is a very sad day.' Upon BAE'S announcement last year Former Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that every effort would be made to redeploy workers, and that compulsory redundancies would be kept to a minimum. 'The loss of a shipmaking capability will be a harsh blow to Portsmouth,' he said as he announced that more than £100 million would be invested in the city's naval base so it can accommodate new warships. Portsmouth Dockland was built in 1495 and was granted royal status in 1670 by King Charles II after the creation of the Royal Navy . HS Daring lines up before the aircraft at Portsmouth dockyard. The final piece of HMS Prince of Wales weighs 65,000 tonnes and is due to arrive in Rosyth in four days . The moving of BAE's shipbuilding to Scotland from Portsmouth dockyard sparked fury among shipbuilders and local people proud of the yard's heritage . Many critics said moving the work from Portsmouth to Scotland ahead of the Scottish Independence Referendum next month was a politically tailored idea . The dockyard has provided steady work for Portsmouth residents for hundreds of years. While many expressed sadness at the completion of work, others encouraged celebrating its contribution to shipbuilding over the last five centuries .

August 2014: Last piece of HMS Prince of Wales to be built in Portsmouth leaves for Scotland on a barge . Conservative councillors slammed the decision as a politically motivated one tailored to the impending Scottish Independence referendum. Speaking in November, Alistair Thompson said: 'This is devastating for the workers and their families but also for all those people involved in the supply chain that keeps the dockyard working. 'Many of those who I represent as a councillor are hugely concerned that this decision has been taken for political reasons because of the referendum in Scotland next year.' Today the leader of Portsmouth City Council, Councillor Donna Jones, said people should take pride in what the dockyard has contributed to shipbuilding. 'I am happy and proud of what the city has produced. 'It has played a historic part in building such a ship, and that is something to be proud of. 'This is only a farewell and not a goodbye as both ships will permanently be based in Portsmouth. 'The city will be their homes and we look forward to welcoming them back. 'The Prime Minister David Cameron has made a commitment that the city will be the home of the Royal Navy, and most of the fleet will be here.' Alison Wright works in the chaplaincy at the dockyard. She said: 'A lot of people have been laid off because shipbuilding is moving, so it is important to show as much interest in what has been achieved already. 'I have seen a couple of lads in the chaplaincy as they have been made redundant. 'It is important to show what happens behind the dockyard and the work produced.

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . MTV reality star Diem Brown is out of hospital and has opened up about the shock hysterectomy she underwent ten days ago. Ms Brown, 32, collapsed earlier this month while filming a new reality show and was airlifted to a New York City hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with colon cancer after finding multiple tumors in her colon, uterus and stomach lining. 'When I came to, they told me that they couldn't save my uterus,' she tells People. 'That was a blow. Might sound silly to most, but it's what made me still feel like a woman and gave me hope for a future. I felt empty ... gutted.' Heartbreaking: Diem Brown, pictured in July, was recently diagnosed with colon cancer, and underwent an emergency hysterectomy, which she describes as being a 'blow' to her womanhood . She's also had to come to terms with the colostomy bag she's just had fitted. Still, once Ms Brown's medical team told her just how 'touch and go' the surgery had been, she says she gained a better 'perspective.' 'I might not have the ability to ever carry a child and I have this damn bag for the time being – but I'm alive,' she says. After the emergency hysterectomy, the star - who found fame on MTV's Real World/Road Rules Challenge back in 2006 - underwent a second operation three days later due to an infection in her abdomen. 'I might not have the ability to ever carry a child and I have this damn bag for the time being – but I'm alive' Speaking to the publication last week when she was still in hospital, Ms Brown's sister said: 'Hopefully in the next few weeks she'll be well enough to start chemo. 'She's on a lot of medication but every once and awhile you'll see her spirit, the light back in her eyes.' Battles: Ms Brown, pictured last year, was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 23, after which she had one ovary, several lymph nodes and part of her fallopian tube removed . Sharing her story: After her second ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2012, Ms Brown published a powerful video documenting her hair loss (pictured) Ms Brown was first diagnosed with ovarian cancer when she was 23; after which she had one ovary, several lymph nodes and part of her fallopian tube removed. After seven years of being all-clear, the cancer returned in 2012; this time taking her second ovary. Just beforehand, she had her eggs frozen in a desperate attempt to hang onto her dreams of pregnancy and childbirth. After her second cancer diagnosis, Ms Brown uploaded a powerful video documenting her hair loss after chemotherapy sessions. Emotionally-charged:  She said of the video, 'I started recording my bi-nightly brushing of my hair ritual in order to show others what really goes on behind closed doors' She wrote on her People.com blog: 'I was curious about the hair-loss process. I wanted to see how the hair falling out actually happened. Like, how fast did it happen? What does it feel like when it comes out? What does it look like while it's falling out? 'At my two-and-a-half week mark after my carbo/taxol chemo infusion treatment, I started recording my bi-nightly brushing of my hair ritual in order to show others what really goes on behind closed doors.'

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . They may look like farm workers in the fields of the tranquil French countryside. But specialist Guy Momper and his colleague Raoul Weber are actually combing the landscape for unexploded shells fired almost 100 years ago during the First World War. The pair are among a handful of men known in French as 'les demineurs', loosely translated as 'the sweepers' whose sole task it is to collect unexploded munitions from fields in northern France. Raoul Weber, left and Guy Momper, centre, pry a 155mm artillery shell from the First World War out of the ground after it was discovered in a field in Champneuville owned by Francois Urvoy, right . Mr Momper then discovers an unexploded 150mm German artillery shell, dropped during the First World War, in the long grass of a field near the city of Verdun . Mine-clearing specialist Mr Momper carefully carries away two unexploded French 70mm artillery shells found by a local farmer in his field . Mr Weber holds a German 105mm artillery shell, which had lay in a corn field after being dropped during the First World War . Most of the unexploded shells they collect are from the First World War, with many being found between the city of Verdun and the German border around 60 miles away. Fighting around Verdun was particularly intense during the conflict and it is estimated that millions of both French and German shells are still strewn across the region. During the 10-month Battle of Verdun in 1916 artillery barrages in some areas were so intense that thousands of artillery shells fell on average per each square metre. Mr Momper and his team of demineurs expect they and their successors will be collecting shells still for centuries to come. Fighting around Verdun, where farmer Francois Urvoy owns fields, was particularly intense during the First World War, meaning the discovery of shells is common . Although some who discover the shells try to destroy the ammunition themselves, Mr Momper recommends that the bomb clearance unit be notified . Mr Weber holds the inner pieces of a 75mm anti-personnel French artillery shell from the First World War . They also found a German mortar shell called a 'taube', left, which means pigeon, while others, right, may have contained chemical agents . Mr Momper and Mr Weber measure an unexploded shell, which turns out to be a 155mm artillery shell from First World War . He explained: 'Today we need more space, we build new houses, and what happens? We stir up the earth. When you stir up the earth, you keep the legacy of this war which are the shells, the grenades and the mortars. 'So in this sense, the war is not over. And I think, in the area where we are now, it will continue for 100 or 200 years.' Although some who discover the shells try to destroy the ammunition themselves Mr Momper recommends that the bomb clearance unit be notified and the dangerous work be carried out by professionals. The shells, including this unexploded German 250mm shell, are taken to a storage facility in Metz for safe keeping . Once in the storage facility, the unexploded ordnance is then taken away, so it can be disposed of safely . Precise figures on the number of deaths due to exploded shells are hard to come by, but two experts from the Metz unit were killed in 2007 after a shell they were transporting detonated. Mr Momper said that given the number of munitions that remain in the area and are yet to be discovered, 'it's almost impossible that nothing will happen.' 'Someone said once, ""the bomb does its own thing"". 'In normal conditions if it's in a certain position, you can carry it around taking a number of precautions. 'You might be able to carry a million of them but the next one might explode.' Most of the unexploded shells they collect are from the First World War, with many being found between the city of Verdun and the German border around 60 miles away . These German shells, that were taken to the storage facility in Metz and stand in a bin, are thought to possibly contain chemical warfare agents .","Specialist Guy Momper and his colleague Raoul Weber collect unexploded ordnance from the First World War .

Richard Airey, 36, pushed night porter James Heseltine through a glass door at the Mercure Hotel in Bingley, West Yorkshire, after trouble flared at his wedding reception on August 9. The company director, from Leeds, attacked Mr Heseltine after he and another guest got into a row with the hotel porter about the fact the bar was closing at 1am. Richard Airey, 36, (left) pushed hotel night porter James Heseltine through a glass door after trouble flared at his wedding reception just hours after he exchanged vows with his partner Leila (right) on August 9 . Prosecutor Suzanne Paige told Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court how Mr Heseltine had been working as a night porter and security guard at the hotel when the two men reacted over plans to shut the bar. Airey, who runs his own textiles business, pushed Mr Heseltine through a glass door causing him cuts to his back just hours after marrying his fiancée Leila. Miss Paige said Mr Heseltine did not need hospital treatment for his injuries but Airey pleaded guilty to common assault when he appeared in court today. His solicitor advocate, Laiquat Din, said the defendant had written to the hotel to apologise and had offered to pay for the damage to the door. 'It was his wedding day and not a very nice way to end his wedding night,' Mr Din told the court. After being arrested, Airey told police he was sorry and admitted the offence at the first opportunity. Airey admitted assaulting Mr Heseltine at the Mercure Hotel in Bingley, West Yorkshire (above), after a row erupted over the closure of a bar at the wedding reception. He was ordered to pay more than £300 by a court . The court heard how Airey realised his behaviour was unacceptable and now wanted to give up drinking alcohol. District Judge Susan Bouch sentenced him to a 12-month community order, with supervision and a six month alcohol treatment requirement. He was fined £50 and ordered to pay £85 prosecution costs and £200 compensation to Mr Heseltine. The judge said the offence was aggravated by the fact that Mr Heseltine was working at the hotel as a security guard.","Richard Airey, 36, pushed night porter James Heseltine through glass door .

Kerry Unsworth, 49, had been watching TV with her elderly mother when the motorist's blue Ford Focus smashed into her conservatory. The mother-of-two said she thought there had been an explosion as the car struck her home in Droylsden, Greater Manchester yesterday afternoon. Smash: Kerry Unsworth and her family had a lucky escape when a 71-year-old driver lost control of his Ford Focus and ploughed into the side of her home . Shock: Ms Unsworth said she thought there had been an explosion as the car hit her home . The 71-year-old driver is thought to have lost control of his automatic car as he approached the bend at the end of Ms Unsworth's street. He then mounted the pavement and drove through a garden wall before the vehicle ended up crumpled against Ms Unsworth's extension. His 73-year-old wife, a passenger in the car, had to be cut free by fire crews before being taken by ambulance to Tameside Hospital. Her injuries are not said to be life threatening and the driver was unhurt. Ms Unsworth said the force of the impact was enough to shift her £9,000 conservatory more than three inches, and she fears it will have to be torn down. Impact: The driver's car mounted the pavement and drove through a garden wall before the vehicle ended up crumpled against Ms Unsworth's extension . Debris was also thrown onto the family car parked on the driveway whilst her two pet cats have disappeared. She fears they may have been traumatised and fled. Ms Unsworth said it was mere chance that she was not in the conservatory at the time and described the whole ordeal as ‘very frightening’. 'I had just got up to get some washing out of the machine and it sounded like an explosion,' she said. 'It was really frightening. We sit in the conservatory all the time so it’s just lucky that this time we weren’t.

Ice cream magnate and State Treasurer Doug Ducey has won the Republican primary to stand for the next governor of Arizona, one of four states where voters were choosing candidates for statewide office. Ducey, who started Cold Stone Creamery in Arizona and built it into a national brand before selling the company in 2007, won the primary following a campaign focusing on his blend of government and business experience. He has been state treasurer for the last four years, serving as the chief steward of Arizona's finances during a period that included the collapse of the housing market in the state. Scroll down for video . State treasurer and former CEO Doug Ducey, right, laughs along with Gov. Jan Brewer, left, as he arrives to claim victory on winning the Republican primary for Arizona governor . The race to replace Republican Governor Jan Brewer had started as a fairly quiet contest focused on health care and jobs. It shifted abruptly however when thousands of immigrant children began entering the country, with some settling in Arizona. The six candidates soon staked out hard-line positions on immigration in the quest for right-leaning Republican primary voters, repeatedly attacking the Obama administration for failing to secure the . border. Democrat Fred DuVal was unopposed in his primary and will face Ducey in November. Elsewhere, former Republican Governor Charlie Crist contined his political comeback as Democratic voters selected him as their nominee to challenge Republican Gov. Rick Scott in Florida. Crist easily defeated former state Sen. Nan Rich, while Scott coasted in his own primary toward a general election matching the state's last two Republican governors. Former Republican Gov.

'Frankly, I think I was on their side when I was in the other party,' he said as he prepared a victory speech. He said a friend once told him, '""Charlie, you've been a Democrat your whole life, you just didn't know it."" Well, now I know it.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . When it comes to the language of love, it's not what you say, but how you say it. People make subtle changes in their voices when they speak to people they find attractive, say scientists. And these voice modulations make the speaker more attractive to the listener too, the research by Scotland's University of Stirling found. Scroll down for video . A study found that people make subtle changes in their voices when speaking to people they find attractive . In the study of 110 heterosexual men and women, who were either English or Czech, male speakers of both languages varied their tone more when they spoke to women they found attractive, speaking in a ‘sing-song’ voice, similar to actor Leslie Phillips. The men also reached a lower minimum voice pitch, or 'deep voice', compared with when they spoke to women they considered less attractive. Luckily for them, female listeners found that style of speech more attractive too. Lead researcher Juan David Leongómez said it is important for men to sound masculine, but that extreme masculinity can be associated with negative traits. He said: 'Previous research has shown that humans signal their romantic interest in several different ways, including non-verbal behaviours and body language, like eye contact and casual touching,- for example playfully touching someone's hair. 'Our study shows that people also modulate their voices to signal romantic interest and that this, in turn, seems to make the speaker seem more attractive. Men were found to speak in a more 'sing-song' voice similar to actor Leslie Phillips (pictured) when speaking to women they found attractive . 'For men, it is important to sound masculine, which is manifested in a deeper voice pitch. However, extreme masculinity is associated with negative traits in a partner, like a tendency for increased aggressiveness and promiscuity. 'This puts men in a dilemma, because they have to convey two seemingly contradictory messages at the same time: ""I am a masculine man"", and ""I'd be a good partner and father"". ‘The solution may be to vary their pitch – which would explain the sing-songy quality of the voices we observed in men speaking to attractive women.' The researchers' findings also showed that by-standers respond to these subtle differences too. When the voice recording of a man speaking to an attractive woman was played to female listeners, the listeners found the voice more attractive than a recording of the same man speaking to a less attractive woman. The men whose voices were recorded were Czech and the bystanding female listeners were British - so the experiment was designed to ensure the women did not understand the words being spoken. This indicates the male speakers' attractiveness was due to their subtle voice changes, rather than what they were saying. Mr Leongómez said: 'If a woman perceives a man's voice to be more sing-songy, then it is likely the man finds her attractive. However, these vocal modulations are very subtle and probably not produced consciously by the speaker. 'Additionally, while they help make a person sound more attractive to the opposite sex, people do not seem to be aware of why they find the voice more attractive.' The study, published in the journal Evolution and Human Behaviour, added these subtle changes are probably not produced consciously by the speaker.","Researchers found voice modulations make speaker attractive to listener .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Physiotherapist Christopher Lewis (pictured) bit a woman client's shoulder and growled 'like a baby lion' to satisfy sexual urge, a tribunal has heard . A physiotherapist bit a client’s shoulder while she was lying on his table and growled 'like a baby lion' to 'satisfy his sexual urge', a tribunal has heard. Christopher Lewis allegedly carried out the act after pressing his body against the woman and squashing her breasts during therapy on her fractured shoulder, the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) panel was told. Sophie Lister, representing the HCPC, said Lewis had spoken to his client about how physical injuries could affect sexual relationships during the session at Verulam clinic in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on May 13 last year. 'Towards the end of the conversation, Mr Lewis started to work her right shoulder and slowly leaned across and squashed her breasts, still keeping eye contact and bit the skin of her left shoulder playfully,' Ms Lister told the hearing in central London. 'It made her feel uncomfortable, vulnerable and shocked.' Giving evidence, the woman, who cannot be named, said she thought Lewis made a noise as he bit her. 'It was a bit of a growl,' she said. 'It wasn’t a lion growl. Like a baby lion growl. 'There was no way this was a peck or a kiss. 'He had my skin in his teeth and shook his head in a similar way to a cat does when he does a bite.' Lewis broke down in tears during his evidence as he told the hearing it was 'completely false' to suggest he bit the woman or that his actions were sexually motivated. But the physio, who is facing a conduct and competence committee, has admitted squashing his client’s breasts with his torso 'in the context of a hug', his lawyer Nicholas Toms said. Ms Lister said: 'We say Mr Lewis’s actions were motivated and done for his sexual gratitude, to satisfy his sexual urge and impulse. 'Notwithstanding what he will say, there is no other feasible explanation for his actions.' She added: 'We say the intention was for his sexual gratification and no other reason.' Following the physio session, the woman cancelled a future appointment after emailing Lewis to say his behaviour had 'blurred the lines', Ms Lister said. Lewis sent a reply in which he said he realised he made a mistake and had not acted 'appropriately', the lawyer said. He later telephoned the woman to apologise, she added. Lewis told the panel the woman may have mistaken contact with his facial hair for a bite on the shoulder and he had been 'stupid' to hug her as she grimaced in pain during treatment. 'No bite took place,' he said. 'Looking back it was not something I would do now. The incident is alleged to have taken place at Verulam Clinic in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on May 13, 2013 . 'It should never have happened. 'I wanted to show her, as a physiotherapist, I could sympathise with her and provide emotional support.' Asked if he thought he acted appropriately, Lewis replied: 'No. 'It crossed physical boundaries. 'She did not come to the session to be hugged, she came for treatment. 'I completely accept what I did was wrong. 'I should have never given her a hug.' Lewis said the length of his facial hair 'probably feels quite prickly' and the woman may have perceived that as a bite. He told the hearing he felt 'terrible' when his client emailed him to cancel her next appointment. 'I knew as soon as I did it it was a stupid thing to do,' he said. 'When I received an email like that I was pretty distraught.' The woman, who cannot be named, said he had her skin in his teeth and growled like a 'baby lion'. She told the panel that it made her feel 'uncomfortable, vulnerable and shocked'. Picture posed by model . During cross-examination, Lewis denied being 'aroused' when the woman mentioned during treatment that she had a female partner. 'I have no interest in the sexual orientation of my clients or what they do behind closed doors,' he said. 'I’ve been a happily married man for five years.' Lewis told the hearing it was 'very hard ... to have been accused of doing something you haven’t done.' 'I’m not sure what I would do if I was not able to continue practising as a physiotherapist,' he said. During her evidence, the woman admitted the alleged bite had not left a mark. 'It wasn’t a painful bite,' she said. 'It was a bite taking hold of my skin.' She also denied that she had mistaken the feel of Lewis’s beard for a 'peck' on her shoulder. 'I have no recollection if he had a beard or not,' she added. The woman, who gave evidence from behind a screen, said there was 'certainly no flirtation' towards the physio. She added: 'The reason I didn’t challenge him at the time was I felt extremely vulnerable.' The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.

"By . Stephen Johns for The Daily Mail . Women go on more diets than men but give up four weeks sooner, according to research. The average diet for women lasts only 12 days before they give into temptation, while men persevere for around six weeks. The majority of women have dieted at some point in their lives, with nearly three quarters admitting they had adopted a constructed eating plan and weight loss strategy, compared to just over half of men. Women go on more diets than men but give in to temptation far sooner research has shown, pictures posed . The study, by online pharmacy UKMedix.com, also found that women go on more diets than men. The poll suggested that women are prolific dieters, trying an average of 17 during their lifetime, while men attempted just five. Essex was revealed as the UK’s top dieting location for women, according to the research, while Newcastle was the top location for male dieters. Experts said that these two areas may have come out on top because of influence from reality television shows based there. The Only Way is Essex popularised the mantra ‘No carbs before Marbs’, as many of its stars went on strict low carbohydrate diets before holidays to Marbella in Spain. Reality show Geordie Shore based in Newcastle upon Tyne is famous for its cast of sculpted males. Brighton and London were the next two most common locations for female dieters among the respondents and men from Cardiff and Glasgow were also keen dieters. 1. Essex – 24% . 2. Brighton – 15% . 3. London – 13% . 4. Manchester – 11% . 5. Sheffield – 9% . 1. Newcastle – 31% . 2. Cardiff – 19% . 3. Glasgow – 14% . 4. Leeds – 12% . 5. London – 8% . Sarah Bailey from UKMedix.com said: ‘The results showed that women tend to stick to their diets for an average of 12 days, whilst men tend to stick at them for much longer. ‘It would seem that women are more likely to give in to their cravings. ‘A lot of men treat fitness regimes as a chance to socialise, such as trips to the gym with friends. ‘They encourage each other to stay motivated and turn it into a competition. ‘Many women dream of the perfect body, so put themselves through strenuous dieting, only to realise they’re happier eating and drinking what they want and not being too strict on themselves. ‘Essex has gained a bit of a reputation in recent years as a glamorous and appearance-centred hot spot, so it’s no surprise that they are the UK’s top diet spot for women. ‘It’s also interesting that men from Newcastle are the UK’s biggest dieters, showing that maybe the high profile reality TV shows set in both has an impact on the residents.‘ .

"By . Harriet Arkell For Mailonline . A pensioner with a string of failed marriages behind him smothered his fifth wife with a pillow and then killed himself as he struggled to cope with another divorce, a coroner ruled today. Chauffeur Terence Kirby, 72, and his wife, Myrna, 57, were found dead at their home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, by their son, Freddie, at least 48 hours after their deaths. An inquest heart that Mr Kirby, who had suffered depression and alcohol abuse in the months before he died, had lived apart from his wife of 30 years for two years. Senior Hertfordshire coroner Edward Thomas heard that Mrs Kirby, a carer and regular churchgoer, had filed for divorce in October 2012, three months before her and her husband's bodies were found. Terence Kirby, 72, and his wife of 30 years, Myrna, 57, were found dead at home by their son, Freddie . Mr Kirby was admitted to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield for treatment for depression.  He was regularly visited by his wife, and discharged in December 2012, two days before Christmas, to be cared for at home by his wife and community mental health workers. The inquest heard that Freddie last heard from his mother on January 7 2013, and found their bodies at home four days later when he could not reach his mother by phone. Philippines-born Mrs Kirby, who lived in nearby Waltham Cross, was found in bed with a pillow over her head, while her husband was dead in another room. A post-mortem found low levels of alcohol in both bodies. Mr Kirby's cause of death was given as suspension, while his wife, who was said to have been dead 'for some time', and for longer than him, died from asphyxia with compression of the neck. Mr Kirby's children questioned whether he should have been released from hospital, and if there was enough contact from community workers. But health workers who visited the pair after his release reported the couple were 'comfortable' with one another despite his continued drinking. Mrs Kirby had been caring for her husband at home in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, as he battled depression . Michael Walker, consultant psychiatrist, told the coroner at the inquest in Hatfield that Mr Kirby was referred to him in November 2012 after telling his GP he felt suicidal, despite having no previous mental health problems. 'He had thoughts of hanging himself or a drug overdose, and it seemed to be because of the divorce,' he said. 'He was drinking at a harmful level, much more than is recommended, and he was felt to be a risk. He talked about a rope and knives.' After Mr Kirby had been admitted to hospital, his wife told his doctors 'she could be scared of him when he shouted at her when he was drinking alcohol', the coroner said. Mr Thomas added: 'She said that there had been ups and downs, and he could become very abusive and call her names, but they would get back together because she loved him.' Mr Kirby's mood improved and he was discharged two days before Christmas, the inquest heard. Police officers arrive at the Kirbys' home shortly after their bodies were discovered in January last year . Between then and January 5, health crisis workers spoke to the Kirbys on several occasions, both over the telephone and during home visits. Suzanne Bernardi, community psychiatric nurse, told the inquest Mrs Kirby had called on Boxing Day to say she had resisted her husband's request for more alcohol. Regular contact was made over the next few days, and Mr Kirby was last visited by a member of the crisis team on January 5. On January 8, the team made a cold call but could not get a response from the house. Two days later another visit was made but got no response, so on the afternoon of January 11 the police were asked to make a welfare check, shortly before Freddie discovered the bodies of his parents. Members of the family criticised the procedures followed by the crisis team, accusing them of 'gross incompetence' in managing the situation. The couple's daughter, whose name was not given, said: 'The crisis team is called that for a reason.' Hertfordshire Police found no evidence of any disturbance and neighbours didn't report hearing any loud arguments or aggression in the lead up to their deaths. Coroner Mr Thomas said: 'Mrs Kirby seems to have been very caring, he had a crisis and they had marital difficulties over the years. 'Clearly there was the impact on him of another failed relationship... What he had intimated was he did not want to get divorced. 'We will never know what actually happened on the day that she died, but we do know she had concerns about his drinking and he had a quantity of alcohol in his blood.' He recorded a verdict that Mrs Kirby was unlawfully killed and Mr Kirby committed suicide afterwards. 'I think that he realised the enormity and sadness of what he had done, to someone who had actually been very supportive and come back to help him in a time of crisis,' said Mr Thomas.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A 500-year-old document signed by King Henry VIII granting a loan which ultimately helped found the London Stock Exchange has emerged for sale for £65,000. Addressed to John Heron, the Treasurer of the Chamber, King Henry informs him to loan £637 and 10 shillings - worth £3.94million today - to English cloth merchant Richard Gresham. The loan enabled Gresham, a member of parliament, to found the House of Gresham - one of the most celebrated mercantile and financial houses of the 16th Century. The document, pictured, signed by King Henry VIII outlined the payment of a loan of £637 and 10 shillings to English cloth merchant Richard Gresham . King Henry VIII, pictured, granted a raft of loans to help develop businesses and used money from the central purse . His son, Sir Thomas Gresham, then further increased the family fortune and in 1571 founded the Royal Exchange in the City of London - the country's first stock exchange and central to founding modern business in England. The monarch wrote: 'Richard Gresham of oure Citie of London with other stonde bounde by obligacion for the payment to oure use of the somme of Sixe hundred thirty seven poundes and ten shillynges at a certayn daie expired.' Signed by Henry VIII 'Henry R' in 1513 - four years into his 38-year reign - he also orders for the payment to be delayed for two years upon receiving sureties from Gresham the crown would be repaid. At the time of the loan, 29-year-old Gresham was a major cloth merchant trading in Antwerp, Belgium. An extremely influential figure, he served as the Lord Mayor of London, a Member of Parliament and was a major financier to the crown. The document is addressed to John Heron, the Treasurer of the Chamber. King Henry informs him to loan which, today, would be worth the equivalent of £3.94million . The Royal Exchange in the City of London - the country's first stock exchange and central to founding modern business in England . The loan was part of a raft of handouts Henry granted to help develop businesses and came from the central purse. It helped fund Gresham's empire and six years later his son Sir Thomas was born - who also became Lord Mayor of London and whose influence on the economy is still felt in London today. The 505-year-old vellum document - which means it is a parchment made from calf skin - once formed part of the collection of Sir Thomas Phillipps, a British Baronet who amassed the largest collection of manuscript material in the 19th Century. His chief collecting rival was the British Library - a testament to the value of his collection. The document emerged for sale in the 1970s and has since passed through the hands of several private collectors. It is now being sold for £65,000 after being bought by Bristol antiques dealers Paul Fraser Collectibles. Paul Fraser, the company's founder, said: 'Henry VIII signatures come up for sale very rarely - most are in museums or libraries. 'The historical importance of the document makes it particularly special to me. Sir Thomas Gresham, pictured, was inspired to build the Exchange when his only son Richard died in a riding accident in 1564 at the age of 16 . 'If it wasn't for Henry's loan to Richard Gresham, he may never have made his fortune, and his son Thomas would never have had the opportunity to establish the Royal Exchange - the precursor to London's Stock Exchange. 'And you can't get much better than provenance from Sir Thomas Phillipps, the manuscript collector of the 19th century.' Sir Thomas Gresham was inspired to build the Exchange when his only son Richard died in a riding accident in 1564 at the age of 16. He suddenly found himself without a male heir to his legacy and set about recreating it in stone, medieval historian Ian Blanchard, Honorary Professional Fellow at the University of Edinburgh, wrote. In January 1565, Sir Thomas offered to finance the building of a bourse - or stock exchange - for the City of London. A year later, he personally laid the first foundation stone. It was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth I - who deemed it the 'Royal Exchange' - in 1571.","500-year-old document signed by King Henry VIII going on sale for £65,000 .

"By . Jack Crone for MailOnline . A British mormon father-of-six has been killed by a bee sting despite always carrying an EpiPen with him in the knowledge that he was severely allergic. Luke Calcraft, 46, died in St. Luke's University Hospital in Fountain Hill, Pennsylvania, on August 1 after falling ill following a severe reaction to the insect's sting. He had moved from Chelmsford, Essex, to Pennsylvania in 2012 after landing a dream job as president of the medical systems group Olympus Corp. Allergic reaction: Luke Calcraft (pictured above with wife Natasha) died on August 1 after being stung by a bee . It is understood Mr Calcraft, who formerly worked in Southend, Essex, was allergic to insect bites and carried an EpiPen -  but he still could not be saved. He was an active member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and leaves behind a wife, Natasha, and six children - Tom, Sam, Joel, Sarah, Rhonin and Arija. The high-flying employee had previously been responsible for the company's medical and microscopy businesses in Europe, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Peter Holmes, who worked with Mr Calcraft between 2003 and 2012, has described his death as tragic. The 62-year-old, from Shoebury, Essex, said: 'What has happened is a terrible tragedy. Everybody is shocked. 'I am still in touch with people I worked with and we all can't believe what has happened. It's hit us all hard . 'He was a very popular man and people felt good about having him around. I will remember him for being very good at his job. He was a decision maker, but also very diplomatic. Tragic: The British businessman moved to Pennsylvania in 2012 after landing a dream job as president of the medical systems group Olympus Corp. 'He loved the company and gave so much to the business and to Southend.' He added: 'He was an altruistic character. He worked hard trying to persuade various authorities to do certain things for the benefit of residents' safety. 'A lot of his spare time was spent working on road safety. It was something he was very passionate about and gave a lot of his time to it.' Mr Calcraft had been employed with Olympus for 24 years and had worked his way up from the Southend branch to president of the medical systems group of Olympus in America.

"By . Alex Lazcano for Daily Mail Australia . It's the stuff of nightmares for any parent. Forty years ago, fifteen year old Annastaes (Anna) Banitskas caught a bus to work and hasn't been seen since. She started her day on Tuesday August 27th 1974 like any other, by getting up and getting ready for work. Her older brother Chris offered her a lift but she turned it down saying she would rather get the bus. But mysteriously she got off the bus a few stops early and never made it to work. Peter Banitskas, Loretta Pantou and Chris Banitskas pose for a photo holding a picture of their sister Anna Banitskas and an artists impression of how she would look now . Anna has been missing for 40 years. The image on the left is one of the only photos her family has of her. To the right an artists impression of what she would look like now . She is remembered by her siblings, Lorretta, Chris and Peter as a happy and good girl who was dedicated to her family and loved them very much. 'We had only lived in Australia for a few years before Anna went missing,' Anna's youngest brother Peter Banitskas told Daily Mail Australia, 'but she had a good group of friends and as far as I knew she was happy.' Forty years on and her family are still perplexed as to why their beloved daughter and sister disappeared. 'We haven't given up on her, we're not resigned to the fact that she may be dead,' says Mr Banitskas who was just seven years old when she went missing, 'She might be out there and we just want to know if she's okay.' Forty years on and Anna's parents have still not given up hope of finding their daughter . Anna's younger sister Loretta who was eight at the time, even went to a psychic who told her that Anna was alive and living in the nearby suburb of Doncaster. 'It’s the not knowing that’s the worst.' Loretta Pentou told Daily Mail Australia, 'We just don't know what happened. We don't have closure, we think about her every day.' 'It was a normal rainy day, my brother Chris offered her a lift to work that morning but she said she wanted to get the bus, she got on that bus but a workmate of hers told us that she got off a few stops early to get some stockings.' She never arrived at work and she was never seen again. Anna caught a bus from nearby Kingsway Drive, Lalor, on Tuesday August 27th 1974 onr way to her job at Rolex, a factory she worked at near Thomastown in Victoria. 'We know it’s been a long time, but we still believe there is someone out there with information relating to Anna’s case.' Detective Senior Constable Craig Hall said. Police today made a public appeal for information about the August 1974 disappearance of the then 15-year-old Anna Banitskas. Anna's sister Loretta Pantou (pictured right with her husband, Chris) misses her sister everyday. Loretta and her family have devoted their lives to trying to make contact with Anna . Anna's family do not believe she is dead and hope that she will get in contact if only just to let them know she is safe. 'It was hard for our parents,' Mr Banistakas said, 'I was young but I remember the crying.' The family have also been subjected to many rumors about Anna's disappearance including that she was pregnant and ran away because she was ashamed, and one that she'd met a man and run off with him. 'It was quite weird, we don't have much of her left. She took all of our photo albums with her that day, she said she wanted to show people at work,' said Ms Pantou. 'It's weird that she took them,' she said. Anna was on her way to work when she got off the bus and was never seen ever again. She was meant to arrive at work at a factory but never showed up . Victorian Police are encouraging anyone who may have any information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. Anna has brown eyes, black hair and an olive complexion. She was last seen wearing grey pants, a white jumper and brown shoes. 'Hopefully with the help of the public, we’ll be able to give some long overdue piece of mind to the Banitskas family,' said Detective Senior Constable Hall.","Anna Banitskas was 15-years-old when she went missing .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . Marine researchers in Croatia have revealed how they have found a previously unrecorded albino dolphin, one of only 20 in the world. The rare mammal - named Albus by the research team - was found in the Mediterranean swimming between Croatia and Italy. Experts say the dolphin - who they believe to be male - appears to be in good health. Marine scientists from Croatia discovered the rare albino dolphin off the Italian coast near Ravenna . The white mammal was seen frolicking with a more conventional dolphin and appears to be in good health . Researchers said the dolphin, named Albus, was the first albino spotted in the entire Mediterranean area . Albus was first spotted in the sea at outskirts of the eastern Italian port city, Ravenna. A spokeperson for Plavi Svijet, an Croatian environmental organisation, said: 'We have observed an extremely rare albino bottlenose dolphin. 'This appears to be the first albino dolphin spotted not only in the Adriatic Sea, but in the entire Mediterranean. 'Albus was, when we met, with another, normally coloured bottlenose dolphin. Both animals swam and fished, and almost completely ignored us,' they added. Bottlenose dolphins are normally a grey colour but a gene mutation gives the albino variety white skin and pink eyes. 'They are no weaker or less able than other dolphins but because of their colour they can be more vulnerable to predators,' said one expert. But the scientists who found Albus warned: 'Please don't try to track him or follow him. The only animal a dolphin has to fear in these waters is man. The albino dolphin was spotted off the coast of Ravenna, Italy by researchers from Croatia . According to marine scientists there are only approximately 20 albino dolphins across the globe .","Marine researchers spotted the incredibly rare dolphin off the coast of Italy .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Junior Cooper, 35, has been jailed for nine years for targeting professional women who were walking home alone in London . The leader of a gang of muggers, who attacked and snatched handbags from professional women who were walking home alone at night, has been jailed for nine years. Junior Cooper, 35, from Queens Park, north west London, and his accomplices pounced from behind and choked their victims in three violent attacks in central London last year. One victim, pianist Susanne Suhonen suffered a broken finger and may never be able to play properly again. Another victim was choked with her own silk scarf, while the third victim was dragged along the street when she refused to let go of her handbag. Sentencing him to nine years in prison, Judge Michael Grieve said: ‘Extreme planning was involved in all the robberies. Women on their own likely to have valuable goods were targeted.’ Cooper - who was jailed in 2009 for a spate of robberies - drove the gang around in a stolen Audi looking for vulnerable women, the court was told. One victim, Jacqueline Hurst, had just parked her car near her home in Marylebone at 10.30pm in November 2013 when she was attacked by the thugs. One of the men grabbed her around the waist, while another choked the woman with her scarf, Southwark Crown Court heard. She was knocked to the ground during the robbery and is still traumatised. In a statement to the court, she said: ‘Before the attack I was a confident girl, happy, fun and totally unfazed by city living. ‘Everything has changed and I am half the woman I used to be. At all times day or night I am looking behind myself.’ Ms Hurst added that she now has to wait for her boyfriend to escort her from her car. She also has to sit or stand with her back to a wall when she is out in public, fearing she will be grabbed from behind. About half an hour after that attack, Sarah Lewishon was targtted as she walked from her car to her house in St John’s Wood, north London. She was also grabbed around the neck but refused to let go of her handbag and was dragged along the ground. Ms Lewishon now suffers severe neck pain and is terrified to go out at night alone. Eleven day later, Ms Suhonen was attacked by the gang as she walked home. She told the court she was unable to sleep for about two weeks after the attack and that she kept having nightmares. She said: ‘I had to open my eyes and I didn’t want to close them for fear of seeing the same scenes again - needless to say I was exhausted in my domestic life and at work.’ Cooper was jailed at Southwark Crown Court for nine years, after being found guilty of conspiracy to rob . Tom Nicholson, prosecuting, said: ‘She fractured her finger on her right hand, which healed crooked, due to the fracture and the way the position of the tendon, she is unable to have it straightened. ‘She might not be able to play the piano properly with that hand again. Her wrist was inflamed and extremely painful. She had to postpone her piano exam for one year because of her injuries.’ Cooper and his accomplice Remy McLeod were convicted after a trial in July this year of conspiracy to rob. McLeod refused to come to court from prison today and will be sentenced on 9 September. Martin Sharpe, defending, said Cooper has a history of crack cocaine abuse, but has started to face up to his addiction problems in prison. He said: ‘He is not someone who is hopeless, he’s not without personal charm, not without personal warmth and not without hope.’ Cooper was on licence at the time of the offences and will serve the remaining three years of his 2009 sentence concurrently.","Junior Cooper, 35, and accomplices carried out 3 violent attacks in London .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . A dog named Brian is at the centre of stand-off between Australia Post and residents on a street in Brisbane who have not received their mail for almost five weeks. Australia Post turned Amaranthus Street in Runcorn, south Brisbane, into an 'exclusion zone' following an incident between a resident and a postman after the boxer escaped from his house in July. Residents of 15 surrounding houses have since missed bills and other important letters and said they received no warning from Australia Post that their mail would not be delivered. Scroll down for video . Australia Post turned Amaranthus Street in Runcorn, south Brisbane, into an 'exclusion zone' following an incident between a resident and a postman after the boxer escaped from his house . Allison Hansen, who lives nearby, said the situation was terrible. 'It's ludicrous, to put it bluntly,' Mrs Hansen told Daily Mail Australia. 'To punish all the other residents for one resident's dog, it's just not on.' Mrs Hansen witnessed Brian escape his house on July 24 and went to restrain the dog and take him back to his owners. Brian escaped his house on July 24 and jumped up and down near a postman's bike . 'The dog never touched the postman, he just jumped up and down in front of bike,' she said. 'Brian thought he was being friendly but the postie may have felt threatened.' Mrs Hansen said the postman then went to confront a female resident in the house because it was the second time Brian had escaped. 'The postman was getting aggro and bashed on the lady's door,' she said. 'She had a sick baby so she couldn't get straight out and she was trying to explain to him, then he explained this was the second time it had happened. 'It just sort of escalated from there.' Mrs Hansen said the woman was upset and crying and rang her husband, who was on his way home. He then met up with the postie on the street. 'They were having words and the postman's helmet and the resident's cap touched, they put their heads together,' she said. 'That was the ""incident"".' A spokeswoman for Queensland Police told Daily Mail Australia that police investigated a complaint in relation to an incident on Amaranthus Street in Runcorn on July 24. Witness Allison Hansen said the postman went to confront a female resident in the house (pictured) because it was the second time Brian had escaped . 'There was no complaint forthcoming and police have finalised the matter,' she said. A spokeswoman for Australia post said the company had been in contact with police who confirmed they spoke with the resident this morning and the issue had been resolved. 'Australia Post is now satisfied that the safety of our postie is no longer a threat and we will resume mail delivery to residents tomorrow,' she said. 'This issue came about not as a result of a stray dog, but the physical and verbal assault of our posties. Australia Post said it 'is now satisfied that the safety of our postie is no longer a threat and we will resume mail delivery to residents tomorrow' 'Australia Post reminds the community that the safety of our people is our highest priority and incidents of violence and intimidation will not be tolerated.' One resident, who did not wish to be named, said the most frustrating thing about the situation had been the lack of communication from Australia Post. 'When some of the neighbours phoned up to ask about it they said ""you should have been received a letter in the mail"",' he told Daily Mail Australia.","Australia Post turned Amaranthus Street, Runcorn into an 'exclusion zone'

The peculiar movement first gained popularity on Tumblr and has since blossomed elsewhere. Though these models will never gain hipster street cred, their floral endeavours are in aid of a more serious cause, raising money for men's health charity Orchid. The beautiful creations are the work of 48-year-old  florist Sue Shone who says: 'We had recently had people close to us die of cancer, and so we wanted to do something creative to raise money for Orchid, a men's health charity. Graham Jenkins (left) and local resident Lee Kelly (right) answered florist Sue Shone's social media plea for local men willing to model their flower-adorned beards in a 2015 charity calendar . Sue Shone trained in art design, which is clear from the tasteful and original arrangement she created in Liam Gallisent's beard . 'I had been looking at pictures of men in the 1960s with flowers in their hair and thought that it would be great to being the trend back, and get some local lads involved.' Sue, from Gosforth, set about recruiting as many local lads as she could and soon had a group of willing bearded and moustached men posing in front of local photographer David Williams. The brave calendar boys include fishmonger Blake Fletcher, van driver Jason Halls and heating engineer Michael Sweeney.

"It has been a week of joy for Sonia Kruger after announcing she is expecting her first child with partner Craig McPherson. And the 49-year-old Mornings presenter has opened up about how she has been dealing with the rollercoaster of emotions that come with her exciting news made possible by a close friend offering to be an egg donor. Speaking to the Australian Women's Weekly, Sonia has revealed the couple of five years and her friend have undergone counselling in order to prepare for the birth of the child and determine her friend's involvement in the baby's life. 'All of these things have to be discussed at length and agreed before the egg donation process begins,' she told the magazine. Scroll down for video . Opening up: Sonia Kruger has opened up about how she has been dealing with the emotions that have come along with her exciting news of being pregnant . It has undoubtedly been a tough journey for the Channel Nine personality, having fallen pregnant naturally a few times before the pregnancies ended in miscarriage. With her strong desire to start a family, the blonde beauty decided to give IVF a go at the age of 45. But having found little luck with the fertility treatment, the next stop was to look at options overseas. Last year Sonia travelled to South Africa for an egg donor, however the embryo didn't take. Proactive: The 49-year-old presenter has revealed she and her partner of five years Craig McPherson have undergone counselling sessions with Sonia's friend who kindly offered to be the egg donor . It was then the option of speaking to someone closer to home that became more of a reality. Appearing on A Current Affair on Monday night, Sonia revealed to presenter Leila McKinnon she is expecting a girl thanks to her friend's kind gesture. 'The egg came from a very good friend of mine…we were having conversation about it one day and she knew that I had struggled, and I said ""Look it’d all be fine if you would just give me one of your eggs!""' 'She said, ""okay!,"" and that's how it all came about.' When asked if having an egg donor will affect her emotionally, the Channel Nine presenter seemed far from phased. It's a girl! Appearing on A Current Affair on Monday night, Sonia revealed the sex of the baby . 'The idea of having an egg donor didn’t feel unusual to me...I'm not that in love with my own DNA to be honest with you!' And she had similar sentiments when it came to her age, which she said 'is irrelevant when it comes to being a good or loving parent.' The Big Brother host announced on social media on Saturday that she and her partner of five years Craig McPherson would be having a baby . Just days later, showing off her small baby bump in a figure-hugging black-and-white gown on Monday's show, Kruger was candid as she spoke about her IVF treatment and fertility fears. 'When you get to my age, to use your own eggs to have a baby...you're not really going to be successful,' she reasoned to guest co-host Richard Wilkins. 'The odds are sort of one in a million and my doctors had been very clear with me because I'd had IVF before. Congratulations: Sonia Kruger was given a cute gift on Tuesday in the form of a giant cake made out of rolled up nappies, topped with colourful balloons . At four months pregnant, she said that during her first trimester 'it was almost as if I couldn't let myself feel happy because it had happened before: I had fallen pregnant before but the pregnancy hadn't progressed.' 'When I went for the first scan and saw a heartbeat that I had never seen before, that was incredible,' she added. Also reflecting on the heart warming experience with the Australian Women's Weekly, Sonia said: 'I even Googled buying a personal ultrasound machine so I could check it at home.' The news was particularly exciting for Kruger's co-host David Campbell, who already has one young son and whose wife Lisa is expecting twins. Kruger joked that she 'felt so sorry for David' because he has to deal with two hormonal pregnant women at home and at work.'

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, warned of the risks of splitting up the giant Government IT project which controls people's tax returns . Plans to split up a giant government computer system holding the tax records of 50 million Britons could end in ‘disaster’, ministers have been warned. The Government wants to split its £10billion tax collecting IT system into 100 separate parts. But MPs fear the ‘Aspire’ system – which collects £500billion of income tax every year, while also processing millions of tax returns, child benefit payments and tax credits – is too important to fiddle with. The giant IT contract, run by the technology company Capgemini for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, has already spiralled out of control with costs almost trebling in ten years, according to the Times newspaper. But MPs are concerned that the plan to split the contract into 100 smaller packages in 2017 could result in chaos. Fears have been raised that private tax information could be lost if the new smaller contracts fail to work together. Richard Bacon, a Tory on the public accounts committee, told the Times: ‘This is one of the biggest IT contracts in the world. ‘There is nothing more critical than getting tax in, and you can’t start relying on hundreds of experimental start-ups taking this over. The potential for another disaster is huge.’ Mr Bacon added: ‘I am a great believer in getting smaller companies in, but if you split the project up into 100 pieces, you need 500 skilled people to manage it. You cannot afford to get this wrong.’ Tom Gash, director of research at the Institute for Government, a think-tank, said there was ‘a big risk that the department may find it all too difficult’. Jim Bligh, the head of public services policy at the CBI, meanwhile, warned that bringing in smaller companies would be difficult for Whitehall to manage. He said: ‘You would need to have a relationship with every one of the contractors and manage the whole contract. That is a very hard thing to do,’ he said. Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the public administration select committee, said: ‘It would be a mistake to run before you can walk. ‘And unless there are people in HMRC with the necessary skills in managing a number of smaller contracts then you will be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire.’ But the Government insisted the new contracts would improve the system. An HMRC spokesman added: ‘We will renew our IT contract within Cabinet Office guidelines and on time. We will continue to improve the performance of the contract over the next three years.’ Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude announced that all Whitehall IT contracts would be limited to £100m to give smaller companies a chance of winning business off the Government . Earlier this year Francis Maude, the Cabinet Office minister, announced that all new IT contracts would be limited to £100 million to allow small and medium-sized companies to compete for government business. A Cabinet Office spokesman said that Aspire was a ‘legacy contract’. The spokesman said: ‘HMRC intends to break this contract into packages, which is entirely in line with our new approach and will ensure competition from the widest possible range of suppliers.’","Ministers want to scrap the £10 billion 'Aspire' IT system used by HMRC .

Parents and disability groups have been outraged by a newsletter that went out to about 50 staff at Calare public school in Orange (pictured), that referred to students with mental health problems as 'morons' The Daily Telegraph reported the head of the school also suggested staff attempting to identify students to participate in a mental health and social skills program look for children with 'two heads” and 'webbed feet'. Principal Christian Cundy (pictured) who sent out a school newsletter that enraged parents and disability groups . The letter also read: 'I will send out a well-scripted letter in week 4 starting off — Have you bred a moron? You might like to access the services of Calare’s new initiative, ‘Operation Nutcase’. Sign on the dotted line or leave your thumbprint if you cannot write.' The principal's comments were condemned and prompted anonymous complaints to the department of education, which resulted in Mr Cundy being forced to apologise. The controversial newsletter at the school was telling staff about an all-day program to be conducted at the school by a professional company. 'If you are a bit of a nut yourself you might want to squeeze in a session between the kids and lie on my couch,' it said. It's believed that jokes, at the expense of children with disabilities or mental health issues, have greatly upset some members of the school community. A department spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: 'the principal appreciates that the material was unacceptable and apologises for any offence it caused.' In the newsletter principal Christian Cundy referred to students who may be bullying victims or have mental health issues as 'morons', 'nut cases' and 'village idiots'. 'He has undertaken not to include any material of this nature in future staff newsletters. He has been formally counselled by the department.' 'The department stresses that the material is contrary to the values of public education and the school’s track record of support for students with disabilities and other learning needs,' they said. The comments have provoked anger amongst disability groups. Autism Advisory and Support Service founder and president Grace Fava told the Daily Telegraph she was angered by the shameful' comments and called for stronger action against the principal. 'You do not joke about this — he is supposedly the head of a school filled with kids who have special needs,' Ms Fava said.","A primary school principal slammed over shocking newsletter .

"By . Sally Lee . and Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . A neurosurgeon who was known to be addicted to cocaine and sex has been deported back to his home country. Dr Suresh Nair, who was linked to the deaths of two prostitutes, was allowed to continue practicing precise surgeries which ruined the lives of some of his trusting patients as he spiralled downhill. The Malaysian-born doctor was later jailed for four years after he pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter and two counts of supplying cocaine, a joint investigation by the ABC and Fairfax has revealed. Nair's permanent residency in Australia was cancelled and he left the country on Tuesday with orders from Immigration Minister Scott Morrison, reported the Daily Telegraph. Scroll down for video . Dr Suresh Nair was allowed to continue working as a neurosurgeon at the Nepean Private Hospital despite the NSW Medical Council being aware of his addiction to cocaine since 2004 . Immigration Minister Scott Morrison ordered Dr Nair be deported to Malaysia . During his negligent stint at the Nepean Private hospital in Sydney's west, Nair caused a life-time of damage to a number of his patients. Carla Downes, who Dr Nair operated on three times, told the ABC that in her second operation Dr Nair operated at the wrong level of her spine, leading to seven years of constant pain and leaving her unable to walk up a flight of stairs. In February 2009, a 23-year-old sex worker, Victoria McIntyre, died of a cocaine overdose after a night at the neurosurgeon's apartment . Another patient, Rhonda Taylor, told Fairfax that her mishandled spinal fusion, performed by Dr Nair in 2009, had 'taken [her] life away'. Their testimonials have come after revelations that the NSW Medical Council and both the private and public Nepean hospitals were aware of Dr Nair's cocaine addiction since 2004, when he was suspended for six weeks after a urine test found traces of cocaine in his system. However the Medical Board deemed it safe to stop performing drug tests on the surgeon in 2008, and despite the Nepean Public Hospital maintaining the former decision to ban him from performing surgeries, their private counterpart allowed him back into the operating theatre. At the time, Dr Nair was spending tens of thousands of dollars on prostitutes and hosting small drug parties in his home, according to the ABC. Even his co-workers, fellow neurosurgeons, began expressing doubts at Dr Nair's ability 'to function as a consultant' at this point, with one person describing his surgical decisions as 'often bizarre', Fairfax reports. In February 2009, a 23-year-old sex worker, Victoria McIntyre, died of a cocaine overdose after a night at the neurosurgeon's apartment. Patients who the Malaysian-born surgeon operated on have revealed they have were left with life-long problems after his surgeries went wrong . Dr Nair was arrested in 2010 following the death of a second escort at his home. 19-year-old Suellen Domingues-Zaupa, died after suffering a cardiac arrest from a cocaine overdose . While the hospital was informed of the incident, the NSW Medical Council was not, and Dr Nair continued to work. Later in the same year, 19-year-old escort Suellen Domingues-Zaupa, also died at Dr Nair's home after suffering a cardiac arrest from a cocaine overdose. Finally, after this incident, Dr Nair was arrested and his medical licence was revoked in 2010.The full media investigation can be seen on Monday at 8:30pm on ABC's Four Corners.","Dr Suresh Nair left the country on Tuesday and was sent back to his native Malaysia .

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . The nephew of former Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home shot himself dead after becoming depressed about his work as a racing journalist, a coroner heard. James Douglas-Home, known to friends and family as Jamie, was found dead in the bedroom of his large country home by his sister, Sarah Dent. An inquest yesterday heard that the former racehorse trainer, who held the title the 28th Baron Dacre, had struggled with depression for two months and had been prescribed medication after seeing his GP and a consultant psychiatrist. Tragedy: Mr Douglas-Home's body was discovered by his sister Sarah at his property in Lockinge, Oxfordshire . Mr Douglas-Home, aged 61 years, whose wife Christine died in 2008, had refused an offer to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital the day before he shot himself, telling a doctor and his daughter he did not feel suicidal and preferred to remain at home. His uncle, Sir Alec, was the 14th Earl of Home and succeeded Harold Macmillan as Prime Minister in October 1963. His father, William, was also a politician and a playwright. He had trained horses in the 1970s and 1980s and wrote a book entitled Horse Racing in Berkshire and numerous magazine articles on the subject. Peter Clark, assistant coroner for Oxfordshire, read evidence from Dr Andrew Allen, Mr Douglas- Home’s GP, which said that the racing journalist had reported feeling tired and suffering from a lack of drive during three appointments in March. James Douglas-Home, the nephew of former prime minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home (pictured) has killed himself at the age of 61 . 'He admitted some concerns about a new book he was writing, which might take a year to research,' said Mr Clark. 'He was concerned he might not be up to it.' Mr Douglas-Home was referred to another GP, Dr Simon Moore, in April and told him he had been 'down in the last two months.' Dr Moore said in a statement: 'He had some thoughts about death but told me he would never actually contemplate doing this.' He was prescribed sleeping tablets and Escitalopram for anxiety after being diagnosed with 'acute depression.' On May 7, Mr Douglas-Home attended the Capio Nightingale Hospital in London with his daughter Emily. Dr Christopher Muller-Pollard, consultant psychiatrist, told the inquest in Oxford that he had been happy and busy with varied work up until Christmas, but this had slowed in February and March. 'He had been commissioned to write a book on horse racing shortly after Christmas and been paid a portion of his fee in advance and was feeling anxiety about being able to fulfil that brief,' he said. 'He told me he was feeling suicidal two days prior to his appointment with me but was no longer feeling suicidal. 'I explained that some anti-depressant medicine could rarely cause an increase in suicidality, but that was more in young people and women.' Dr Muller-Pollard reserved a bed at the hospital and told Mr Douglas-Home it would mean he could 'take a break' for a while, but he refused. 'Jamie reassured me he didn’t need any supervision as he was not currently suicidal. He would prefer to go home,' he said. The inquest heard that, after this was explained to his daughter Emily, Mr Douglas-Home stayed at her home in London that night and appeared well. The next day, Thursday, May 8, he returned to his home in Park Lane, East Lockinge, Wantage, Oxfordshire, and spoke to family friend Penelope Enthoven when she returned his two dogs at 12.30pm. 'I recalled him saying words to the effect of ""Let me say thank you, you’ve been amazing throughout all this"",' she said. Mrs Dent had been due to stay with her brother at his home of 25 years that night and arrived at Didcot train station at 4.50pm, expecting him to pick her up. 'When I arrived and did not see my brother I thought that was strange as he was usually very punctual,' said Mrs Dent, who lives in Ireland. She tried to call his mobile phone and landline several times but got no answer. Concerned, she took a taxi to his home, arriving at 6.30pm. The deceased's father was British playwright William Douglas-Home, left, and his cousin's daughters are Lady Mary and Lady Iona, right, friends of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . She asked the driver, David Craske, to wait as she entered the house through the back door. 'I went upstairs and straight into the bedroom. As soon as I entered I saw Jamie laying there on the bed,' said Mrs Dent. 'It appeared he had shot himself because of the blood all over the bed and wall.' She ran out to Mr Craske, who called the police. Mr Douglas-Home was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. Police found no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement. The shotgun used was one of two legally owned by Mr Douglas-Home. A post-mortem examination gave the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the head. Mrs Dent told the inquest her brother had mentioned he had felt worse after starting his medication and questioned the logic of leaving the decision of whether to admit her brother with him, due to his indecisiveness and mental state. Mr Clark said: 'His apparent preference was to return home. 'It is clear from the statements that there is this issue that you feel slightly worse before you are meant to feel better, which is a very difficult judgement call to make.' Mr Clark recorded a verdict of suicide, adding that the 'catastrophic method' chosen indicated no desire to be discovered and helped.","James Douglas-Home, 61, was found dead in his country home bedroom .

A leading New Zealand fashion designer has sent critics and fans on the warpath after staging a show featuring American Indian feather headdresses. Dame Trelise Cooper has now issued a grovelling apology for featuring the spectacular headdresses in her show as part of New Zealand fashion week, admitting it was a mistake due to her ignorance. Critics took to social media to pan the headdress feature as culturally obnoxious, one asking if it would now be in order to bind Dame Trelise's feet like the Chinese used to do to women in times gone by. Dame Trelise Cooper's Indian headdresses have caused an uproar on social media . Cooper posted an apology on her Facebook page saying she genuinely respected all cultures . In an apology she posted on Facebook, the fashion guru said today that she genuinely respected and honoured all cultures, races and religions. 'It was never my intention to disrespect another culture. 'It is my hope that through my mistake and ignorance, like me, people now know and are aware of the sacredness of the head dress to Native Americans,' she wrote. 'To those who I have offended, I sincerely apologise.' Cooper's apology received a mixed reaction among the hundreds of comments . The headdresses featured in her show as part of the New Zealand fashion week 2014 . The designer's Facebook page has exploded with comments opposed to the Indian theme. 'This is appallingly offensive cultural appropriation. I see you're deleting comments about this too. 'Would love to see some accountability for this - you put it on the runway, you have to defend your poor choices,' Morgan Ashworth posted after Cooper's apology. While other fashion fans didn't perceive the look as offensive and couldn't see what all of the fuss was about. 'This is getting ridiculous, did anyone ever b***h about the Indian dude from The Village People?? I love going to fancy dress parties as an Indian Chief and am looking forward to doing it again in the near future, just to p*** off the over-sensitive clowns that society seems to spew forth on a more than regular basis,' Paul Silva ranted. Moroni Saseve agreed saying: 'these people need to get over themselves. take a chill pill or a kit kat'. Some of the social media users who aren't criticising the designer's choice of fashion headgear . Cooper she made the mistake through her ignorance of the sacredness of the headdress to Native Americans . However, The New Zealand Herald reported that among Dame Trelise's fiercest critics was Melbourne-based lawyer Di White who told the designer in a social media comment that 'Indian headdresses are not yours to wear. 'This is cultural appropriation and super offensive.' Claiming that the show was an attempt to profit off people's hurt, Ms White delivered a further blow by declaring that she had long believed Dame Trelise to be 'the most boring, unimaginative fashion designer in NZ and cheap shots like this just prove it.' Another critic, Rosie Wong, asked whether 'in protest, can we bind your feet like Chinese women did back in the day? Or is breaking your feet not hipster enough? I get so confused these days about what's hot and what's not.' The Herald reported that Dame Trelise said that she had seen feather headdresses worn as a 'fun thing' on her travels in the US and Ibiza recently. In her defence today, Fashion Week managing director Dame Pieter Stewart said on TV3s Firstline that Dame Trelise meant no offence with the garments. 'It was beautiful, to be honest,' she told the program. 'It's a beautiful culture. 'Designers draw their inspiration from all sorts of things and she drew her inspiration obviously from the Indian culture.' It is not the first time Indian headdresses worn by models have created uproar. The French fashion house Chanel raised controversy in December when it used headdresses and American lingerie company Victoria's Secret was forced to apologise after using the garments in 2012. Many fans hit out at Cooper following her apology on her Facbook page .","Dame Trelise Cooper has caused an uproar by featuring Indian feather headdresses in her show at New Zealand fashion week .

Jacob Michael Smith, 38, was tracked to a Gold Coast property less than 24 hours after being named as a person of interest. He was allegedly one of the last people to visit Anthea Mari before the 34-year-old mother of four died at her inner-city Brisbane home early on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Anthea Mari, 34, was found dead in her lounge in 'suspicious circumstances' in Brisbane's south east . Police arrested a 38-year-old man at Gaven at around 10.30am on Wednesday and he was charged with murder on Wednesday night . Smith suffered a dog bite during his dramatic arrest on Wednesday before he was taken to Brisbane's Dutton park police station. He will face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday charged with murder, deprivation of liberty and attempt to murder. Detective Inspector Rod Kemp would not confirm reports the victim was strangled to death before a housemate found her dead. Smith has been described as a 'friend'.

Ms Mari, right, gave advice to other domestic violence sufferers. 'Don't think you're the only one. There are plenty of other women going through it, too,' Ms Mari said . Micah Projects welfare co-ordinator Karyn Walsh said Ms Mari had sought help from the community group before she became an advocate against domestic violence. 'She was a woman with her children who accessed services,' she told AAP. 'Like many women who have been through the fear of domestic violence she was very passionate about wanting to tell other women to seek help.' Staff at Micah Projects who knew Ms Mari are 'deeply saddened and shocked by the way that she died'. 'And mostly for the children that now don't have a mother,' Ms Walsh said. On Tuesday police released this photo of Jacob Michael Smith, 38 . Clearly devoted to her family, Ms Mari's Facebook page is filled with images of her children and shared parenting tips.

The lake's hypnotic patterns are revealed in these incredible photos that show billowing smoke and lava bubbles bursting from its surface. The amazing spectacle in war-torn Democratic Republic of Congo is rarely seen as the conflict means the lake is difficult to reach. These photographs show the incredible formation of a lake filled entirely with lava.

Hidden in the depths of Mount Nyiragongo, climbers must trek to an altitude of nearly 11,400ft (3.47km) to catch a glimpse of the lava lake. Nyiragongo is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, erupting on average every 30 years, according to programmer Mikhail Korostelev.

It is located in Virunga National Park, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, around 12 miles (20 km) north of the town of Goma. Despite being one of the world’s most active volcanoes, Nyiragongo is also one of the least studied. Since 1882, the volcano has erupted at least 34 times. The lava emitted in eruptions at Nyiragongo is often unusually fluid, scientists claim. In 2002, Mount Nyiragongo caused 400,000 people to be evacuated from the city across the Rwandan border into neighbouring Gisenyi. 'We crawled to the edge of the crater and could not believe our eyes - the lava lake existed. 'After it clouded over, we couldn't see anything for the rest of night so we began to descend the following morning after a night in a hut.’ Despite being one of the world’s most active volcanoes, Nyiragongo is also one of the least studied. In 1977 lava shot down the mountain at more than 60 miles an hour (97 km/h), the fastest ever lava flow recorded. Despite the flow hardening before it reached the main part of the city, several hundred people died as a result. In 2002 the volcano released more lava into nearby Goma, obliterating 14,000 homes and forcing 350,000 citizens to be evacuated. 'The lava lake in the crater acts almost constantly and the crater has sheer walls around 328ft (100m) high,’ said Mr Korstelev. 'Therefore it is impossible to get closer without special equipment - so we were about 656ft (200m) away from the lake. 'This is not an eruption but the lava lake is active almost all the time.'

"By . Jaya Narain for the Daily Mail . A schoolgirl who dreamed of becoming a scientist hanged herself after she felt pressurised to study six A-levels, her family said yesterday. Lisa Wilks, 17, desperately wanted to do well when she started the courses last autumn so she could go to a good university. But, an inquest heard, she was stressed and upset in the run-up to sitting 15 exams in her subjects – chemistry, biology, maths statistics, psychology, religious education and general studies. Lisa Wilks, 17 (pictured) hanged herself because she felt under pressure to study six subjects for A-Level . The teenager pictured with her father, Derek, and mother, Christine, died in May last year . The teenager studied at Blackpool Sixth Form College (pictured). Principal Felicity Greeves said: 'The entire College was deeply shocked and saddened by Lisa's death. She was a bright and ambitious student' On the day before her first paper last May, she was found dead by her father Derek, 46, an IT consultant, at the family’s home. Her mother Christine, 55, said in the weeks before, Lisa had spoken of wanting to hang herself as a way of avoiding her exams. Her family, of Thornton Cleveleys, near Blackpool, told how the teenager had felt under pressure to get A or A* grades. Mrs Wilks said: ‘Everything reflects back on the teachers and the institution but it all comes back to the students. Christine Wilks said her daughter 'was very loving and very kind and brought a lot of happiness to everybody' ‘Kids are told they can’t fail. They feel that even a B is not good enough. The adults are driving them and they forget the kids are already clever enough without being pushed further.’ She said Lisa had been put in a class of students at Blackpool Sixth Form College who had all been tipped for places at Oxford or Cambridge. The mother-of-three added that Lisa also felt pressure because she had been allowed to study chemistry despite not achieving high enough GCSE grades. But she took on the massive workload and was coping as best she could, said her mother, a former librarian. She added: ‘The 15 exams were her biggest worry. Lisa Wilks was due to sit 15 A-Level exams as part of her plan to become a scientist . ‘She didn’t want to do it. Having to study for that many A-levels made her very angry. ‘It was the pressure she was under. It was added to as she was a very driven person. She would do everything to the best of her ability.’ At the inquest in Blackpool, Mrs Wilks said: ‘She felt she’d done all she could do and was getting to the point where she was sick of chemistry. A ‘B’ grade would have been good enough for most but not Lisa.’ She said the family had put her daughter’s remarks about suicide down to exam nerves brought on by the pressure she felt under. Lisa Wilks was found dead at the home (pictured) she lived at with her parents Christine, 55, and Derek, 46 . ‘I think she was unhappy at college,’ said Mrs Wilks. ‘We had a discussion saying she didn’t have to be at college. She thought giving it all up would be an admission of failure. All that studying would go to waste. She thought she was stuck.’ Coroner Alan Wilson recorded a verdict of suicide. He said: ‘Clearly there has been reference to her feeling pressure about her exams but there is a lack of evidence to suggest the issue in relation to exams was probably a causative feature.’ College principal Felicity Greeves said: ‘Lisa was a bright and ambitious student who was doing well academically. She impressed all her tutors with her commitment. ‘We have an excellent record of providing pastoral support. Tragically, in Lisa’s case there was no indication she was having any difficulties within college or outside.’ For confidential support in the U.K., contact the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch, seewww.samaritans.org for details.

"By . Belinda Robinson . An illuminated American flag which is attached to the top of a tree in an Idaho park will be left there because officials don’t know how to get it down. The flag was affixed to the top of a tall pine tree in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest near milepost 27 of the I-90 on the Fourth of July Pass in northern Idaho. It is thought that it was put up about a month ago but it is too dangerous to remove, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

However, it is not known how it got there or who put it onto the tree. Mr Kirchner said the agency sent professional tree climbers to remove it but it was so high and attached to such a small part of the tree that it was difficult to get it down.

He added: ‘It's just too dangerous for them. To get up on that skinny part of the tree that high up would just be too risky. ‘Since it's not hurting anything, we are going to leave it up there for now. It's not worth the risk.’ Mr Kirchner said he would prefer that the flag and light be taken down at some point. ‘We applaud and respect this individual's display of patriotism,’ he said. ‘But they did this on public land and we don't want more people putting up displays on public land.’ Mattias Wermke, 35, left, and Mischa Leinkauf, 37, claimed responsibility for the stunt .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Spontaneously moving your hands to illustrate a point can help boost a child's language development, researchers say. Gesture-plus-word combinations can make it easier for children to grasp what certain words and phrases mean - even during sign language. The findings back up previous research which found gesticulating helps youngsters develop their language, learning and cognitive skills. Researchers at the University of Chicago say gestures help children learn (stock image shown). Study says it helps kids develop their language, learning and cognitive skills. Gesture is a flexible way of communicating, one that can work with language to communicate or, if necessary, can itself become language . In 2009, Dr Goldin-Meadow and her team found that boys and girls whose parents gesticulate a lot have bigger vocabularies when they start school. Advocating that parents start talking with their hands, the researchers said that simple gestures from nodding and shaking of the head to indicate yes and no, to flapping of the arms to indicate flying, could make all the difference. The US researchers studied the actions and gestures used by 50 toddlers and their parents as they played together. The researchers said simple gestures such as pointing prompted parents to introduce children to new words. Writing in the journal Science, they said: 'For example, in response to a child's point at a doll, a mother might say ""yes, that's a doll"", thus providing a word for the object that is the focus of the child's attention.' The connection could also be more direct, with gestures allowing children to use their hands practice meanings of words they have difficulty in pronouncing. Encouraging parents and children to talk with their hands could prove to be a cheap and easy way of boosting youngsters' word power and better preparing them for school. 'Talk to your children more, gesture more,' said co-researcher Dr Meredith Rowe. The new study, by Dr Susan . Goldin-Meadow, from the University of Chicago, examined how gesturing contributes to language learning in hearing and in deaf children. She concluded that gesture is a flexible way of communicating, one that can work with language to communicate or, if necessary, can itself become language. 'Children who can hear use gesture along with speech to communicate as they acquire spoken language, ' Dr Goldin-Meadow said. 'Those gesture-plus-word combinations precede and predict the acquisition of word combinations that convey the same notions. 'The findings make it clear that children have an understanding of these notions before they are able to express them in speech.' In addition to children who learned spoken languages, Dr Goldin-Meadow studied children who learned sign language from their parents. She found that they too use gestures as they use American Sign Language. These gestures predict learning, just like the gestures that accompany speech. Finally, Dr Goldin-Meadow looked at deaf children whose hearing losses prevented them from learning spoken language, and whose hearing parents had not presented them with conventional sign language. These children use homemade gesture systems, called homesign, to communicate. Homesign shares properties in common with natural languages but is not a full-blown language, perhaps because the children lack 'a community of communication partners,' Dr Goldin-Meadow writes. Nevertheless, homesign can be the 'first step toward an established sign language.' In Nicaragua, individual gesture systems blossomed into a more complex, shared system when homesigners were brought together for the first time. The gesture learning technique is apparently true for both hearing children and those who sign (research image shown). Gesture-plus-word combinations can make it easier for children to understand what certain words and phrases mean, which makes it easier for them to pick up language more quickly at school . These findings provide insight into gesture's contribution to learning. Gesture plays a role in learning for signers even though sign itself is based around gestures. As a result, gesture cannot aid learners simply by providing a second language. Rather, gesture adds imagery to the categorical distinctions that form the core of both spoken and sign languages. Dr Goldin-Meadow concludes that gesture can be the basis for a self-made language, assuming linguistic forms and functions when other vehicles are not available. But when a conventional spoken or sign language is present, gesture works along with language, helping to promote learning. The study will be published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society .","Chicago study says it helps develop language, learning and cognitive skills .

He has given an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the National Enquirer and revealed that his daughter has not contacted him or responded to his messages in the five years since her freedom . Five years after her dramatic rescue, Jaycee Dugard has still not contacted her biological father, leaving him heartbroken. According to the National Enquirer, Kenneth Slayton, 68, is yet to set eyes on his daughter or his two granddaughters born to Jaycee during her 18 years of captivity at the hands of Phillip Garrido in Antioch, California. Kenneth has begged his estranged daughter to contact him, almost five years to the day she arrived at a parole office in Concord with her two children and Phillip and his wife Nancy. 'I've made myself known to her, so if she elected to see me, she knows where I'm at,' said Kenneth to the National Enquirer. On June 10, 1991, Jaycee, 11, was abducted on her way to catch the school bus in South Lake Tahoe, California. Kenneth told the National Enquirer that he was not made aware of her kidnapping until FBI agents arrived at his home to tell him. A nationwide search was launched for Jaycee, which went unresolved till her sensational return 18-years later. Throughout the intervening years Jaycee was a prisoner in a disgusting makeshift tent on Garrido's property and gave birth to two daughters by him after he repeatedly drugged and raped her. Scroll down for video . Vulnerable: Jaycee Dugard, now 34, has not contacted her biological father according to a new National Enquirer interview . Jaycee was rescued in 2009, when two female police officers became suspicious of Garrido, a convicted rapist, and summoned the family - including Jaycee's two daughters - to a parole meeting. Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life for the kidnap and rape of Miss Dugard. His wife Nancy was sentenced to 36 years to life. Following this, Kenneth claims he tried to contact Jaycee but was ignored at every attempt. 'They cited some back child support,' said Kenneth to the National Enquirer. 'At that point it was like turning the switch off. I said enough is enough.' Failed by the system: Jaycee Dugard was 11 when she was kidnapped by a convicted rapist who was out on bail in California . Staggering: Tarps, tents and a wooden structure are seen in the backyard of alleged kidnapper Phillip Garrido August 28, 2009 in Antioch, California. Jaycee Lee Dugard was allegedly kidnapped by Phillip Garrido nearly two decades ago and was forced to live in tents and sheds behind Garrido's home with two of her children that were fathered by Garrido . Now 34, Jaycee lives with her 16 and 20-year-old daughters away from the public eye in California and appeared to accept a heroism award from Oprah Winfrey in March 2013. 'It would be very nice to have a big family reunion,' said Kenneth's wife, Jamie. 'Jaycee has three sisters and a brother and we would like to open our arms to her.' Over the past five years, Jaycee has given interviews recalling the horror she faced as Garrido's prisoner. In an emotional 2011 interview, Jaycee fought off tears as she described the overwhelming feeling of hope after giving birth to a baby girl in her kidnappers squalid back yard. At only 14, little Jaycee had already been a prisoner of predatory pedophile Garrido for three years by the time she gave birth in August 1994. Speaking to ABC's Diane Sawyer, Jaycee described the traumatic, but ultimately uplifting effect the birth of her first child had on her frightened 14-year-old self. Locked up: Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy are serving 431 years and . 36 years respectively for abducting Jaycee and hiding her in the . backyard of their home. Jaycee had two children by Phillip Garrido . Held: Garrido, a registered sex offender, kept Jaycee Dugard at his Antioch home, pictured, for 18 years . Describing the birth as 'painful', Jaycee said: 'But then I saw her,she was beautiful. 'I felt like I wasn't alone any more. I had somebody who was mine. 'I wasn't alone.' Jaycee continued: 'And I knew I could never let anything happen to her. 'I didn't know how I was going to do that, but I did.' Mrs Sawyer, clearly struggling to form her next question, told Jaycee: 'I am trying to imagine what it is like.' Jaycee, confidently answered: 'I don't know, I can't imagine being beaten to death, and you can't imagine being kidnapped and raped. 'You just do what you have to do to survive.' Bravery: Jaycee Dugard, right, who was abducted as a child and held for 18 years, and her mother, Terry Probyn, appear with their Hope Award at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children annual Hope Awards in Washington in 2013 and (right) Jaycee appears with Oprah Winfrey in March of 2013 . When she was finally found in August 2009, Miss Dugard couldn't bring herself to tell police her own name, because she hadn't said it in 18 years. Ever since she was discovered in 2009, Miss Dugard has fiercely guarded her privacy. During the broadcast, Miss Dugard describes how Garrido abducted her, shooting her with a stun gun and pulling her into his car before driving her to his home in Antioch, California. She tells Ms Sawyer how she can remember her hand closing on her sticky pine cone as she was dragged away. Her captivity finally came to an end on August 25, 2009, when Garrido, a convicted sex offender, was ordered to bring his daughters to a parole meeting.","Kenneth Slayton, 68, wants to speak to his daughter, who was kidnapped in 1991 aged 11 .

The 29-year-old wombat is believed to be the oldest recorded wombat living in captivity in the world as they usually live up to 5 years in the wild and 20 years in captivity. Patrick, the world's oldest and largest wombat, celebrated his 29th birthday on Tuesday . Weighing in at 38 kilograms, Patrick was most commonly known for greeting his visitors in the car park in his wheelbarrow back in his younger days, to which he has now retired from this duty and lives in his pen. The cuddly animal was orphaned as a baby before he was taken in and hand raised by the owners of the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria. Known as one of the park's longest members, the team have tried releasing Patrick back into the wild a couple of times but he couldn't defend himself against other wombats. Weighing in at 38 kilograms, Patrick is believed to be the oldest wombat living in captivity in the world . Tourism Australia took to Facebook to wish Patrick the wombat a happy birthday on Tuesday . The park’s social media manager Lauren Rix said: ‘We always knew that Patrick was a very special wombat, but the huge social media response that he has received this week is incredible. 'Since Tourism Australia posted about Patrick, his Facebook page has grown by over 4,500 new followers and he has attracted the attention of television news media,' she said. 'It’s safe to say that his birthday this year will be extended into a week of celebrations here at Ballarat Wildlife Park.' He looks good fur his age! He has been hand raised by the owners of the Ballarat Wildlife Park in Victoria Australia . Despite his age celebrations and fame, Tourism Australia also posted that Patrick has never had children or any female wombats in his love life. Facebook users speculated that Patrick's single status may have contributed to his longevity. Andrew Bufton posted on the birthday message: 'Hence why he's lived so long! No GF's!' Pascal van Turenhout added: 'Thats proof women do take years of your life...' And Tasha McAuley said: 'Haha maybe the fact he hasn't had any kids or a partner is why he has lived for so long.'

Children as young as six have a better understanding of modern technology than most 45-year-olds, a study has found. From smartphones and tablet computers, to 3D printers and smart glasses, hi-tech advances over the past decade have left older generations unable to keep up with the youngsters in their family. A survey by communications watchdog Ofcom found teenagers aged 14 and 15, who were born at the turn of the millennium, and have therefore lived with broadband internet all their lives, are the most confident with technology. Young adults now spend more than three and a half hours on their smartphones every day, nearly three times longer than the national average. And even primary school children are more confident at using the latest devices than their parents. More than 60 per cent of adults over 55 admitted they struggle with new technology. Ofcom said the future of media and digital communications are now being shaped by the ‘millennium generation’ for whom slow ‘dial-up’ internet connections are a relic of history. Those aged eight have never known a world without social networking sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. At the same time many older people are still learning to use email. Ofcom asked 2,800 Britons to fill in an in-depth questionnaire about their knowledge of new technology and ability to use different devices. Researchers scored each age group on their digital confidence, with the average UK adult achieving a ‘digital quotient’ mark of 100. The survey found six-year-olds had a score of 98, rising to 113 in the 14 to 15 age group. Meanwhile 45-year-olds scored only 96 points, dropping to 80 among the over-75s. More than 84 per cent of youngsters aged between 12 and 15 claimed they would not know how to live without the latest technology. Although older generations are being outstripped by youngsters, they are still buying tablet computers in increasing numbers. Almost a third of over-55s now own a tablet device, up from just 11 per cent last year. However, just 14 per cent of over 65s own a smartphone, compared with almost nine in ten of 16 to 24-year-olds. Ofcom also found that teenagers no longer use traditional phone calls to communicate, instead preferring to use written messages on social media, instant messaging via the internet or text messages. Those aged 12 to 15 spend just three per cent of their time on the phone, compared with 20 per cent for adults. Comfort zone: A survey by Ofcom found teenagers aged 14 and 15, who were born at the turn of the millennium, and have therefore lived with broadband internet all their lives, are the most confident with technology . Jane Rumble, head of media research and intelligence at Ofcom, said the results could signal the demise of telephones because the younger generation ‘loses its voice’ and opts for more impersonal forms of communication. Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards added: ‘Our research shows that a “millennium generation” is shaping communications habits for the future. While children and teenagers are the most digitally savvy, all age groups are benefitting from new technology. The convenience and simplicity of smartphones and tablets are helping us cram more activities into our daily lives.’ █ Nearly half of adults now check their work emails out of office hours, Ofcom has found. The spread of smartphones and broadband internet means more of us are taking work home with us than ever before. One in ten adults said they read or send work emails or texts while in bed, while a third have made work-related calls, emails or texts on holiday. Another 10 per cent admitted to working on the beach. Some 60 per cent admitted sending personal texts during work hours, while one in five do their shopping online while in the office. As many as a quarter of workers believe technology has improved their work-life balance, with just 15 per cent saying it has made it worse.","Ofcom study finds teens of 14 and 15 are most confident with technology .
