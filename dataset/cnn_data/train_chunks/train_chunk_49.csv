"(CNN)  -- Everything will glow -- the balloons, the table cloths, the blue martinis and the party favors. The red carpet will turn blue. Even the female impersonators will be painted -- you guessed it -- blue. The first 50 guests will be given bright blue boas. There will be seven high-definition projection screens, and the winner of the trivia competition will win a massive, crystal-bedazzled Hpnotiq bottle. All-in-all, Edward Gisiger says, it's going to be one great Oscar party. Gisiger is the owner of the Kit Kat Lounge and Supper Club in Chicago, Illinois. Every year the Kit Kat throws an elaborate themed party on Oscar night. This year they've chosen to transform the club into ""The Land of Avatar,"" complete with Kit Kat diva Aurora Sexton playing the role of warrior princess Neytiri. ""This is one of the best years of Hollywood ever because of 'Avatar,' so there's a real reason to celebrate,"" Gisiger said. With 10 best picture nominees, there are plenty of themes to choose from. But planning that party can be stressful and time consuming. CNN talked to Gisiger and other party-throwers to provide dos and don'ts for an award-worthy night. Don't wait until Sunday . Mary Johnson and her friend Carolyn Mueller in Dayton, Ohio, held a ""Julie & Julia"" dinner party in December. The pair started prepping their individual ingredients on Tuesday, met on Wednesday to combine portions and baked early on Thursday to get all the dishes ready for Thursday night. ""Prepare as much of the food ahead of time so you can enjoy the party,"" Johnson recommends. ""You also don't want to try new recipes out on a party. Choose recipes you feel comfortable with."" First season ""Top Chef"" host and cookbook writer Katie Lee offers the same advice. ""It is important to be able to enjoy your party just as much as your guests. Don't keep yourself too occupied in the kitchen so you can join in on the fun. Put out a food and drink buffet to make it easier to serve."" Do make it interactive . Johnson and Mueller dressed up in old-school aprons, chef hats and pearls. Gisiger says this is a great way to get guests involved in the theme, especially if you offer them prizes for being creative. Lee recommends creating ballot games and trivia to entertain guests in between watching category announcements at the Academy Awards show. Do set the mood . Although Gisiger's budget may be a bit bigger than yours, his club's glowing blue atmosphere should inspire you. ""I think there are so many things you can do from home. It's just a way of being creative and making it different from others,'"" the club owner said. Gisiger suggests having a signature drink that follows the theme of the party, similar to his ""Avatar Princess"" martini made with vodka, Cognac and pineapple juice -- with a glow stick, of course. Stacy Suzuki attended another ""Julie & Julia"" party in Hawaii where the host had guests bring a dish from Julia Child's cookbook. The recipes were on display and the dining table was set with lines from France. A French cooking DVD played in the background. ""A part-French poodle was running around the house wearing a doggie t-shirt made in Paris,"" she said. Lee, also the Moet & Chandon spokeswoman, said you can offer your guests the same cocktail the stars are drinking on the red carpet and at the Governor's Ball -- Moet Golden Glamour. Or bring the fashion world to your party by making it black tie optional and place digital cameras around the room to capture paparazzi shots, Lee suggested. Whatever you do, ""don't keep the glamour to a minimum."" Don't have guests leave empty-handed . Suzuki's host created a full menu using all of Julia Child's recipes. When the guests left, the host had copies of the recipes available to take home. The gift bags at the Kit Kat Lounge will include that blue boa, a glowing heart-shaped necklace and a T-shirt. But most important, Gisiger says, is that guests leave feeling recharged. ""It's a fun way to escape,"" Gisiger said about both the party and movies in general. ""That's kind of what we focus on.""","With 10 best picture nominees, it's easy to pick a great theme for an Oscar party .

"(CNN) -- Days ahead of national elections, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has announced plans to rehire 20,000 former Iraqi army officers who served under former leader Saddam Hussein. The officers will be reinstated into the new Iraqi army, said an official with the ministry of defense. The move garnered criticism as being a political ploy and was surprising in some circles after al-Maliki's campaign rhetoric against Hussein's Baath Party. Several candidates who planned to stand in the upcoming election have been banned by the country's Accountability and Justice Commission because of evidence of them ""glorifying"" the Baath Party. Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said al-Maliki was simply trying to secure more votes. ""This contradicts his anti-Baathist election campaign and it is very obvious that he wants to appeal to voters."" A few weeks after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, top U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer dissolved Baathist institutions, including the Iraqi army, that were viewed as threats against building a new Iraqi society. The Baath Party was declared illegal and many Sunni Arabs lost their government jobs. As a result, the Sunni Arab community became disenfranchised -- many embraced the rising insurgency and stayed away from the first elections in 2005. The tensions led to pitched battles between Shiites and Sunni Arabs in the streets of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities. Over the years, the United States has worked to get on the good side of the Sunni Arabs, bring them into the country's new political culture, and persuade them to accept the new Iraq. In a separate development, a member of an al Qaeda in Iraq cell responsible for several dozen assassinations in and around Baghdad has been arrested, the U.S. military said. Iraqi security forces seized the militant in a rural area about 38 kilometers, or almost 24 miles, southwest of the capital. The cell is believed to have conducted nearly 50 assassinations. The arrest occurred ahead of Iraq's March 7 national elections, and the military says intelligence reports indicate that the al Qaeda in Iraq fighters ""are increasingly staging politically motivated assassinations"" to undermine the Iraqi government and the upcoming polls. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Iraq to hire thousands of former soldiers who worked under Saddam Hussein .

"(CNN)  -- Iceland's voters overwhelmingly rejected a deal to pay billions of dollars it owes to the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, the Foreign Ministry said Sunday. With around 90 percent of votes counted, just over 93 percent said no and just under 2 percent said yes. Not enough votes remain to be counted to change the result. Some 62.5 percent of Iceland's roughly 200,000 register voters cast ballots, the ministry said. The referendum was on a law about repaying the Netherlands and UK, which helped savers in their own countries who lost money in a failed Icelandic Internet bank. The British and Dutch governments came up with more than $5 billion for bailing out people who lost money in Icesave -- an online retail bank branch of Landsbanki. That Icelandic bank failed in October 2008, along with two other banks in the country. Under a European Union directive, Iceland now owes compensation to Britain and the Netherlands. The Icelandic government has said it will honor its international obligations. Iceland's parliament passed a bill authorizing a state guarantee for repayment of the funds, but President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson declined to sign it in January. He cited public disapproval, and in particular, an Internet petition signed by up to one-quarter of the electorate, as a reason for not signing the bill. He said there needed to be a national consensus in addressing the issue. That prompted Saturday's national referendum on the law. The Icelandic public widely disapproved of the deal, the government said in a fact sheet on the deal. ""There is widespread frustration over the claim on ordinary citizens in Iceland to pay the price for the irresponsible behavior of reckless bankers,"" it said. Magnus Arni Skulason, who campaigned against the bill, called the terms of the loan repayment unacceptable. ""Of course we feel empathy for those people that lost money,"" he said Saturday while voting was going on. ""We just want to get a more reasonable agreement,"" he told CNN. It is not clear what happens now that voters have said no to the loan guarantees. The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November, and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan. Iceland has begun moves toward applying for European Union membership, which Britain and the Netherlands could block. Britain spent £2.3 billion ($3.69 billion) last year to cover the losses that British savers incurred when Icelandic banks collapsed. The Dutch government spent €1.3 billion ($1.87 billion) to cover bank losses in the country. The Icelandic government said it has ""clearly stated its intention to honor its international obligations and remains fully committed to implementing the bilateral loan agreements with the UK and the Netherlands.""","UK, Dutch governments bailed out their savers hit by collapse of Icelandic banks .

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- A Spanish court Wednesday convicted five men accused of Islamic terrorist activities that included aiding fugitives from the Madrid train bombings of 2004 and planning other attacks. The five men include three Moroccans, an Algerian and a Turk. Their sentences, on charges of collaborating or belonging to an Islamic terrorist group, range from five to nine years in prison, according to a copy of the court order viewed by CNN. The court acquitted four other defendants, all Moroccans, on similar charges. ""During the years 2004 and 2005, the group provided cover and economic support and facilitated the flight from Spain for individuals who had roles"" in the train bombings, the court said. The group was based in a Barcelona suburb, Santa Coloma de Gramenet, before police made arrests in June 2005, officials said. Some in the group also were involved in trafficking in weapons or explosives, or preaching violence for indoctrination of new militants, ruled a three-judge panel at Spain's high-security National Court. The Madrid train bombings -- coordinated attacks on four morning-rush commuter trains -- killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800. Spanish courts previously had convicted 14 Islamic militants for their roles in the train bombings. Among them were four Spaniards convicted of trafficking in the explosives used in the attacks.","Spanish court convicts five men of Islamic terrorist activities that included aiding fugitives from Madrid train bombings .

"(CNN)  -- Embattled former Detroit, Michigan, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was released from jail early Tuesday. Kwame Kilpatrick appears for his sentencing October 28, 2008, in Detroit, Michigan. Kilpatrick, his beard overgrown and bushy, was escorted out of Michigan's Wayne County jail as he dodged a crowd of reporters before getting into a car and was driven away, according to television footage from CNN affiliate WXYZ. Kilpatrick spent 100 days in jail as part of a plea agreement connected to a sex scandal that rocked Detroit and caused the city council and governor of Michigan to push to impeach him. Kilpatrick also agreed not to run for public office during his five years of probation. He was expected to immediately leave the state for a job interview, WXYZ reported. Kilpatrick pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case. He was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up the affair.","Kwame Kilpatrick spent 100 days in jail as part of a plea agreement .

"Editor's Note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Colombian tailor Miguel Caballero specializes in making garments that enable the wearer to get shot at point-blank range with nary an injury besides, maybe, a bruised ego. At-high-risk-of-catching-a-bullet demographics, such as rappers and politicians all over the world, rely on Miguel's handiwork. And, lucky me, when I was recently in Bogota for VBS.TV covering a few stories, I had the chance to visit Miguel's shop, learn about his protective clothing, and get shot in the gut by him. Seriously. Upon arriving at Miguel's warehouse one sunny morning, I received a guided tour from a friendly office assistant. It all seemed totally benign -- sweet middle aged ladies stitching together jackets and blazers, smiling at me as I walked by. I could've been at American Apparel's Southern California warehouse. But when I sat down with Miguel and he got into the whole spiel about why he made the type of clothing he did, nervousness started to set in. Was this guy seriously going to put a thin jacket on me and then shoot me with a real live handgun? The man is running a multimillion-dollar international business. Is he really so confident in his wares that he's going to risk it all by potentially killing a novice American journalist on camera? The answer was yes. But first he had to finish telling me about himself. Miguel explained his business model to me, and it was hard to dispute the logic. The world's an increasingly dangerous place for political leaders and citizens alike. Miguel is simply combining the need for safety with the natural desire to look good. Watch more videos from around the globe on VBS.TV . And judging by his success, I'm not the only one who gets it. There were rumors that President Obama wore some of Miguel's goods during his inauguration. Plus, look at the automobile industry. Not long ago, Hummers were the province of soldiers in combat. Today, they're a staple of suburban strip malls. How long until Miguel's pieces follow suit? By this point, Miguel seemed very determined to prove the reliability of his products to me. I figured it would be somewhat staged: I'd sign something, be ushered into a safe room, and he'd fire a couple blanks into some military grade flak jacket. Thanks and good night. Instead, my new buddy Miguel popped the question mid-interview in his office. And it wasn't really a question. I believe he said, ""Now we'll do a demonstration with you."" Not exactly a request. He stood up from his desk, opened a drawer, and casually pulled out a .38. This was happening very fast. He moved me over to the side of the room, outfitted me with some noise-reducing headphones, and offered me a black suede jacket. After instructing me to take a deep breath on ""1"" and prepare for a gunshot on ""3,"" he shot me in the gut on ""2."" Obviously I lived to tell the tale. But -- most importantly -- I like to think that I looked damn good doing it.","Colombian tailor makes fashionable bulletproof clothing .

"(CNN) -- Talk about a hefty baggage fee: . For months now I have not been able to get the $27,100 suitcase out of my mind. The economy is rocky. People are out of work. Yet the $27,100 suitcase exists. It's not a joke. At first I thought it was. Last fall I was traveling through Naples, Florida, and a cover line on a glossy local magazine caught my eye. The magazine was called Gulfshore Life, and the cover line said: . ""The $58,000 brooch... The $27,100 suitcase... Check Out Our Luxury File."" Perhaps, I thought, this was a teaser to a satirical story using literary exaggeration to whistle past the graveyard of America's fiscal hard times. But when I flipped open the magazine, the feature seemed to be serious. The $27,100 suitcase, the story said, was sold by Hermès, the luxury retailer, which has a store in Naples. The suitcase was called the Hector, and was ""constructed of Officier canvas with Evercalf calfskin."" I closed the magazine, but could not stop thinking about the suitcase. A suitcase is something that gets banged around. It sits out in the rain and snow on airport runways. Baggage handlers toss it roughly onto conveyer belts. Sometimes it gets lost on flights. Why would anyone pay $27,100 for a suitcase? Weighty and important matters dominated the news. But there it was, always in the back of my mind: the suitcase, and the parallel world of wealth it represented. Over the holidays, I was in New York City. One morning I walked to the Hermès store at the corner of 62nd Street and Madison Avenue. I took a deep breath and walked in. ""May I help you?"" a clerk asked. ""I'd like to see the $27,000 suitcase,"" I said. (I shaved $100 off the price; the phrase sounded smoother that way.) ""Which bag specifically?"" she said. ""You have more than one that costs that much?"" I said. ""There was one that cost $200,000,"" she said. ""It featured diamonds."" ""Why would someone spend that kind of money on a suitcase?"" I said. ""Hand-stitching,"" she said. ""Sometimes exotic material."" She looked around, as if to be certain no one was listening, then half-whispered: . ""I use my Samsonite."" She said that the $27,100 suitcase was not, on that day, on floor display. I left New York, still mulling: How could a person take such a suitcase on a trip? It would be like putting a baggage tag on $27,100 in cash. At Midway Airport in Chicago, I went in the slush and slop to Southwest Airlines' curbside baggage-check area to commiserate with my baggage-handler friends there. I told them the story. I would like to report their response, but it was so cold outside, and they were so bundled up head to toe, that all I could discern was their muffled laughter. In recent days I was in southwest Florida again. This time I went to the Hermès store there, in the elegant Waterside Shops outdoor mall. ""I'm interested in the $27,000 suitcase,"" I said to the first clerk I saw. She absolutely beamed, and I immediately realized she had mistaken my intentions. ""No,"" I said. ""No. I don't want to buy it."" The wattage of her smiled dimmed a bit. She said I would have to give her more information about the product; she said some specially made Hermès bags sold for $40,000 or $50,000. ""The people who pay that much for a bag usually fly on jets,"" she said. ""Most people fly on jets,"" I said. She gave me a don't-be-dense look. ""Oh,"" I said, surmising that, in these circles, ""jets"" was a synonym for ""private jets."" Back in my hotel room, I called Hermès' U.S. corporate headquarters. There, a spokeswoman, Bernice Kwok-Gabel, said that for many customers, only the best that money can buy will do. ""They want the finest,"" she said. ""No compromises."" She said that for people who might spend $27,000 on a work of art, $27,000 for a suitcase is not excessive. ""If they want it, the price is not a big concern."" She said that the $27,100 Hector suitcase is actually a twinned piece of luggage: two compartments carried by a single handle. For a customer on a tight budget, a single Hector compartment can be bought by itself. For $14,000. I ended my quest where it began: at Gulfshore Life magazine, where I had seen the original mention. I called the editor-in-chief, David Sendler, to ask if he thought his readers had greeted the item about the suitcase with a shake of the head. ""Some probably did,"" he said. ""But I'm sure there were others who saw it and thought: 'I'd like to have that bag.' We have a very high-demographic readership."" I will leave you with this thought. At that Hermès store in New York, I asked the clerk why someone would pay so much for a suitcase that would inevitably get scuffed and scratched in transit. ""Some people buy metal cases in which to enclose their suitcases,"" she said. She saw the disbelief in my eyes, smiled, and said: . ""They buy suitcases for their suitcases."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene saw an ad for a $27K suitcase and thought it was a joke .
Even in difficult economic times, extravagant luxury goods are for sale, he says .
He asks why people would pay so much for an item that gets jostled around and endures all weather ."
"(CNN) -- Shoe prints left behind at the scene of several church fires in east Texas, as well as surveillance tapes and witness accounts, led police to two men now charged in one blaze and suspected in a string of others, according to court documents. Jason Robert Bourque, 19, and Daniel George McAllister, 21, are charged with one count of arson each in connection with a February 8 fire at Dover Baptist Church in Tyler, Texas. The blaze was one of 10 church fires in east Texas this year. Nine have been ruled arson, and authorities have said they believe Bourque and McAllister are responsible for them. Both men appeared in court Monday in Tyler and are being held on $10 million bond. A federal law enforcement source told CNN that multiple pieces of evidence have been linked to one of the suspects through DNA, and that many of the fires were ignited the same way. A resident called 911 at 8:45 p.m. after seeing smoke rising from the sanctuary at Dover Baptist Church, according to probable cause affidavits. As firefighters battled the blaze, a second fire was reported at 9:44 p.m. at Clear Spring Missionary Baptist Church in Lindale, Texas, about 15 miles northwest of Tyler. At Dover Baptist, someone apparently kicked in a rear door and threw a rock through a window, according to the affidavits. A Red Wing brand boot print was found on the door. It's the same brand of boot that authorities believe left prints at previous church fires and attempted church break-ins in three counties. A print from a Skechers shoe also was found at several fire and attempted break-in locations, the affidavits said. Police obtained a surveillance tape from a gas station near Dover Baptist, the documents said. ""Subsequent review of this video revealed individuals known ... as Jason Robert Bourque and Daniel George McAllister were present at said location close to the same time the fire at Dover Baptist Church was discovered."" A second surveillance tape, from a store near Clear Spring Missionary Baptist, shows someone police believe is Bourque walking inside at about 10:35 p.m., according to the affidavit. Witnesses told police they saw a dark blue or purple four-door car parked next to the Clear Spring Church before the fire. A second sighting of such a car was reported on the same road where the church is located, the documents said. One witness said he saw the driver was a white male wearing a T-shirt and tried to flag him down, but the vehicle sped away. On February 11, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives contacted Bourque at his Lindale home, following up on a tip they received that he was involved in several of the church arsons, the affidavit said. Bourque agreed to talk with authorities, and they checked his blue 2008 Ford Focus, the documents said. The affidavits do not divulge what, if anything, Bourque told the agents. While agents were at Bourque's home, his grandmother backed out of the garage and left the door open. The agents saw a muddy pair of Skechers shoes inside, the affidavit said. Agents believe the sole pattern on the shoes is consistent with the prints found near the churches. Authorities contacted a member of McAllister's family, who told them he wears a size 13 or 14 boot, the documents said. A family member was shown a Red Wing boot and said the sole was the same as McAllister's, except his boots were more worn. The relative took McAllister to the Greyhound Bus Station in Dallas, Texas, on February 10 where he purchased a one-way ticket to San Antonio, Texas, the affidavit said. McAllister was arrested in San Antonio. Authorities have given no information on a motive for the fires.","Jason Bourque, Daniel McAllister charged with arson in connection with church fire .

"(CNN) -- Philanthropist and billionaire businessman Ted Turner will receive 88 disease-free bison from Yellowstone National Park, Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks confirmed Tuesday. The bison, which were facing slaughter, will be transferred for breeding to Turner's ""Green Ranch,"" west of Bozeman, Montana, from a quarantine facility. ""The Green Ranch emerged as the best option we have for these bison right now,"" said Ken McDonald, said the state agency's wildlife bureau chief in Helena, Montana. ""It gives us time to evaluate the social and biological factors that will come into play as we begin to plan for the future of bison management in Montana."" For several years, the bison were quarantined and spared from slaughter after concerns about brucellosis disease, an infectious disease caused by contact with animals carrying the bacteria called brucella. All quarantined bison delivered to Turner's property, along with 25 percent of their offspring, will be returned to the state wildlife agency at the conclusion of the agreement, which will last up to five years, the release said. Turner Enterprises' Green Ranch proposal describes 12,000 acres of suitable habitat, excellent handling facilities, years of experience with bison and secure living space for the animals. The ranch also will participate in continued disease testing and monitoring conducted by state and federal officials, the release said. According to the Turner Enterprises Inc. Web site, Turner, who founded CNN in 1980, is the largest individual landowner in North America with an estimated 2 million acres. His Western properties consist of 15 ranches in seven states. His bison herd is about 50,000 animals, making it the largest private herd in the world, his Web site said.","Turner will get 88 disease-free bison to use for breeding .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Corey Haim was the ""poster child"" for the problem of addicts ""doctor shopping"" for dangerous drugs, California's top law enforcement official said Tuesday. Investigators found that the former child actor was supplied with prescriptions for five controlled substances by seven doctors in the last 10 weeks of his life, Attorney General Jerry Brown said. ""Corey Haim actually obtained 553 dangerous drugs in just this year, as late as five days before he died,"" Brown told reporters at a news conference in Los Angeles. The drugs included Vicodin, Valium, Soma, Oxycontin and Xanax, Brown said. The coroner has not yet ruled on what killed Haim, 38, who died last month after collapsing at the Los Angeles apartment he shared with his mother. Toxicology lab results are expected to be available this month for Haim, who battled drug addiction for decades. Haim visited several emergency rooms and urgent care clinics with complaints of an injured shoulder or depression issues, according to Sara Simpson, head of the state task force investigating doctor shopping. Los Angeles County Deputy Coroner Ed Winter revealed last month that Haim obtained drugs using prescriptions written under the names of 20 Los Angeles doctors in the past year. The coroner subpoenaed medical records from those doctors. Haim also obtained at least one prescription of Oxycontin through the use of an illegally obtained prescription pad, Brown said. State agents arrested one person last month in connection with what Brown said was a massive drug ring that obtained and sold the counterfeit doctor's pads. Although Haim battled drug addiction for decades, his manager said his death came when Haim ""was making major progress"" with a program to wean him from pills. Still, Haim sometimes threatened to find other doctors to prescribe him drugs when his primary physician wouldn't give him what he wanted, manager Mark Heaslip said Monday. ""I would be the only one who could talk him out of it,"" Heaslip said Monday night. His doctor was providing pills only in one-day supplies in an effort to wean him, Heaslip said. Haim's primary care doctor would constantly follow up with urgent care centers that he believed were writing prescriptions for Haim, Heaslip said. The doctor later gave the information to investigators, he said. Simpson confirmed to CNN that Haim's doctor was helping investigators. Haim had a prescription for the muscle relaxer Soma and the narcotic pain reliever Norco filled at a pharmacy February 26, a source with knowledge of the transaction told CNN. Two days after Haim picked up the drugs, his primary care doctor called the San Fernando Valley pharmacy to ask about the prescriptions, the source said. An autopsy revealed that Haim suffered from pneumonia, an enlarged heart and water in his lungs when he collapsed March 10, Winter said. Heaslip said he and Haim's family are convinced his death was not from a drug overdose, but was perhaps a bad reaction to a single pill he took in the hours before his death. The pills, prescribed by an addiction specialist, came with a warning that they should not be taken by someone with a heart condition or flulike symptoms, both of which Haim had, Heaslip said. ""This kid was making major progress,"" Heaslip said. His manager said that if Haim was cheating on his addiction program, he would probably not have admitted it to him since he would have dropped Haim as a client. Haim began his acting career in 1982, with his first television appearance on the Canadian series ""The Edison Twins."" His first film role was in the 1984 American movie ""First Born."" Haim also won rave reviews for his title role in the 1986 film ""Lucas."" Film critic Roger Ebert said of him at the time, ""If he continues to act this well, he will never become a half-forgotten child star, but will continue to grow into an important actor."" His most famous role was in the 1987 movie ""The Lost Boys,"" in which Haim played a fresh-faced teenager whose brother becomes a vampire. In recent years, the actor was reunited with longtime friend and frequent co-star Corey Feldman in a reality show. ""The Two Coreys"" ran for two seasons on the A&E Network before it was canceled.","Corey Haim obtained 553 drugs in last year of his life, AG says .

"New York (CNN) -- A human skull and crossbones, valued at up to $20,000, won't appear at a Christie's auction Friday after another party claimed rights to the remains, the auction house announced. Yale University's secret Order of Skull and Bones used the skull and crossbones as a ballot box, Christie's said in its advertisement of the item in an auction catalogue. The auction house estimates the 19th century ballot box is worth between $10,000 and $20,000. The skull, crossbones and accompanying book of Skull and Bones members between 1832 and 1877 were ""withdrawn from sale due to a title claim,"" Christie's said in a statement Friday. The global auctioneer did not say who claimed rights to the items. Earlier this month, the World Archaeological Congress condemned the sale, calling the sale of human body parts an ""affront to human dignity."" The group also suggested the skull might be that of a Native American and thus be subject to federal laws protecting Native American remains. This isn't the first time Skull and Bones has been entangled in a debate over human remains. The great-grandson of famed Chiricahua Apache warrior Geronimo sued Skull and Bones last year, claiming the society had Geronimo's remains. Historians disagreed on whether the society had ever dug up Geronimo's grave. The collegiate society has existed since 1832 and has prominent alumni such as former President George W. Bush and his grandfather, Sen. Prescott Bush.","Another party claims rights to human skull and crossbones valued at up to $20,000 .

"Jerusalem (CNN)  -- Israeli authorities discovered and disarmed an explosive barrel Wednesday, the third to wash up on an Israeli beach this week, the Israel Defense Forces said. The barrel was found Wednesday afternoon at Palmachim beach south of Tel Aviv. On Monday, Islamic Jihad, the Fatah Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade and the Nasser Salah A din Brigades issued a leaflet in Gaza claiming responsibility for sending three explosive devices to the coastal cities Ashkelon and Ashdod. The other two barrels packed with explosives -- one found at Ashkelon and one at Ashdod -- were discovered Monday and disposed of. In response, the IDF said, the Israeli Air Force attacked ""two Hamas terrorist targets"" in southern Gaza. ""One of the targets was a terror tunnel, used for the infiltration of terrorists into Israel, while the other was used for smuggling of weapons. Direct hits were identified,"" the IDF said. Hamas, the movement controlling Gaza, has been vowing retaliation against Israel since one of the founding members of its military wing, Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, died last week in Dubai. Al-Mabhouh's brother, Fayek al-Mabhouh, said that preliminary results of Hamas' investigation of the death showed his brother was killed by electrocution and strangulation with a piece of cloth. Hamas officials accused Israel of assassinating Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. Israeli officials have not responded to that allegation.","Various Islamic groups issue a leaflet in Gaza claiming responsibility for sending devices .

"(CNN) -- A former foreign minister claimed to be in control of an interim government in Kyrgyzstan early Thursday after a wave of protests that left at least 40 dead and appeared to have driven President Kurmanbek Bakiev from office. ""We must restore a lot of things that have been wrongly ruled,"" said Roza Otunbayeva, who called herself the country's interim leader. No independent confirmation of the claim was immediately available. The U.S. State Department said earlier that it believed Bakiev remained in power, but Otunbayeva said he had fled Bishkek, the capital, and his government had resigned after a day of clashes between anti-government protesters and police. Are you there? Share your story, photos and video . A senior State Department official told CNN late Wednesday that the situation in Kyrgyzstan remains ""very fluid and fast moving,"" and declined to comment on reports that the government had collapsed or that the president had left the country. The official, who insisted on anonymity because of the quickly changing situation, said the United States had been in contact with both members of the government and the opposition. The United States is encouraging all sides to work toward resolution according to the rule of law, the official said. Otunbayeva's announcement came after hours of clashes between anti-government demonstrators and police, who responded with water cannon, tear gas and eventually with live ammunition. Kyrgyzstan's Health Ministry told CNN that 40 people had been killed and 400 wounded in the clashes, and that the toll was expected to rise. The former Soviet republic is home to an air base that forms an important link in the supply line for U.S. and NATO forces in nearby Afghanistan. In Washington, a senior Pentagon official said that the turmoil has interrupted flights into and out of that facility, and it was unclear when those flights would resume. But the U.S. military has contingency plans to deal with the situation, the official said. Otunbayeva is the head of Kyrgyzstan's Social Democratic Party and a member of its parliament. She was a leader of the protests that brought Bakiev to power in 2005, and she served as his foreign minister for about two years before quitting to protest his appointment of one of the president's brothers to an ambassadorship, said Mirsulzhan Namazaliev, executive director of the Central Asian Free Market Institute in Bishkek. Opposition leaders have accused Bakiev of consolidating power by keeping key economic and security posts in the hands of relatives or close associates. Protests began Tuesday in the northern city of Talas, Kyrgyzstan, over increases in electric and fuel rates, which had been jacked up at the first of the year as Bakiev's government sold the country's public utilities to companies controlled by his friends, Namazaliev said. The demonstrations spread to the capital on Wednesday after the government responded by arresting opposition leaders in Talas. Namazaliev said that demonstrators were already gathered outside Bishkek's main square when he was headed to his office Wednesday morning, and the crowd had grown to about 5,000 people by noon (2 a.m. ET). About that time, police began to open fire on them, he said. ""I was running together with them while the police was shooting,"" Namazaliev said. Other protesters remained and battled with police, and some took weapons from officers they overpowered, he said. Machine-gun fire could be heard in the streets into the evening. Opposition leaders took control of the state television network Wednesday evening, airing images of riot police turning water cannons on demonstrators and asking people to donate blood. Though the opposition called for calm, clashes with police continued into Wednesday night, Bishkek resident Munarbek Kuldanbaev said. And Namazaliev said some protesters turned to looting after the proclamation of a new government, and police began trying to crack down on the looting only after negotiations with the interim government. iReporter describes protests, discusses grievances . Bakiev came to power in 2005 after a similar upheaval led to the ouster of then-President Askar Akayev. He won a new term in July 2009 in a vote the United States said ""was marred by significant obstacles for opposition parties, intimidation, voting irregularities, and the use of government resources to benefit specific political interests."" There have been reports of restrictions on the freedom of expression and the media in the country, including the recent closure of an opposition newspaper and other media outlets, the United Nations said. Outside Bishkek, opposition leaders had taken control of Talas and several other towns before claiming power in the capital, the Russian independent news agency Interfax reported. Russia called on Kyrgyz authorities and the opposition to settle all disputes without force and with a democratic process. It also stepped up security at its air base in Kant, Kyrgyzstan. ""On the assumption of our interests to secure political stability in a country that is friendly to ours, we believe it is important that all issues in the given situation be resolved within the legal framework. At the same time, we would like to strongly appeal to the opposing forces to refrain from the use of force to avoid bloodshed in any case,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who had visited Kyrgyzstan on Saturday, said Wednesday that he was ""shocked"" by the reports of violence and urged all sides to show restraint, engage in dialogue and promote calm. ""While freedom of assembly is an essential element of any democratic society, the rule of law must be respected,"" he said. CNN's Ben Brumfield, Matthew Chance, Talia Kayali and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Former foreign minister says she is in charge of interim government .

"(CNN) -- Space shuttle Discovery docked with the international space station early Wednesday despite a broken antenna that knocked out radar tracking aboard the shuttle. The shuttle docked with the space station at 3:44 a.m. ET. At the time of docking, both spacecraft were traveling 225 miles over the Caribbean sea near Caracas, Venezuela, NASA said. Commander Alan Poindexter and his crew completed the rendezvous without the use of the shuttle's Ku-band radar, relying instead on other navigation tools to precisely track the space station, NASA said. The Discovery's seven-person crew now joins the six-person space station crew for more than a week of work together. It will mark the first time four women have been in space at one time. Three women -- mission specialists Stephanie Wilson, Dorothy Metcalf-Lindenburger and Naoko Yamazaki -- comprise part of the Discovery's crew. NASA astronaut Tracy Caldwell Dyson is already at the space station. Discovery launched Monday morning from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The shuttle's 13-day mission includes three planned spacewalks, replacing an ammonia tank assembly and retrieving a Japanese experiment from the station's exterior. It is scheduled to return to Earth on April 18 at 8:35 a.m. ET. There are only three shuttle missions remaining before the space shuttle fleet is retired.","Shuttle Discovery reaches international space station despite loss of shuttle's radar system .

"Hartford, Connecticut (CNN) -- Few defending champions in sport have had as much to defend as the University of Connecticut women's basketball team. On Tuesday night, the Huskies successfully defended their title (beating Stanford 53-47), their winning streak (78 games) and themselves (against the charge that they're ""bad"" for women's basketball). They are so much better than every other team, goes the argument of various scribes, yakkers and bloggers, that they've made a mockery of the game. Never mind that these very pundits have mocked the game for years. Perhaps that's UConn's real crime: It's made a mockery of others' mockery. I know. I once mocked women's basketball -- and thank God I did. After I'd written a single line casually ridiculing women's basketball in the pages of Sports Illustrated, a woman confronted me in a bar in New York. She asked me how many games I'd attended before forming my low opinion of the sport. My armpits burst into flames, and I said that I'd never actually been to a women's basketball game. She invited me to one, and 23 months later, I married that woman, Rebecca Lobo, who won a national championship with an unbeaten UConn team in 1995 and a gold medal at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and who helped to launch the WNBA in 1997 as a member of the New York Liberty. I'm not saying critics are wrong: Perhaps UConn is bad for the sport, the way Secretariat was bad for horse racing when he won the Belmont by 31 lengths, or the way the Beatles diminished pop music by releasing 20 No. 1 hits, or the way da Vinci's diversity of talents -- artist, engineer, inventor, etc. -- rendered the Renaissance irredeemably dull. Or perhaps exceptional talent and overriding excellence, over time, raises the level of everyone in its proximity, in which case this UConn team might be the best thing that ever happened to women's basketball. True, when the Huskies play, the outcome of every game is known in advance, much as the outcome of every Perry Mason case was known in advance. The fun lay in seeing how the inevitable victory happened -- in watching the genius at work. People knew going in that Houdini always escaped. They still watched, because the next time he might not. And so it goes for the Huskies, who trailed 20-12 after a hideous first half Tuesday night before slipping the padlocks and swimming to the surface, triumphant. People who play and appreciate extraordinary basketball recognize this dominance as an end unto itself. ""UConn has too many weapons,"" Oklahoma City Thunder star Kevin Durant said on Twitter last week. ""Best team ever in sports?"" Not many people can answer that question knowledgeably, because most people don't watch women's basketball. It can't help that the women's final is played between the men's national championship game and the Masters golf tournament. It's a subordinate clause between a giant pair of parentheses. Pity, because the 2009-10 UConn women are surely one of sports history's most dominant teams, one for whom losing is unfathomable. ""What if the UConn women lose?"" Minnesota Timberwolves guard Jonny Flynn asked on Twitter during the tournament. ""I hope not, because that means the end of the world is near."" He pleaded for the Huskies to save the planet -- or as Flynn put it: ""Win for Humanity."" Of course, the Huskies are not saving mankind. Or womankind. Or womynkind. Women's teams, unlike men's, are somehow required to carry the flag for their entire gender. They're ""empowering our daughters,"" they're sneaker-shod suffragettes. The UCLA men's team that won 88 consecutive games in the early 1970s weren't striking a blow for wearers of headbands or mutton-chop sideburns. The Chicago Bulls dynasty of the '90s was not empowering the rainbow-haired. Men's teams play and are appreciated on their own merits. We should be able to do the same with the UConn women. They don't have to be heroines or feminist icons. The epithet my wife most often uses to describe herself is ""tall chick."" That's what the UConn women are: Women -- some tall, some not -- playing very good basketball. It's pleasure enough to watch a bunch of shiny new parts working together, efficiently, toward a devastating end: the kind of beauty you see in a combine harvester as it threshes a field of wheat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Rushin.","Steve Rushin says UConn had to defend title, winning streak and dominance in sport .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama and the rest of the first family teamed up with an extremely oversized rabbit Monday to the host the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, much to the delight of visiting children from across the country. The theme of this year's festivities was ""Ready, Set, Go!"" -- a reference to first lady Michelle Obama's ""Let's Move"" initiative, which is designed to address the problem of childhood obesity. The first family kicked off the event, which dates to 1878, shortly before 11 a.m., appearing with the Easter Bunny on the White House's South Portico, a balcony overlooking the residence's sprawling South Lawn. ""Is this not the most perfect day for the Easter Egg Roll?"" Michelle Obama asked the enthusiastic crowd. Washington is currently in the middle of a warm spell under a clear sky. ""Our hope today is that in addition to having fun and doing some of the traditional activities like the egg roll ... you can learn about beginning to live a more healthy life,"" she said. As well as participating in the traditional egg roll, families were invited to visit the White House garden and play football, basketball and tennis, among other things. Several celebrities attended the event, including players from the Washington Redskins and athletes Apolo Ohno and Billie Jean King. The president also read the Dr. Seuss book ""Green Eggs and Ham"" to the visiting children. ""When your parents tell you to eat your broccoli, you don't know whether you're going to like them or not,"" he told the kids, emphasizing the point of the classic story. ""You've got to try it. ... [And] when your parents tell you to eat your peas, eat your peas."" The first White House Easter Egg Roll was hosted by President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878.","White House Easter Egg Roll dates back to 1878 .

"(CNN) -- At the stroke of midnight, American beer drinkers were no longer breaking the law when they broke open a beer. Brewers and beer lovers this weekend are toasting the return of legal brew 75 years ago. Breweries and beer lovers around the country are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the return of beer on April 7, 1933, as the Prohibition era was drawing to a close. It wasn't quite the end of Prohibition, and it wasn't quite beer, but after 14 thirsty years, it was close enough. What became available that day was only 3.2 percent alcohol by weight (compared with up to 5 percent in full-strength beer), but still, it was a step up from the virtually alcohol-free ""near beer"" that had been sold since 1920. ""It's a big deal. ... The whole industry of beer has gotten together to say this date is definitely historic,"" said Julia Herz, spokeswoman for the Brewers Association, which represents smaller ""craft"" brewers. In St. Louis, Missouri, megabrewer Anheuser-Busch is throwing a big bash, complete with historical exhibits and an appearance by the company's famous Clydesdale horses. Also in St. Louis, but on a more intimate scale, Schlafly Beer is inviting folks to come out to its Bottleworks for a festival next weekend. Remnants of Prohibition survive today in the form of state-owned liquor stores and local laws that, for example, prevent sales of alcohol on Sundays or in grocery stores. Some counties remain entirely dry, banning alcohol sales altogether, and 3.2 beer is still sold in six states (Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma and Utah), according to Modern Brewery Age magazine. And there are those who think a beer-related anniversary is nothing to celebrate. ""It is the product of choice for underage drinking,"" said Michael Scippa, advocacy director for the Marin Institute, an alcohol industry watchdog group. ""We're not neo-Prohibitionists or teetotalers,"" he said. ""We're not trying to tell adults what to do. "" He said his group just wants the industry to operate more responsibly. The crowds celebrating the anniversary are unlikely to match the size or enthusiasm of those that gathered around breweries all over the country on ""New Beer's Eve,"" April 6, 1933, in anticipation of the return of legal beer that actually had some alcohol in it. ""There was dancing in the streets and lines outside brewery doors ... It was a big date, for sure,"" Herz said. Franklin Delano Roosevelt had been president barely a month, having been sworn in on March 4 after a landslide victory the previous November. Sweeping into power with him was an anti-Prohibition majority in Congress known as ""the wets."" Together they fulfilled their first campaign promise with passage of the Cullen-Harrison Act, which increased the amount of alcohol allowed in beverages from 0.5 percent to a discernible 3.2 percent by weight. When the act took effect at 12:01 a.m. ET April 7, trucks and carriages burst out of brewery gates bearing cases and barrels of beer for a parched republic -- at least for the District of Columbia and the 20 states whose laws permitted it. Several breweries dispatched cases directly to the White House and the Capitol. According to the Brewers Association, more than 1.5 million barrels were snapped up in the first 24 hours. Full-strength beer and hard liquor were still a few months away. National Prohibition wasn't repealed until the 21st Amendment to the Constitution was ratified on December 5. Bob Skilnik, author of eight books about beer, including ""Beer & Food: An American History,"" holds that the December date is more significant and that the quickly brewed April 7 beer probably was of poor quality. ""I know everyone gets excited about it, but you were offered a watered-down version of beer. That's all you got,"" Skilnik said. ""It probably wasn't a very satisfying drink. If you wanted to have a shot [of hard liquor] on the side, you still had to wait until December 5th for that to happen."" But the celebration was about more than getting a buzz. According to a contemporary article in The New York Times, the revival of the brewing industry restored at least 50,000 jobs in the midst of the Great Depression, instantly breathing life into the economies of St. Louis; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Chicago, Illinois; and other cities and towns where breweries were large employers. ""April 7th was really just ... FDR looking for an economic shot in the arm,"" Skilnik said. ""And it was a very successful shot in the arm. There was a hell of a lot of money spent."" He said $25 million was pumped into breweries and associated businesses -- helping farmers, truckers, and glassmakers as well as brewers and pubs -- in the first 48 hours of sales. And that was good for cash-strapped governments, too. ""Everybody [in government], for the first time, started to wrap their heads around the notion that this is something that you could tax,"" he said. The first day of beer sales reaped $7.5 million in tax receipts for the U.S. Treasury, he noted. About half the nation's breweries went out of business during Prohibition, but others survived by converting to products such as oleomargarine, ice cream, cheese and smoked ham. So at the Storck brewery in Milwaukee, for example, children could enjoy a sundae while Mom or Dad slipped away to a room where illicit beer was served from a hidden tap, according to the American Brewerania Association's Web site. Yes, despite Prohibition, Americans could go for the gusto. Chicago had as many as 20,000 speakeasies, Skilnik said. ""If you couldn't find a beer during Prohibition,"" he said, ""you really weren't trying."" E-mail to a friend .","Brewers, beer lovers celebrate 75th anniversary of return of beer on Monday .

"(CNN) -- A California man pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter with the use of a gun Tuesday in the shooting death of a man who he claimed sexually abused him as a teen, a prosecutor said. The plea comes less than a week before Aaron Vargas' first-degree murder trial was supposed to start for the slaying of Darrell McNeill, a neighbor from his childhood and a family friend whom Vargas claims began molesting him when he was 11 years old. Under the terms of a plea deal, Vargas, now 32, faces anywhere from probation to 10 years in prison for shooting the former Boy Scout leader and local businessman last year in his home in the Northern California community of Fort Bragg. Lawyers will return to court April 20 to place a statement of facts on the record before Judge Ronald Brown decides on the final sentence. ""There's some relief that we know we won't lose him for the rest of his life, but there's also a lot of anxiety about what the judge is going to do,"" said Vargas' sister, Mindy Galliani. ""I won't have closure until he's home,"" she added. ""But even when he's home, it's still not going to be closure. We need to get him into treatment so he can get help. I feel like this is only the beginning."" Since his arrest, Vargas' family has waged a tireless campaign to reduce the charges and raise awareness over child sex abuse, earning support from members of the community and giving rise to more sex abuse allegations against McNeill. McNeill used his position as a Boy Scout troop leader and as active neighborhood father to win the trust of Vargas and other young boys, Galliani said. He took the boys on camping trips or hikes, gave them alcohol or drugs and molested them, Galliani alleged. The alleged sexual abuse waned as Vargas grew into adulthood, but McNeill continued to call him and visit the home where Vargas lived with his wife and infant daughter. The continued contact drove Vargas to the breaking point, his sister said. Vargas was under the influence of alcohol the night of February 8, 2009, when he drove to McNeill's mobile home with a loaded gun and shot him in front of his wife, Mendocino County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Norman said. The prosecutor said she consulted with the victim's family and reached what they thought a jury may have found -- that his level of intoxication placed the crime more along the lines of an ""emotional decision rather than an intentional first-degree murder."" Norman said she has received four reports of sexual abuse involving McNeill, which factored into the decision to strike a plea deal even though she could not prove they were true. ""When you have other victims coming forward, that does lend credibility to that scenario,"" she said. ""These people have written me letters and said this has happened, and I have no way of showing this has happened, but it has been put out there."" The slaying victim's wife, who lived next door to Vargas' family and has known the defendant since he was a child, said she had no reason to doubt his claims of abuse. ""I love this young man and feel he needs counseling more than anything,"" McNeill's wife said in an e-mail. She requested that her name not be published. ""I cannot condone what Aaron has done, but I do understand it. I believe he took the wrong avenue by taking the law into his own hands. Like most of this community, I do not feel he deserves 50 years in prison. Unlike most of this community, I feel he should serve some time, but not much."" The case, with its suggestions of long-buried secrets, has rocked Fort Bragg, a former logging community that has become a coastal tourist destination. Another longtime Fort Bragg resident has come out publicly with allegations of abuse against McNeill. ""I was a reserved kid, some considered me a loner; I just kind of kept to myself as a kid, and he would play on that,"" Todd Rowan said in an interview in March. ""He'd give me pot and beer, and he'd get me stoned and a little drunk, and he took advantage of me that way."" Rowan said the abuse began when he was 15 and continued on and off until he was 19, but the emotional trauma lingered for years, driving him to substance abuse and suicide attempts. He said he brought the allegations to Fort Bragg Police in 2001 but nothing happened. ""All those years, I wanted to forget about and push it away with alcohol because you're supposed to be a man. And then, when police didn't do anything, that pushed me even further down the hole."" Repeated calls for comment to the Fort Bragg Police Department and the Mendocino Sheriff, which handled the investigation of McNeill's death, were not returned. Rowan said his ability to stay sober for more than two years braced him for news of McNeill's death. ""When I got news that he'd been shot, the first thing I thought was, 'who got him? Somebody got him. Who else did he do it to?'"" McNeill's second wife, Jenny Cotila, who divorced him in 1980, said she also went to Fort Bragg Police in the 1990s after she was told that her ex-husband had sexually abused her son years ago. ""It could've been stopped a long time ago but the police didn't take me seriously when I reported it because they said the statute of limitations was up by the time I found out what happened to my son,"" Cotila said in a phone interview Tuesday. Cotila said she has long felt indifference toward her ex-husband but worried about the effects of his death and the abuse allegations were having on their children, now adults. ""It's hard for them to cope because they're friends with Aaron, they knew him,"" said Cotila. ""Darrell's their father and he's their friend. They're having a hard time separating their father from the pedophile."" Members of the community also expressed shock that a ""normal"" guy like McNeill, a small business owner who installed the blinds in your home after you bought them at his furniture store, was capable of such horrific acts right under their noses. ""Here we have this man, and he's being the normal, small-town businessman, and he's following all the cultural paths available and all the norms, so when you have people coming forward and saying this man is doing something to me that's outside the norm, there's a tendency to not listen closely or to ignore it,"" said Jeff Edwards, a hospital employee who has lived in Fort Bragg most of his life. ""I guess we are to blame in a way, for thinking that this could never happen in our town.""","Aaron Vargas was set to stand trial for first-degree murder next week in Darrell McNeill's death .

"(CNN) -- ""Don't close your eyes, don't close your eyes,"" a terrified Christopher Gamez chanted as he coasted 7,000 feet above South Padre Island, Texas, his heart racing. One by one, Gamez watched as three people were ""sucked"" out of the plane and whipped violently into the thrashing winds and mist. ""Just put your head back and breathe,"" he told himself, seconds before joining the others. But why would someone with a severe fear of heights willingly plummet from the sky? To cross ""skydiving"" off his mental bucket list, of course. Gamez was inspired to dream up his list of goals after watching MTV's ""The Buried Life"", a reality TV show about four friends who set out to accomplish the tasks on their joint bucket list. The show, which wrapped its first season in March, has motivated many young adults to create such lists right now, rather than waiting until they're about to ""kick the bucket"" like Jack Nicholson and Morgan Freeman's terminally ill characters in ""The Bucket List"" or Queen Latifah's supposedly terminally ill character in ""Last Holiday."" Gamez said he tuned in every week, but he knew he wanted to live his own version of ""The Buried Life"" five minutes in to the first episode. ""If you had one day to live, what would you do?"" a voice asks viewers during the show's opening credits. ""Would you climb a mountain? Would you kiss the girl of your dreams? Would you tell someone how you feel? Now, if you had a whole lifetime to live, would you lose that drive, or would your list just keep getting longer?"" ""[The guys on the show] inspired me and they pushed me to [go skydiving],"" he said. ""To see them go out with no fear and do the things they wanted to do -- it made me want to do those things, too."" The show's title was inspired by a 19th century Matthew Arnold poem by the same name. The stars on the show -- Ben, Dave, Duncan and Jonnie -- decided ""The Buried Life"" summed up their concerns about getting bogged down with daily routine and losing their passion for life. ""What do you want to do before you die?"" became the premise for their new lifestyle and, eventually, the MTV series that allowed them to cross Number 53 off their bucket list: ""Make a badass TV show."" That list is under their control. ""What they do and how they do it and who they contact and help -- that's their decision,"" said Brent Haynes, a senior vice president at MTV, who first realized the project's potential when he saw footage of the guys sneaking into the Video Music Awards to walk the red carpet. Rather than arresting them, we gave them a TV show, Haynes joked. Others like the guys' ideas. ""The more I watch 'The Buried Life' and the more I've seen them experience things, the more I've wanted to do it,"" Megan Fulton said. The 18-year-old Emory University student said she appreciates what the guys stand for. In 2008, Fulton's friend died about three days after being diagnosed with an infection. The loss prompted Fulton and her friends to create a bucket list made up of kind gestures, long-term goals, personal achievements and travel destinations. Some of the items, like pay for someone's groceries and adopt a dog from a shelter, were crossed off rather quickly, she said. But goals like start a flash mob, travel to Lebanon -- from where Fulton and her sister were adopted -- and overcome her crippling stage fright, will be more difficult to accomplish. ""If they can take part in a Krump [dance] competition, I think I can get up and say a few lines in front of people,"" she said. ""They've really helped me and they don't even know it."" One of Fulton's favorite aspects of the show is that every time the cast members cross something off their bucket list, they help a stranger accomplish one of his or her own goals. For example, in the series finale, the guys help a young man who was adopted at birth find his biological father. Because Fulton was adopted, the episode meant a lot to her, she said. ""You can actually care about people and still be cool,"" Fulton said. ""[It's] a good trend to have caught on."" Just one bucket list wasn't enough for 21-year-old Kevin Cheaney. The Michigan State University student wrote two -- one for specific goals he wanted to accomplish during 2010 and one for long-term goals. Like Fulton, Cheaney was inspired to write a bucket list after his friend died suddenly in a motorcycle accident last summer. ""It opened up my eyes,"" he said. ""Life is kind of short."" Though Cheaney hasn't yet found the time to be someone's hero, save someone's life or race Germany's legendary Nürburgring track, just writing the lists is an accomplishment, he said. ""A lot of these things, like taking more pictures and visiting old friends, aren't going to be difficult,"" Cheaney said. ""They're just going to improve me as a person and make me appreciate life more and really enjoy it to the max."" Celestine Chua, who has never seen the TV series, came across the bucket list concept while surfing the Internet in 2009. The 25-year-old from Singapore eventually decided to write her own bucket list, which she shares with the public on her Web site as a reminder to ""live every moment to the fullest when you're in good health."" Despite already opening her own school for personal development in Singapore and starting an online talk show, Chua said she thinks No. 14, ""experience true love,"" will be the most challenging goal to accomplish. ""You might think [a bucket list is] just a list of goals, but if you're really thinking about things you want to see, experience and feel before you die, then the whole concept of setting goals is totally different,"" Chua said. ""When we start thinking about what we want to do before we die, our goals become totally different. Fall in love, see the Empire State building. That's the magic of the bucket list -- it removes limits."" Gamez agrees. That's why he's not ending his ""buried life"" with skydiving, which he said he would do again in a heartbeat, by the way. Bungee jumping and riding a bull are next. ""I'm hooked,"" he said.","""The Buried Life"" follows four friends as they accomplish tasks on their bucket list .

We're waiting to see what those arrested have to say. It seems that the attack happened in the bathroom of a bar."" Cabanas is one of Paraguay's most highly-rated players and was part of their World Cup squad in Germany. He has scored more than 100 times in the Mexican top-flight and has netted 18 goals in 24 matches this season. Club America president Michel Bauer later revealed the forward was having surgery adding he believed the attack was unprovoked. ""He arrived conscious and responded well to the questions they asked him as he was going into hospital,"" he told Televisa. ""It's a key point that can be encouraging, but until further notice we cannot speculate on anything at all. ""They wanted to assault him. I can confirm that is what his wife has said, that it was an assault. There was no shoot-out nor any quarrel,""  Bauer added.","Paraguay international Salvador Cabanas is in a critical condition after being shot in the head in Mexico City .

"(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country will show its support to the revolution on February 11. ""Our revolution has changed the patterns and the equations of the world,"" he said in a nationally televised interview. Ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the Ten Days of Dawn, which lead up to the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. He said that enemies who plotted against Iran during the election protests last year continue to plot, but despite all the economic sanctions on the country, they are not succeeding. ""This year, they have mobilized themselves again to harm the Iranian nation and to stop them, but they failed,"" he said, adding that the capitalist powers who are against Iran have peaked. Specifically, he cited the United States and United Kingdom as nations that have tried to interfere with Iran's domestic issues. ""They adopted their stances, and they failed,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""This is a clear defeat for them."" On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad said that Iran seeks such production for peaceful purposes only. The United States and other nations have expressed concern that Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. The same countries who doubt Iran could, instead, partner with Iran and build the nuclear plants themselves if they wanted, he said. ""Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts to build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course, if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point [where we will] build our own power plant,"" he said. The Iranian leader also mentioned the three American hikers who have been detained, saying that negotiations are ongoing. ""We don't like anyone in jail or in prison, but these people have violated our borders, and it has a defined penalty,"" he said, adding that there are Iranians ""languishing within American jails."" He hinted at a possible prisoner swap. ""We are approaching this from a humanitarian perspective and see how it goes,"" Ahmadinejad said. U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the United States is prepared to answer any questions about Iranians in U.S. custody. ""It's hard to know what he meant from these fragmentary comments, but we have made clear that we want consular access to our citizens in Iranian custody,"" Duguid said. ""If President Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that they are prepared to grant us access through the Swiss and resolve the cases of the three hikers and others in custody, we would welcome that step. It is long overdue."" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","The Ten Days of Dawn lead up to the February 11 anniversary of the Islamic Revolution .

"(CNN) -- Jacques Kallis moved into joint third place on cricket's all-time Test century list as he helped South Africa recover from a disastrous start to the opening match of the series against top-ranked India in Nagpur on Saturday. The all-rounder joined Brian Lara and Sunil Gavaskar in having scored 34 tons in the five-day game as he posted 159 on the opening day, putting on an unbroken 285 with Hashim Amla as the tourists battled back from losing two wickets for only six runs. The 34-year-old right-hander reached the milestone in his 136th match, five more than West Indian Lara and 11 more than India's Gavaskar. Only India's Sachin Tendulkar, who will seek to add to his record tally of 45 centuries in this match, and Australia captain Ricky Ponting (39) have passed three figures more times than that trio. Amla ended the day on 115, his eighth century in his 42 Test, having come to the crease after India's left-arm quick bowler Zaheer Khan had Ashwell Prince caught behind by wicketkeeper Mahendra Singh Dhoni for a duck, fending off a short ball. India, who have taken South Africa's top ranking of the nine Test-playing nations, struck again soon after when Zaheer clean bowled Proteas captain Graeme Smith for six. But Kallis took the attack to the bowlers, and had scored 120 of South Africa's tea total of 193-2. Amla had only 38 to his name when Kallis reached his ton, but then took charge in the third and final session as hit hit 55 of the 92 runs scored. It ended a frustrating day for the home side, who had to give reserve wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha his debut as a specialist batsman after VVS Laxman failed a fitness test and Rohit Sharma injured himself playing football in the warm-up. Dhoni then lost the toss, and Zaheer's early exploits proved to be a false dawn.","Jacques Kallis scores 34th Test century as South Africa reach 291-2 on opening day .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Actor Dennis Quaid told lawmakers Wednesday how his newborn twins came close to death after an overdose of blood-thinning medication, the fault of a drug company that did not recall easily confused bottles despite previous problems, he said. Actor Dennis Quaid says that what is happening in the nation's courts ""is no fiction."" The incident occurred last year at a Los Angeles, California, hospital, Quaid told members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In The actor also said the ""infants nearly died because of a drug company's failure to put safety first."" The panel's hearing focused on the issue of ""pre-emption,"" under which FDA approval guarantees immunity for drug companies against state lawsuits, because federal law supersedes state law. The Supreme Court is mulling the issue in a Vermont case. Oral arguments are expected in early October. ""I am in the entertainment industry, but what happened to us, and what is happening in the courts of our country, is no fiction,"" Quaid said in a statement prepared for members of the House panel. ""It is all too real. That is why I have decided to speak out and do something.""  Watch Quaid say ""Baxter's negligence was an accident waiting to happen"" » . The actor's actual statement was abridged, as he and other witnesses were given a five-minute time limit on remarks. Committee Chairman Henry Waxman, D-California, said, ""This is exactly the wrong time for the FDA to say, 'Trust us.' As a result of chronic underfunding and weak leadership, FDA's ability to protect the public is plummeting."" He said the agency has believed that state liability helped the agency regulate drugs and devices but has changed its stance under the Bush administration. In response to Quaid's testimony, the company that made the drugs involved -- Baxter Healthcare -- issued a statement saying human error was to blame, noting that the finding was supported by the California Department of Public Health. In November, Quaid's 12-day-old twins, Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace, were undergoing intravenous antibiotic treatment for a staph infection at Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Hospital. According to standard procedure, nurses were supposed to clean the infants' IV lines with Hep-Lock, a drug containing a very small dose of the blood thinner heparin, to allow the lines to flow freely. However, instead of the 10 units of heparin they were supposed to receive, the twins received 10,000 units, 1,000 times the prescribed amount. The babies survived, apparently with no permanent injury, Quaid told members of Congress, although no one knows whether they will show any long-term effects. The actor grew emotional as he recalled a 41-hour ordeal in which his infants' blood was the consistency of water and their bodies bore bruises from internal bleeding. ""It made me feel that they had survived for a reason ... that maybe they were going to change the world in a little way,"" he said. In researching the incident, Quaid told lawmakers he found that the bottles of 10-unit Hep-Lock and 10,000-unit heparin were ""virtually indistinguishable."" Both drugs are manufactured by Baxter Healthcare. He also learned that the labels' similarity led to an overdose of infants at an Indianapolis, Indiana, hospital in 2006. Three babies died and three were injured. Four months after that incident, he said, Baxter sent a warning to hospitals regarding the potential for mistakes. Seven months after that, Baxter received permission to change the labels. However, Quaid said, Baxter failed to recall the previous bottles that were in hospitals. ""They recall automobiles; they recall toasters; they even recall dog food,"" Quaid said. ""Although mistakes did occur at Cedars, the overdosing of our twins was a chain of events of human error -- and the first link in that chain was Baxter."" Baxter, meanwhile, said in its statement that its heparin vials ""have been used safely more than 100,000 times a day, a fact that contradicts the implication that two of the company's vials are indistinguishable. ""The two hospitals where tragic errors occurred with Baxter's heparin products reported that these were isolated events resulting from a system failure in the hospital along with human and procedural errors, such as not reading the label."" Quaid and his wife, Kimberly, have filed suit against Baxter in state court. The drug company has filed a motion to dismiss the case, relying on the pre-emption argument, Quaid said. Baxter spokeswoman Erin Gardner said in the statement that the company did not recall the vials because the medication errors were not related to the safety or efficacy of the product, and ""Baxter's vials, even before the label enhancement, were better differentiated than other heparin products on the market."" The company said it contacted the Quaids' attorney in March to ask whether the couple would partner with them and medication safety experts on a program aimed at reducing medication errors but had not received a response. ""Baxter is hopeful that it can resolve this litigation and partner together with the Quaids for the beneffit of clinicians and patients rather than continue to litigate this matter in the courts,"" the statement said.","Actor testifies before House committee on newborn twins' brush with death .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian firetruck responding with lights and sirens to a weekend fire in Rouses Point, New York, was stopped at the U.S. border for about eight minutes, U.S. border officials said Tuesday. The U.S.-Canadian border is more than 5,000 miles long. Fire officials battling the blaze called for help from fire departments in nearby Quebec, using a longstanding and often-used mutual aid agreement. But the first truck that arrived at the small Rouses Point border crossing was delayed as officials checked documentation of the firefighters and their truck, officials confirmed. Two other trucks that arrived at the crossing next were cleared in less than two minutes each, a time that one fire official said was still too long considering the situation. ""It's embarrassing,"" said Chris Trombley, chief of the Champlain [New York] Volunteer Fire Department and deputy fire coordinator for Clinton County Emergency Services. ""We're calling for help from another country and the first roadblock they hit is at our border."" The Canadian firefighters ""were asked for IDs,"" Trombley said. ""I believe they even ran the license plate on the truck to make sure it was legal."" In the past, firetrucks on emergency calls cleared border checkpoints in 30 seconds or less, Trombley said, although he said identification is sometimes checked upon their return. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection official said the eight-minute delay at the Rouses Point crossing was caused ""when one of the firefighters' admissibility was brought into question."" He declined to elaborate, citing immigration and privacy laws. A government source familiar with the case said one firefighter had a criminal record, raising questions about whether he could enter the United States. Kevin Corsaro of the border protection's Buffalo field office said the agency's primary responsibility is to protect the homeland. He called the event an ""isolated incident"" and said agency officials  were meeting with local fire officials to ""develop a plan to prevent the possibility of any delays."" No one was seriously injured in the fire, but The Anchorage Inn restaurant -- a landmark in the village of Rouses Point -- was destroyed. A firefighter who suffered minor smoke inhalation was treated at the scene, said Michael LeBlanc, chief of the Rouses Point Volunteer Fire Department. The cause of the blaze has not been determined, he said. Ten fire departments, including the Canadian departments, responded to the fire. ""Would it [quicker passage at the border] have changed the outcome of the fire?"" Trombley asked. ""Would the building have been burned? Of course it would."" But he said firefighters were getting fatigued fighting the fire and relief was delayed. ""Just the fact that it could happen and it could happen again is what has us worried,"" he said. Clinton County has mutual aid agreements with fire departments in Vermont and Quebec, Trombley said, and the county requests help from Quebec fire departments about 30 times a year. It sends help to Canada a similar number of times, he said. Trombley and LeBlanc said they planned to meet with authorities on Wednesday to discuss the incident. LeBlanc declined to comment. ""I don't have all the facts and I don't want to mistake what happened,"" he said. ""We've had a mutual aid system in place since the '50s and I can't remember anything like this happening,"" said Trombley.

"(Skiing Magazine) -- When it comes to ski-equipment meccas, there's Park City, Utah; Boulder, Colorado; and, Vancouver, Canada. Home to Arc'teryx, Westcomb, and Prior, these Vancouver-based brands are leading the charge in innovative gear technology and design. Take Arc'teryx, a local company that got its start in 1991 making rock-climbing harnesses, and has since evolved into an industry leader turning out stellar outdoor apparel, equipment, and accessories year after year. ""Our brand was born and raised and is still growing its roots in Vancouver,"" explains Arc'teryx CEO Tyler Jordan. ""We rely on our local contacts, a group of hardcore athletes, and our employees -- we're all gear junkies -- to give immediate feedback to help us grow and develop the brand."" Using state-of-the-art materials, construction methods, and a style-y aesthetic, Arc'teryx appeals equally to hardcore skiers as to mainstream mountain lovers. In fact, Arc'teryx's gear is so good, some of Vancouver's police are now outfitted in the brand's LEAF (Law Enforcement Armed Forces) line. And with two full-time colorists on staff, the brand has revolutionized the world of color in ski apparel. Gone are the days of black, yellow, and red jackets à la North Face 1995; in are outer shells splashed with shades like Big Sky blue and Bud green. It's not just the city's proximity to the outdoors that influences local gear companies; it's also Vancouver's thriving cosmopolitanism, fashion scene, and underground culture. Alan Yiu, CEO and creative director of Westcomb, a local ski apparel brand, just looks to his city for ideas. ""I look at architecture and buildings. Anything that makes me stop in my tracks and wonder what the process was to create it is a source of inspiration to me."" And Westcomb's vibe reflects Yiu's -- and Vancouver's -- modern sensibility: funky, fresh, and sleek. Skiing Magazine: Why you should care about the Olympics . Vancouver is also home to award-winning ""microbrew"" ski and snowboard manufacturer Prior. What started in 1990 with founder Chris Prior making snowboards in his North Vancouver garage has turned into one of the world's top producers of handcrafted snow equipment.

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has fired his chief of staff despite an inquiry into a sex scandal that cleared the second-in-command of wrongdoing. Rafiq Husseini was accused of using the power of his office to extract sex from a female job seeker. The scandal erupted in February after a video was made public allegedly showing Husseini undressing in a bedroom and calling for a woman to join him in bed. The president fired Husseini on Tuesday at the recommendation of a committee that Abbas created to look into the allegations. The report clears Husseini of corruption and sexual misconduct charges. But because its content was not made public, it was not immediately clear why the committee recommended that the aide be let go. ""I was exonerated from the main accusations of abusing my power in office for personal gain and sexual favors,"" Husseini said Wednesday. ""But at the same time, the committee found that I committed personal error outside the realm of my work."" The controversy began after Israel's Channel 10 aired the grainy surveillance footage of Husseini. The footage shot in 2008 was provided to Channel 10 by Fahmi Shabaneh, a former agent in the Palestinian Authority's General Intelligence Department. Shabaneh said he released the tape to the media to expose ethical and financial corruption within the Palestinian Authority. Shabaneh said he had brought evidence of both sexual and financial wrongdoing to Abbas before going public, but that he was ignored. He said received permission from his superior officer to make the clandestine recording of Husseini after a Palestinian woman approached him complaining that Husseini was trying to ""sexually blackmail her."" The tape was made in cooperation with the woman who had brought the allegations, he said. In a news conference in February, Husseini denied the allegations. He told reporters that he had been framed by a gang ""working for the interest of Israeli intelligence"" and said the tape was ""dubbed."" On Wednesday, Husseini said he accepted the committee's recommendation. ""I am satisfied, and know that I paid a price after all,"" he said. ""I refuse to be blackmailed and I stood up to the black mailers even when that meant that I would lose my job over it.""

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama announced Thursday that the federal government will spend $8 billion developing a nationwide high-speed train system -- an investment the White House says is needed to help spur long-term economic growth. The investment, to be made through a series of state grants, will be funded through the government's $862 billion economic stimulus package. Overall, projects and planning involving the rail corridors will take place in 31 states, according to a White House statement. The program ""will help accelerate job growth in an economy that is already beginning to grow,"" Obama said at a town hall at the University of Tampa in Florida. ""There is no reason why other countries can build high-speed rail lines and we can't,"" Obama said. More than 30 rail manufacturers have agreed to establish or expand U.S. operations if they are hired to work on the high-speed rail network, the administration said. The president first mentioned the program in his State of the Union speech Wednesday night. The administration initially released an outline for a national high-speed rail network last April. Each of the corridors identified by the administration last year are between 100 and 600 miles long. The program is ""a long-term venture in which states will need to plan projects, purchase and lay track, build and assemble equipment, and construct or upgrade train stations, tunnels and bridges,"" the statement said. In addition to the $8 billion mentioned by Obama, the plan also includes $1 billion a year for five years in the federal budget ""as a down payment to jump-start the program,"" the White House said. Train corridors in the program include: . -- San Diego-Los Angeles-San Luis Obispo in California . -- Oakland-Sacramento in California . -- Portland-Eugene in Oregon . -- Seattle-Portland in Washington and Oregon . -- Chicago-St. Louis in Illinois and Missouri . -- St. Louis-Kansas City in Missouri . -- Minneapolis/St. Paul-Madison in Minnesota and Wisconsin . -- Madison-Milwaukee in Wisconsin . -- Milwaukee-Chicago in Wisconsin and Illinois . -- Cleveland-Columbus-Cincinnati in Ohio . -- Detroit/Pontiac-Chicago in Michigan, Indiana and Illinois . -- Tampa-Orlando in Florida . -- Raleigh-Charlotte in North Carolina . -- Washington-Richmond in the District of Columbia and Virginia . -- Raleigh-Richmond in North Carolina and Virginia . -- New York City-Albany-Buffalo in New York . -- New York City-Montreal in New York and Quebec, Canada. -- Boston-New York-Washington in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and the District of Columbia . -- Brunswick-Portland in Maine . -- Philadelphia-Harrisburg-Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania . -- Springfield-East Northfield in Massachusetts . -- New Haven-Springfield in Connecticut and Massachusetts .","Projects and planning involving rail corridors will take place in 31 states, White House says .

"Leogane, Haiti (CNN) -- In a dirt field 20 minutes outside of Leogane's city center, desperation surfaces in the form of fear, anger, thanks. All at once. Relief trucks from CARE International have arrived, and the waiting wall of people pounces on the aid workers. The residents clutch paper tickets given out earlier to collect the goods: one mattress and blanket per family. CARE begins to distribute 250 of each, but the makeshift settlement here holds as many as 10,000 earthquake victims. Guards wearing gray polo shirts with the word ""securite"" painted on their backs roam the grounds with metal baseball bats in hand. They anticipate chaos. ""We are happy for the mattresses. We are thankful,"" says Willio Sainvil, a spokesman for a community organization helping organize the flow of aid. ""But what we need is water. We need food. We have people who are sick. They need medicine,"" he says. ""We need tents, especially if it rains."" Above the sun is hiding, for the moment, under dark clouds. iReport:  Looking for loved ones in Haiti . ""You can see the people are not satisfied,"" Sainvil says. ""But they are thankful."" CARE spokesman Rick Perera says the humanitarian agency delivered a water buffalo to this settlement, about 20 miles west of Port-au-Prince, but nothing else arrived until the mattresses on Sunday. The agency plans to supply more relief items, but distribution has been a huge problem, Perera said. It has been difficult finding enough trucks to carry the goods. In outlying areas like this, the biggest fear is people will be forgotten. Sainvil says aid agencies have visited the city center, but few have received help in the townships and villages of Leogane province, lined with sugarcane groves, banana trees and now, mangled chunks of concrete that used to be homes, offices, schools and clinics. Twelve days after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake, the focus in Haiti has shifted from extracting survivors from heaps of rubble to helping those who survived. By some estimates, 1.5 million Haitians were rendered homeless. In Leogane, at the epicenter of the massive quake, about 85 percent of the town may have been destroyed. Kenneth Merten, U.S. ambassador to Haiti, told CNN'S Christiane Amanpour on Sunday that the relief was slow in the first few days. ""It was very slow, a lot came in, it was hard to get it out to the people who needed it most,"" he said. ""If I were a Haitian here, I would be, frankly, angry at the whole situation I found myself in. But I must say that I think the Haitians are resilient, and they're to be applauded for approaching this in a stoic and dignified fashion."" Full coverage . The International Organization for Migration said Sunday that the biggest need was tents for as many as 500,000 displaced people. The agency identified two new sites in Port-au-Prince and Leogane where temporary shelters will be developed for those ""living in deplorable conditions in makeshift settlements without basic services."" ""The temporary tent settlements will provide a clean and safe environment for the displaced,"" said Vincent Houver, the agency's chief of operations in Haiti, ""but they are a short-term solution. Tent settlements are not sustainable."" More than 500 aid agencies are operating in Haiti. Fifteen of them met with Leogane officials Saturday to address needs. The United Nations plans to set up a separate water and sanitation system for Leogane, but the world organization is ""quite stretched,"" said Paul Shanahan, senior emergency specialist with CARE. ""It's hard to imagine how it could be worse,"" he said about Leogane's sanitation problems. ""Human waste is being generated and disposed of informally."" He meant left in open areas or dumped onto trash heaps. ""You see every mode of catastrophic failure possible,"" Shanahan said of Leogane. ""And the people fear they are not going to be attended to."" Interactive map of where to find aid, hospitals in Haiti .

"(CNN) -- Akio Toyoda's appearance before U.S. legislators on Wednesday represents not just a fact-finding mission by committee members and a public relations move by Toyota, but a clash of cultures that in many ways created the recall controversy. ""They turned a rather ordinary recall into a brand-threatening crisis,"" said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies at Temple University's Japan campus in Tokyo. Indeed, a key reason why Toyoda is in the hot seat is because the company leadership responded in a very Japanese fashion, Japan watchers say. ""Their decision-making process was painfully slow, but the international media and concerned customers don't want to wait so long for answers,"" Kingston said. ""Anytime the public hears 'brake' and 'problem' in the same sentence, they want quick answers."" Toyoda's long silence as the company deliberated what to do is a hallmark of the Japanese culture of consensus building. ""The decision-making process is really the planning process in Japan -- you don't see a lot of rapid response to a strategic issue,"" said Michael Alan Hamlin, president of Team Asia, which provides communications advice to multinational companies. Difficult, too, will be how Toyoda handles hostile questioning, especially since most of his public experience has been before a largely deferential Japanese press. ""There is a huge difference in how Japanese media cover companies,"" said Hamlin, who lived in Japan for a decade. ""They are careful not to upset or annoy business leaders too much, because they don't want their access to information or press conferences blocked because of negative reporting. ""In the West, you take Microsoft, Google or GM -- once they are big, successful companies, they are targets (of aggressive media),"" he said. ""That's the trade-off for visibility and success."" How the two audiences -- American and Japanese -- view Toyoda's performance may be very different because of cultural differences in body language. ""Japanese when in an apology mode -- especially before an authority like the U.S. Congress -- will be very humble. That means, you don't necessarily look people in the eye,"" said Deborah Hayden, Tokyo managing partner of Kreab & Gavin Anderson Worldwide, a communications consultancy. ""From a Western perspective, that can be mistaken as weakness or perhaps trying to hide something."" Also, Japanese language tends to be indirect -- whereas before the committee members are likely to pepper him with direct questions and ""be a bit of political theater,"" Hamlin added. ""He's got to walk a very fine line of polite respect -- which Japanese have in bucket loads -- and the confidence of being head of one of the largest, most respected companies in the world,"" Hayden said.","Toyota's handling of the recall crisis has elements of a culture clash .

"Athens, Greece (CNN) -- Thousands of people marched through Athens Thursday as part of a 24-hour nationwide strike to protest further austerity measures by the embattled government. The strike began at midnight and caused all government-run institutions -- including schools, airports, trams, subways, and most buses -- to close down. Banks and the media were also shut, meaning no broadcast news Thursday and no newspapers Friday. There were small clashes with police and protesters threw two petrol bombs at officers in Constitution Square, in front of the Parliament building. Police fired some tear gas and pepper spray in return, but otherwise the march was relatively calm. Sixteen people were arrested and two police officers were injured, police told CNN. Many people appeared to be suffering from the tear gas. The protesters are angry about further government measures aimed at cutting Greece's massive deficit. They oppose the cutting of benefits and salaries, and the raising of taxes, and want more of the measures to be aimed at the wealthy. The government says Greece has to modernize its tax structure as the country suffers from tax avoidance and other structural impediments to job growth. But younger workers say they already pay high taxes, have little job security and make less money than older generations. Some of the same measures prompted large demonstrations and some violence two weeks ago, but polls at the time still showed the majority of Greeks backing the government plans. Since then, government has introduced a third round of austerity measures in Parliament amounting to $6.5 billion of cuts and tax increases, and that has caused support for the government to slip -- polls now show only a bare majority in favor of the government's actions. The Greek government revealed late last year that its budget deficit was 12.7 percent of its gross domestic product, far exceeding the European Union limit of 3 percent. Countries participating in the EU must agree to that condition and other economic goals. Greece aims to reduce that deficit to 8.7 percent this year and reach the EU target by 2012. Thursday's strikes were rescheduled from March 16, when European Union officials plan to go to Athens and assess Greece's financial pledges to Europe. Protesters moved the strikes to Thursday in order to maximize disruption, because both public and private sector workers would be able to strike. The Greek government has said it will not back down in the face of strikes. CNN's Jim Boulden contributed to this report.","Protesters angry about measures aimed at cutting Greece's massive deficit .

"(CNN) -- Tzipi Livni, leader of a key Israeli opposition party, said Monday she would be willing to face arrest to challenge the validity of war crimes charges reportedly filed against her in a British court. ""For me, this is not a question,"" Livni told CNN's Christiane Amanpour, when asked whether she was willing to face arrest. ""I mean, yes, the answer is yes. I am."" A British court last year issued an arrest warrant for Livni, leader of Israel's Kadima Party. Details of the warrant were never made public; the warrant was reportedly later dropped. ""I would like this to be, in a way, maybe even a test case, because I'm willing to speak up and to speak about the military operation in Gaza Strip,"" Livni said. Livni had served as Israel's foreign minister during an Israeli three-week military offensive against Hamas in Gaza that ended exactly one year ago. The United Nations and some human-rights groups have blamed Israel and Hamas for human rights abuses during the conflict. But Livni, who is no longer in the Israeli government, defended the former government's decision to go to war, saying that the campaign was needed to confront rocket attacks by Palestinian movement Hamas on Israeli civilians, particularly those living in southern Israel. ""I know that the decisions that we made were crucial to give an answer to Israeli civilians that couldn't live in the south part of Israel and later or even also in different parts of Israel,"" she said. ""It was part of my responsibility, and this was the right answer. And I'm willing to stand for these reasons and to explain this to -- to the world and to any court."" She said that the Israeli military had already conducted its own investigation into the actions of its soldiers, but that she did not necessarily support a public inquiry in Israel, unless it helped Israeli soldiers when they traveled outside Israel. ""Part of our responsibility is also to defend the Israeli soldiers and officials that worked according to our decision in the government. And if an inquiry helps them, this is fine, so I can support an inquiry, as long as this helps them. It's not about me. It's about the Israeli soldiers, because I want them to leave Israel and to feel free to visit different parts of the world according, you know, to -- like any -- like any other citizen of the free world and any other soldier."" One year after end of fighting in Gaza, Livni said that the Israeli blockade of Gaza would stay in place. ""The blockade on Gaza -- yes. But it's important to say that, when it comes to humanitarian needs, the gates are open,"" she said. It was not clear who originally sought the warrant for Livni last year from Westminster Magistrates Court. British legal rules allow arrest warrants to be issued by a court independent of ministerial approval. The arrest warrant was revoked once it was clear Livni was not in Britain, the BBC reported.","Tzipi Livni, leader of Israeli opposition party, is willing to face war crimes charges .

"(CNN) -- The first decade of the 21st century was the warmest ever on Earth according to data released by scientists at NASA. The U.S. space agency's data also revealed that 2009 was the second warmest year since temperature records began in 1880, and only narrowly cooler than 2005, the warmest year ever. 2008 was the coolest year of the decade but this was attributed to a strong La Nina which causes extensive cooling of the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. James Hansen, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) said in a statement: ""There's substantial year-to-year variability of global temperature caused by the tropical El Nino-La Nina cycle. When we average temperature over five or ten years to minimize that variability, we find global warming is continuing unabated."" In the past three decades, GISS report surface temperature records show an upward trend of about 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. In total, according to GISS, average global temperatures have increased by about 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.5 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880. GISS sources its data using over one thousand weather stations around the world, satellite observations of sea surface temperatures, and research station data from Antarctica -- all of which, they say, is readily available to the public.","2000 to 2009 was the warmest decade since records began .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The super-yachts of the super-rich could soon become super-green. The solar sail: super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this. Sydney-based technology company Solar Sailor is working on a ""solar sail"" which could act as both a sail and a solar power source to all sorts of large vessels. Super-yachts owned by billionaires like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet. Some of the ocean-going beasts like Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's ""Dubai,"" the biggest private super-yacht in the world, are over 150 meters long and contain amenities like aircraft hangars, movie theaters, Jacuzzis, and swimming pools. All of these features sap incredible amounts of energy. Fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power. • See a photo gallery of the world's best super-yachts . Solar Sailor's CEO Robert Dane told CNN the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts. He said the solar sails had the ability to significantly reduce the boats' fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions. ""We think it would enable people to have their super-yacht but make little or no carbon footprint, which is the big problem with these vessels,"" he said. Dane said the technology worked by using a wing that is a solar panel or a sail, pivotally mounted to a vessel so it can be angled to the sun or the wind. The ""sails"" are controlled by a computer which takes into account the direction and strength of sun and wind to optimize energy collection. A design project is currently underway in the United Kingdom to create a solar sail for the super-yachts, he said. Dane said the company was working with Chinese shipping company COSCO to get solar sails on some of its fleet. ""Our aim is for a trail of retrofitted sails to one bulker and one tanker in 2010. Based on the results of this, then we would design 'new-build' vessels,"" he said. Dane estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots. ""This might add up to a 10 percent saving overall in the whole journey,"" Dane said. He said there were further hopes that the technology could be improved by developing systems to raise and lower sails with fewer moving parts and store energy more efficiently.","Solar sails are large solar-paneled wings which can harness sun or wind power .

"Washington (CNN) -- Washington Wizards player Javaris Crittenton Monday became the second member of the NBA team to plead guilty to a weapons charge following a gun-toting locker-room incident. Crittenton, 22, pleaded guilty in Superior Court in the District of Columbia to a misdemeanor count of possession of an unregistered firearm. He will avoid jail time. Judge Bruce Beaudin sentenced Crittenton to one year of unsupervised probation. The judge also ordered him to perform community service with a children's organization in Washington and through the NBA's Haiti project. ""Possessing a firearm unlawfully in the District of Columbia can lead to nothing but trouble and can have serious consequences,"" said U.S. Attorney Channing Phillips. ""We commend Mr. Crittenton for accepting responsibility and hope he fully appreciates the gravity of his actions,"" Phillips said. The Wizards said in a statement that the charges and Crittenton's plea were ""another disappointing development in what has already been a long and frustrating process for the team, the NBA and, most importantly, our fans."" ""Javaris clearly used very bad judgment in this situation and will now face the consequences of his actions,"" the statement said. Crittenton, who is currently listed as inactive on the Wizards' roster and has not played a game all season, agreed with prosecutors that the incident stemmed from an angry exchange with teammate Gilbert Arenas following arguments over a card game. The argument led to shooting threats, according to documents submitted to the court. Prosecutors say Arenas threatened to burn or blow up Crittenton's car when they came to practice the following Monday. ""According to Crittenton before he left his home in Virginia for practice that day, Crittenton placed a lawfully owned unloaded handgun into his backpack because he believed that Arenas would carry out his threat to shoot him that day,"" prosecutors said. Authorities say Crittenton displayed the weapon to Arenas, but did not aim it at him or load the weapon. Arenas had placed four of his own guns at Crittenton's locker and told him to ""pick one,"" authorities said. Authorities say Crittenton had been cooperating with them after the incident, and had voluntarily surrendered his weapon, a 9 mm semi-automatic Taurus, to law enforcement officials. Arenas, a former NBA all-star, pleaded guilty to a more serious felony charge and faces potentially six months in jail, and has been suspended indefinitely by the NBA. His sentencing is set for March 26.","NEW: Wizards call charges and sentencing ""another disappointing development""

"(CNN) -- When an overwhelmed Shreve Stockton tweeted: ""I need an assistant!"" she considered it more of a joke than a serious request, because she couldn't pay a salary. ""I can't even offer room & board, only a camp trailer named the Psychedelic Jellybean & an unlimited supply of milk!"" she tweeted last month. Shreve is not a celebrity or executive requiring a personal assistant, but a published writer and photographer who lives in a log cabin on 40 acres in the rolling hills near Ten Sleep, Wyoming. Her homestead includes a dog, tomcat, dairy cow, baby calf, young bull she's training to work like an ox, two horses and, of course, Charlie the coyote. She feels overwhelmed with the daily care of all the animals. But she'd also like to share her home with visiting assistants because ""it's becoming so rare in America to have the time and space and the openness of the rural landscape that is shrinking."" The only ""luxury"" she will be able to provide a starving artist is the time ""to work on whatever they want art-wise"" in their off time, without having the stress of coming up with money for rent or utilities. Her ad was only posted for a day or two but drew around  100 responses -- with one person offering to pay her for the opportunity to be her assistant. She directed them to an application. She shared a few of the forms with her boyfriend, Mike, a trapper with the Bureau of Land Management, who found all the applicants interesting and told her if he had to choose, he'd have to move into a tent so they could all move into his house. The application also came with an unusual warning to all would-be helpers that there would be no petting, no face-to-face time and no ""hanging out"" with Charlie. The wild-born Charlie earns his keep by allowing Shreve to take photos of his everyday activities and write about him in her book as well as on her blog -- both titled the Daily Coyote. She's raised him since he was 10 days old, after his parents were shot for attacking sheep. Although he walks on a leash, co-exists with Eli the cat, plays with Chloe the dog and often visits inside Shreve's house, Charlie does not like strangers. So for everyone's safety, her new helper will not be visiting inside the electric fence that surrounds his territory. But that's OK with self-taught artist Sarah Frary of Kentucky, who plans to move into the trailer and spend part of her days helping Shreve with household tasks such as cleaning milk pails and maintaining her Web site, and the rest of her time on her art. Frary, 23,  expects the experience will have a ""monumental"" effect on her drawing, painting and screen printing. She describes her current drawings as ""very primordial and ancient feeling,"" while her new boss calls them fantastic. Frary has already started blogging about her new life and plans to set off later this month. She sought out the position because Shreve's ""energy and everything about her just completely resonates and it's something I connect with."" Shreve was a little concerned about sharing her space with a stranger, but said she felt ""a kindredness"" with the young woman, who has been working as an apprentice tattoo artist in Louisville, Kentucky. Frary also performs ""live art,"" which she describes as taking place in a theater during a concert or play with her perched near the edge of the stage, painting on a large scale that has her ""throwing paint and finger painting -- getting crazy with it."" The work-exchange program will give Shreve more time to ""concentrate on her next artistic endeavor."" She has a few ideas percolating and hopes to decide on one ""the day after my new help arrives."" Frary, a tattooed former military brat, feels her arrival won't go unnoticed, with her PT Cruiser covered in stickers she describes as bizarre and with an interior sporting a bobble-head Mr. T and feathers. Shreve landed in Wyoming after her own unusual journey, a solo, cross-country trip from California to New York on a motor scooter. After reaching her destination, she returned to the shadow of the Big Horn mountains to write about the trip on her Vespa Vagabond blog. While she fell in love with Wyoming instantly, the author says it still felt like another planet at first and it was a year and a half before she ""fully got into the rhythm of this life."" Because Frary's father was in the Air Force, she says she's used to having to uproot and adapt to new places. She also describes herself as being outdoorsy, pretty adventurous and a nature person who loves to challenge herself. The two women will have to work out their schedules and computer differences: the Wyoming resident only knows Macs, while the visitor has built her own PC. Shreve plans to teach Frary how to market her art on the Internet and is willing to teach her how to mend real fences and care for the animals. The older woman picked up her skills watching and helping her neighbors. ""I'm a pretty gung ho, hardworking person, so I'll probably get my hands on everything,"" says the painter, who expects a full, disciplined life in the country with fewer distractions than the city. But there is one service Frary says she probably won't be able to provide to Shreve's satisfaction: cooking. She says her mother hated cooking so she never learned. She has been taking lessons from a vegan friend who doesn't use any animal products. Cooking takes a lot more planning on the homestead because the nearest grocery store is about an hour away.","Author and photographer tweets in frustration and gets an artist as assistant .

"HILLSBOROUGH, North Carolina (CNN) -- A man who was obsessed with the Columbine High School massacre was found guilty of murder Friday and sentenced to life without parole for gunning down his father before opening fire at a North Carolina high school three years ago. Alvaro Castillo was fixated with the Columbine High School shootings, mass murders and natural disasters. Alvaro Castillo, 21, has been medicated during the trial and showed little reaction as the first verdict was read -- guilty of the first-degree murder of his father. He also was convicted of multiple assault and weapons offenses in the school shooting. No one was killed at the school, but two students were wounded. The jury deliberated seven hours before rejecting Castillo's insanity defense. At his sentencing, Castillo thanked ""the Lord our God for all his blessings"" and thanked his family for being in court. ""I thank my father in heaven for watching down on me"" he said. Later, Castillo apologized to the victims, adding, ""I know by my actions I shocked and hurt a lot of people. It wasn't my intention. I simply wanted to help. Now I know I was wrong."" Before pronouncing a sentence of life without parole, Judge Allen Baddour said: ""It's frustrating to hear how help -- I think it was available, but everything didn't fit together to get you the help that you needed."" Castillo, who has a history of mental illness, admitted shooting his father and firing at the students, but defense attorneys James Williams and Phoebe Dee argued he was not criminally responsible for his actions because he was legally insane. Experts for the defense testified that Castillo believed God wanted him to sacrifice his father and the students. ""The only thing that could make this tragedy worse would be if he were convicted of first-degree murder, despite substantial evidence that he was indeed insane at the time that these acts were committed,"" Williams said during his closing argument. Prosecutor James Woodall said while Castillo might be disturbed, he does not meet the criteria for a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity. He said Castillo planned a murderous rampage. ""He wants to be famous and he wants to be somebody. And the only way he can figure out to do that is to kill some folks,"" Woodall said.  Watch more of the closing arguments » . The 13 days of testimony told the story of an alienated young man who grew up in a dysfunctional family and finally lashed out violently on August 30, 2006. Castillo, then 18, shot his father, Rafael, 65, seven times in the head and neck as he sat on the couch reading, according to testimony. Castillo covered his father's body with a sheet, held his hand, kissed him, asked for forgiveness and then left a note and pipe bomb next to the body. Castillo later dressed in a Colorado T-shirt, a black trench coat he bought during a sightseeing trip to Columbine, cargo pants, military-style boots and ammunition belts, according to testimony. He armed himself with a sawed-off shotgun he named Arlene, the same name Columbine shooter Eric Harris gave his gun, he wrote in his journal.  Watch how Castillo named his guns » . He also carried a 9 mm semi-automatic rifle he named Anna after an unrequited high school crush. He gathered pipe bombs, smoke grenades and nearly 200 rounds of ammunition. Before leaving for Orange High School, Castillo sent an e-mail to the principal of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, to alert him that Hillsborough would soon make history, according to testimony. He also mailed a letter and videos to a classmate and a local newspaper. Castillo drove the family's minivan to a patio lunch area, set off a cherry bomb and fired at the students. He later told a psychiatrist that he aimed for their heads, according to testimony. His gun jammed, and he was jumped by a deputy sheriff assigned to the school and a retired highway patrol officer who taught driver's education . Castillo's trial included eight hours of homemade videos showing Castillo ranting, yelling, whispering, singing and beating himself; journal entries detailing an obsession with a classmate he compared to the obsession would-be presidential assassin John Hinckley had with Jodie Foster; and a notebook he called ""Mass Murders and School Shootings of the 20th and 21st Centuries.""  See excerpts of Castillo's journal » . In the notebook, he listed himself at the end of a gallery of school shooters. Jurors also saw a narrated video that Castillo shot in Littleton after convincing his mother to take him there to see Columbine High School and the homes of shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. Castillo's mother and sister, both named Victoria, testified that Rafael Castillo tormented the family. He was described as a controlling husband and father with unconventional beliefs. They said he forbid his wife from bathing the children in warm water because he believed cold water cured all ills. The children often saw their father drag their mother by her hair, according to testimony.  Watch Castillo's mother describe the abuse » . After high school graduation in 2005, Castillo enlisted in the National Guard. By January 2006 he decided to kill himself. He was discharged from the National Guard later that year. In April 2006 Castillo recorded a video in which he appears to be talking to his unrequited crush. He asked his father to mail the video on April 20. When Rafael Castillo returned, his son was dressed in his military uniform and was close to shooting himself with a shotgun, according to testimony. Rafael Castillo wrestled the gun away and called the police on his son, who was committed to a psychiatric facility. When Castillo was discharged a week later, he was advised not to have contact with guns and placed on an antidepressant. But five days after his discharge Castillo bought another shotgun. His journal shows that he had decided to carry out a ""Columbine-like massacre at Orange High School."" By late June, he told his therapists that he no longer felt suicidal or thought of hurting others, and that he was no longer obsessed with Columbine. From June 1 to August 30, Castillo's diary is replete with references to ""Operation Columbine"" and how he would ""sacrifice"" students then kill himself. He chose August 30 because it is the birthday of Kip Kinkel, another high school shooter who killed his parents and high school students in 1998 in Springfield, Oregon. Defense attorney Williams told the jury that a social worker tried urgently to get Castillo into treatment in July, but there was a six-week backlog at the local psychiatric clinic. She tried to get another clinic to see him, but learned on August 11 that they would not. Nineteen days later, Castillo shot his father dead, dressed in the manner of the Columbine shooters, drove to his alma mater and opened fire.","Alvaro Castillo, 21, sentenced to life without parole .

"(CNN) -- A school board in Rhode Island has voted to fire all teachers at a struggling high school, a dramatic move aimed at shoring up education in a poverty-ridden school district. In a 5-2 vote Tuesday night, the board approved the plan by Frances Gallo, superintendent at Central Falls School District, to discharge the teachers, administrators and other personnel at Central Falls High School. The firings, which will be effective at the end of this school year, came after the district said it failed to reach an agreement with the teachers' union on a plan for the teachers to spend more time with students to improve test scores. A union spokesman called the firings drastic and cited a 21 percent rise in reading scores and a 3 percent increase in math scores in the past two years. The school district said 93 people -- including the principal, three assistant principals and 77 teachers -- were fired. The teachers' union said the firings affected 74 classroom teachers plus a number of other educators such as guidance counselors and reading specialists. Central Falls High is one of the lowest-performing schools in Rhode Island. It is in a community where median income is $22,000, census figures show. Of the 800 students, 65 percent are Hispanic and for most of them, English is a second language. Half the students are failing every subject, with 55 percent skilled in reading and 7 percent proficient in math, officials said. In a proposal based on federal guidelines, Gallo asked teachers to work a longer school day of seven hours and tutor students weekly for one hour outside school time. She proposed teachers have lunch with students often, meet for 90 minutes every week to discuss education and set aside two weeks during summer break for paid professional development. A spokesman for the union said the teachers had accepted most of the changes, but wanted to work out compensation for the extra hours of work. The superintendent said the two sides could not agree on a pay rate. Under new federal requirements for school reform, low-performing schools have several options. One is called the transformation model, which includes a series of changes that teachers agree to adopt. When the negotiations on those changes failed at Central Falls High, the superintendent switched to another option: the turnaround model, which means firing every teacher at the troubled school. Kathy May, a teacher at Central Falls High, said she's disheartened. ""I feel like, after 20 years, I can see some progress beginning to be made. And I'm sad that we're not going to be around to follow that through, to push that forward."" Gallo, who said Rhode Island law says notice must be given by March 1, said the problem isn't solely the fault of teachers and it wasn't her preference to make the move. She indicated that some of the teachers might be rehired. ""When we had to move from the transformation model, the next best move was the turnaround model. And that requires us to remove the teachers and rehire, of those who reapply, up to 50 percent,"" she said. ""This is a major move, for a very significant reason, and that being that we couldn't hone in on the assurances we needed for the transformation model."" Asked what would happen if the teachers' union accepted the original terms, Gallo said it would be very difficult to go back, but can't be discounted. ""And if ... as we move forward, if indeed something of that effect comes around, then I still think we have a lot of doors that could be opened."" At a community rally before the school board meeting on Tuesday, supporters of the teachers slammed the plan. Jane Sessums, president of the Central Falls Teachers Union, said teachers have been unfairly targeted and scapegoated and the union will fight to have them reinstated. ""We want genuine reforms, not quick fixes that do nothing but create a wedge between teachers, our school and our community,"" said Sessums. She added that ""teachers have agreed to numerous solutions and reforms."" George McLaughlin, a guidance counselor who was fired along with his wife, a chemistry teacher, said the school  has been inaccurately cast as a place with low graduation rates. ""We have the most transient population in this state. Nobody comes close to us. So when they say that 50 percent of the people graduate, a very high percentage of our students leave our school. They return. They leave again. They go back to other countries,"" he said, noting that three times as many of the school's students are accepted to colleges now than they were five years ago. He also knocked the superintendent, saying she ""has been with us for a little more than three years."" If Gallo were willing to negotiate and listen to former Sen. Lincoln Chafee, who has offered to mediate, ""maybe we could resolve this instead of causing more trauma to us."" McLaughlin said the negotiations were about job security, not pay, and said the teachers are ready to resume talks.","Board votes to discharge all teachers, other educators at Central Falls High School .

The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Viewer discretion advised. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called ""the most dangerous place in the world."" A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children. One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns. Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in. The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem. See more stories on VBS.TV . Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand. The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s. These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army. This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations. But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government. For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.","VBS.TV gains rare access to gun market in Pakistani tribal area .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney's injury time header gave Manchester United a 3-1 victory over city rivals Manchester City to put them through to the English League Cup final 4-3 on aggregate. City won last week's first leg 2-1, courtesy of a double by former United striker Carlos Tevez, but the English champions brought the aggregate scores level early in the second half. Rooney sent Ryan Giggs racing clear with a superb cross-field pass. City's defence appeared to have halted the attack, but the ball eventually fell to Michael Carrick, whose pass found veteran midfielder Paul Scholes to fire past goalkeeper Shay Given. Then, with 20 minutes remaining, the tie looked settled when  Darren Fletcher laid a Nani pass into the path of Carrick who scored with a precision side-footed effort into the corner of the City goal. Tevez was jeered by the home fans, but the Argentine again showed what the Old Trafford club are missing when pulling a goal back five minutes later, flicking Craig Bellamy's cross powerfully home, ahead of defender Rio Ferdinand, to leave the tie poised for extra time. However, in the 91st minute, England forward Rooney -- who scored all four goals in United's victory over Hull on Saturday -- struck with a close range header from a Giggs to deny City a place in their first major final for 29 years. United will now face Aston Villa in a repeat of the 1994 League Cup final, looking to gain revenge for that particular 3-1 Wembley defeat.","Wayne Rooney's injury time header gives Manchester United a 3-1 victory over Manchester City .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Many fans will always remember where they were when they heard the ""King of Pop"" had died. The rapper The Game will always remember what he did afterward. The Game created a tribute to Michael Jackson -- video and all -- within a day of Jackson's death. That same day, Thursday, June 25, he rounded up some famous friends, recorded a song, shot a music video and got a Michael Jackson tattoo etched on his upper arm. Actually, he got the tattoo while he was in the studio recording the track. Some people know how to multitask. The tune, ""Better on the Other Side,"" isn't available for sale yet -- although he's hoping it will hit iTunes very soon. Because the record company was caught off guard, it is still playing catch-up. Game says all proceeds from the sale of the single will be donated to Michael Jackson's family. The companion music video is all over YouTube. In it, the 29-year-old shares the spotlight with Chris Brown, who sings the hook as a counterpoint to Game's rap. It's the first project Brown has appeared in since he pleaded guilty to assaulting his former girlfriend, Rihanna. The video, in various forms, had received more than 750,000 views as of Thursday evening -- not bad for less than a week in release. In the following interview, The Game (born Jayceon Taylor) recounts how the project came together -- with a little help from Lady Luck and the muse of Michael Jackson. CNN: You may be the first well-known artist to have a Michael Jackson tribute out there. The Game: I didn't want to wake up the next morning and have somebody spread a tribute all over the Internet, and I wasn't a part of it. So I decided to take matters into my own hands. CNN: Did you already have the beats pre-recorded? The Game: No. The first thing I did was call DJ Khalil ... and I told him, ""Yo, I need you in the studio, and by the time I get there, I need a Michael Jackson tribute song made [the music bed]. I need violinists, I need pianists, I need everyone in there for a production."" And then I started reaching out to Diddy. He's on a set 18 hours a day, but he said he'd get it done some way, somehow. Talked to Chris Brown. He and [his manager] Tina Davis said they were on their way to the studio -- so they told me after I do my part, to bring it over and Chris will do the hook. Before I took the beat over to Chris, Boyz II Men walked into the studio randomly -- so they took it to their studio next door, laid down all the background vocals. Then I took it to Mario [Winans], then I took it to Diddy. In the meantime, me and my boy Taydoe -- we running around to the hospital, to the Jacksons' house, to the star on Hollywood, getting all this [secondary] footage [for the video]. Crazy. CNN: This was the day he died, on Thursday? The Game: It was just the day. By Friday, everything was done -- video, everything. We did it in 15 hours.  Watch a report about Jackson's final days » . CNN: You made the music video for $500. The Game: All in tapes, $500 went to tapes, HD high-definition tapes. CNN: At the end of the video, you reveal a new tattoo. The Game: Yeah, I'll show you. I thought if I was going to get a Michael Jackson tattoo, I would get a more menacing one. (The tattoo shows the ""King of Pop"" with a bandanna over the lower half of his face.) CNN: Had you ever met Michael? The Game: I never met him in person, but he tried to mediate a truce between myself and Curtis Jackson [aka 50 Cent], and I wasn't having it at that time. CNN: How did that happen? Did somebody call you and say, ""Please hold the line for Michael Jackson?"" The Game: At first my managers called me and they said, ""Mike -- Michael Jackson -- is going to want to talk to you in an hour. Exactly an hour."" So I waited an hour, and I'm like chewing on my fingers in the hotel room ... and the phone rings and a guy comes on and he's got an English accent. He's like (affects an English accent), ""Hello Game, I have Michael Jackson on hold for you."" It was just cool. So Michael comes on, and ... he was like, ""Yo, it's Mike, and I'm a big fan of your music,"" and starts going into my songs, ""Hate it or Love It"" and ""How We Do."" And he's like, ""I'm a big fan of 50's -- every time I get in the car, I tell my driver to play 'In Da Club.' Would you guys be willing to make a truce, and then put it on my album?""  Listen to Jackson's biggest hits » . And then I was like, ""Yo Mike, we gotta slow down, man!"" This was at the height of me and 50's little beef, or whatever people called it, but I talked to him for another 35 minutes on why I couldn't do it at that time, and at that point in my career, and he was OK with that. He said one day if we decided to do it -- myself and Curtis' camp -- we could reach out to him. We never got a chance to do it. CNN: So the video also features Chris Brown. It's the first track we've heard him on since the hearing last Monday [June 22]. The Game: They were really edgy about getting on it. I think [his managers] wanted Chris Brown's first look to be kind of strategically thought out, and I came so fast with the Michael Jackson tribute -- but we talked it over, and at the end of the day, they thought it was a good idea, so we went ahead and did it. CNN: How is Chris? I'm sure you guys talk all the time. The Game: He's like a little brother to me. I talk to him all the time, and I give him my support. You know, I'm no stranger to trials and tribulations in life, and the court system. CNN: What are your thoughts about how Michael Jackson died, and how it seems as though prescription drugs may have been involved? The Game: My thoughts on Michael Jackson are always the same. It doesn't matter, the form or fashion he died in. He's iconic to me, and his untimely demise is felt around the world. You got certain people saying, ""Oh everybody's loving Michael now,"" but that's neither here nor there. Me, myself -- I loved Michael Jackson to death. My mom sent me a host of pictures with all my ""Thriller"" shirts on, and the jacket with the zippers and glove -- me, my sisters and brothers -- so I really don't care. I just know he left an impact on the world. I think he's the most cried-for human being since Jesus Christ. It's just my opinion. CNN: Are you thinking about donating part of the proceeds from the single? The Game: Oh, all the proceeds of anything that I do that has anything to do with Michael Jackson will go to his family and his children. And that's just the bottom line.","The Game records ""Better on the Other Side"" as tribute to Michael Jackson .

"(CNN) -- Scientists have found the oldest fossilized footprints made by a four-legged creature, forcing a rethink on when fish first crawled out of water and onto land. The discovery of the footprints in a former quarry in the Holy Cross Mountains in southeastern Poland are thought to be 395 million years old -- 18 million years older than the earliest tetrapod (a vertebrate with limbs rather than fins) body fossils. The report published Thursday in the science journal Nature says the footprints of the tetrapod measure up to 26 centimeters (10 inches) wide, which scientists say is indicative of an animal around 2.5 meters (7.5 feet) in length. The footprints are also 10 million years older than the earliest known elpistostegids -- creatures which displayed some animal characteristics but retained fins. Philippe Janvier from the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, the reviewer of the paper, told CNN: ""It is a really stunning discovery because it's the earliest evidence we have of tetrapods. These footprints are clear enough to attest that tetrapods were there 395 millions years ago."" The report's authors say their findings ""force a radical reassessment of the timing, ecology and environmental setting of the fish-tetrapod transition, as well as the completeness of the body fossil record."" As well as finding fossilized footprints, Per Ahlberg, professor of evolutionary organismal biology at Uppsala University in Sweden, and his co-authors from the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw also report finding several tracks of different sizes and characteristics. The tracks, they say, have distinctive ""hand"" and ""foot"" prints and no evidence of a dragging body. Ahlberg said in a video on the Nature Web site: ""The trackway shows pairs of prints -- the sort of tracks a salamander would leave if it walked. In order to make tracks like the ones found you need to have front legs and back legs that are about the same size."" Ahlberg said the disused quarry where the fossils were discovered has yielded some of the most exciting finds he has encountered in his career as a paleontologist. Although Janvier describes the lack of skeletal evidence as ""frustrating,"" it doesn't undermine the importance of the discovery. ""It changes what we thought about the evolutionary tree concerning the part dealing with transition from fish to land vertebrae."" Janvier said. ""The divergence between the tetrapods and their closest fish relatives is much younger than previously thought and it obliges us to find actual evidence -- skeletons or complete fossils -- in much earlier strata that could enlighten us between this divergence.""","Fossilized footprints of 395-million-year-old four-legged creature found in Poland .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani Taliban are waiting the weather out and will take on the military when winter arrives in Pakistan's tribal region, said Taliban leader Hakeemullah Mehsud in a phone call with CNN. ""We will wait till January for our offensive since we are stronger during the snowing season,"" Mehsud said. He told CNN he remains confident despite the large-scale military operation currently targeting him and his fighters in the province of South Waziristan. ""We have conserved our energy and have not lost our morale,"" he said. The leadership of his organization is safe, he said, but he didn't say where they are taking refuge. He neither denied nor confirmed that the Pakistani Taliban was responsible for Monday's suicide blast outside the district courthouse in Peshawar. ""Being occupied in other matters, I have not been able to contact my colleagues there, so I will not be able to take responsibility at this time,"" Mehsud said. Eleven people died and 36 were wounded in the Monday terror attack, according to a count by the hospital where victims were taken. Two of the dead were police officers.

(CNN) -- Nigeria joined Group C rivals Egypt in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after they completed a 3-0 victory over Mozambique on Wednesday. Osaze Odemwingie struck either side of halftime break for Nigeria at the Tundavala Stadium in Lubango before substitute Obafemi Martins sealed victory for the the 'Super Eagles'. Nigeria had enjoyed the majority of possession and took the lead moments before the interval when Odemwingie found space inside the penalty area. The Lokomotiv Moscow midfielder was able to take full advantage and rifled a low near-post shot past Mozambique goalkeeper Joao Rafael and into the net. Shuaibu Amodu's side doubled their lead two minutes after the break when the unmarked Odemwingie was able to control a cross from Yakubu Aiyegbeni and tap the ball home from close range. Everton striker Yakubu was substituted and replaced by Martins who got his name on the scoresheet five minutes from time. John Obi Mikel punished some sloppy Mozambique defending but lashed a shot straight at Rafael who parried the ball into Martins and he confidently stroked the ball home. Defending champions Egypt cruised into the knockout stages with a 100 percent record after a routine 2-0 victory over Benin which extended their unbeaten run in the Africa Cup of Nations to 16 games. Egypt coach Hassan Shehata rested key players Ahmed Fathi and Wael Gomaa but they still had too much quality for Benin and took the lead in the seventh minute with an audacious effort by Ahmed Al-Mohammadi. The defender lashed an ambitious shot from long range which caught Benin goalkeeper Yoann Djidonou off his line and dropped into the top-right corner of the net. Egypt doubled their lead in the 23rd minute when Emad Motaeb was able to bundle the ball home from close range after Ahmed Raouf's header had been parried by Djidonou. The win ensured the 'Pharaohs' qualified with nine points at the top of Group C and Nigeria went through with six while Benin and Mozambique end their campaigns with just a point apiece.,"Nigeria joined Group C rivals Egypt in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after they completed a 3-0 victory over Mozambique.

"(CNN) -- Investigators expanded their search into Texas Monday for a 7-year-old girl who was reported missing after her mother was found dead in Oklahoma Sunday night. Authorities also are trying to find the dead woman's estranged husband, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. The girl -- Aja Daniell Johnson -- was reported missing from Geronimo, Oklahoma, late Sunday, the bureau said. Her mother, Tonya Hobbs, 37, was found dead inside a parked RV Sunday night, the bureau said. Hobbs and her daughter were visiting Hobbs' estranged husband, Lester William Hobbs, at his sister's home, the bureau said. Lester Hobbs, 46, and Aja are missing and are presumed to be in Hobbs' car, said investigators who issued an Amber Alert to try to find her. Lester Hobbs is not Aja's biological father, police said. Texas authorities also issued an Amber Alert, Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman Lisa Block said. Authorities believe Hobbs has connections to Rockport, Texas, and the alert was issued preemptively, she said. Tonya Hobbs and her daughter were last seen Saturday night. Authorities did not say how Hobbs died, but the bureau said investigators believe someone killed her. The RV belonged to Lester Hobbs, and was parked at his relatives' home, Richard Goss, agent in charge of the state bureau of investigation's Lawton, Oklahoma, office, told reporters Monday. Hobbs' relatives became suspicious Sunday after they did not see Tanya Hobbs or Aja, and one of them pried open the door and discovered Tanya Hobbs' body, he said. Lester Hobbs and Aja were gone, Goss said. The Hobbses were separated, but apparently Tanya Hobbs was visiting Lester Hobbs in an attempt to reconcile, Goss said. The couple had been together for about five years. A medical examiner was performing an autopsy, the bureau said, and police want to question Lester Hobbs about the death. He and the girl are believed to be traveling in his car, a white 1992 Toyota Paseo with Oklahoma tag number 577-BPW. The two-door car has no hubcaps, and the rear passenger window is covered in plastic, the bureau said. The Comanche County, Oklahoma, Sheriff's Office said Aja has a medical condition that requires medication. ""Our main concern at this time is to find the little girl,"" Sheriff Kenny Stradley told reporters. ""We know that she does need some medication,"" and authorities were checking leads regarding that, he said. He did not specify Aja's medical condition. Goss said Lester Hobbs has an extensive criminal history but did not elaborate. The Sheriff's Office said he had prior felony convictions. Lester Hobbs was supposed to appear in court in Lincoln County, Oklahoma, on a DUI charge, Goss said, and did not appear, so a warrant has been issued for him. Aja's biological father was awarded emergency custody of her in November, according to Oklahoma County District Court documents obtained by CNN affiliate KWTV of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. At a hearing, Tonya Hobbs -- identified as Tonya Dunkin in the documents -- and the girl's father, John Johnson, agreed that she would have supervised visitation with Aja and keep the girl away from Lester Hobbs, the documents said. Aja is 4 feet tall and weighs 59 pounds, Goss said. She has brown eyes, and her hair is brown with the ends dyed black. Lester Hobbs is about 6-foot-1 and 190 pounds, with hazel eyes and brown hair, according to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation. The agency released a picture of him and said he has a mustache but no longer has a goatee. Geronimo is about 12 miles south of Lawton, Oklahoma, in the south-central part of the state.","NEW: Amber Alert issued as authorities extend search into Texas .

"(CNN) -- The father of American figure skater Nancy Kerrigan is dead and her brother is behind bars, accused of assault and battery against 70-year old Daniel Kerrigan, according to Massachusetts authorities. Daniel Kerrigan died Sunday after being taken by emergency personnel from his family home in Stoneham, Massachusetts, to a hospital, authorities said. His son Mark, 45, was arraigned Monday and pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged assault. According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley, police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. Sunday from Brenda Kerrigan, wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan. Keeley told Middlesex District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment Monday for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son, resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor. Keeley said that Mark Kerrigan told authorities ""that he did in fact have an argument with his father, the argument became physical, he grabbed his father around the neck, and at some point the father collapsed to the floor."" The Middlesex District Attorney's office said Monday that authorities were still investigating the ""entirety of the circumstances of the incident,"" along with the cause and manner of death. The county medical examiner is expected to release a report within a couple of weeks. According to Keeley, police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house, ""clearly intoxicated"" and ""extremely combative."" He refused to comply with police officers, said Keeley, and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home. Mark Kerrigan wept softly during Monday's arraignment. His attorney, Denise Moore, told the judge that Kerrigan was in grief and ""quite distraught about his father's death."" Through his attorney, Mark Kerrigan denied any responsibility in the death. Moore said in court that Mark Kerrigan was unemployed, was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents. He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress, apparently from his time in the Army, Moore said. Despite appeals from his attorney, Sullivan ordered Kerrigan held on $10,000 cash bail. His next court appearance is expected to be February 24. Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. In 1994 she earned an Olympic silver medal in Lillehammer, Norway. But she is perhaps best remembered for surviving an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding's ex-husband and an accomplice. Through a spokeswoman on Tuesday, the Kerrigan family released a statement saying: ""Dan Kerrigan was a wonderful husband for 47 years, a caring and loving father to his daughter Nancy and two sons, Michael and Mark, and a grandfather of eight. ... The family's focus is on mourning Dan and honoring his life and many contributions."" CNN's Vanessa Juarez contributed to this report.","Violent argument and struggle between father and son results in elder Kerrigan falling .

"(CNN) -- A man on trial for gunning down a Kansas abortion provider in church said he had no regrets because ""abortion is murder."" Scott Roeder, 51, said he shot and killed Dr. George Tiller as services began on May 31 to save the lives of the unborn. ""There was nothing being done and the legal process had been exhausted, and these babies were dying every day,"" Roeder said. ""I did what I thought was needed to be done to protect the children."" Roeder is charged with one count of first-degree murder for the death of Tiller, who ran a women's clinic in Wichita where abortions were performed, including the controversial late-term procedure. Roeder was the only witness for the defense, which rested its case Thursday. Sedgwick County District Judge Warren Wilbert told jurors closing arguments will be held Friday morning, depending on the weather. After the jury left, Wilbert ruled that the jury could not consider convicting Roeder of the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter, which is defined as ""an unreasonable but honest belief that circumstances existed that justified deadly force"" under Kansas statute. Wilbert said testimony did not support the defense claim that Roeder's beliefs on abortion justified the use of deadly force against Tiller. Tiller, 67, was one of the few U.S. doctors who performed late-term abortions. He had already survived one attempt on his life and a clinic bombing before he was slain. During Roeder's testimony Thursday, Tiller's widow, Jeanne, and other family members sat in the gallery. Initially stoic, they began to dab at tears as Roeder described putting a gun to Tiller's head. Asked if he regretted what he did, Roeder said, ""No, I don't."" Upon learning that Tiller's clinic was shut down after his death, he said he felt ""a sense of relief."" Dressed in a dark suit, white shirt and a red patterned tie, Roeder calmly testified that he had a long-standing belief that Tiller should die. He thought about different ways to kill the doctor -- driving a car into him, perhaps, or shooting him with a rifle. His main concern, Roeder said, was that he might harm others. Under cross-examination by Sedgwick County District Attorney Nola Foulston, he said he also considered cutting Tiller's hands off with a sword, but decided that would not be effective, as Tiller would still be able to train others. Roeder said that through the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue he learned that Tiller took measures to protect himself -- traveling in an armored car, using a security escort, wearing a bulletproof vest and living in a gated community. He decided to kill Tiller at his church, he said, because ""I felt that actually if he was to be stopped, that was probably the only place he could have been stopped. ... It was the only window of opportunity I saw."" Roeder said he visited the church four or five times before Tiller's death. The week before the shooting, on May 24, he carried a .22-caliber handgun with him, he testified, but Tiller did not attend church that day. On May 31, though, the doctor was greeting congregants in the foyer of Reformation Lutheran Church before Roeder walked up to him and shot him at point blank range. ""The lives of those children were in imminent danger if someone did not stop George Tiller,"" Roeder said. ""I shot him."" Under questioning from Foulston, Roeder acknowledged that he ""somewhat"" admired those who previously had committed violence against abortion providers. He said his anti-abortion beliefs ""go hand in hand"" with his religious beliefs. He said he became born again in 1992 after watching an episode of ""The 700 Club."" Asked if there are any circumstances in which he believes abortion is acceptable, Roeder said he thought it could be if the mother's life was in ""absolute"" danger. ""I struggle with that decision,"" he said, ""because I believe that ultimately, it is up to our heavenly father. But if there was a time, that would be it."" He said he did not believe abortion was justified in the case of rape. ""You are taking the life of the innocent. You're punishing the innocent life for the sin of the father. Two wrongs don't make a right."" Asked about incest, he said his beliefs were the same: ""It isn't our duty to take life, it's our heavenly father's."" Roeder's testimony was peppered with objections from prosecutors. Many objections were sustained by Wilbert, who has maintained he does not want the trial to become a forum on abortion. In a conference out of the presence of jurors, Wilbert cautioned Roeder, saying specifics on medical procedures would not be allowed. Roeder's testimony would proceed, Wilbert said, ""on a question-by-question basis."" Roeder recounted conducting what he called ""sidewalk counseling"" at Kansas City abortion clinics, handing pamphlets and other literature to women as they went inside. ""Some of them did ultimately change their mind,"" he said. In opening statements Thursday, defense attorney Steve Osburn told jurors Roeder ""killed Dr. Tiller because he believed that was the only way, necessary to save the lives of the unborn."" Defense attorneys claim Roeder was also motivated by authorities' failure to punish him through the judicial system. Wilbert refused to allow former Kansas Attorney General Phill Kline to testify on behalf of the defense. On Wednesday, he refused to allow testimony from current Deputy Attorney General Barry Disney. Kline unsuccessfully attempted to prosecute Tiller in 2006. Disney charged Tiller with 19 misdemeanor counts, but a jury acquitted the doctor. Wilbert said Roeder can testify about the cases and how they affected his beliefs, but to allow testimony from Kline would ""get into legal matters that do not concern this jury."" And, the judge said, the cases do not give Roeder a basis to state absolutely that Tiller's actions were illegal, since the doctor had never been convicted. Roeder testified he was ""very frustrated"" by Tiller's acquittal, saying it ""seemed like that was the last attempt by the state of Kansas to find if there was anything at all going on illegally in George Tiller's clinic."" Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, told reporters outside the courtroom the trial is ""a railroad, a kangaroo court, where they are denying critical evidence about what was on Scott Roeder's mind when he pulled the trigger."" ""Perhaps if the Sedgwick County prosecutors had done a better job prosecuting Tiller for how he illegally killed babies, he would still be alive,"" Terry said.","NEW: Judge rules jury cannot consider manslaughter charge for abortion provider's shooter .

"Washington (CNN) -- At the end of his career, former House Speaker Tip O'Neill was asked how Congress had changed between the 1950s and 1980s. O'Neill answered: ""The people are better. The results are worse."" Watching last week's health summit, you see what O'Neill meant. The conversation was intelligent, civil, well-informed. It also predictably achieved nothing. How could it? Deals are never reached in front of the television camera. Take this quiz. Name the most important legislation enacted in the 30 years between 1950 and 1980. Overwhelming isn't it? Civil rights. Voting rights. Interstate highways. Medicare. Medicaid. The deregulation of the airlines, natural gas, trucking, rail and oil. The immigration act of 1965. Clean Air, Clean Water, and the Endangered Species Acts. Supplemental Security Income in 1974. I could fill the whole screen. Now ... the next 30 years. There's the Reagan tax cuts of course. Deregulation of the savings & loans in 1982. The Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. Welfare reform in 1995. Medicare Part D. What else? Leave aside whether you are liberal or conservative, whether you approve the measures mentioned above or disapprove. It's hard to dispute: Congress just got a lot more done in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s than in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. Why? You hear many grand, sweeping explanations. Let's try just one simple one. Congress in the first period was controlled by a handful of committee chairmen, who owed their positions to seniority. The committees did their work in secret. Bills written in committee typically could not be amended on the floor of Congress. The institution was authoritarian, hierarchical, opaque. And stuff passed. In the mid-1970s, Congress underwent a revolution. The power of the committee chairmen was broken. The number of subcommittees proliferated. The committees met in public. Amendments multiplied. Congress become more open, more egalitarian, more responsive. And stuff ceased to pass. Again and again, today's gridlock can be traced to yesterday's reform. Is the filibuster grinding Congress to a halt? Before the 1970s, filibusters were both very rare and very difficult. But when Congress took action to make filibusters easier to break, it inadvertently made them easier to use. Back in the 1950s, a filibuster would bring the entire Senate to a halt, as the filibustering Senator talked and talked and talked. A filibuster was both spectacularly visible and personally exhausting: it exacted a high price from the filibustering senator. Then Congress took action to make filibusters easier to break, requiring only 60 votes instead of 67. But that same deal made them much easier to start. No need to speechify all night; no colleagues enraged that the filibustering senator has paralyzed the chamber. Today, a filibustering senator need only notify the majority leader of his intention. The filibustered legislation is sidetracked until 60 votes are found to enact it, while other business continues as normal. The price of the filibuster has been drastically cut. No surprise we get more of them. Candidates consumed by fundraising? Two generations ago, candidates barely raised money at all. Once nominated, a candidate would turn to his party apparatus to provide the money and expertise needed to contest an election. But the maximum contribution by a party organization was capped in the 1940s, and it has not been raised significantly since. This cap was supposed to clean up politics by weakening party bosses. Instead, it has forced every individual member of Congress to spend the bulk of his or her time begging for funds -- the very opposite of clean politics. Lobbyists everywhere? In 1950, a lobbyist who wanted a tax measure would have very few targets. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee could help, ditto the ranking member of the opposition party. The senior members of the Senate Finance Committee would likewise be worth talking to. Maybe some of the upper level officials at Treasury. The days of concentrated power have ended. Today, almost any one of the 535 members of Congress could help -- and so of course the interests must employ many more lobbyists to woo them all. Congress utterly polarized? Once upon a time, members of Congress did their business mostly in secret. They struck quiet  deals with each other. A Republican might support a Democratic labor measure in return for some discreet help with a farm bill. Today, everything happens in the bright glare of sunshine, policed by hundreds of ideological interest groups. Deviate one step from the party line, and you are a traitor, a sell-out, an enemy. Just ask Scott Brown, yesterday's Republican hero, today a villain for voting against the filibuster of a jobs bill. We have an ideology that more publicity, more transparency, more openness must improve Congress. And when each successive wave of openness makes things worse, we tell ourselves that the answer is even more publicity, transparency and openness still. No contrary evidence makes any impression. Seems like everything's open -- except our minds.

"Wichita, Kansas (CNN) -- In situations like the dire humanitarian crisis that has followed Tuesday's earthquake in Haiti, we all are forced to witness what is the sometimes painful truth behind the cliché about it taking a village to raise a child. In the tragedy unfolding before us now, it will take a global village. President Obama and former presidents, along with other leaders and representatives of humanitarian organizations, have reminded us of this. We would like to add our own small, humble contribution to the efforts under way around the world to help the people of Haiti. In particular, we would like to draw your attention to the many children who were living in Haitian orphanages when the earthquake hit. As we have heard from professionals devoted to children's issues, children are among the most vulnerable segments of a population subject to natural disasters and humanitarian crises. It is not hard to imagine that orphans living in institutional care might often be even more vulnerable. Watch couple's interview with Anderson Cooper . Right now, orphanages across Port-au-Prince are struggling to provide the most basic necessities to the children in their care. But right now, all Haitians in the capital are struggling to do this. What makes Haiti's orphans different is that they have no families to take care of them, and no hope of reuniting with their families. Except for the orphanages' staff members, most of whom have families of their own to which they rightly must divide their attention, these children have no one. iReport: Looking for loved ones in Haiti . Our adoptive son, Alexander, is one of the children without a family. He was left, just hours after his birth, near a hospital in Cité Soleil and, with the permission of Haiti's Institut du Bien-Être Social et de Recherches, brought to one of the homes of the Brebis de Saint-Michel de L'Attalaye orphanage in Port-au-Prince. He was named after one of the American volunteers, Alison McMutrie, who works alongside Haitian staff to care for orphaned children. Ti Ali, or Little Ali, is 17 months old, and Big Ali is about 21. Ali and the rest of the BRESMA staff have been the only family Alexander has ever known. And although we will never know for sure, especially not after the earthquake, anything about her, we firmly believe that his birth mother loved Alexander and did what was in her power to ensure that he would have a brighter future than she could provide. Hers was, we believe, an act of sacrifice, but it was also an act of hope and trust -- hope that the world would be kind to Alexander, perhaps even despite her own experience, and trust that someone would love him as much as she does. Though she will never know us, the faith that she has placed, even indirectly, in us is quite simply astounding. Or at least it was until Tuesday. Now, we imagine that we share another bond with her: We would willingly make whatever personal sacrifice we have to to save Alexander's life. As parents who are adopting across national, linguistic and cultural boundaries, we are sensitive to all of the complicated issues that arise in international adoption, and we support both the integrity of Haitian families and the commitment to finding loving homes for children who are in need of them. Since being matched with Alexander in April, we have traveled to Haiti four times to get to know him and the country of his birth. Each successive trip impressed upon us more and more the dignity of the Haitian people and the sense of commitment they show for each other. From what we have seen of the people of Haiti when we have been there with Alex, they care deeply about all children -- orphans and those still living with their families. Many likely would help the orphans through this crisis if they could, but they simply cannot. As Alexander's mother put her trust in the people who, as fate would have it, turned out to be us, we are placing our trust in others to join our efforts to secure the life of our child and the rest of the orphans of Haiti. This is no longer an adoption matter. It's a matter of life and death. We have been told by the BRESMA staff that the children living in orphanages before the quake need to be evacuated from Haiti to save their lives. We are aware that evacuating these children under such circumstances is temporary and might affect our adoption proceedings, potentially negatively. We also understand that it could mean that Alexander will never live in the home we have waiting for him. But he's our son, and we want him to live. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jean Griffith and Ross Haskell.","In Haiti crisis, children are most vulnerable and orphans most of all .
Authors are in the process of adopting Alexander, a 17-month-old orphan in Port-au-Prince .
Children in Haitian orphanages need to be evacuated, according to staff of institution .
Priority is saving the life of Alexander and his fellow orphans, the authors say ."

"(CNN) -- The first passenger plane equipped with a system to repel shoulder-fired missiles successfully completed its flight, a British defense and aerospace company announced Wednesday. The system aims to protect against fire from missile launchers like these, which were used to fire at an Israeli plane. The JetEye infrared missile-defense system was tested on an American Airlines flight that took off July 11, according to a  statement from BAE Systems. The plane flew from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport to Los Angeles International Airport in California, the company said. The JetEye system works by detecting the heat-seeking missiles and then firing a laser, which diverts the missile. American Airlines refused to make the system mandatory on all trips but agreed to cooperate with the tests. The flight represents the final phase of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Counter-Man-Portable Air Defense System program, designed to test the suitability of missile-protection equipment for commercial aircraft. Previously, the technology was successfully evaluated on an American Airlines test aircraft and an ABX Air Inc. cargo aircraft. The missile-protection equipment will be installed on two more American Airlines 767-200 aircraft for daily cross-country flights through March. Engineers will evaluate the system's maintainability and reliability, as well as its suitability for the airline industry. No missiles will be fired at these flights. ""BAE Systems worked closely with DHS and the airline industry to develop an effective response to potential terrorist threats,"" said Burt Keirstead, JetEye program director for BAE Systems in Nashua, New Hampshire. Homeland Security officials said in January that there is no specific threat of these weapons being fired at planes. However, Taliban forces successfully used shoulder-fired missiles against Soviet helicopters in Afghanistan. Terrorists tried in 2002 to shoot down an Israeli passenger jet in Kenya with them. Insurgents hit a cargo plane in Baghdad the following year, but the plane landed safely. Experts say that about 500,000 to 700,000 shoulder-fired missile weapons have been produced worldwide, and some have been purchased in Middle Eastern and Central Asian arms markets for as little as $5,000. Since 2003, Congress has pressured Homeland Security to adapt military anti-MANPADS technology to commercial aviation. BAE Systems, based in Farnborough, England, works with American Airlines Maintenance and Engineering Services, which provided the test aircraft and engineering services for the development of JetEye. DHS awarded BAE Systems a $29 million contract in January for this final evaluation phase of the program, which calls for the planes to log about 7,000 flight hours. Northrop Grumman, a defense company with its own system to protect planes from portable missiles, urged the Defense Department in March to install its system on commercial flights that take soldiers and equipment to war zones. Jack Pledger, a Northrop Grumman executive, said in March that 27 terrorist groups are believed to possess shoulder-fired weapons, that aircraft are vulnerable to the missiles within 25 miles of airports and that one missile incident could have catastrophic effects on the U.S. economy. In March, the Northrop system concluded a 14-month test during which anti-missile systems were installed on 11 FedEx cargo planes that flew 4,500 flights.","System detects heat-seeking missiles, then emits a laser to divert the missile .

"Wichita, Kansas (CNN) -- Major King remembers a time before the abortion debate came to his hometown, a time when Wichita, Kansas, was known as the air capital of the world. Manufacturers such as Learjet, Cessna and Beechcraft were the backbone of a tight-knit community where God-fearing folks like King would canoe after school in the Arkansas River and drag the streets ""in slick cars with a nice-looking honey"" on weekends. Times have changed, says King, 70, a retired oil refinery worker who also spent time at Cessna. ""Now, Wichita's known as the abortion capital of the world."" It's a label shunned by many Wichitans, regardless of their views on abortion. They'd rather be known for the restaurants and entertainment venues, quality schools and affordable housing that make Wichita one of the nation's ""best-kept secrets,"" King says. But the May 31, 2009, slaying of Dr. George Tiller, a prominent abortion provider gunned down in church during Sunday services, focused national attention back on Wichita and its role in one of the most divisive legal and social controversies of our times. It faded for a time, as Tiller's death led to the closure of Wichita's last abortion clinic, and activists on both sides shifted their focus elsewhere. But the trial of Tiller's admitted shooter, Scott Roeder, again stirred talk of abortion in the bars and coffee shops of a city where most have steeled themselves for years against noisy protests and graphic images of fetuses. Roeder was convicted Friday of first-degree murder. After the jury's swift verdict -- they deliberated for just  37 minutes -- many in Wichita are hoping the abortion controversy will fade. ""After he receives his sentence on March 9 --  preferably the Hard 50, as District Attorney Nola Foulston is requesting -- he'll also get the consequence. And then may we never hear from him again,"" blogged an editorial writer for the local newspaper, The Wichita Eagle. ""Maybe this will get things back to normal now, seeing as there's not much reason for abortion to be such a big issue now that the trial's over,"" King says. ""And, now there is no more abortion in Wichita, either, because the doctor is gone."" To Troy Macormac, Tiller's death already signified the end of Wichita's reputation as the world's abortion capital, albeit through deplorable means. ""I'm really not for abortion ... so it's kind of a fence-riding deal,"" says Macormac, a brick mason who grew up in Wichita. ""But I feel he has a right to have a business and provide for his family and take care of his business the way he wants to take care of it. That's his right as being an American."" For years, demonstrators maintained a constant presence outside Tiller's Women's Health Services clinic, a nondescript, cream-colored building of cement and brick facing Kellogg Avenue -- the city's major east-west corridor. ""People got tired,"" says Lorrie Donham, a middle school science teacher. ""The only way it really affected me was when I'd have to drive down Kellogg with my young daughters and have them be exposed to these grotesque, brutal images."" The turmoil also spread to Tiller's congregation at Reformation Lutheran Church, where he was ultimately shot to death. ""They knew what service Dr. Tiller generally attended and they would come out there full-blown with their babies in arms and huge imagery of damaged fetuses,"" said Teresa Mora, a member of the congregation who identifies herself as pro-choice. ""It got to the point we had to set up partitions so children could exit family vehicles and go into church without having to be exposed to so much of that imagery."" Frosted glass was installed on the church's windows, added Mora. The controversy made Tiller a symbol of hope for the abortion rights movement and a formidable foe of abortion opponents. He received repeated death threats and survived a shooting, a clinic bombing, criminal trials and two grand juries intended to put him out of business. Wichita's abortion activism peaked during 1991's ""Summer of Mercy,"" when tens of thousands on both sides of the debate gathered in Kansas to stage protests. ""What bothered me is that it wasn't Wichita people stirring the pot, so to speak. It wasn't Wichitans having conflicts with Wichitans. It was somebody from outside Wichita coming in and stirring the pot,"" said Donham, the middle school science teacher. ""I think everyone felt the same way at that time,"" she added. ""There are other things going on, but our resources, the city was having to extend coverage by local law enforcement, just to have a presence and keep the peace. It was an expensive, aggravating time."" It was not the first time a conservative social movement claimed the south central Kansas town as its staging ground. Early in the 20th century, Carrie Nation, a voluble evangelist who helped establish the Medicine Lodge, Kansas, chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, brought her fight to Wichita. She became a local legend after using a rock and a pool ball to smash up the Carey House, a downtown bar. Since then, the former trading post and cattle-drive destination has grown into a sprawling metropolitan area of more than 600,000. It covers four counties of flat suburban landscape criss-crossed by railroad tracks about 200 miles southeast of Kansas City . An assortment of newer, upscale subdivisions and stately homes a few blocks from older craftsmen and ranch-style homes underscore the city's evolving landscape. Much of modern Wichita's growth has been spurred by the airline industry, along with successful entrepreneurial ventures such as Coleman, Koch Industries and Pizza Hut, and three universities. A new arena recently opened, and a revitalization of Wichita's ""Old Town"" has produced many new bars, high-end restaurants and entertainment venues in the city center. But lifelong residents like Major King still gather in the same coffee shops they patronized when they were younger, like the Riverside Cafe, a cozy diner that has changed hands several times but where you can still find breakfast specials for $4.99. ""Wichita's still a good place to raise a family, but it's not the same,"" he said on a recent morning as his brother, Thomas, sat across the table, nodding his head. ""You could say it's grown too big for its britches."" After the Summer of Mercy, things mostly quieted down, resurfacing with an occasional protest that drew national media coverage, or a periodic extreme act directed at Tiller. He was shot outside his clinic in 1993 by Shelley Shannon, who has voiced support for Roeder from prison. Tiller's slaying last year led to the closure of his clinic, which was Wichita's last abortion clinic. Mark Gietzen, an anti-abortion activist and long-time Wichitan, started Kansas Coalition for Life in 1993, making the closure of ""Tiller's the Killer's"" clinic one of his main goals. ""He has pretty much always been the focus of our efforts because he's always been the late-term abortionist. He was known not only nationwide but worldwide. People came from all over the world to see him,"" said Gietzen. An upbeat man who runs Kansas Coalition for Life and a Christian dating service from the basement of his suburban Wichita home, Geitzen has posted a sign on his driveway that greets visitors with the message, ""Thou shalt not kill"" on one side. The other side reads, ""If you no longer feel close to God, ask yourself, 'Who moved?'"" ""We had 650 volunteers that were involved in the continuous presence at Tiller's gate, offering help to the women that were going in,"" Gietzen said, adding that his group had a ""save"" rate of about 3.5 unborn babies per month. Like many anti-abortion organizations across the country, Gietzen has denounced Roeder's use of violence, calling it a blow to the movement and its credibility. He says anti-abortion groups in Wichita were only months away from shutting Tiller down through official channels. The debate over health care policy has mobilized his group's efforts to lobby politicians and gather signatures on the Web site, abortionisnothealthcare.com. ""I don't have time to think about Scott Roeder because we're too busy trying to keep abortion out of health care,"" he said. Next to the building that once housed Tiller's clinic, a pregnancy counseling clinic called Choices has no plans to close. In fact, since Tiller's death, Choices has seen an increase in clients, spokeswoman Marilyn Manweiller said. ""We will continue to provide services to women as long as they keep coming through our doors,"" she said. Abortion rights activists such as Mora are determined to see a new abortion clinic open in Wichita eventually. ""Dr. Tiller's death kind of forces us to keep going, to make noise and fight so there is a safe and legal option,"" she says. ""He was a hero for all women. He fought for us."" But to Donham, Tiller's death may further strain the bonds of a once tight-knit community. Wichita has endured other violent crimes, including the BTK serial killer Dennis Rader, who evaded authorities for 30 years. Still, Tiller's death within the sacred confines of a church struck a deep chord. ""What does this say for your openness to others? Do we have to lock the church narthex after service begins or check your ID at the door?"" she says. ""[Roeder's] biggest impact is going to be he caused us to be suspicious of each other. Unfortunately, I think it makes you even more hesitant to embrace a stranger.""","Some say abortion provider's death marks end of Wichita's reputation as ""abortion capital""

"Richmond, California (CNN) -- Four teenagers were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the alleged gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on a high school campus after a homecoming dance. Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as over 14 years old, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. Two other juveniles, Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter, appeared with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court, but did not enter a plea. The court described Morales as under 16, and did not give an age for Peter. All three juveniles, who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing, were charged as adults. A fourth individual, Manuel Ortega, 19, appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea. He did not wear a protective vest. The four are accused of taking part in what police said was a 2½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus, in the Richmond community north of Oakland on San Francisco Bay. All of those arraigned are due back in court on November 5. Another adult was arrested in connection with the October 24 attack, but has a different court date than the others. Police said as many as 10 people were involved in the assault in a dimly lit back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911. The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition but was released Wednesday.","Cody Ray Smith pleads not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Miss California USA Carrie Prejean has assured pageant officials that a lingerie modeling photo published online this week is the only one she posed for, the state pageant director said. Miss California USA Carrie Prejean may lose her crown because of some semi-nude photos she appeared in. But the Web site that published the first picture said it has several more that it will ""slowly roll out"" starting Wednesday afternoon. The possibility that racier images could emerge prompted ""closed-door meetings"" Tuesday to consider stripping Prejean of her beauty queen title, pageant spokesman Ron Neal said. Although Neal said Prejean ""breached her contract"" by keeping the semi-nude photo or photos a secret, the only picture published so far appears about as revealing as the bikini Prejean wore in the pageant's swimsuit competition. ""We have been told by Carrie Prejean there are no other photos other than the one circulating in existence. She should know better than anyone,"" Miss California USA Director Keith Lewis said Wednesday. The 21-year-old Miss USA contestant has been the center of controversy since she declared her opposition to same-sex marriage in a response to a question on the national pageant stage last month. She finished as runner-up to Miss USA. In a statement given to CNN Tuesday, Prejean said the photos -- and she did use the plural -- were being used in a ""vicious and mean-spirited"" effort to silence her for ""defending traditional marriage."" While she vowed to ""continue to support and defend marriage as the honorable institution it is,"" Prejean may be doing so without the Miss California USA title. State pageant officials met Tuesday with lawyers and representatives of Donald Trump, who owns the international competition, to consider if they had grounds to take the crown away from Prejean, according to Neal. ""When you compete for Miss California, you're supposed to disclose whether you posed for nude or semi-nude photos because it's grounds for disqualification,"" he said. CNN obtained a copy of the pageant contract Prejean signed last year in which she agreed that the discovery of semi-nude photos could mean disqualification. The only photo made public shows Prejean -- who said she was 17 at the time -- wearing pink panties and no top. She is turned away from the camera, with her arm hiding most of her breast. It was unclear if pageant officials would consider this a semi-nude photo, in light of their standard requirement that contestants parade across stage wearing a bikini that arguably shows more bare skin. But the other shoe -- or other garment -- may be yet to drop. Nik Richie -- of TheDirty.com -- said he has waited for an upgrade of his Web site's servers to handle the flood of traffic he expects will come after he posts the additional photos. ""I will slowly roll these out,"" Richie said. The next image will likely be published Wednesday afternoon, he said. ""We'll see what happens with those and we want to know who's releasing them,"" Neal said. Shanna Moakler, the co-executive director of the Miss California USA organization, will meet with Tami Farrell, the runner-up for the title, ""to discuss the possible next steps,"" Neal said. Prejean defended the photos, which she said were taken when she was a teenager aspiring to be a Victoria's Secret model. ""I am a Christian, and I am a model,"" she said. ""Models pose for pictures, including lingerie and swimwear photos."" She said the photos ""have been released surreptitiously to a tabloid Web site that openly mocks me for my Christian faith."" ""I am not perfect, and I will never claim to be,"" she said. ""But these attacks on me and others who speak in defense of traditional marriage are intolerant and offensive. While we may not agree on every issue, we should show respect for others' opinions and not try to silence them through vicious and mean-spirited attacks."" Her publicist, Melany Ethridge, confirmed a comment she gave to celebrity Web site TMZ in which she said Prejean was just 17 when she posed for the photos, hoping they would land her a modeling job. ""In her naivete, an agent convinced her to pose for this photo to submit to a lingerie company, claiming they could make her the next Victoria's Secret model,"" Ethridge told TMZ. ""She has since learned what a lie that was, and what a mistake it was to have the photo taken."" Prejean announced last week that she would star in a new $1.5 million ad campaign supporting what she termed ""opposite marriage"" (marriage between a man and a woman) funded by the National Organization for Marriage. ""Marriage is good,"" Prejean said at a news conference announcing the ad campaign. ""There is something special about unions of husband and wife. Unless we bring men and women together, children will not have mothers and fathers."" CNN's Aileen Martinez contributed to this report.","Miss California USA Carrie Prejean says she posed for one semi-nude photo .

"(CNN) -- Maybe marriage to Kate Winslet isn't all that bad. Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski star as a couple on the road in the comedy ""Away We Go."" After cruelly dissecting marital malaise in ""American Beauty"" and again, just six months ago, in ""Revolutionary Road,"" Winslet's husband Sam Mendes takes a slightly more optimistic view of family life in the edgy comedy ""Away We Go."" Not that he's offering a whole-hearted endorsement of the institution. Burt and Verona (John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph) aren't legally bound -- she staunchly resists his repeated proposals -- but nevertheless they're a couple about to go nuclear: She's six months pregnant. He sells insurance to insurance companies. She's an illustrator with a lucrative line in anatomical drawings. Nevertheless, they're struggling to make ends meet. ""Are we losers?"" wonders Verona (only she uses a more colorful expression). ""We have cardboard windows... I think we must be."" Insomuch as they have a plan at all, it hinges on the support they're expecting from Burt's doting parents. So it's a nasty wake-up call when Jerry and Gloria (Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara) announce they're taking off for a new life in Belgium -- yes, even before the baby's out. There is a silver lining: Realizing they no longer have any reason to stay, Burt and Verona decide to widen their horizons. They could move to Arizona where Verona's sister lives. Burt has a job prospect in Madison, Wisconsin. Or they have college friends in Montreal. Their destiny awaits them, all they have to do is go out and find it. And away they go. Although the couple racks up a good few miles in their search for home, the movie doesn't betray much interest in location. Arizona is hot and arid. In Montreal they pour gravy on French fries. Don't expect cultural insights. It's never explained how these stragglers can afford such speculative wandering, and when they do find their dream home it's mystifying that it hasn't occurred to them before. Still, the movie's loose-limbed, spontaneous quality is a good part of its appeal, and a refreshing change of pace from other movies by Mendes, whose artfully designed compositions often seem self-conscious and painfully detached. In keeping with Indie-wood's vogue for shuffling snide satire and sentimentality (see ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine""), ""Away We Go"" presents its trepidatious travelers with half a dozen starkly contrasted parental figures, including Allison Janney's monstrously vulgar alcoholic, Maggie Gyllenhaal's radical earth-mother (who has shortened her name to ""LN""), and Paul Schneider as Burt's rawly dumped brother, who wonders aloud if it would be wrong to tell his daughter her mom has been murdered. There's a level of bile here that some audiences may find alienating -- I can't see it being a big hit in Phoenix -- but Dave Eggers' and Vendela Vida's writing is a cut above the average, and it's performed with gusto. They may not be the most dynamic duo to hit the road, but the relationship between Burt and Verona feels touchingly true. Burt is a boy still trying on manhood for size (with a beard for extra emphasis), and though we've seen Krasinski do this before, he seems to have fine-tuned the performance to the point where he could very happily play it for the next two decades. Unlike his character, he's an actor who has found himself. Maya Rudolph is the joy of this picture. Give or take her role in Altman's ""Prairie Home Companion,"" the ""Saturday Night Live"" star hasn't made much impact in movies before now. With her frazzled, freckled face, she's not the glamour girl who would normally be shoe-horned into the romantic lead, but she seizes her chance and runs with it. Mendes brings out a more thoughtful and nuanced presence than the brittle comedienne, and Rudolph makes you consider how rarely we see a real woman at the center of things. Even her occasional tentativeness works for the part. Verona is so fresh and alert, she can't help but doubt herself as they trail from one family disaster to the next and wonder what kind of parents they are going to make. It's an uneven picture about the bumps in the road, and not immune to the odd dramatic shortcut or jocular cheap shot. But it does catch an anxiety that will be acutely familiar to anyone contemplating imminent parenthood, and -- in a beautifully judged cameo by Melanie Lynskey -- the deep anguish of someone who has had that prospect snatched away. More often than not, and where it really counts, ""Away We Go"" hits home. ""Away We Go"" is rated R and runs 98 minutes.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Eight years ago, Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna became global pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking after their memorable breakthrough in coming-of-age road movie ""Y tu Mama Tambien."" ""Rudo y Cursi"" reunites Luna and Bernal, who became pin-ups for the resurgence in Mexican filmmaking with ""Y tu Mama Tambien"" in 2001. Today, Luna and Bernal's on-screen chemistry has once again grabbed the public's attention, this time in Mexico, where their latest film ""Rudo y Cursi"" made box-office history. It became the fourth highest-grossing film in the country's history when it was released at the end of 2008. ""Rudo y Cursi,"" approximately translated as Tough and Corny, tells the story of two rural banana farmers who, after being 'spotted' by a crooked talent scout, gain instant celebrity in the Mexican soccer league playing for opposing teams. But, mesmerized by women and fast cars and unable to defy their demons, they look on powerless as the dream disintegrates in front of them almost as suddenly as it arrived. The movie touches on fame, poverty and corruption, but for its makers, it is ultimately a tale of brotherhood. It was written written and directed by Carlos Cuaron, and is the first release from groundbreaking new production venture Cha Cha Cha films. Cha Cha Cha was established by Mexico's three leading directors who are also renowned internationally -- Carlos' brother Alfonso Cuaron (""Children of Men""), Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel"") and Guillermo del Toro (""Pan's Labyrinth""). All three serve as producers on the film.  In pictures: Bernal and Garcia in ""Rudo y Cursi"" » . ""Originally I wanted to make a fake documentary about a footballer from a humble background who made it big and then disappeared mysteriously,"" Carlos Cuaron told CNN. ""But I told this idea to Gael [Garcia Bernal] and Diego [Luna], and they both said they wanted to play the part. I had one part and two actors. So I made up another brother and forgot about the fake documentary."" Cuaron also cast Bernal and Luna -- best friends since childhood in Mexico City who were so keen to do the film the signed up before they saw a script -- against type and against their wishes. Both had originally wanted to play the opposite character: Bernal the abrasive Rudo, and Luna the romantic Cursi. They were eventually dissuaded by Cuaron who said: ""I don't want to make Y Tu Mama Tambien 2."" The idea behind Cha Cha Cha films was conceived by Cuaron senior, del Toro and Innaritu when the trio -- a kind of all-stars of Mexican cinema -- found themselves with a surprise 16 nominations and 4 awards at the 2007 Oscars. The idea came out of a desire to pool their their rising bargaining power and maximize their clout in Hollywood -- and, of course, out of friendship. The company was ""born out of friendship and sibling sympathies,"" del Toro told CNN. When Carlos was originally writing the script, his bother, Alfonso told him thought it was perfect for Cha Cha Cha. The venture formalizes a working relationship del Toro, Innaritu and Alfonso Cuaron have had for years, but they freely admit they spend little time together. Rather it is a case of exchanging ideas and honing each other's writing over the phone and via email from all over the globe. Del Toro, for example, is currently in New Zealand directing Peter Jackson's follow-up to his wildly successful ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Hobbit."" It would appear that the Mexican trio have created an ideal creative environment for themselves, Cha Cha Cha has been criticized for forgetting their Mexican heritage in the rush to embrace Hollywood. It is not a criticism they take lightly. Watch Cuaron, Bernal and Garcia talking about ""Rudo y Cursi"" ""I don't care about Mexican films, about indie films, about Hollywood films,"" says Alfonso. ""Just good or bad movies. ""Yes, it's great that we have a common background as Mexican creators, but once you are a creator you have a common language with creators from all around the world."" For del Toro, the company will extend the influence of Mexican cinema not diminish it: ""We want to give Mexican cinema, if you want to call it that, the credentials and right to exist in world cinema. ""People don't think twice when [Italian filmmaker] Bernardo Bertolucci is doing a movie about China called 'The Last Emperor.' ""But in your mind, Latin American filmmakers are only doing Latin American films. We're trying to show that it's important to have roots, but not borders."" The bittersweet drama has played to big laughs all over Mexico and the U.S., but for its makers, it is not simply a comedy. ""People talk about this film as if it's a comedy but I question that,"" says Alfonso. ""The elements are very dramatic and actually very tragic, and the ending has a very bittersweet tone."" According to del Toro, the movie ""says there's a way to be comfortable with failure, and finding you're emotionally more satisfied in failing."" Failure though, is not an issue overly burdening Cha Cha Cha's ""three amigos,"" -- their second film, ""Biutiful,"" set in Barcelona, directed by Inarritu and starring Javier Bardem is currently being edited in Spain. Alfonso told CNN his next movie would be shot in France and Scotland, and would be in French and English, though that too ""will be a Cha Cha Cha film."" Carlos Cuaron is the only one who is unhappy, despite the unprecedented success of his directorial debut. ""For me it's difficult,"" he says. ""Whenever I see the movie, I only see the flaws. Nobody else sees them."" ""Not even your mother?"" asks Bernal. ""No, not my mother,"" says the director. ""She thinks I'm a genius.""","Mexican superstars Gael Garcia Bernal, Diego Luna star together .

"(CNN) -- Embattled Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe signed a power-sharing deal with the opposition party's breakaway faction, his party said Tuesday, though Mugabe's opponents denied the claim. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe leaves a hotel where negotiations had been taking place Tuesday. Mugabe's party said the deal, which promises cabinet positions to the splinter group of the Movement for Democratic Change, does not involve MDC head Morgan Tsvangirai. Tsvangirai said he still is involved with the talks, and that the power-sharing deal with the MDC offshoot is part of larger deal that has not been signed by anyone. Welshman Ncube, spokesman for the MDC splinter group, also said his party has not signed a deal with Mugabe, though Mugabe's party said the deal was signed with the group's chief, Arthur Mutambara. South African President Thabo Mbeki, the mediator in the talks, would not confirm that a deal had been signed. Mbeki said Mugabe and the splinter group had formed an ""agreement"" and were awaiting Tsvangirai's position on certain points in the plan. Another high-ranking official with knowledge of the negotiations told CNN that the deal signed with Arthur Mutambara, head of the faction that broke from the MDC, has to do with the prime minister position that will be created in the new Zimbabwe government. The official said deciding the duties of the new prime minister has been a sticking point in the negotiations. The MDC has wanted the prime minister to be in charge of government and Mugabe to be in charge of the state, the official said. But Mugabe has sought to keep control of both and make the prime minister position ""ceremonial,"" the official said. All the parties involved have been meeting in a hotel in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital city. Video footage Tuesday showed Tsvangirai leaving the negotiations stone-faced as he ignored reporters' questions. Mutambara told reporters he plans to have a news conference Wednesday, and Mugabe smiled widely and shook hands with onlookers as he left the hotel, but did not answer reporters' questions. Tsvangirai had been in power-sharing talks with Mugabe in recent days as a culmination of his party's protest of Mugabe's disputed re-election in a June presidential runoff. The election was condemned internationally as a sham. Tsvangirai withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had orchestrated a campaign of beatings, intimidation and murders against the MDC. Tsvangirai had garnered the most votes in a March general election, but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","Official: Zimbabwe's president makes power-share deal with splinter group .

"(CNN) -- Whether they're raising their adopted baby girl, dodging homophobic quips from their fraternity brothers or teaching the ""Single Ladies"" dance to the football team after glee club, it seems gay characters are becoming a vital part of prime time TV. With characters like ""Modern Family's"" Mitchell and Cameron, Calvin from ""Greek"" and Kurt from ""Glee,"" the number of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) characters on scripted programs has just about doubled since 2005, according to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance against Defamation. And characters will continue to identify as LGBT as time goes on, such as ""Ugly Betty's"" Justin, who recently had his first same-sex kiss. But Jarrett Barrios, president of GLAAD said, ""We still have a long way to go before we're fully represented [on] TV."" In addition to the increasing number LGBT characters on scripted shows, which currently represents a little more than 3 percent of all leading and supporting characters on broadcast networks, there are also more openly gay actors and producers working in Hollywood, says Barrios. Actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson plays the character Mitchell on the ABC prime time show ""Modern Family."" Like his on-screen role, Ferguson himself is openly gay. ""The opportunity to play not only a well developed gay character, but a dad, a son and brother was really appealing to me. ... I chose to play him very close to myself and I think that truthfulness was appealing to the creators,"" Ferguson told CNN. However, Ferguson says his sexual orientation does not make him any more qualified to tackle a gay role than Eric Stonestreet, his straight co-star who plays Mitchell's partner Cameron. ""As a gay man and as someone who is an advocate for equality, truthfulness and fairness, I want to see more gay roles go to gay actors,"" Ferguson said in an e-mail. ""But then on the flip side, as an actor, I want to still be given the opportunity to play roles that are straight."" In a recent interview on The Joy Behar Show , Stonestreet said he's excited he has been given the opportunity to portray one half of a committed gay couple raising a child -- a first, he said, for broadcast TV. ""Our goal is to make people laugh, but while we're making people laugh, if we can open a couple minds here and there, that's also an added benefit,"" he said. And while shows like ""Modern Family"" are working to open peoples' minds about same-sex parents, the ""L"" and the ""T,"" of LGBT, are still waiting for their TV time, said Hollywood casting director Tammara Billik. It's very common for female characters to be portrayed as bisexuals instead of lesbians, she said. ""I wouldn't say it's because of a discomfort with lesbianism, it's just an interest in bisexuality,"" Billik said. ""[People] think it's hot, and it gives characters a wide variety of storylines."" And as far as the ""T,"" she said, ""transgender people are not represented in our daily lives with the same frequency that gay and lesbian people are. It's harder to find an audience that will embrace a transgender character."" Sean Smith, the executive producer of ABC Family's ""Greek,"" said he has loaned some of his own experiences as an openly gay man to the show. And when casting, an actor's sexual orientation does not come into play. ""When you're in casting, it's not appropriate or legal to say, 'Hey, are you gay?' Whether they're gay, straight, from the South, British or from Mars, it doesn't matter. The best person who captures that character gets the job."" And for Smith, straight actor Paul James was the best person for the role of Calvin Owens, a gay member of Omega Chi, a fictional fraternity on ""Greek."" James said he doesn't think twice about the intimacy between him and the three actors he's made out with on the series. His girlfriend doesn't either. It's just acting, he says. But with the exception of Neil Patrick Harris, who came out in 2006, playing a straight character on ""How I Met Your Mother,"" straight actors are more often tapped for gay roles, rather than the other way around. Or so it seems. ""Many gay actors, who are not out in Hollywood, are afraid (coming out) will compromise their ability to get roles,"" Barrios said. ""But [LGBT] actors need to feel as if they can be who they are and still make it in Hollywood or homophobia wins."" Both Ferguson and Smith identified themselves as gay before beginning careers in Hollywood, but Smith said he understands why some people are apprehensive about coming out once they're in the spotlight. ""People want to succeed and avoid any potential pitfalls, and coming out is definitely one that can draw attention to you that might make other people in this town fearful of hiring you,"" said Smith. ""For me, I've never really questioned it. I've worked with great guys. For them it wasn't an issue, but I'm aware of other parts of this industry."" People want to watch characters they can relate to, said Smith, who was very excited to welcome ""Modern Family"" into his living room. ""Jesse and I ... get so many compliments from gay couples and lesbian couples that want to introduce us to their kids and thank us for representing them on TV for the first time,"" Stonestreet told Behar. But still, ""Modern Family"" isn't hitting viewers over the head with Cameron and Mitchell's physical intimacy. ""We're the perfect show to just build it in naturally, not draw a bunch of attention to it,"" Stonestreet said. For Ferguson, it's a non-issue. ""I want the viewers to know Mitchell and Cameron's sex and love life is just fine,"" Ferguson wrote. ""They also have regular bowel movements, but that is something you don't see either.""","The number of LGBT characters on scripted programs has doubled since 2005 .

"(CNN) -- A Maryland mother faces assault charges for allegedly ordering a group of teens to beat up a 14-year-old who was stabbed in the ensuing melee, Baltimore County police said Friday. Kimberley Lyn Cudanin, 34, told her 16-year-old son and at least four of his friends to attack Malaki Malloy as retaliation for a recent assault against her 14-year-old son, police said in a news release. On Saturday night, Cudanin drove some of the teens to where Malloy was, about a mile from her home, police said. Those teens and others at the scene then beat and stabbed Malloy and three friends who were with him, police said. Malloy was released from the University of Maryland Medical Center's shock trauma center Monday, hospital spokeswoman Cindy Rivers said Friday. Cudanin and her son Andre were arrested Monday and face first- and second-degree assault charges, police spokesman Bill Toohey said. Four other teens face the same charges after being arrested Wednesday: Leo Eades, 17; Marvin King, 16; Malcolm Scott, 15; and James McBride, 16. All are being charged as adults, police said. Police are looking for two other suspects, Toohey said. Warren Brown, defense attorney for at least one of the teens, could not be immediately reached for comment Friday. An attempted murder charge is likely against the person alleged to have stabbed Malloy, Toohey said, but police have yet to determine who that person was. Investigators do not think it was Kimberley Cudanin, he said. In fact, investigators do not think she assaulted anyone, but under Maryland law, her role in the attack warrants the assault charges, Toohey said. CNN's Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report.","Kimberley Lyn Cudanin told son and his friends to attack Malaki Malloy, police say .

"(CNN) -- A college student in Nigeria has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for scamming an Australian woman out of $47,000 online by pretending to be a widowed white businessman desperately in love with her. A court in Ikeja in southwest Nigeria ruled that Lawal Adekunie Nurudeen will also have to pay back the 56-year-old woman, even if it meant selling the two plots of land and the Honda Prelude he bought with her money. Nurudeen was an engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007, said the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Nigeria's anti-corruption police. The woman lamented that she was looking for a husband but had been disappointed in the men she had met. ""The convict, who is married with three children, instantly applied and told the victim that she had met Mr. Right,"" the commission said in a statement. Nurudeen pretended to be a 57-year-old British engineer working with a multinational company in Nigeria. He told her his wife and only child had died in a road accident in Lagos, the former capital of the country. ""He sent the picture of a white man to the victim to foreclose any suspicions,"" police said. The woman agreed to marry him. A few weeks later, Nurudeen called the woman pretending to be a doctor. He told her that her fiance had been in an accident and needed money for treatment. The woman obliged, the commission said. Nurudeen let two weeks pass. He then called the woman again, thanking her profusely for her kindness and telling her that he would like to visit her in Australia. He asked her for airfare, cash for customs clearance and other incidentals, police said. Authorities did not say how Nurudeen was caught. But he duped the woman of $47,000 before his arrest, the commission said. Scammers in Nigeria have gained a reputation for using the Internet to con foreign nationals out of money. Some of the scams have earned the name ""419"" after the clause in the Nigerian criminal code that deals with obtaining property under false pretense.","Police: Nurudeen was engineering student when he met the woman online in 2007 .

"(Budget Travel) -- Hard as it may be for anyone under 30 to imagine, there was a time when people used to shoot eight-millimeter films while on vacation and then show them to friends and family gathered around a projector in the living room. Nowadays, capturing video is far easier (whether you use a video camera, a digital still camera with video capability or even a cell phone), as is the sharing: YouTube has proved that millions of folks have learned to upload video to a computer and instantly e-mail a link to family and friends. Whether you use a video camera, a digital still camera with video capability, or even a cell phone, capturing video has never been easier. While YouTube remains a popular venue for sharing vacation videos, Web sites specifically targeting travelers are also springing up. The quality of the applications and usefulness of the content, however, vary greatly. We tested four to see which are easiest, which have bugs to work out and which can even help you offset your travel costs. Travelistic . For anyone just getting the hang of online video sharing, no-frills Travelistic -- founded by veterans of Condé Nast, iFilm and MTV -- is a good start. Before you upload a video, Travelistic directs you through a simple registration process and asks you to write a short description of your clip. When the video is posted, you can e-mail friends to tell them to watch it. You can also create a profile page to list your videos, add links to other people's clips and indicate on a world map where you've been and where you'd like to go. Cool: Similar to YouTube, Travelistic gives an embed code for most postings, allowing anyone on the Internet to add the clip to his or her own Web site or blog. Likewise, YouTube videos can be embedded into Travelistic. Not cool: No registration is required to leave comments on other people's videos, leading to spam. Travelistic also doesn't restrict who can post videos, so some material on the site comes from tourism promoters. Upload time: Painfully slow at 20 minutes.* . Revver . Revver is a general-interest video-sharing site with a category devoted to travel clips. Its process for uploading a video is similar to Travelistic's, but the personal ""dashboard"" is much more sophisticated. You can collect friends, à la Facebook, and add other people's videos to your playlist (a compilation of favorite clips). There are also more ways to share your videos: The site allows you to use embed codes to link your videos to social-networking sites, and your friends can download the clips as podcasts in iTunes. Cool: The site affixes small advertisements to the bottom of every video, usually promoting something germane. (For example, an ad for a Miami hotel is attached to a home movie of Miami Beach.) Revver then pays you half the revenue it makes from the video ads -- the total depends on how many people view the ads or click on them. You can track how much you've made in your dashboard, and you're automatically paid through PayPal once you've earned at least $20. Earnings can be substantial. The creators of an extremely popular Diet Coke and Mentos video on the site have made $50,000. Not cool: Editors screen all of the videos to ensure that no obscene or copyrighted material will be posted to the site -- the process can take several hours or even a day. If your video has more than 10 seconds of a Beyoncé song in the background, for instance, the editors could consider it a copyright violation and block the clip's posting. Upload time: Five minutes. Tripfilms . Founded by four friends in New York City, including former IgoUgo chief executive Tony Cheng, Tripfilms is geared toward people who think of themselves as filmmakers, professional or otherwise, with higher-quality and more informative clips than those on other video-sharing sites. But that shouldn't deter the novice videographer; Tripfilms's videos may be slicker than those on other Web sites, but the site isn't necessarily more exclusive. The staff posts all videos submitted by users unless the clips are offensive. There are also tips on producing better videos, such as finding an opening or closing shot and writing a more natural script. Cool: The site has a Film Your Trip program in which people pitch ideas for video travel stories to the editors and -- if their ideas are accepted -- are paid at least $50 for each clip they produce. If you ask, the staff may edit your video to make it look more professional or give advice on how to do it yourself. The site also occasionally gives away an iPod Nano to the creators of the top videos. Not cool: Tripfilms is less than a year old, so traffic is low. There are just 700 videos on the site; only a handful have more than a few thousand viewings. Upload time: Six minutes. Zoom And Go . Zoom And Go sees itself as a combination of TripAdvisor and YouTube. The site allows users to not only upload videos and photos, but also to write reviews for hotels, destinations and attractions, and to search for hotels in certain cities. Navigating the site, however, can be slightly problematic. When you click on a city like London, for instance, you can add it to your Trip Planner, but that just creates a list of bookmarked places -- there's no actual planning function yet. The site also has a tool to check hotel availability, but clicking on the link to book the room in both Firefox and Safari led to an error page. Cool: Zoom And Go doesn't attach ads to videos, but it's launching a system that'll award points for every video, photo and review posted on the site. The points will then be redeemable for money that'll go to the charity of the user's choice. Videos will be worth 30 points apiece; every 100 points accrued will earn $1. The editors also say that all content is provided by actual travelers, not tourism promoters. Not cool: Although Zoom And Go claims to have the largest collection of travel videos on the Internet (more than 14,000), the clips are rarely longer than a minute, providing just a cursory glimpse of a hotel lobby or a tourist destination.

"(CNN) -- Basketball commentator and former hoops star Charles Barkley was arrested Wednesday in Scottsdale, Arizona, on suspicion of drunken driving, a police spokesman said. Charles Barkley was driving an Infiniti SUV through a trendy area of Scottsdale on Wednesday, police say. Barkley issued a brief statement, saying, ""I am disappointed that I put myself in that situation. The Scottsdale police were fantastic. I will not comment any further as it is a legal matter."" Lt. Eric Shuhandler of the Gilbert Police Department said an officer pulled Barkley over after he ran a stop sign in Scottsdale's Old Town area, a trendy spot known for its nightclubs and bars. Gilbert and Scottsdale are in the Phoenix metro area. ""The officer identified the driver of the 2005 Infiniti as Charles Barkley,"" according to a written statement from police. ""Mr. Barkley was administered the standard field sobriety tests after the odor of intoxicating liquor was detected.""  Watch: Barkley 'disappointed' by arrest » . At a news conference later in the day, Shuhandler said Barkley's ""performance on the field sobriety test revealed there was probable cause to make an arrest."" Barkley declined to take a breath test to measure his blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said earlier. ""When he arrived at the station, police administered a blood test, which is customary of our police department to do,"" he said, adding that Barkley consented to the blood test. It will take ""a few days"" for the crime lab to test the blood sample and determine Barkley's blood-alcohol level, Shuhandler said. The former NBA power forward was cited for driving while impaired and released. ""It was a pretty routine arrest,"" Shuhandler said. Barkley's sport-utility vehicle was impounded under mandatory vehicle impound laws, police said. Shuhandler said Barkley behaved professionally during the booking and was ""very respectful and cordial with our officers.""  Watch Shuhandler describe the arrest » . Barkley, 45, is a commentator for TNT's coverage of the NBA. In October, he told CNN's Campbell Brown that he plans to run for governor of his home state of Alabama in 2014, saying, ""I can't screw up Alabama. We are number 48 in everything and Arkansas and Mississippi aren't going anywhere."" Although he is well known for entertaining comments and a cocky attitude, he also compiled an impressive résumé as a professional basketball player. A Hall of Famer and 11-time All-Star, Barkley is one of four players in history to rack up more than 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in a career. He also earned the NBA's most valuable player designation in 1993 and brought home gold medals with the U.S. Olympic basketball team in 1992 and 1996. His commanding performance on the court earned him the nicknames ""Sir Charles"" and the ""Round Mound of Rebound."" Barkley was drafted out of Auburn University in 1984 by the Philadelphia 76ers and played 16 seasons with the Sixers, Phoenix Suns and Houston Rockets before he was permanently sidelined in 1999 with a ruptured tendon in his left knee. TNT is owned by Turner Broadcasting Corp., also the parent company of CNN. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","NEW: Barkley says he's disappointed in himself, police were ""fantastic""

"(CNN) -- Costa Rica's first female candidate held a two-to-one lead in the country's presidential election, as the second-place candidate, Otton Solis of the Citizen's Action Party, conceded defeat. If the PLN -- the Spanish acronym for the ruling National Liberation Party party -- wins, Laura Chinchilla would become the nation's first female president. Polls showed Chinchilla garnering 47.3 percent of the vote, with 24.9 percent of election sites reporting. Solis had 23.3 percent, while Otto Guevara of the Libertarian Movement had 21.9 percent. Before noon Sunday, all three leading candidates had cast their votes in events broadcast live by local media. If none of the candidates gain 40 percent of the vote, a runoff election will be used to select the next president. In addition to president, Costa Ricans also cast ballots Sunday for two vice presidents, 53 congressmen and 495 councilmen. Video footage showed flag-waving supporters of the main presidential candidates dressed in their respective campaign colors throughout the country. International observers interviewed on CNN affiliate Teletica compared the election scene to a festival. The festivities included election sites where children could vote in a mock presidential vote. The educational outreach let the children pick their candidate on a digital ballot not unlike the ones the rest of the electorate cast their votes with. Some 2.8 million Costa Ricans are eligible to vote. The legacy of outgoing President Oscar Arias -- a Nobel laureate who leaves office a popular, if polarizing leader -- has in many ways shaped the presidential race. Although he has given Costa Rica a larger role in foreign affairs through his involvement in seeking resolution to the political crisis in Honduras, but his style has rubbed some the wrong way. After casting his vote Sunday, Arias called the electoral process transparent and trustworthy. ""I would like to thank the Costa Rican people for filling the streets with color,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to increase spending on efforts to break into U.S. military computer systems, expand its Navy, and invest in intercontinental nuclear missiles and weapons to destroy satellites, according to the latest U.S report on China's military power. Chinese military officers after a meeting about the People's Liberation Army in 2007. The annual report from the Pentagon to Congress says China's total military spending in 2007 was between $97 billion and $139 billion, but it is hard to tell exactly how much was spent and on what. In comparison, the U.S. military budget request for 2008 is $481.4 billion, not including war requests. Pentagon officials said a chunk of China's spending went to cyberwarfare, because 2007 saw several ""intrusions"" believed to be from the Peoples Liberation Army. In the incidents, unclassified U.S. military computer systems were broken into and information was taken, according to Pentagon officials. While the information taken was not classified, Pentagon officials said the worry is the Chinese hacking required many of the skills and capabilities that would also be required for a computer network attack. Last summer, a cyber-attack on Department of Defense computer systems took down the e-mail capability of hundreds of staffers for weeks, but the Pentagon still will not comment on who initiated the attack. It is widely believed among the military to have been the Peoples Liberation Army. China is also investing heavily in and fielding improved nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and antisatellite missiles, according to the report. The United States expressed its concern last year after China fired a missile at one of its old satellites and destroyed it, sending thousands of dangerous pieces of space debris into orbit. The United States conducted a similar strike last month on a broken U.S. spy satellite before it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. U.S. officials said the satellite was hit and broke into thousands of small pieces that burned up as they re-entered Earth's atmosphere. The United States is also concerned about the purchase of more submarines by the Chinese navy as well as plans for more aircraft carriers. The Chinese once had a small Navy. Now the United States is keeping an eye on the growing service amid concerns over Taiwan. The concerns include ""China's near-term focus on preparing for contingencies in the Taiwan Strait, including the possibility of U.S. intervention, which is an important driver of its modernization,"" the report says. Additionally, the Chinese have placed about 100 more short-range missiles on the shore opposite Taiwan in the past year, it says. Pentagon officials worry the continued increase in Chinese military spending is slowly tipping the balance of power between China and Taiwan in China's favor. The United States has said it would help defend Taiwan if China invaded. The report also says the Peoples Liberation Army is ""pursuing comprehensive transformation from a mass army designed for protracted wars of attrition on its territory to one capable of fighting and winning short-duration, high-intensity conflicts along its periphery against high-tech adversaries."" Such an army, the report says, would have ""the greatest potential to compete militarily with the United States and field disruptive military technologies that could, over time, offset traditional U.S. military advantages."" The United States says the lack of transparency by the Chinese on its spending poses ""risks to stability by increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation,"" and that China has yet to explain to the international community the purpose of its military expansion, Pentagon officials said.

"(CNN) -- The parents of a 15-year-old girl who was gang-raped on a California high school campus urged the community Saturday to channel its anger over the event ""through positive action,"" according to a pastor. At a Saturday community event at the campus where the attack took place, the Rev. Jim Wheeler, who said he was the family's pastor at First Presbyterian Church in Richmond, read a statement from the teenager's parents. ""Stop the violence,"" Wheeler read. ""Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing more pain. We've had enough violence already in this place."" Police say as many as 10 people were involved in the rape on October 24 in a dimly lit back alley outside Richmond High School, where a homecoming dance was taking place. Another 10 people watched the attack without calling 911, police say. Five people have been arrested in connection with the attack. A sixth person who was arrested is expected to be freed because of insufficient evidence, CNN affiliate KGO reported. Authorities say the attack lasted for more than two hours. The victim, who was taken to a hospital in critical condition, was released Wednesday. The parents' statement urged the community to work to ensure that such an attack never happens again. ""If you need to express your outrage, please channel your anger through positive action,"" they said, according to Wheeler. ""Volunteer at a school. Go help a neighbor. Be courageous in speaking the truth and in holding people accountable. Work toward changing the atmosphere in our schools and in this community so that this kind of thing never happens again.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama headed to the Czech Republic on Wednesday night to meet with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and sign an arms control agreement that reduces the nuclear stockpiles of both nations. The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to be signed Thursday by the two leaders builds on a previous agreement that expired in December. Obama has called the treaty the ""the most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly two decades"" and said it would cut the nuclear weapons of the United States and Russia by about a third. After meeting with Medvedev and attending the signing ceremony in Prague, the Czech Republic capital, Obama will have dinner with heads of government from 11 countries -- Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. The highlight of the two-day trip is the new treaty with Russia, which is another step in nuclear arms relations between the former Cold War adversaries. Its signing comes two days after the Obama administration announced a new U.S. nuclear weapons policy and four days before Obama convenes a summit of 47 nations on nuclear security issues. ""It significantly reduces missiles and launchers,"" Obama said of the new treaty, which lasts for 10 years. ""It puts in place a strong and effective verification regime. And it maintains the flexibility that we need to protect and advance our national security, and to guarantee our unwavering commitment to the security of our allies."" Obama has made nuclear non-proliferation a major priority of his presidency, prompting criticism from conservatives who fear the president will weaken the U.S. nuclear deterrent against possible attack. ""We believe that preventing nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation should begin by directly confronting the two leading proliferators and supporters of terrorism, Iran and North Korea,"" according to a statement issued Tuesday by Arizona's two Republican U.S. senators, John McCain and Jon Kyl. ""The Obama Administration's policies, thus far, have failed to do that and this failure has sent exactly the wrong message to other would be proliferators and supporters of terrorism."" According to information released by the White House, the new treaty limits both nations to ""significantly fewer strategic arms within seven years"" of its signing. One of the limits: 1,550 warheads. ""Warheads on deployed ICBMs (Intercontinental ballistic missiles) and deployed SLBMs (submarine-launched ballistic missiles) count toward this limit and each deployed heavy bomber equipped for nuclear armaments counts as one warhead toward this limit,"" the White House said. There also are limits on launchers. The treaty also lays out a ""verification regime"" that includes on-site inspections, data exchanges and notifications, the White House said. ""The treaty does not contain any constraints on testing, development or deployment of current or planned U.S. missile defense programs or current or planned United States long-range conventional strike capabilities,"" according to the White House. Obama said the agreement is part of the U.S. effort to ""reset"" the U.S. relationship with Russia. ""With this agreement, the United States and Russia -- the two largest nuclear powers in the world -- also send a clear signal that we intend to lead,"" the president said. ""By upholding our own commitments under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, we strengthen our global efforts to stop the spread of these weapons, and to ensure that other nations meet their own responsibilities."" Negotiators have been working since April 2009 to wrap up the ""follow-on"" to the 1991 START agreement. Talks were difficult, with disagreements over verification, including on-site inspection of missiles that carry nuclear warheads. A U.S. official with knowledge of the talks earlier said that negotiators had found ""innovative"" ways to verify what each side has. Verification will be a top issue politically because the U.S. Senate and the Russian parliament will each have to ratify any agreement. Russian officials at one point objected to the Obama administration's plans to build a missile-defense system in Eastern Europe. Specifically, they were angered by news leaks from Romania that it had agreed to allow missile interceptors to be installed in that country. The issue, according to arms control experts, was resolved by including non-binding language in the START treaty's preamble stating that there is a relationship between offensive and defensive weapons; however, the treaty itself deals only with limits on offensive weapons systems. This resolution could help placate U.S. critics who want no link in the treaty between offensive and defensive weapons, arguing that it might be used to try to limit a U.S. missile-defense plan. The new treaty would be the first pact related to arms control since the end of the Cold War, experts have said, setting the stage for further arms reductions that will tackle thorny issues such as what to do with non-deployed warheads that are kept in storage, tactical nuclear weapons and further cuts in missiles and launch vehicles. Some of those issues are expected to come up at the nuclear security summit in Washington on April 12-13.","Obama: ""Most comprehensive arms control agreement in nearly two decades""

"(CNN) -- People were ""thrown to the roof as if they were dolls"" and some feared for their lives when a Continental Airlines flight ran into turbulence, shaken passengers said. Oxygen masks hang from a damaged part of the plane Monday, in a photo by passenger Camila Machado. The turbulence struck without warning several hours into Monday's Continental Flight 128 from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Houston, Texas. The pilot diverted the Boeing 767-200 to Miami, Florida, to get treatment for the injured. Continental said seven passengers were transported to hospitals, and about 28 other passengers were treated at the scene. Lt. Elkin Sierra of the Miami-Dade Fire Department said 26 passengers were injured, including four seriously. ""The airplane came down very sharply, and all of us bumped our heads against the ceiling -- twice,"" Brazilian passenger Celi Dfaria told CNN affiliate WSVN-TV at Miami-Dade International Airport. ""It dropped so hard that everything in the seat-back pockets just flew up in the air. I caught my phone in my lap,"" passenger Richard Sharp told the Houston Chronicle.  Watch what happens when a plane drops » . ""The second one was the devastating one. That's when the plane really fell,"" Fabio Ottolini of Houston, who with his wife and daughter was returning from a visit with family in Brazil, told affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston. ""While it was doing that, I saw people being thrown to the roof as if they were dolls."" Aloiso Dias thought the plane dropped more than twice. ""I felt like I was on a roller coaster,"" he told WSVN-TV. ""I couldn't even see what happened with my wife. I was just holding onto the front of the seat and going with the flow."" He couldn't see because the cabin lights had gone out and ""it was pitch black outside,"" Frederick Bright told the Houston Chronicle. ""I went up, and it was like I was in the air for a minute. Then I came down and I hit my back on the armrest, then I fell into the chair,"" he said. ""I thought I was going to die because the lights went off completely, and all I could see was the red lights"" on the wings. Most of those who were injured had not been wearing seat belts, passengers said. ""It was like in the movies -- anybody who didn't have a seat belt on came right out of their chairs,"" Manuel Alfaro of Houston told the Chronicle. ""It smacked everyone around."" Several people hit the ceiling hard, witnesses said. ""People that weren't seatbelted in flew up and hit the ceiling, so their heads and their faces hit the plastics all up at the top,"" John Norwood of Houston told WSVN-TV. ""A couple of people were badly hurt from the plastic breaking on their faces from the lights. There were people cut, bleeding. There were a few people unconscious.""  Watch passengers describe the terror » . Deanna Buckley of Houston hit the ceiling but wasn't hurt. ""I hit my head on the light above and it broke the light out and I was showered in glass,"" she told WSVN-TV. ""I was lucky, though. There were people on there whose faces were cut up. It was terrible."" The turbulence came suddenly, catching many passengers asleep. ""It seemed like the back of the plane got it the worst, though, probably because there's more people in the back and a lot of people didn't have their seat belts on,"" Sharp told the Chronicle. ""You had a lot of people sleeping across the empty rows, so those people were bouncing around on the armrests. They really took the brunt of the beating in the back.""  Learn more about turbulence and what causes it » . One of those was 13-year-old Thiago Candido, who was traveling unaccompanied. ""Oh, I was scared man,"" Candido told KTRK-TV. ""I was sleeping and I woke up with my head in the ceiling. I didn't know what was going on. ""I thought the plane was falling, just like a big earthquake, but in the air,"" he said. The flight carried 168 passengers and 11 crew members. Continental flew remaining passengers to Houston later Monday. ""I think the most important thing about this whole episode is seat belts, all the time,"" Ottolini told KTRK-TV. ""Because we have no way to predict what happened. It just happened.""","Airliner dropped sharply at least twice, sending people and objects flying .

"(CNN) -- Rutgers University has suspended a sorority after police charged six of its members in a hazing investigation. The North Carolina-based headquarters of the Sigma Gamma Rho sorority also suspended the chapter at Rutgers, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. That means the sorority has ceased to be officially recognized and can accept no new recruits while the investigation is under way. Police have charged six sorority members with aggravated hazing, which a police spokesman Friday called a possible ""indictable offense."" Rutgers Police Lt. Richard Dinan said the six women were taken to the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Facility, and bail was set at $1,500 for each. At least four of the woman have posted bail, he said. He declined to give details of the alleged hazing, but said one woman sought medical attention for non-life-threatening injuries. Dinan told The Star-Ledger newspaper in Newark Wednesday that there were at least three victims, but police may identify more victims and more suspects. He said four sorority members were arrested Tuesday and two more on Wednesday. He said the hazing occurred at a university student apartment building, but he declined to give the location. The hazing began about the middle of January and went on for eight days, he said. Dinan also told the newspaper that the alleged victims were ""unofficial pledges"" because the alleged hazing did not occur during the university's recognized pledge period. Sigma Gamma Rho is a recognized sorority, but it does not have a sorority house in New Brunswick, Dinan said. The police officer said five of the undergraduates charged were from New Jersey: Vanessa Adegbite, 21, of Jersey City; Joana Bernard, 21, of West Orange; Kesha Cheron, 20, of Newark; Shawna Ebanks, 21, of East Orange; and Marie Charles, 21, of West Orange. Llana Warner, 20, is from New York City. E. J. Miranda, a spokesman for Rutgers, said a student and her parents reported the alleged hazing to the university administration Tuesday. According to the university's statement, ""After receiving this information, university officials contacted the police."" Miranda said he didn't know whether the sorority had had similar reports before. According to Rutgers, the university ""strictly prohibits all forms of hazing. Under the Code of Student Conduct, a student found to have engaged in hazing may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including expulsion.""","Members of Sigma Gamma Rho at Rutgers charged with aggravated hazing .

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from flooding and mudslides in Brazil continued to climb Thursday, with official reports of at least 154 fatalities.

"(CNN) -- ""New Moon,"" the latest film in ""The Twilight Saga"" is doing record business at the box office. In its opening weekend the film grossed $140.7 million -- more than any other film with an autumn release in history. The tales of teenage vampire love based on the best-selling books by Stephanie Meyer have wooed film-goers without having to resort to acres of flesh being on display. This distinct lack of on-screen sex runs contrary to the popular trend of portraying teenagers on screen as playing fast and loose with their virginity and affections. Love and the importance of relationships most definitely rule in ""The Twilight Saga"" and the formula is proving popular with audiences. Elizabeth Morowitz, Communications Professor at the University of Missouri and author of ""Bitten By Twilight"" thinks that this more sensitive approach is the key to the film's success. ""A lot of people ask 'what's so appealing about the Twilight and why is it popular now?' and we think it's because of the relationships and the messages about love in Twilight. In a more conservative environment we've had this push for abstinence education, so we now have a media message that's more congruent with that. So perhaps some teens relate to it in that way,"" Morowitz told CNN's Katie Walmsley. The director of ""New Moon"" Chris Weitz says that sexual abstinence is central to the film's appeal. ""It's not that they can't have sex, they choose not to and I think there's so much popular culture that's saying to young people: 'you'll be cool if you have sex' or 'it's important to be sexy' whereas this series really concentrates on matters of the heart and spirit and I think that's lovely,"" Weitz told CNN. A dashing male lead, in the shape of Robert Pattison doesn't hurt either when you're trying to attract a female teenage audience. But whatever the exact recipe for its undoubted success it looks like teenagers in the ""Twilight"" world don't like to bite off more than they can chew.","""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is breaking records at the box office .

"(CNN)  -- Golf legend Tom Watson says Tiger Woods needs to ""clean up his act"" and show some humility in public when he returns to the circuit after sorting out his tangled personal life. World number one Woods is taking an ""indefinite break"" from the circuit after a car crash outside his Florida home on November 27 led to revelations about a string of extramarital affairs. Elder statesman Watson, who came close to winning last year's British Open at Turrnberry, aired candid views on Woods as he prepared to tee up in this week's Dubai Desert Classic. ""Tiger has to take ownership of what he has done,"" said the 60-year-old. ""He must get his personal life in order. I think that's what he's trying to do. And when he comes back he has to show some humility to the public,"" he added. ""I would come out and I would do an interview with somebody and say, `You know what? I screwed up. And I admit it. I am going to try to change. I am trying to change. I want my wife and family back."" Watson, who dueled with fellow legend Jack Nicklaus at the peak of his career, also criticized Woods for his behavior on the course, upbraiding him for bad language and angry outbursts. ""I feel that he has not carried the same stature that other great players that have come along like Jack (Nicklaus), Arnold (Palmer), Byron Nelson, the Hogans, in the sense that there was language and club throwing on the golf course,"" Watson went on: ""I think he needs to clean up his act and show the respect for the game that other people before him have shown."" Woods, who has not made a public appearance since the media storm which engulfed him at the end of 2009, has lost a string of endorsements since he admitted to ""transgressions"" in his personal life. The 14-time major winner has also been a regular at the prestigious tournament in Dubai, which completes the ""Gulf swing"" on the European Tour. In his absence, Watson is the star attraction after his heroics at Turnberry which saw him beaten in a playoff by fellow American Stewart Cink. Watson, who has already won the Seniors Tour this year, has played down his chances of victory but has been impressed by the condition of the Emirates course. ""The rough is very tough,"" he said. ""It is very tough to get the ball on the green from the rough. You have probably only got a one-in-seven or one-in-eight chance to get the green if you drive into the rough.""

"(CNN) -- The remains of a woman who disappeared 22 years ago in northern California have been found after the son of the woman's purported killer guided police to the site where her body was dumped, investigators announced Thursday. The alleged killer's son told authorities that he watched his father kill 27-year-old Lysandra Marie Turpin in 1988 and that his dad forced him to help dispose of the body, the Humboldt County, California, Sheriff's Office announced. Ernest Samuel Christie III, who was 16 at the time, told authorities that his now-dead father, Ernest Samuel Christie Jr., made him help dump Turpin's body in a ditch near their home in Fieldbrook, California, about 80 miles south of the Oregon border. Christie said his father forced him to help cover the body with tires, douse it in gasoline and set it on fire, Humboldt County Sheriff Gary Philp said in a statement Thursday. Christie's dad had held and abused Turpin at his house for several weeks before killing her, Christie told the sheriff's office. She had been reported missing to Humboldt County law enforcement on April 8, 1988. After Christie supplied the sheriff's office with a map of where the body had been dumped, a team of detectives, evidence technicians, and sheriff's deputies found teeth, clothing and charred bones. A forensic odontologist positively identified the remains as Lysandra Turpin on Wednesday, according to Philp. Ernest Samuel Christie Jr. died in 2006, according to the sheriff's office. His son, now 38 and living in North Carolina, contacted the sheriff's office in February. He is not facing criminal charges, Philp said. Christie told authorities that his father had abused other women, once holding a woman prisoner in a hollowed-out redwood tree stump. The woman escaped and declined to report the incident to law enforcement, the sheriff's office said. Using a description provided by Christie, sheriff's personnel located the stump and found a carpet, plastic jugs, a hypodermic syringe and clothing there, Philp said Thursday. Christie related other instances of his father -- who he said frequently used methamphetamine -- terrorizing women, Philp said. Christie told authorities that his dad once took a woman on his fishing boat, tied her up and told her he was going to kill her. The woman managed to escape, and detectives were recently able to find her and corroborate Christie's account, Philp said.","Man told police he watched his father kill 27-year-old Lysandra Marie Turpin in 1988 .

"(CNN) -- Fashion designer Vivienne Westwood and members of the Sex Pistols have led tributes to the band's former manager Malcolm McLaren who died of cancer on Thursday aged 64. As manager of the Sex Pistols and owner, with his then-lover Westwood, of the Sex boutique in London during the mid-1970s, McLaren was considered one of the pioneers of the punk movement. ""When we were young and I fell in love with Malcolm, I thought he was beautiful and I still do,"" Vivienne Westwood said in a written statement. Westwood's son with McLaren, Joe Corre, her other son, Ben Westwood, and McLaren's girlfriend, Young Kim, were with him when he died in Switzerland after a battle with mesothelioma. ""I thought he is a very charismatic, special and talented person. The thought of him dead is really something very sad,"" said Westwood. The lead singer of the Sex Pistols, John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten, also paid tribute to the band's former manager. ""For me, Malc was always entertaining, and I hope you remember that,"" Lydon said. ""Above all else, he was an entertainer, and I will miss him, and so should you."" McLaren and the Sex Pistols had a turbulent relationship during the band's brief, spectacular and controversial career. Originally known as the Strand, McLaren drafted in Lydon as lead singer and renamed the band the Sex Pistols. Lydon had been spotted wearing a Pink Floyd T-shirt with the words ""I hate"" added to it. The Sex Pistols' raucous public appearances and raging lyrics on songs like ""Anarchy in the UK"" and the sneering ""God Save the Queen"" -- which became a hit despite the BBC's refusal to play it -- made the band notorious on both sides of the Atlantic by 1977. The Sex Pistols broke up in 1978 after one studio album, in large part because of a feud between McLaren and Rotten, who walked off stage at the end of the band's last show declaring, ""Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?"" The band's surviving members have regrouped for periodic tours since 1996, but its official Web site still refers to McLaren as its ""(mis)manager."" McLaren went on to assemble the pop act Bow Wow Wow and record several albums of his own in the 1980s and '90s.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan are through to the semifinals of the Champions League after Wesley Sneijder's first-half free-kick gave them a 1-0 victory at CSKA Moscow, for a 2-0 aggregate win. Dutchman Sneidjer scored the only goal of the game in the sixth minute when his low-free-kick deceived goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev after his defensive wall jumped in unison -- allowing the shot to go underneath them. Following their 1-0 defeat at the San Siro last week, that meant the Russian champions needed to score three times to advance to the last four stage for the first time in their history. But their mission became impossible three minutes after the interval when substitute Chidi Odiah was sent off for a late challenge on Samuel Eto'o, resulting in a second yellow card. From then on, Italian champions Inter Milan were always in control. Sneijder and Dejan Stankovic both had shots well saved by Akinfeev, while the goalkeeper produced a superb save to keep out Diego Milito when the Argentine international went through on goal. The home side rarely threatened after being reduced to 10 men and Inter comfortably held on to reach the last four of the competition for the first time since 2003.","Italian champions Inter Milan through to the semifinals of the Champions League .

But how much of our identity is lost when we select ""female,"" ""African-American"" or ""Muslim?"" I think much of my own identity is lost when I fill in those boxes. I am technically a white, male, heterosexual, Christian, upper-class Ph.D. student. But I am more than meets the eye.

The lesson I hope to teach others through my life is that it's important to see past appearances. My sociopolitical views are a large part of my identity, and I incorporate these into what I wear; whether it's T-shirts emblazoned with the images of activists whom I admire or deliberately manipulating my demeanor to reflect the ""professorial"" role I assume in the classroom, I am continually aware that others are reading my presentation as a measure of my character. And it is to this end that I deliberately try to throw people off. I hope to debunk some of the myths surrounding tattoos and piercings. And I know that everyone who interacts with me is left wondering how someone so ""deviant-looking"" can be kind, courteous and hospitable. My body is also a billboard for my life, and my tattoos tell the story of my identity. My earliest tattoos were direct quotes and Bible verses and captured my identity as an outspoken social-justice advocate. I began to display my political views more directly in later tattoos. I have the ""female"" sign behind my left ear to reflect my commitment to feminism and women everywhere; I have the Human Rights Campaign logo behind my right ear to reflect my commitment to LGBT struggles. The tattoos on my arms capture my commitment to ""faith,"" ""family"" and ""mom and dad."" I also have a bald eagle on my forearm to reflect my commitment to making this country a better place and a skull wearing a graduation cap to reflect my lifelong commitment to teaching. I know that my appearance is misleading, and I know that many people would disagree with what I see as efficacious inscriptions. But one thing is for certain: I will not blend in with the crowd.

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- British newspapers were filled with speculation Wednesday that Prince William may soon propose to his girlfriend, Kate Middleton, after an influential blog reported on a possible date. In an entry on her Web site, The Daily Beast, former magazine editor Tina Brown wrote that a ""high-placed source in royal circles"" told her that June 3 and 4 have been ""mysteriously blocked out on the palace diaries."" This suggests a likely date for the engagement of William, 27, and Middleton, 28, wrote Brown, author of a biography of the late Princess Diana.  Brown was previously editor-in-chief of high-society magazine Tatler as well as editor of Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. There was no response Wednesday from Clarence House, William's official residence. ""We don't comment on speculation,"" a spokeswoman there told CNN. William and Middleton have been dating off and on since 2003, when both were students at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.  They split in April 2007 despite widespread speculation they were close to marriage, but they remained friends and began dating again by the end of that year. The pair is often seen on the town in London, going to exclusive nightclubs. William is now training to be a search-and-rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force, where he holds the rank of flight lieutenant.","No response from Clarence House, Prince William's official residence .

"(CNN) -- Lourdes Batista wishes she had super powers so she could use them to find her husband, she said Wednesday, 105 days after authorities said he was kidnapped in Mexico. Lourdes Batista says she has no idea why someone would kidnap her husband, Felix. Felix Batista, a renowned kidnapping consultant, disappeared after getting into a vehicle outside a Saltillo restaurant December 10. The family has yet to hear a word from his abductors. ""I don't have words to describe the pain,"" Lourdes Batista said. ""It's cruel, very cruel."" Lourdes Batista was getting ready for bed at her Miami, Florida, home when she received a phone call informing her that her husband of 31 years had been snatched. She tried contacting him on both of his phones, but to no avail. Felix Batista, 53, had arrived four days prior in Saltillo, the Coahuila state capital about 250 miles from the U.S. border, to take part in a security seminar about kidnappings. He was giving talks about kidnappings to a business group in Saltillo and Torreon. Though the Cuban-American worked as a contract consultant for the Houston, Texas-based ASI Global Response, the trip was not affiliated with the company. On the day of his kidnapping, Felix Batista was in a restaurant with several other people when he received a phone call, according to a statement from the Coahuila state attorney general's office. ""After speaking for a few minutes, [he] left the restaurant, telling his colleagues that several people in a white pickup truck were going to give him a message,"" the statement said. ""Afterward, outside the business, at about 7 p.m., he got into a vehicle with different characteristics from those he had mentioned to his colleagues and, since then, no one has had any communication with him,"" the statement said. There was no indication of violence at the scene, the attorney general's office said. Jackie Batista said she has no clue why someone would abduct her brother. ""We can speculate till next year,"" she said. ""We've waited for answers. We don't have any information, and no one has contacted us."" Lourdes Batista added, ""It's very perplexing. I don't know. I don't understand why. This is why I can't sleep at night.""  Watch Felix Batista's wife, sister plead for his release » . Felix Batista served four years in the U.S. Army before entering private practice. He has 23 years of experience as a crisis responder and had worked with ASI Global Response since May 2007, President Charlie LeBlanc said. A profile on the company's Web site, which has been taken down, said Felix Batista conducted threat assessments and had been credited with the ""successful resolution"" of almost 100 kidnap-and-ransom cases. LeBlanc said Felix Batista was a ""multidisciplined security practitioner"" who also worked on extortion cases and consulted corporations. His aptitude as a consultant aside, Lourdes Batista said, he was an outstanding family man: ""a great man and a great father and a wonderful husband. I couldn't ask for better."" Since Felix Batista's kidnapping, ASI Global has been working with his family, acting as a liaison with the FBI and Mexican authorities and vetting those offering to help with the case, LeBlanc said. It's the same kind of work Felix Batista was known for, he said. ASI Global has been sharing information with the Mexican national police, who have ""been very forthcoming in sharing information and asking for advice,"" LeBlanc said. ""We've had viable leads. They just haven't panned out,"" he added. Kidnappings and violence have long been problems in Mexico, but the problem has spiked in the past year, at least statistically. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said this month that there were 6,500 organized-crime killings in 2008, more than double the number from 2007. The nation's human rights ombudsman has reported that there were 5,140 reported kidnappings between 2001 and 2008. Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora's office reported that there were 326 kidnappings in the first five months of 2008 alone. ""Many cases continued, however, to go unreported, as families negotiated directly with kidnappers. The number of reported cases to authorities was believed to be far less than the actual number of kidnappings,"" said a statement from Mora's office. Lourdes Batista said the level of violence in Mexico troubles her. ""The Mexican citizens, how do they live like this every day of their lives? It's beyond me,"" she said. ""I fear for them and fear for their loved ones."" Lourdes Batista said there have been no threats against her or against her five children with Felix, who range in age from 16 to 28, but she still lives anxiously. ""I do live in fear, but mostly for Felix and for the families that are going through what I'm going through,"" Lourdes Batista said, adding that the kidnappers' silence has left her feeling impotent. Last week, exactly 100 days after his kidnapping, the Batistas submitted a letter to three newspapers in Monterrey, about 30 miles east of Saltillo. The letter, addressed to ""the Mexican people,"" sought any leads or information in the case and offered a financial reward for information yielding Felix Batista's safe return. In short, it stated, ""we want Felix back,"" Jackie Batista said. Lourdes Batista said she is willing to add a caveat to the family's plea. ""I am not one to persecute, and I don't want to know. I just want my husband back. We need him here,"" she said.","Lourdes Batista says of perplexing motive, ""This is why I can't sleep at night""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iran tested an upgraded version of a surface-to-surface missile with a range that makes it capable of reaching parts of Europe, state-run television reported Wednesday. Iranian Defense Minister Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said on Press-TV that the solid-fuel, high-speed Sajil-2 missile has ""great maneuverability"" and can access targets more than 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) away, making Israel and U.S. military bases in the Gulf reachable. Vahidi said the missile has a shorter launch time and is intended to boost Iran's deterrent capability. In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell said Defense Secretary Robert Gates had seen the intelligence on the launch, which occurred Tuesday, ""and, based on that, is clearly concerned."" ""At a time when the international community has offered Iran opportunities to begin to build trust and confidence, Iran's missile tests only undermine Iran's claims of peaceful intentions,"" he added. ""Such actions will increase the seriousness and resolve of the international community to hold Iran accountable for its continued defiance of its international obligations."" But a U.S. intelligence official said the test launch does not represent ""a major advancement"" in Iran's missile technology. The official added that Iran carries out such tests on a ""routine basis ... to attract attention."" Iran tested the initial version of the Sajil-2 in May. In September, days before a key meeting over nuclear issues with industrialized powers, Iran tested two types of long-range missiles. Those tests drew condemnation after the Islamic republic revealed the existence of a covert uranium enrichment site near the city of Qom. Iran shocked the world with that revelation. Since then, it has allowed inspectors from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency to visit the plant. Western powers fear that Iran is intent on developing nuclear weapons. That's a claim Tehran denies, but the latest test-firing of the Sajil-2 could add to existing tensions.","NEW: Gates: ""Missile tests only undermine Iran's claims of peaceful intentions""

"(CNN) -- On most mornings, my better half wakes up around 5:30, throws on some sweats and heads to the gym before work. About a half hour later, I wake up my 13-year-old son, go downstairs to the kitchen to make his breakfast and pack his lunch. Once he's out the door, I brew some coffee and get to work. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present to you the ""gay lifestyle"" -- run for your heterosexual lives. I understand opponents of gay rights must highlight differences in order to maintain the ""us against them"" tension that's paramount to their arguments. But this notion that sexual orientation comes with a different and pre-ordained way of life -- as if we're all ordering the No. 3 at a drive thru -- only highlights how irrational groups such as Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council, the American Family Association and others like them are in this whole debate. Pro-marriage organizations try to stop two consenting adults from marrying. Pro-family groups try to stop stable couples wanting children from adopting unloved orphans. And somehow, me doing something like going to the grocery store threatens the very fabric of society, as Oklahoma State Rep. Sally Kern spewed. She says ""the homosexual agenda is destroying this nation"" and ""homosexuality is more of a threat than terrorism.""  I'm not sure what her idea of a gay lifestyle might be, but with a growing teenager, buying and cooking food dominates my day-to-day. I don't worship Barbra Streisand, I don't watch any TV show with the word ""Housewives"" in its title and I love fishing, beer and Madonna. But more important, I'm just a father trying to keep my son away from drugs, get him into college and have a little money left over for retirement. I'm no sociologist but I'm pretty sure those concerns are not exclusive to gay people. In one of the most pivotal scenes in the biopic ""Milk,"" Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, gathers a group of community organizers and activists to come up with strategies to combat a 1978 ballot initiative that sought to ban LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) teachers and their supporters from working in public schools in California.  As the small crowd settles down, Milk quickly glances around the room and says .. ""If we're going to convince the 90 percent to give a ---- about us 10 percent, we have to let them know who we are ..."" ""What"" we are -- be it gay, straight, black, white -- is simply window dressing. ""Who"" we are is where the substance is, where the person is, where our humanity is. Too often, discussions about gay people and gay rights focus on sex, as if a person's entire being is defined by his or her Hollywood crush. This fixation has been the crux behind attempts to link gay men to pedophilia -- from John Briggs, a state legislator from Orange County who introduced the proposed ban on gay teachers in California, to the Catholic League's Bill Donohue, whose recent attempts to excuse the church for its global scandal coverup by seemingly blaming homosexuality -- and it's a tactic that is evil incarnate. ""The vast majority of the victims are post-pubescent,"" Donohue recently said on ""Larry King Live."" ""That's not pedophilia, buddy. That's homosexuality."" Actually, Bill, sexual predators whose victims are 13- to 17-years-old are called hebephiles -- a la Joey Buttafuoco, Madeleine Martin and Heather Kennedy -- not homosexuals. And that still doesn't explain why the church opted to save face as opposed to, in the words of the infamous anti-gay figurehead Anita Bryant, ""Save our children."" Being gay doesn't dictate how people live their lives any more than being straight does. There are gay people who go to church every Sunday and straight people who do not believe in God. There are single gay men who believe in the sanctity of marriage and married straight men who apparently do not -- such as Gov. Mark Sanford, ex-Sen. John Edwards and Sen. John Ensign, to name a few. The truth is the only thing all gay people have in common -- you know, besides being gay -- is that we face continuous rhetorical, social and legal attacks for simply existing, thus potentially making something as mundane as bringing a date to a work function a fight-or-flee situation. And yet, even in the face of that discrimination, LGBT people all handle it differently. Some of us live in the closet, some of us do drag every Wednesday night, some of us are Republicans hoping to be change agents within a conservative sect and some of us are apathetic Democrats too dumb to carry on a conversation about anything other than Lady Gaga. In other words, we're just as diverse, intolerant, upstanding and tragic as our straight counterparts and unless there is an annual meeting I don't know about, the only item on the much talked-about gay agenda is an abbreviated passage from the Declaration of Independence -- ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."" In 29 states, people can be fired simply for being gay regardless of their education, experience or job performance; servicemen and women can be dismissed from the military regardless of their qualifications, dedication and courage; and partners are unable to see their better halves in the hospital regardless of the love, commitment and life they share. Wanting to be judged by the content of one's character isn't a special right, it's a constitutional one guaranteed by the 14th and 15th amendments. And yet, 145 years since the abolition of slavery, 90 years since women were allowed to vote and 20 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act, we're still involved in McCarthy-like investigations, holding Briggs-like elections and taking opinion polls based solely upon ""what"" someone is as opposed to ""who"" they are. It's sad. We're such a great nation, still full of great hope and promise and yet we keep being tripped up by ignorance, which leads to fear and then eventually hate. Being gay isn't a choice, but being a bigot certainly is.

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- Chinese investors want to cash in on the country's NBA fever with a bid to buy a 15 percent stake in the Cleveland Cavaliers. Chinese superstar Yao Ming has been linked with a switch to Cleveland if Huang's deal goes through. Chinese-born businessman Kenny Huang is heading the deal, estimated to be worth more than $70 million. Huang has masterminded previous sports deals, including introducing Mandarin advertisements in the Houston Toyota Center, home of Rockets and Chinese basketball star Yao Ming. With his U.S.-based partner Marc Ganis, Huang founded SportsCorp China, a company that facilitates sports and sponsorship contracts between the United States and China. Ganis said that if the deal goes through, it would rank as the largest international sports transaction ever made by Chinese nationals. ""Simply having Chinese ownership will increase significantly the visibility of the team within China,"" Ganis said. ""There will be much more coverage [of the Cavaliers] on the electronic news as well as the printed news. which means the team gets a much broader brand penetration in China for themselves, for their sponsors, and for any other business activities that they may want to engage in."" The news has already sparked excitement among China's massive basketball fan base. ""It makes me proud that the Chinese will be working with my favorite team,"" said a 14-year-old boy at Beijing's Youth Pro Basketball Training Camp. ""It's an honor."" At the training camp, players practice in the shadow of a giant statue of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal, who last month moved to losing Eastern Conference finalist Cleveland from Phoenix Suns. ""They're crazy for basketball,"" said the camp's founder and former Chinese national basketball player Ma Jian. ""Basketball has probably become the number one most popular sport in China."" Ma says China's fascination with shooting hoops stems partially from NBA efforts to promote the league in the world's most populous nation. A minority ownership of an NBA team will take China and the NBA's love-love relationship to the next level. ""It is a natural extension of what the NBA's efforts have been in China,"" Ganis said in an interview, ""for Chinese investors to look not just at sponsoring the NBA, not just getting athletes as endorsers of their products, but also for them to now move into ownership of NBA franchises,"" The move is also expected to bolster the Cavaliers' marketing opportunities in China, where the franchise's merchandise is already a top seller. Some say that deal may even entice LeBron James, who has claimed he wants to be the first billion-dollar athlete, to re-sign with his hometown team next summer. James, or ""Little Emperor"" as the Chinese call him, is hugely popular in China. It seems the feeling's mutual. Playing for a team with links to China, ""should be fun,"" James told Cleveland newspaper, The Plain Dealer. ""It's a big market; they love the game of basketball .I've been over there the last four or five summers, and I know how much they are inspired about the game."" There's also speculation that if the deal is finalized, the Chinese presence at Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena may increase by one. A move by Yao to the Cavaliers has been at the center of discussion in the Chinese bloggosphere. A Chinese forum post reads: ""I think there is around a 60 percent chance that Yao Ming will go to the Cavaliers because now the team is part-owned by Chinese investors and they will want to sign him."" ""This is all an unknown,"" said Yao in the interview with his hometown Shanghai TV station. Although Yao's recent injury may keep him off the court, it won't keep Chinese fans from watching the NBA -- despite speculation that his broken foot could end his career or, at the very least, keep him out of the next season. ""Despite Yao's injury, many people in China will still be interested in basketball,"" says Mang Hongche, the manager of one of Beijing's NBA Stores. ""Yao Ming's our favorite, but besides Yao there are also other players that we like, like Kobe and LeBron."" With Chinese basketball fans in it for the long-run, the future may see more partnerships between the NBA and China. ""In the next three to five years you will see a lot more sponsorships [with the NBA],"" Ma Jian said. ""The Kenny Huang deal and Yao Ming are just a piece driving this market."" Some analysts say there's a possibility the NBA and China may even tie the knot by creating an NBA-CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) partnership. ""At the end of the day, the NBA is still a league, so at some point they'll want to have a league here on the ground,"" says Michael Sun, managing director of sports giant IMG. ""This is something that I'm sure [NBA China CEO] Ted Chan thinks about every day.""","Chinese businessman hopes to buy 15 percent stake in Cleveland Cavaliers .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- African governments have stopped importing Chinese dairy products as the crisis which has seen more than 52,000 Chinese children poisoned by melamine-tainted goods spreads. Burundi, Gabon and Tanzania have joined governments closer to China -- including Indonesia, Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Malaysia -- in banning Chinese dairy products. At least 11 countries have banned imports. The precautions come as the number of affected children in China continues to swell. Four babies have died from melamine-tainted infant formula and more than 52,000 children have fallen ill, Chinese authorities say. ""I think we will see more cases, but it is, of course, impossible to predict how many cases there finally will be,"" said Hans Troedsson, the the World Health Organization's China representative. ""We have to remember that China is a large country with a population of 1.3 billion people. However, of course, 40- to 50,000 children are affected as reported now. It's a staggering figure, but where we will end up is too early yet to say."" On Monday, China's top quality control official, Li Changjiang, resigned as a result of the scandal, which has seen the arrest of at least 18 people. Two brothers arrested last week on charges of selling contaminated milk could face death if convicted, according to China Daily, a state-run newspaper. The raw milk used to produce powdered baby formula had been watered down and the chemical melamine was added to fool quality checks, the newspaper said.  Watch CNN visit the company at the center of the scandal » . Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited Beijing hospitals and a supermarket to show his concern. China's Health Ministry said about 13,000 children were hospitalized, while another 40,000 had undergone outpatient treatment. ""What we need to do now is to ensure that nothing like this happens in the future, not only in dairy products, but in all foods,"" he said. ""Manufacturers and owners of dairy companies should show more morality and social responsibility in these cases. They are heartless, so we have to create strict law and legislation. I'm sorry.""  Watch how Beijing is under pressure over public safety » . The repercussions from the scandal were felt as far away as Africa. Burundi imports milk products from two suspect Chinese companies and the government has set up a commission to investigate how much tainted product could remain on store shelves, officials said. ""For the moment, nobody knows if the milk is being sold on the Burundi market,"" Noel Nkurunziza, president of a Burundi consumer association known as ABUCO, is quoted as saying in The Guardian newspaper and other publications. In Asia, Singapore announced a recall of all Chinese milk products on Tuesday. The head of Indonesia's Food Safety Watch said she was instituting a temporary ban of all milk imports from China, although contaminated milk has not been found in the country. In issuing its recall of milk products, Singapore had already suspended the import and sale of milk and dairy products from China on Friday, after it said it has found traces of melamine in three Chinese-made dairy products. The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority said ""White Rabbit Creamy Candy"" was ordered off of shelves after tests showed it was contaminated. White Rabbit is among the best-known candy brands in China and one of the few exported widely. The United States is among 40 nations that import the candy, a man in the administrative office of the Shanghai-based company told CNN Monday. Earlier, Singapore's agri-food agency said it found melamine in two other milk-based Chinese imports: the Yili brand ""Choice Dairy Fruit Bar Yoghurt Flavored Ice Confection"" and the Dutch Lady brand of strawberry-flavored milk. In Bangladesh, three Chinese powdered milk brands -- Sanlu, Suncare and Yashili -- have been taken off shelves and all milk powder imports at Bangladeshi ports will be inspected. Bangladeshi TV showed the country's Rapid Action Battalion climbing over a fence to raid a storage facility believed to contain tainted milk. In Malaysia, Health Minister Datuk Liow Tiong Lai announced that import of Chinese milk products had been stopped. In addition to banning imports, thousands of tons of tainted milk powder have been recalled. In the Philippines Monday, the country's Bureau of Food and Drugs banned the distribution and selling of two brands of imported Chinese milk that could possibly be tainted, the Philippines News Agency reported. The milk brands were Yili and China Mengniu Diary Company, the agency reported. One of the implicated Chinese plants is operated by a subsidiary of the Marudai Food Co. in Japan. Marudai said it was recalling five types of products from the plant, would halt operations there for one month, and will send employees to the subsidiary to examine quality controls. The factory will be shut down through October 19. Even some countries that don't import Chinese dairy products, such as Malaysia and Brunei, have banned milk products from China. In Hong Kong, concerned parents have swamped hospitals. A 3-year-old Hong Kong girl was reported this weekend as the first case outside of mainland China. The girl was treated for kidney stones at Princess Margaret Hospital and released, Hong Kong's government Web site reported. Her condition is being monitored.  Watch the public outcry faced by the Chinese government » . A second child, a 4-year-old boy, had similar renal symptoms, the government reported Monday. The boy, a Hong Kong native, had consumed milk products contaminated with melamine and was diagnosed with a kidney stone in mainland China, the Department of Health said. He was treated at Princess Margaret on Monday and was in stable condition. The hospital said Monday it has provided medical consultation to 63 people who might have consumed contaminated milk products. The patients, 34 males and 29 females, ranged in age from 2 months to 17 years old. A Hong Kong government hotline has received nearly 1,000 calls. Melamine is commonly used in coatings and laminates, wood adhesives, fabric coatings, ceiling tiles and flame retardants.

"Northampton, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Three teens accused in the bullying of a Massachusetts high school student who committed suicide pleaded not guilty to related charges Tuesday. Sean Mulveyhill, 17, Kayla Narey, 17, and Austin Renaud, 18, were not present at Hampshire Superior Court. They entered their pleas through their lawyers. Judge Judd Carhart upheld an agreement between prosecutors and defense attorneys that the defendants report to State Police barracks for booking before Friday. They must also stay away from the family of Phoebe Prince, the dead student. Terrence Dunphy, attorney for Renaud, did not comment on the status of his client, but told reporters that Renaud is innocent. The body of 15-year-old Phoebe was found hanging in the stairway leading to her family's second-floor apartment in South Hadley on January 14, Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth D. Scheibel told reporters last month. Phoebe underwent what Scheibel described as a months-long campaign of bullying that led to her commit suicide. The girl was on the receiving end of ""verbally assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm ... on school grounds, by several South Hadley High School students,"" Scheibel said. In the indictments, returned last month, the Hampshire County grand jury charged Mulveyhill, of South Hadley, with statutory rape, violation of civil rights with resulting bodily injury, criminal harassment and disturbance of a school assembly. The indictments charged Renaud, of Springfield, with statutory rape. Kayla Narey, of South Hadley, was charged with violation of civil rights with resulting bodily injury, criminal harassment and disturbance of a school assembly. Charges against another three girls included violation of civil rights with resulting bodily injury; two also were charged with stalking. South Hadley Public Schools Superintendent Gus Sayer defended school administrators' handling of the matter, saying Phoebe had not alerted anyone to her situation. ""She didn't reveal to people what she was being subjected to and, unfortunately, until January 7 we were not aware of what she was being subjected to, so [there was] very little way we could have intervened in the bullying,"" he said. Sayer cited two incidents that occurred on January 7, a week before Phoebe's death. In one, a girl walked into a classroom and called Phoebe ""an Irish slut,"" he said. The name caller was taken to the principal's office and disciplined, he said. In the other, a girl ""said something threatening about Phoebe"" to another girl, he said. A staff member overheard the comment and reported it to the principal, who took disciplinary action, Sayer said. He said it was school policy not to specify what disciplinary actions may have been taken against any individual student, though he said the latter case did not include expulsion and that the student returned to school. ""To our knowledge the action taken was effective in ending their involvement in any bullying of Phoebe,"" he said. Phoebe, who had recently moved to the area with her family from Ireland, also was harassed as she walked through the halls of the school on the day of her death and as she walked on the street toward her home, Scheibel said. The harassment that day, by one male and two females, ""appears to have been motivated by the group's displeasure with Phoebe's brief dating relationship with a male student that had ended six weeks earlier,"" she said. None of the six students identified in the indictment remains in school, Sayer said. CNN's Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.","Sean Mulveyhill, Kayla Narey and Austin Renaud enter pleas through their lawyers .

"(CNN) -- Before this week, most Americans had likely never heard of Kyrgyzstan and even fewer could place it on a map. But the central Asian nation, which is about the size of South Dakota, is important to U.S. foreign policy for one simple reason: a vital military base through which tens of thousands of troops pass every month on their way in and out of Afghanistan. The fate of the Manas Transit Center was thrown into question Wednesday when Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev was forced to flee the capital after angry mobs seized government headquarters. Fighting between police and protesters left 75 people dead and hundreds injured, authorities said Thursday. The protesters say they are in control of the government, but Bakiev sent word Thursday from southern Kyrgyzstan that he is not abandoning his duties. The United States likely will retain use of the Manas facility even if Bakiev's opponents secure control of the government, said Alexander Cooley, a central Asia expert at Barnard College. Latest news out of Kyrgyzstan . ""It's going to survive, but it's going to generate a lot of noise, uncomfortable negotiations and a lot of hard bargaining,"" said Cooley, author of ""Base Politics."" The Manas base plays a major role in internal Kyrgyzstan policy on several levels. For starters, it is a major source of income in the small nation, which has a gross domestic product of less than $12 billion a year, according to the CIA World Factbook.  The nation ranks 143rd in the world in terms of its GDP. In exchange for use of the base, the United States provides about $180 million in aid to Kyrgyzstan each year, Cooley said. Although the United States does not pay rent for use of any bases in the world, Cooley said, about $60 million of the Kyrgyzstan aid is considered payment for access to the Manas facility. In addition, Cooley said, Bakiev's political opponents say the United States pays about $160 million a year to buy fuel for American aircraft using the base. ""The base is as much an economic investment as much as it is a security investment,"" Cooley told CNN. ""Kyrgyzstan does not have a lot of economic assets. That's why the base is important."" But the base also has deep significance to Bakiev's opponents, who see it as a symbol of the deposed president's corruption and U.S. complicity in his abuse of power. ""The United States stayed silent as Bakiev built a criminal state,"" Cooley said. iReport: Are you there? Share photos, video . Political opponents believe that aid paid for use of the base went into Bakiev's pockets, not the country's coffers. ""That money went to companies and shady off-shore enterprises controlled by the family,"" said Cooley. ""It's the actual site of tacit deals and corruption."" The new government has said it will address citizens' concerns. Kyrgyzstan has had a troubled history since shortly after gaining independence when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Also gaining independence that year were the three other ""stans,"" as some people commonly refer to the region: Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. ""Kyrgyzstan seemed to be in the 1990s the one bright spot,"" Cooley said. Askar Akaev, who had been president since 1990, started off as a good leader, Cooley said, ""and politics were pretty pluralistic. Then, he started regressing."" Akaev increasingly turned to repression. ""As they do, he stayed a few years too many,"" said Cooley. ""Bakiev was bad, but Akaev was a real thug."" As happened this week, opponents took to the streets in 2005 and drove Akaev from power. Bakiev won election as president in July 2005. But he, too, soon started to maneuver to increase his power and consolidate control. Demonstrations by political opponents in April, May and November 2006 led to the adoption of a new constitution that gave some of the president's powers to parliament and the government. A year later, the parliament voted to restore some of those powers to the presidency. In September 2007, the new constitution was declared illegal, and Bakiev resumed having the presidential powers he had inherited when taking office. ""The president then dissolved parliament, called for early elections and gained control of the new parliament through his newly created political party, Ak Jol, in December 2007 elections,"" the CIA World Factbook says. ""In July 2009, after months of harassment against his opponents and media critics, Bakiev won re-election in a presidential campaign that the international community deemed flawed. ""Just a few months later in October, Bakiev engineered changes in the government structure that further consolidated his already considerable hold on power."" The CIA World Factbook says concerns about Bakiev's rule, ""included privatization of state-owned enterprises, negative trends in democracy and political freedoms, endemic corruption, improving interethnic relations, electricity generation and combating terrorism."" That such turmoil should fall upon such a country seems incongruous to some. ""Kyrgyz are great,"" Cooley said. ""They are very hospitable. Very mild-mannered."" The CIA World Factbook describes Kyrgyzstan as a land of ""incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions."" With an estimated 2009 population of about 5.4 million, Kyrgyzstan ranks No. 111 among nations. It is a landlocked country and entirely mountainous, with 94 percent of the nation 3,280 feet (1,000 meters) above sea level and an average elevation of 9,000 feet (2,750 meters), the CIA World Factbook says. The topography includes many tall peaks, glaciers and high-altitude lakes. Nearly two-thirds of the nation's citizens belong to the Kyrgyz ethnic group, while nearly 14 percent are Uzbek and more than 12 percent are Russian, the CIA World Factbook says. Likewise, nearly 65 percent of the people speak Kyrgyz, which is the official language. Nearly 14 percent speak Uzbek and Russian is the language for more than 12 percent. Three of every four citizens are Muslim and one in five are Russian Orthodox. Although Kyrgyzstan shares a 533-mile (858-kilometer) border with China, most people identify with mother-nation Russia. Kyrgyzstan was formally annexed to Russia in 1876 and became a Soviet republic in 1936. ""There's a strong cultural affinity to Russia due to media, education and the Soviet legacy,"" Cooley said. Still, China is knocking at the door. ""China has moved in, but it's been a very recent development,"" said Cooley. ""Last year, China did a lot more trade there than Russia did. But there's very little cultural affiliation with China."" There is no seeming affinity for the United States, a distant nation tied in the minds and hearts of many Kyrgyz to corruption at home. The question that remained unanswered this week was whether millions of dollars in U.S. aid would provide enough affiliation to allow continued use of the Manas Transit Center.","Central Asian nation is home to a military base that's vital to U.S. in Afghanistan war .

"(CNN)  -- As the National Tea Party Convention concluded this weekend, it's clear that the Tea Partiers are propelled by two competing claims -- a principled commitment to fiscal conservatism and a serious case of Obama Derangement Syndrome. The first group remains true to the roots of the movement as it emerged almost one year ago amid bailout backlash. They feel like modern Paul Reveres, warning their fellow citizens about the unsustainable nature of our government's deficit spending and unprecedented debt. They still have an important civic role to play in our national debate. The second group reflects the overheated, hyperpartisanship that emerged over the August town halls and the 9/12 march on Washington. Oddly enough, this group embraced the tactics of Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals and applied them to the conservative cause, with angry confrontation and street theater protests. They ascribe to Obama every sinister characteristic imaginable -- often a secret plot to undermine our constitutional republic and put in a socialist, one-world government in its place. This is the crowd that carries the signs comparing Obama to Hitler and communists, while proclaiming themselves patriots. Their extremism will ultimately lead the movement to self-destruct unless it is clearly repudiated. The weekend's controversial and much-covered Tea Party ended up being more of a conference than a convention. It offered speeches and seminars to a relatively small group of attendees. While Tax Day 2009 Tea Parties attracted some 300,000 people nationwide, this convention accommodated just 600 people, who paid nearly $500 each for the privilege of attending the populist conference. While the crowds at 2009's protests were generally angrier than the speakers who climbed up onto platforms at last weekend's conference, the dynamic was reversed. The crowd was generally more civil than the selected speakers. Former congressman Tom Tancredo accused the president of being a ""committed socialist ideologue"" and proposed a civic literacy test for voting. WorldNet Daily founder Joseph Farah used his post-dinner speech, covered by C-Span, to repeat inane ""Birther"" claims. Alabama gubernatorial candidate and former state Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore said Obama had ""ignored our history and our heritage, arrogantly declaring to the world that we are no longer a Christian nation."" He also compared Obama to King George III by quoting the Declaration of Independence: ""A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people."" Sarah Palin was the most cautious by far, saying simply ""America is ready for another revolution."" Where will the Tea Party movement go from here? The for-profit conference organizers declared that ""we absolutely do not support a third party"" and instead announced the creation of a new corporation and concurrent PAC to support conservative candidates, primarily in the South. This is still very much a leaderless movement with divergent tributaries. There's no shortage of anger at the GOP for starting the path of deficit spending last decade and then backing the first round of Wall Street bailouts under Bush. There is a rejection of politics as usual, the feeling that both parties are captive of their respective special interests -- big business and big government. What's your take? Share your thoughts on the Tea Party movement . For the Tea Party momentum to continue in a constructive way, it will need to take at least two further steps: First, repudiate the unhinged Obama-haters and then focus its anger at fiscal irresponsibility into policy proposals instead of bumper-sticker platitudes. With a growing number of conspiracy entrepreneurs trying to profit off populist anger in a recession, it's also worth keeping the conservative virtue of healthy skepticism in mind. Remember what the author Eric Hoffer warned in his book ""The True Believer:"" ""Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business and eventually degenerates into a racket.""","Some in Tea Party movement have an Obama blind spot, John Avlon observers .

"Naoma, West Virginia (CNN)  -- Crews planned to pump nitrogen into a West Virginia coal mine as the search resumed early Friday for four miners who may be trapped after a deadly explosion earlier in the week. Kevin Stricklin of the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) said crews would neutralize potentially explosive air in the Upper Big Branch coal mine with nitrogen, allowing rescuers to go back in and remain there even if an explosive mixture builds again in the air. The hope, though slim, is that the four missing miners were able to survive by entering one of the chambers, which were stocked with enough food, water and air to keep 15 miners alive for four days. ""We committed to the families that we wanted to get into the chambers within 96 hours and we're trying to everything in our power to do that without taking a chance on the rescue teams, and I think this is the way to do it,"" Stricklin said. Officials said the rescue teams will make ""a mad dash"" to one of the mine's two airtight rescue chambers. ""The rescue teams have taken four breathing apparatuses with them,"" Stricklin said. ""In the best case scenario, we would find four survivors. Once they get in there, we'll put oxygen masks on the survivors and bring them out."" At least 25 miners died in Monday afternoon's explosion in West Virginia, while four others remain missing and two were injured. Rescuers -- 32 of them working in four teams -- got within 500 feet of one of the rescue chambers before having to turn back Thursday, said J. Christopher Adkins, chief operating officer of Massey Energy, the mine's owner. They were pulled back after it was determined that noxious gas levels were high enough to cause another blast. The readings showed potentially explosive levels of methane and hydrogen and high levels of carbon monoxide. Stricklin said air samples were tested at regular intervals Thursday night and that rising barometric pressure in the wake of a cold front that moved through the region had helped reduce the chances of another blast. Rescuers had been using high-pressure fans to pull the toxic air through 1,100-foot holes to the surface Thursday. One of the four unaccounted-for miners and 18 of the dead were working in an area where longwall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal. It creates large amounts of coal dust and methane, both of which are explosive. The other three missing miners are believed to be about 2,000 feet away in a new development area of the mine. Authorities have acknowledged it is unlikely the four missing men are alive, but they refuse to give up hope. Officials hope to determine whether either rescue chamber has deployed by lowering a camera through the second hole. ""If they're deployed, more than likely someone's in them,"" said West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin said. ""That means we have a chance of that miracle."" But he added: ""If they're not deployed, we know that our chances are diminished tremendously."" In an interview with CNN, Manchin noted that the mine was outfitted with gas sensors to alert mine personnel when levels become danger. ""In gaseous mines, you want to monitor and you want to have good ventilation,"" he said. ""If that has worked before, whenever the levels got out of control they pulled them out and stopped, why did it not happen this time?"" The cause of the explosion is unknown, and state and federal officials have pledged a full investigation. The White House announced Thursday that President Obama will meet next week with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and an MSHA official to hear their initial assessment of the cause of the blast and their recommendations on steps the federal government should take to improve safety. CNN's Rachel Streitfeld and Samira J. Simone contributed to this report.","NEW: Crews to pump nitrogen in West Virginia coal mine to flush out toxic gas .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama called Thursday for high-level talks with Republicans to work out a compromise on health care legislation, then putting the resulting bill to a vote in Congress. ""If Congress decides we're not going to do it, even after all the facts are laid out, after all the options are clear, then the American people can make a judgment as to whether this Congress has done the right thing for them or not,"" Obama said. ""That's how democracy works."" Obama's comments were the first clear signal from the White House or Democrats in Congress on how they would proceed on a top legislative priority after losing their 60-seat super-majority in the Senate. Republican Scott Brown was sworn in as the new U.S. senator from Massachusetts earlier Thursday, leaving the Democrats one vote shy of being able to overcome GOP filibusters of health care reform and other major initiatives. Asked at a party fund-raising event about the Democratic strategy for health care reform going forward, Obama said Democratic leaders in the House and Senate were working out differences in the separate health care bills passed by each chamber last year. Once that was finished, Obama said, the next step would be ""to call on our Republican friends to present their ideas."" ""What I'd like to do is to have a meeting whereby I'm sitting with the Republicans, sitting with the Democrats, sitting with health care experts, and let's just go through these bills -- their ideas, our ideas -- and walk through them and in a methodical way so that the American people can see and compare,"" Obama said. ""And then I think we've got to go ahead and move forward on a vote,"" he added. ""We've got to move forward on a vote."" A White House official acknowledged later Thursday that this was new language from Obama to offer a possible scenario for health care talks to move forward. However, the official stressed it was ""not a new strategy"" for the White House to coalesce behind, and aides were still mulling various options to complete action on health care legislation. Democrat leaders in Congress have struggled to come up with a consensus strategy since the party lost its super-majority in the Senate. Republicans have unanimously opposed the health care bills so far, meaning Democrats would be unable to pass a bill through the Senate because of a certain GOP filibuster. Brown, now the 41st Republican senator to give the GOP its unstoppable filibuster ability, said Thursday after his swearing-in that Congress should start over on the health care issue instead of continuing to work on existing proposals. Republicans complain the comprehensive Democratic health care bills would lead to a government takeover of health care. They call for smaller steps focused on individual issues, such as limiting medical malpractice lawsuits. Democrats, however, say that spiraling health care costs that threaten the nation's future economic stability can only be addressed through comprehensive reform. Obama said Thursday the Democratic bill that will emerge from the House-Senate talks on joining their two proposals would expand coverage to at least 30 million Americans who lack health insurance while reducing long-term health care costs. The measure would include an insurance exchange to allow people and small business owners to pool together to purchase coverage, Obama said, but he made no mention of a government-run public health insurance option that Republicans have rallied against. Obama said the Democratic bill would include reforms that prevent insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions or capping lifetime benefits. ""And by the way, all of it is paid for,"" Obama said. ""Not only is it deficit-neutral, but the Congressional Budget Office, which is the bipartisan office that is the scorekeeper for much things cost in Congress, says it is going to reduce the costs by $1 trillion."" Obama called health care reform the ""single best way to bring down our deficits,"" adding ""nobody has disputed that."" ""Nobody can dispute the fact that if we don't tackle surging health care costs, then we can't control our budget,"" he said. While Democrats from both chambers have been working together to merge their two bills, alternative strategies also have been discussed. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this week that the chamber would vote next week on one provision of its health care bill, which would drop the current anti-trust exemption for the insurance industry that allows practices such as market allocation. The Senate bill would maintain the anti-trust exemption, so it was unclear whether the House's limited first step would win approval there. However, Democratic aides have said that House Democrats want to keep momentum on health care going in coming weeks.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William is starting a two-month attachment with the Royal Navy on Monday, part of the future king's continued experience with various branches of the military, the Ministry of Defense said Saturday. Prince William and his father, Prince Charles, at his graduation from the Royal Air Force in April. William, 25, will spend the first part of his attachment on a basic sea safety course training in sea survival, firefighting and ship damage repair, according to the ministry. If William passes the course, as expected, he will join the HMS Iron Duke in the Caribbean, the department said. The ship's function is to support overseas British territories in the event of a hurricane and to carry out counter-narcotic operations. The prince, who will be called Sub Lieutenant Wales in the Navy, is expected to spend time aboard a frigate, a mine hunter, a submarine and helicopters during his attachment, which ends August 1, the Ministry of Defense said. William completed a four-month attachment with the Royal Air Force this year and received his pilot's wings upon graduating in April. He learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as Flying Officer Wales within the RAF. William is also a second lieutenant in the British Army, where he serves in the Blues and Royals regiment of the Household Cavalry. The attachments are designed to provide the prince with military experience for when he becomes head of the armed forces as king. ""When he becomes king, he needs to know his armed forces -- instinctively be very familiar with them -- and so he is doing this visit to the Royal Navy,"" said Rear Adm. Bob Cooling, the assistant chief of naval staff. William's father, Prince Charles, had a five-year career in the navy in the 1970s. Charles served on the guided missile destroyer HMS Norfolk and two frigates before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and joining a naval air squadron that operated from the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes. Prince Charles spent his last nine months in the navy in 1976 in command of the coastal minehunter HMS Bronington. William's uncle Prince Andrew served 22 years in the Royal Navy as a helicopter pilot, seeing active service during the Falklands War between Britain and Argentina in 1982. Queen Elizabeth II's husband, Prince Philip, William's grandfather, spent more than 13 years in the Royal Navy. He saw active service throughout World War II and was in Tokyo Harbor when Japan surrendered.","Britain's Prince William begins two-month attachment with Royal Navy on Monday .

"South Hadley, Massachusetts (CNN) -- The 15-year-old girl who hanged herself last January after enduring months of bullying from schoolmates failed to alert others to her plight, the superintendent of South Hadley Schools said Thursday. The girl, Phoebe Prince, ""was apparently a very private person; she bore a lot without talking to friends or with her parents or with anybody at school,"" Gus Sayer told CNN. ""She didn't reveal to people what she was being subjected to and, unfortunately, until January 7, we were not aware of what she was being subjected to, so [there was] very little way we could have intervened in the bullying."" Sayer cited two incidents that occurred on January 7. In one, a girl walked into a classroom and called Prince ""an Irish slut,"" he said. The name caller was taken to the principal's office and disciplined, he said. In the other, a girl ""said something threatening about Phoebe"" to another girl, he said. A staff member overheard the comment and reported it to the principal, who took disciplinary action, Sayer said. He said it was school policy not to specify what disciplinary actions may have been taken against any individual student, though he said the latter case did not include expulsion and that the student returned to school. ""To our knowledge the action taken was effective in ending their involvement in any bullying of Phoebe,"" he said. Prince, who had recently moved with her family from Ireland to South Hadley, hanged herself on January 14 after enduring what Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth B. Scheibel described to reporters Monday as ""a nearly three-month campaign of verbally assaultive behavior and threats of physical harm toward Phoebe, on school grounds, by several South Hadley High School students."" Six students were named in an indictment returned by a grand jury Friday and made public Monday. In addition, Scheibel said three female students received juvenile charges, but she would not clarify if they were among the six named in the indictment. That left even Sayer confused. ""There could be as many as nine, but I believe that six"" is the correct number, he said. Though authorities did not consider that the actions or failures to act by the faculty, staff and administrators of the school amounted to criminal behavior, prosecutor Scheibel called for them to undergo training to learn to intervene more effectively in such cases. But administrators in the school district, who oversee the education of 2,100 students in four schools, are being unfairly blamed for the death, Sayer said. Those critics include a number of parents who have demanded that the administrators resign. ""They really don't know what's going on in the schools, but they feel that this shouldn't have happened and that, somehow, it has to be the fault of the schools themselves,"" Sayer said. ""Frankly, I think that grossly oversimplifies the situation."" Sayer said he had received hundreds of vituperative messages from the community. ""They are awful,"" he said, citing one that said he should be ""burning in hell."" He said he was trying to ignore them. None of the six students identified in the indictment remains in school, he added. Sayer said he supported the punishments meted out to the students. ""If they, as they have been charged, committed crimes, they should face the consequences for those crimes,"" he said. But, he added, expulsion is something educators are reluctant to countenance. ""It's a terrible punishment because that changes their whole lives and what they are capable of doing, and they have to figure out a way to renew and complete their education."" CNN's Alina Cho contributed to this story.","Irish immigrant Phoebe Prince, 15, hanged herself in January in Massachusetts .

"(CNN) -- A Colorado woman indicted on terror charges pleaded not guilty at her arraignment Wednesday in federal court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, 31, faces federal charges that she conspired to support terrorists overseas. She was mostly expressionless at the hearing and nodded her head to indicate her not guilty plea rather than saying it aloud. She was wearing a green jumpsuit. Her attorney said she is 12 weeks pregnant. The attorney, Jeremy Gonzalez Ibrahim, said he and his client decided she should not speak at the hearing because the government may have collected audio evidence. If that is the case, the defense didn't want to give prosecutors an opportunity to do voice analysis between her courtroom testimony and any possible evidence, Ibrahim said. Paulin-Ramirez, who was indicted Friday, is being held in a federal detention center in Philadelphia. She was arrested in Ireland in March, reportedly as part of an investigation into a conspiracy to commit murder. She was released without charges after that arrest. The fact that she was released in Ireland and chose to return from abroad to answer charges in Philadelphia shows that she is confident of clearing her name, Ibrahim said. Paulin-Ramirez, who was indicted Friday, is being held in a federal detention center in Philadelphia. Her lawyer said she will file a motion for bail. The U.S. indictment also charges Colleen R. LaRose, a Pennsylvania suspect known as ""Jihad Jane,"" with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. The indictment is a superseding document to a previous indictment that charged only LaRose. According to the latest indictment, Paulin-Ramirez exchanged e-mail messages with LaRose during summer 2009 and was invited by the Pennsylvania woman to join her in Europe to attend a ""training camp."" Paulin-Ramirez accepted the invitation and arrived in Europe with her 6-year-old son, Christian, on September 12, 2009, with ""the intent to live and train with jihadists,"" the indictment says. Paulin-Ramirez was arrested Friday afternoon in Philadelphia after voluntarily flying to the United States from abroad, authorities said. Her lawyer, Jeremy Ibrahim, said his client ""did what any law-abiding citizen would do if they knew they were facing charges back home: She came back with her [6-year-old] son."" Paulin-Ramirez, of Leadville, Colorado, briefly appeared in court Friday. Ibrahim said Paulin-Ramirez married a man when she arrived in Ireland last fall after meeting him through the Internet. Ibrahim said the man ""courted her and told that he would take care of her and her son."" On Tuesday, the government filed a motion for a continuance in the trial of Paulin-Ramirez and LaRose, citing the complexity of evidence in the case including the seizure of several computer hard drives. The trial was originally set for May. The government's motion also called for a court order to schedule a pretrial conference among parties in the case to discuss discovery materials under the Classified Information Protective Act. Paulin-Ramirez's son is being held in the custody of Pennsylvania Child Services. Ibrahim has said Paulin-Ramirez is distraught over the welfare of her son. Her attorney said he has not been able to see the boy to check on his condition on behalf of his mother. He said he is trying to make arrangements for a phone call between mother and son.

"(CNN) -- After eight months in hibernation, ABC's ""Lost"" returns to television tonight to finally explain, among other things, the dazzling white light that ended the 2009 season not with a whimper, but with a bang. Was it a nuclear blast? A quantum-leaping time shift? A reboot to the story's preflight origins? These are key questions as broadcast TV's most ambitiously complex drama series presents the beginning of the end -- the first of 16 final-season episodes before ending its time-rearranging, sympathy-shifting narrative. But the most important question of all, six years after ""Lost"" was launched in 2004, is this: . Who cares? That's not a flippant question, because both TV and the audience have changed in the years since ""Lost"" pulled back from Jack's eyeball to reveal, slowly and masterfully, the panicked insanity of a remote island plane crash. Little more than a decade ago, ""Lost"" would have been riveting ""appointment television,"" but DVRs and DVD boxed sets have changed the rules of the game. Instead of clearing calendars to watch in real time and line up for the water-cooler conversation the next morning, fans of such shows as ""Lost"" and Fox's similarly serialized ""24"" might just as easily record and time-shift their viewing, avoiding office chats until they watched on their own schedules. Or, even more aggressively, they might actively avoid the broadcasts of their favorite show, just for the delayed gratification of watching the entire season later on DVD -- gobbling up episodes at their own pace, and without commercials. It's a very different TV world than in 1967, when the long-awaited ending of ABC's ""The Fugitive,"" with David Janssen's Richard Kimble finally coming face-to-face with his wife's one-armed killer, drew enough viewers to set a TV record for entertainment programming that beat even The Beatles on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" three years earlier. Or in 1983, when the finale of CBS' ""M*A*S*H,"" with its end to the Korean War, drew 77 percent of all TV viewers that night, and set a viewership record of 121.6 million that still stands. And, given the fragmentation of TV audiences, most likely will never be equaled. ""Lost,"" at its viewer zenith in season two, boasted an average of nearly 19 million viewers. By last season, that number was below 12 million. And the season finale -- the episode that, in a reverse-polarity nod to the abrupt blackout ending to HBO's ""The Sopranos,"" concluded with an unsettling fade to white -- attracted about 10 million viewers. In the interim, the broadcast networks attempted to copy the ""Lost"" formula of season-long mysteries and unanswered questions, but all the attempts (""Threshold"" from CBS, ""Invasion"" from ABC, etc.) came up short, and vanished without concluding. ""Lost,"" at least, is marching towards an actual ending -- and that alone makes it a TV event worth embracing. iReporter: ""Lost"" lives up to expectations . After all, how many more opportunities like this will viewers get? On cable TV, perhaps many. But on broadcast TV, how many shows are left that are even worth caring about -- much less anticipating their conclusion? It's likely that many viewers who gave up on ""Lost"" in years past will return for this final lap, hoping to witness something special. And they will. The creators and show runners of this labyrinthine drama series have known for years what the final image will be (my guess, and my hope: an extreme closeup of Jack's eye, ending the show just as it began), and are crafting this final season with an eye (so to speak) to the show's beginnings, as well as its endings. Despite all the changes in technology and viewership, ""Lost"" is a series that rewards, if not demands, watching in real time. ABC didn't even provide critics with preview copies of the final-season premiere -- and even though I'm therefore deprived, I'm not complaining. This is a show I want to watch as it airs, and discuss with friends afterward. I don't take for granted how rare that is these days -- and neither should you. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Bianculli.","After eight months in hibernation, ABC's ""Lost"" returns to television Tuesday for its final season .

"(CNN) -- The federal government is starting to deploy full-body scanning machines to 11 airports across the United States, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano announced Friday. Forty body-imaging machines already have been put into use at 19 airports nationwide as part of a field test, according the Department of Homeland Security. The Transportation Security Administration expects to deploy 450 units by the end of this year. ""By accelerating the deployment of this technology, we are enhancing our capability to detect and disrupt threats of terrorism across the nation,"" Napolitano said in a statement. The first of the new units are being installed Friday at Boston's Logan International Airport, according to a DHS statement. The list of other airports set to receive the scanners by the end of summer includes Chicago O'Hare International, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International, Mineta San José International, Los Angeles International, Port Columbus International, Oakland International, San Diego International, Kansas City International and Charlotte Douglas International. The imaging machines are being funded through the Obama administration's $862 billion economic stimulus plan. Under existing protocols, full-body scans are optional at airport checkpoints. Travelers who decline the scans are funneled to a location where they may be given a pat down and subjected to other tests such as swabs that can detect minute traces of explosives on hands or luggage. The TSA said most passengers prefer a body scan to a pat down. But others have objected to the body scans, calling them electronic strip searches. Passenger privacy is maintained during the scannning process by blurring all images, deleting images after they are viewed and placing the screener viewing the images in a remote location, according to DHS officials. Acting TSA Administrator Gale Rossides testified before Congress on Thursday that the machines will not significantly slow the passenger screening process, saying it will be done at the same time as carry-on baggage screening. The TSA has spent years testing full-body imagers. Plans to deploy them this year were given added urgency after the arrest of a Nigerian man, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who has been accused of attempting to detonate an explosive sewn into his underwear on a December 25 flight. Field testing of full-body scanners already is under way at the following 19 airports: . • Albuquerque International Sunport Airport  • Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport  • Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport  • Denver International Airport  • Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport  • Detroit Metro Airport  • Indianapolis International Airport  • Jacksonville International Airport  • McCarran International Airport  • Los Angeles International Airport  • Miami International Airport  • Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport  • Raleigh-Durham International Airport  • Richmond International Airport  • Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport  • San Francisco International Airport  • Salt Lake City International Airport  • Tampa International Airport  • Tulsa International Airport .

"(CNN) -- Reigning Australian Open champion Rafael Nadal was forced to retire hurt from his quarterfinal match against Andy Murray in Melbourne on Tuesday. The Spaniard, who suffered injury trouble for much of last season, was 6-3 7-6 (7-2) 3-0  down to the 22-year-old Scot when he pulled out of the match after struggling with his right knee for much of the third set. Murray spoke of his disappointment regarding the manner of his progression but was pleased with his standard of play. ""I've known Rafa since I was 13, he's my favorite player to watch so I was gutted for him,"" Murray told reporters after the game. ""I came through a few tough moments at the start of the match but I thought I found the right tactics to win, I played really well tonight. ""I had to go for my shots and when the big points come keep them short, as you don't want to play long points against Rafa."" Murray's victory sets-up a semifinal clash with Croatian Marin Cilic, who underlined his growing reputation by hitting  20 aces and 63 winners to consign seventh seed Andy Roddick to defeat. A win that has Murray keenly anticipating his next challenge: ""Nerves will be there about making my first Australian final but I lost to [Cilic] in straight sets at the U.S. Open so there is a bit of revenge to be had there.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A Latino group Tuesday expressed outrage over the slaying of an Ecuadoran man, allegedly at the hands of seven teenagers in what police are calling a hate crime. Marcello Lucero, 37, was stabbed to death in an attack that police say was a hate crime. The teens' parents bear some of the blame, along with community leaders who have created an inhospitable environment for immigrants, Fernando Fernando Mateo, founder of Hispanics Across America, said at a news conference. ""We understand that some may not welcome us in their neighborhoods, but killing us will not drive us away,"" Mateo said. ""Those that hate us allow us to cut their lawns, build their homes, paint their homes, cook for them, serve their children -- and yet they teach them hate."" Marcello Lucero, 37, was walking to a friend's apartment in Patchogue, New York, when he was attacked late Saturday, police said. He was stabbed in the chest and died of his injuries. A friend walking with Lucero was not injured. The seven teens were trying ""to find Latinos and to assault them,"" said Suffolk County Police Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick. ""That was what they went out to do that night, and that's exactly what they did do. ... They were actively seeking victims."" At a court hearing for the seven Monday, a prosecutor quoted the youths as saying, ""Let's go find some Mexicans to f--- up."" Jeffrey Conroy, 17, faces charges of first-degree manslaughter as a hate crime in the attack, police said. He and the other six -- Jordan Dasch, Anthony Hartford, Nicholas Hausch, Christopher Overton, Jose Pacheco and Kevin Shea -- also face charges of first-degree gang assault. The additional charge against Conroy stems from authorities' belief that he was the one who stabbed Lucero. All of the suspects are 17 except for Overton, who is 16, according to police. The ""hate crime"" designation would enhance any sentence imposed upon conviction. Upon their arrest, all seven of the youths ""admitted their involvement and their role in this crime,"" said Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer. However, all seven pleaded not guilty when they were arraigned Monday in Suffolk County Criminal Court. Mateo said that Hispanics Across America and Lucero's relatives have retained a law firm and may file suit against the youths' families ""to make sure the parents of these seven kids pay the consequences."" But he and other community leaders also laid blame at the feet of Steve Levy, Suffolk County executive. ""He has brought this hate that exists here amongst the Hispanic community,"" Mateo said. ""He has legislated over and over again against Hispanic immigrants. ... He should be the person not welcome in this community."" The Rev. Alan Ramirez of Brookville Reform Church said, ""We all know that Mr. Levy, along with these seven young men, has blood on his hands. And we consider that unacceptable. We ask a responsible Democratic Party to seek Mr. Levy's resignation or removal from office. We do not need our communities to be separated by hatred, intolerance and racial discord."" Attempts by CNN to contact Levy on Tuesday were unsuccessful, as his office was closed for the Veterans Day holiday. On Sunday, however, Levy issued a statement saying Lucero's death ""wasn't a question of any county policy or legislation; it was a question of bad people doing horrific things,"" according to Newsday, which reported that Levy answered no further questions. In a statement issued by police Sunday, Levy was quoted as saying, ""This heinous crime that led to the death of an individual because of his race will not be tolerated in Suffolk County. The suspects will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."" New York Gov. David Paterson, in a statement Monday, also condemned Lucero's death. ""Suffolk Police tell us that Mr. Lucero and a friend were attacked late Saturday by seven teenagers who were driving around looking for a Hispanic to beat up,"" Paterson said. ""The senseless and cowardly act by these teenagers cannot stand. ... Mr. Lucero's death is a jarring reminder that we must remain vigilant and continue our fight to eradicate prejudice in our words and in our actions."" Mateo said Tuesday that Lucero's death ""is an outrage. ... Those days of noosing, hanging and torturing should be a thing of the past."" Conroy's friends and fellow students told CNN affiliate WABC they do not believe he committed the crime. ""He's the nicest guy you will ever meet,"" one said. Attempts to contact Conroy's defense attorney were unsuccessful Tuesday. A candlelight vigil was held Monday night in honor of Lucero. ""I still don't believe my brother's death,"" Joselo Lucero said. ""Today I buried him and I still don't believe that he's dead. ... He's left a real emptiness in my family.""","NEW: Officials condemn attack, fatal stabbing of Ecuadoran in Long Island .

"(CNN) -- An Ethiopian-flagged vessel fought off a pirate attack in the Gulf of Aden earlier this week, the multi-national anti-piracy task force said Thursday. The MV Andinet, part of the Ethiopian Shipping Line, was approached by two pirate skiffs Monday, with one of them coming close enough to fire automatic weapons in an attempt to force the ship to stop, the task force said in a statement. But the vessel's crew used anti-piracy measures -- including firing flares in the air and utilizing fire hoses, as well as ""evasive maneuvering"" -- to repel the pirates, Combined Maritime Forces said. After a distress call was sent out, the USS Farragut, a U.S. Navy destroyer assigned to the task force, deployed her SH-80 helicopter to follow the skiffs, and the USS Porter gave chase as well, the task force said. ""A boarding team from the USS Farragut subsequently stopped and boarded the pirate skiffs, but only an empty magazine and used rounds were found on board."" ""The MV Andinet once against demonstrated that even basic preventive measures can save a crew from a successful pirate attack,"" said Commodore Tim Lowe of Britain's Royal Navy, deputy commander of the Combined Maritime Forces. ""Although there is (a) significant international naval presence in the Gulf of Aden, these warships cannot be everywhere and may not always be close at hand to prevent an attack."" The incident occurred about 145 miles east of Aden, Yemen. The task force advocates that commercial and civilian vessels in the region implement anti-piracy measures such as maintaining a 24-hour lookout, traveling in convoys and using high-intensity lighting.","MV Andinet, part of the Ethiopian Shipping Line, was approached by two pirate skiffs Monday .

"London, England (CNN) -- Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic finally took the stand Monday at the U.N.'s international tribunal at The Hague to defend himself against genocide charges stemming from the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict. For CNN's Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson, the 64 year-old was as defiant and unrepentant as the man he recalled meeting outside Sarajevo in 1993-94, as Bosnian-Serb forces shelled the city. Karadzic, who faces 11 charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide during the war, told the tribunal the Serb cause is ""just and holy,"" and dismissed as myths two of the worst atrocities of a conflict that claimed 100,000 lives -- the three-year siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre in 1995. He even claimed that the image of the Muslims as victims was untrue and that they were the first to attack. Their fighters ""had blood up to their shoulders,"" he said. ""I will defend that nation of ours and their cause that is just and holy,"" he said in his defiant opening statement. The aim of the ""Muslim plotters,"" he added, was ""100 percent power, as it was in the Ottoman Empire."" ""This is reminiscent of those days,"" said Robertson, who reported from the Bosnian capital during the war. ""These were the exact same justifications: 'we're the ones that had been under attack, we're the ones being wronged.' ""It's very telling that he's not trying to address specific issues, such as the Srebrenica massacre and such like, which are going to be the main parts of the prosecution. ""Many Bosnian-Serbs watching this will feel that he's doing the right thing because Serbs have a history of feeling wrongly done to."" He said some still think back to their nationalist past and only identify with themselves through that, which is incompatible with the direction modern Europe is taking. ""They're trying to return to a kind of Serb nationalist heyday, which is akin to the Taliban taking Muslims, if you will, back centuries."" Karadzic is the most senior figure to stand trial since the former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, who died of a heart attack in 2006 before a verdict was reached. According to Robertson, the trial might offer a crumb of comfort to some victims but it will stir up a great deal of emotion and anger to many Bosnian-Muslims who lost relatives or their homes. ""When you listen to Karadzic's description of the situation in Bosnia during this period it belies the fact that Bosnian-Serbs went through and ethnically-cleansed people from their towns,"" he said. ""There were towns and villages where no Muslims were left. Any towns or villages the Serbs couldn't get into they just surrounded and poured on machine-gun fire and rockets. This trial is going to bring all this out again."" During the siege of Sarajevo, which lasted 44 months, Karadzic was in Pale, a mountain-top village to the south-west of the capital which became the Bosnian-Serb headquarters. Down below, Sarajevo was like a goldfish bowl surrounded on all sides by Bosnian-Serb soldiers who had dug in and were shooting civilians indiscriminately with machine guns, sniper rifles and mortars. ""These were men in uniform with weapons taken from the former Yugoslav national army acting on clear instructions,"" said Robertson. ""It's hard to get an idea of what a siege is like in modern Europe. But imagine a city where you can't leave, get out to buy eggs, apples or fuel for your car. Equally nothing can come in. ""The encirclement of Sarajevo was so tight that the only way in or out for Bosnians was a hand-built tunnel they dug under the U.N.-run airport runway. A man couldn't stand upright in the tunnel. ""Telephone lines were non-existent, while electricity and water supplies were often cut for weeks on end."" On one occasion, while buying fuel in Serb-held territory, Robertson came across several Bosnian-Serb snipers at a gas station. They proceeded to show him their positions and what they could see through their rifle scopes. ""Looking down onto the streets you could see why the snipers were so effective,"" he said. Throughout the conflict Bosnian-Serb forces were supported by the rump Yugoslav state -- which would later become Serbia -- and its national army, which was dominated by Serb generals. ""That chain of reporting command was important,"" said Robertson. ""I remember going to Belgrade with Karadzic and he was the like the vassal of Milosevic. He was going there worried about what demarche he was going to get from him. So there was a complete tie-in between the Bosnian-Serbs and the Serbs in Belgrade. ""But in terms of the chain of command on the ground, I don't think anyone there would question the fact Karadzic and his political allies gave the backing, justification and instruction for the army to act on the ground. ""For three years you can't surround Sarajevo and shell it as a political leader. He never once stood up and tried to stop what was going on and only condoned and supported it, having meetings with army commanders involved, such as Mladic."" Ratko Mladic is the most senior fugitive still at large. Now that Karadzic's tribunal has finally resumed after a four-month postponement, many analysts believe it has enough evidence to secure a conviction. ""If there's a successful conviction,"" said Robertson,"" then the court should feel it has set a good marker for future leaders who would try to turn guns on civilians and try to divide a country. ""Failure would call into the question the tribunal's ability to try anyone.""","Radovan Karadzic faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko refuses to concede defeat in Ukraine's presidential election and plans to demand a recount in some districts, officials from her party, Bloc Tymoshenko, said Tuesday. Meanwhile, her rival, former Ukrainian prime minister Victor Yanukovich told CNN it is time for her to give up. Yanukovich is leading Sunday's runoff election. With 99.98 percent of the votes counted, he has 48.96 percent, while Tymoshenko has 45.47 percent, according to the country's Central Election Commission. Yanukovich's supporters rallied outside the commission Tuesday and vowed not to leave until the vote count was final and their candidate named the winner, Ukrainian news agencies and state media reported. In an exclusive interview with CNN Tuesday, Yanukovich called on Tymoshenko to accept defeat and remember the pro-Western Orange Revolution that swept her to power. ""This country has been democratic for five years, and that's been proven again by this election,"" he said. ""Yulia Tymoshenko is betraying the principles of her Orange Revolution"" by failing to acknowledge defeat. A Yanukovich win would put the finishing touches on a remarkable comeback for the former prime minister five years after he was ousted in a populist uprising. Ukrainian voter Nikolay Gluhovskiy said he supported Yanukovich because Tymoshenko had been a disappointment. ""All the time Yulia Tymoshenko has been in power, we had no prospects,"" he said at a Yanukovich rally Monday. ""Of course, she is a fighter, but in a bad sense. She shouldn't have promised us so much and done nothing."" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich by telephone Tuesday, the Kremlin told CNN. ""Medvedev congratulated Yanukovich on the completion of the election campaign, which was highly rated by international observers, and the success achieved at the presidential election,"" the Kremlin's statement press statement said. The Kremlin statement did not offer congratulations for a Yanukovich win, however. During the 2004 presidential election, then-Russian President Vladimir Putin became the first world leader to congratulate Yanukovich on his victory, a full two days before the electoral commission declared him the winner. Appearing on television after the polls closed Sunday night, Yanukovich said his opponent should begin preparations to step down. But Tymoshenko has evidence of election fraud and intends to demand a recount in some districts where, she says, voting irregularities took place, officials from her party said Tuesday. The two politicians have fought a bitter battle. Yanukovich has strong links to Russia, and a checkered election history. In 2004, he was declared the winner of the presidential election before the ballot's legitimacy was questioned and he was accused of stealing the race. ""The country remembers times when there were presidents announced, they received congratulations, and then things changed,"" Tymoshenko said Sunday, referring to the 2004 race. A pro-Western uprising, known as the Orange Revolution, followed. Yanukovich's win was annulled, and current President Victor Yushchenko won the re-vote. Yushchenko ran for a second term this year, but, blamed for Ukraine's faltering economy, he did not make the runoff. This year's elections, by contrast to those in 2004, got a clean bill of health from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which sent observers. The OSCE hailed the process as ""professional, transparent and honest,"" saying it should ""serve as a solid foundation for a peaceful transition of power."" CNN's Matthew Chance, Mike Sefanov and Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report.","Tymoshenko refuses to concede defeat in Ukraine's presidential election .

Toyoda appeared earlier before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in a hearing aimed at discovering, among other things, why the automaker was slow to respond to safety issues related to sudden acceleration. He admitted to King that the day had been difficult, ""and I am not confident to what degree our sincerity was conveyed."" Asked what his grandfather, the company founder, would say, Toyoda responded, ""He is telling me to regain the trust of those customers who are driving our vehicles."" He vowed to respond more quickly to any future problems. But he was adamant that the company's products are roadworthy. ""I'd like to say that Toyota vehicles are safe,"" he said. Company engineers were not able to reproduce the throttle-control problems, he said, ""so, at this point in time, I would say our vehicles are safe.""

"London, England (CNN) -- The iconic Abbey Road Studios made famous by the Beatles are being declared a national historic landmark, British Culture Minister Margaret Hodge announced Tuesday. ""My favorite song of all time, 'If I fell' by the Beatles, was recorded there in 1964, and to have played a part in preserving this world-famous venue is as exciting for me as hearing that song for the first time. Well, almost!"" Hodge said in a statement. ""Whether your tastes are for classical, hard rock or pop music, one of your favourites is more than likely to have recorded at Abbey Road,"" she added. The studios became an international cultural touchstone when the Beatles were photographed crossing the road there for the cover of their album ""Abbey Road."" But it's not only where the Beatles recorded ""All You Need is Love"" and numerous other songs, but where much of Britain's best known music of the 20th century was laid down. Rock stars Pink Floyd and Cliff Richard, composer Sir Edward Elgar, and the movie soundtracks for ""Star Wars"" and the ""Harry Potter"" films were recorded there. Hodge declared the site in west London a Grade II listed building based on its ""outstanding cultural interest."" The classification means that ""although changes to the interior are not prohibited, care must be taken to ensure that any alterations with respect to its character and interest are fully considered,"" the ministry said. There was intense speculation last week that the studios were for sale, but the owner shot down the notion on Sunday. The music label that owns them is seeking a partner to help pay for upgrades, according to Terra Firma, which controls record label EMI, the owner of the recording studios. ""EMI confirms that it is holding preliminary discussions for the revitalization of Abbey Road with interested and appropriate third parties,"" Terra Firma said Sunday. But that does not mean the studios are for sale, it added. ""In mid-2009, we did receive an offer to buy Abbey Road for in excess of £30 million (currently about $46 million), but this was rejected since we believe that Abbey Road should remain in EMI's ownership,"" the music company said in a statement. The company said Sunday it supported the listing of the building as a historic landmark, before the culture ministry's announcement. Terra Firma bought EMI in 2007. Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer of ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Cats"" and one of Britain's richest men, is ""very interested"" in buying the studios, a representative said Friday. ""He first recorded there in 1967 with Tim Rice. Andrew has since recorded most of his musicals there,"" said the representative, Jenni Pain. ""He thinks it is vital that the studios are saved for the future of the music industry in the UK. Abbey Road has such great facilities, with three major recording studios, and Andrew has probably brought more musicians to record there than anyone else, because it has the capacity to record large orchestral productions."" CNN's Per Nyberg and Morgan Neill contributed to this report.","Abbey Road Studios given Grade II listed building status for ""outstanding cultural interest""

"(CNN)  -- An angry Phil Mickelson hinted at legal action for being accused of ""cheating"" by fellow PGA Tour professional Scott McCarron. The world number two carded a two-under 70 to be four shots behind third round leader Ryuji Imada at the Farmers Insurance Open, but for the second day in a row his post-round press conference centered on his use of a 20-year-old wedge with square grooves. McCarron was quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle on Friday, saying that Mickelson and others who had opted to play with the Ping-Eye 2 wedge were exploiting a loophole in PGA Tour rules. ""It's cheating, and I'm appalled Phil has put it in play,"" he said. New rules introduced this year only allow for irons with V-shaped grooves, but because of a lawsuit filed by manufacturers Ping an exception has been made for wedges, with square grooves, which were made before April 1, 1990. Mickelson is using one of those wedges at Torrey Pines this week and on Friday he was grilled about his use and McCarron reported comments. Mickelson declined then to get into what he called ""name calling"" but mounted a stout defense of his use of the club, saying it was within the rules. But after his fine third round on the South Course, Mickelson appeared to up the ante. ""We all have our opinions on the matter, but a line was crossed and I just was publicly slandered,"" Mickelson told the official PGA Tour Web site. ""And because of that, I'll have to let other people handle that."" Asked he was mounting a lawsuit, Mickelson said, ""I'm not going into specifics what that meant."" Meanwhile, the PGA Tour has issued a statement to explain why the controversial Ping-Eye 2 wedges were approved for play, appearing to criticize McCarron for his comments. ""Because the use of pre-1990 Ping Eye 2 irons is permitted for play, public comments or criticisms characterizing their use as a violation of the Rules of Golf as promulgated by the USGA are inappropriate at best,"" read the final paragraph of the statement. Mickelson said that it was ""cool if they put that out there."" On the course, Imada shot a two-under 70 for a 13-under 203 and had a two-shot lead over Ben Crane (69) and Michael Sim of Australia. U.S. Open champion Lucas Glover carded a 68 and was three shots behind with Mickelson a further stroke behind on his season-debut on the PGA Tour.","Phil Mickelson hints at legal action after accusations of 'cheating' by fellow pro Scott McCarron .

"United Nations (CNN) -- United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon handed President Clinton additional responsibility Wednesday for earthquake-ravaged Haiti, charging him with overseeing aid efforts as well as reconstruction.

""Almost all the infrastructure (is) gone there, so the trick is to get the Haitian people back where they can stop living from day-to-day and start living week-to-week or month-to-month.""

"(CNN) -- Kwame Nkrumah-Acheampong, or the ""Snow Leopard"" as he has been dubbed, is making his final preparations for the Winter Olympics in Vancouver. A skier preparing to take part in the Games at this point in the calendar is not the most sensational news, until it is understood the 31-year-old grew up in Accra, Ghana (where the annual average temperature is around 79 degrees Fahrenheit) and learnt to ski only six years ago on a dry slope. Nkrumah-Acheampong hopes his remarkable and unconventional rise to prominence -- he achieved the strict qualifying criteria set by the world governing body of his sport from his training base at an artificial snow dome in Milton Keynes, England, where he was a former employee -- can act as inspiration to his countrymen. ""The response that I get from emails and phone calls, that more people are going to come into snow sports, that's what I'm hoping to achieve and 10 years from now Ghana should have a ski racer who is 10 times better than me,"" he told CNN. The ""Snow Leopard"" first sprung to prominence after announcing his intention to qualify and compete in the downhill at the Turin Winter Olympics in 2006, despite only having taken up the sport in 2003. ""It took 30 minutes for me to be able to just go in a straight line, slow myself down and stop, and the instructor who was my friend, told me: 'You know something, just go and train yourself now, just carry on.' And that's when I started falling down,"" he said. After becoming hooked on downhill and pleased with his natural ability he set about trying to qualify -- a feat that involved traveling around the world. He narrowly missed qualifying for the Turin-based Games but came back stronger to insure his place in Canada, an achievement the 34-year-old is exceptionally proud of. ""I think it was like sending a Ghanaian to the moon, [but] apart from it being really cool -- I still wake up and still think to myself -- this is going to be really tough, people are going to be watching you -- you can't just go to the Olympics and just have fun,"" he added. The father of two will compete in two events, the giant slalom and slalom, and is anxious not to be a figure of fun like British ski-jumper Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards, who notoriously captured the headlines at the 1988 Winter Games in Calgary. He prefers to take his cue from the Jamaican bob sleigh team who also competed in Calgary and inspired the popular film ""Cool Runnings"". ""The Jamaican bob sleigh team did actually try really hard to have really fast push off times, really moving down the course -- not all the factors were right for them -- and they crashed -- if they didn't crash, they would have done a really good time,"" he said. ""So I love being compared to Cool Runnings but not Eddie the ""Eagle"" or Eric the ""Eel"" (swimmer from Equatorial Guinea) because to me, sports is a serious thing. ""If you want to be a sportsman, be a sportsman. If you want to have fun then do sports for leisure. Don't take the seriousness of sport and make a mockery of it."" There is another serious point to the Ghanaian's participation, his efforts on behalf of the charity which attempts to protect the rare animal from which he gleans his nickname. ""I'm working with the Snow Leopard Trust, they protect the endangered snow leopard,"" he said. ""I'm also working with Sabre which is a registered charity in Britain, taking kids in tough areas out of London and out to the Alps, showing them a different side to life."" Nkrumah- Acheampong's ambition is to return with his family, who live in Milton Keynes, to Ghana and to open a dry ski slope. In the meantime, his attentions are fully on next month where he will pit his skills against the likes of Bode Miller and Benjamin Raich. ""I don't just want to get down, but ski well and not come at the bottom of the table,"" he said.","Winter Games appearance comes only six years after first ski run on a dry slope .

"London, England (CNN) -- A British soldier who went absent without leave rather than return to fight in Afghanistan was jailed Friday for nine months by a military court, officials said. A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that Lance Corp. Joe Glenton had been convicted by a military judge at a court martial in Colchester, southeast England, . Glenton, who completed a seven-month tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2006, became an outspoken critic of British military operations in the country during his absence, frequently appearing at anti-war rallies and on television. In an interview last July, the 27-year-old told CNN that he was not a conscientious objector, but was refusing to return because he felt the 2001 invasion and subsequent conflict against Taliban militants was not a legitimate use of force. ""The situation in Afghanistan and our involvement is further antagonizing the Muslim population of the world,"" Glenton said.

"(CNN) -- An Ohio firefighter faces jail time and may lose his job for shooting his two dogs to death rather than pay to board them while he went on a cruise. Columbus, Ohio, firefighter David Santuomo shot his two dogs in his home's basement, prosecutors say. Columbus firefighter David P. Santuomo, 43, took Sloopy and Skeeter to his home's basement, suspended them from a pipe near the ceiling and fired at least 11 shots from a .22-caliber rifle fitted with a homemade silencer, Franklin County Prosecuting Attorney Ron J. O'Brien said. Santuomo then wrapped the carcasses in plastic and dumped them in a trash bin behind Firehouse 27, where he worked, O'Brien said. ""This is pretty heinous,"" said Cheri Miller, spokeswoman for the Capital Area Humane Society, which carried out a search warrant in Santuomo's home. The humane society has limited law enforcement powers in Franklin County. Santuomo pleaded guilty in June to two misdemeanor counts of improperly killing a companion animal and a felony count of possession of a criminal tool. Santuomo had fashioned a makeshift silencer by taping a 2-liter soda bottle to the end of the rifle. The incident happened in December. Miller said appalled fellow firefighters turned Santuomo in to authorities. ""There were reports that he was bragging about this,"" she said. Santuomo initially told investigators the dogs had ingested antifreeze and he killed them to put them out of their misery, Miller said. However, after necropsies showed the dogs were not poisoned, the firefighter admitted shooting them because he couldn't afford to board them, she said. Public records show Santuomo has twice filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and underwent a home foreclosure in 2003. The Columbus Division of Fire has received more than 2,000 outraged e-mails and calls from the public, said Battalion Chief David Whiting, the department's spokesman. ""People are not very happy,"" he said. ""We had people say they should do to him what he's done to the dogs. A lot of people want him fired. They don't want him coming into their house. They're worried about their animals; they're worried about their kids. They'd just as soon let their house burn down if he shows up."" The Division of Fire has concluded an internal investigation, including interviews with Santuomo, Whiting said. The report now goes to Fire Chief Ned Pettus Jr., who will schedule a disciplinary hearing. Punishment, if any, could range from a verbal reprimand to firing, Whiting said. With appeals and possible arbitration, the whole process could take a month or more, he said. In the meantime, Santuomo is working in the division's fire alarm office, ""where he is not dealing face to face with the public,"" Whiting said. If he remains employed with the fire division, he will return to his regular assignment, though that could bring a new set of challenges, Whiting added. ""If someone did this that worked next to you at work, how would you feel about working with him?"" Whiting asked. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. ... There are a lot of options."" Santuomo has only minor disciplinary matters, such as tardiness, in his record, Whiting said. Santuomo was sentenced to 90 days in jail, to be served in 10-day increments over the next two years. He also has to pay $4,500 in restitution, perform 200 hours of community service, stay away from companion animals for five years and write a letter of apology to be published in the local newspaper and the International Association of Firefighters magazine, the humane society's Miller said. Santuomo's attorney said that his client is remorseful over his actions and that people need to temper their outrage. ""It's the same old story. They couldn't care less about people and they love animals,"" lawyer Sam Shamansky said. The firefighter, who could not be reached for comment, has no criminal history other than traffic violations, Shamansky said. ""It, of course, was a heinous act, and it's an act for which he's sorry and has accepted responsibility,"" Shamansky said of the dog killings. ""He's been punished appropriately, and I think it's now time for the public to practice what they preach and show a little forgiveness and mercy. Maybe that might be a novel approach.""","Columbus, Ohio, firefighter ties his two dogs in basement, shoots them .

"Titanyan, Haiti (CNN) -- Daniel Rouzier clutched a mahogany rosary and a pair of latex gloves in his left hand, his face covered in a sterile mask. He watched intently as two front-end loaders clawed into piles of dirt and dumped it into freshly dug trenches. Arms, legs, entire bodies flailed and flew before reaching their final resting place. The stench of human flesh, decomposing for 17 days, carried with the wind. Rouzier took it upon himself to bury the estimated 2,500 bodies here. They were mothers, fathers, sons and daughters who were never given a proper burial after they perished in the earthquake that leveled the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince on January 12. At least 150,000 people died that day, the Haitian government estimates. Many of their bodies were dumped here, near the village of Titanyan, about 45 minutes northeast of the capital. Rouzier, who owns a car dealership and helps run the Haitian charity, Food for the Poor, said he was watching a CNN report Friday about how many bodies were just left to rot, without proper interment. ""I was just appalled. This is a sacrilege,"" he said Saturday. Haiti, he said, is a deeply spiritual country with great respect for the dead. ""This,"" he said pointing to the mounds of death, ""is countercultural to Haiti -- the total lack of respect for the dead."" Marie Laurence Lasseque, Haiti's minister of information, denied to CNN's Anderson Cooper that the dead had been transported out of the city by truck and dumped out of view without burial. She said the state-run trucking company CNE was ""doing a good job"" disposing bodies. But after seeing footage of the bodies on CNN, Rouzier had to do something. By 8 a.m. Friday, he was on the phone, ordering front-end loaders. He asked his welding shop to shape five metal crosses and called Bishop Pierre Andre Dumas to come perform last rites. Dumas arrived Friday with American priest Richard Frechette, a doctor who cares for the poor in Haiti. The two sprinkled holy water and said prayers over the freshly dug graves and remaining piles of bodies. Rouzier's crew buried about 1,500 people Friday. The next day, they returned for the remaining 1,000. No one knows how many such mounds of bodies exist still in these valleys. Some are near Titanyan, its grim past now linked with this macabre task. This is where the dirty work of politics stooped to its lowest as the bodies of thousands who died under the brutal Duvalier dictatorships were said to have been tossed. Rouzier surveyed the land -- rocky dirt and gentle rolling hills that will forever be haunted by restless souls. At least, he was able to restore dignity to some of them, though no one will know who is buried here, under the five metal crosses. ""Maybe they are doing them better elsewhere. I don't know,"" Rouzier said. He didn't want to blame anyone for what happened. It's easy to point fingers at a time of epic tragedy. He simply found relief Saturday in finding some sense of closure more than two weeks after the devastating earthquake. ""I'm very grateful to be able to do this,"" he said. He asked visiting journalists to refrain from walking the mounds of dirt. To not step over the dead. It was a tough two days for Rouzier. But for 2,500 Haitians, it was grace.","Many earthquake victims were dumped in mass graves about 45 minutes northeast of capital .

"(CNN) -- At least 15 people have been killed and more wounded after a weekend of heavy fighting in Somalia's capital, journalists and a hospital spokeswoman said Monday. Artillery shelling from an area controlled by the government into an insurgent stronghold killed at least 15 and wounded 60 others Sunday in northeastern Mogadishu, journalists said after surveying the aftermath. More than 120 people have been admitted to a hospital with wounds related to fighting since Friday, said Duniyo Ali Mohamed, head of the medical department at Medina Hospital. The fighting comes after a militant Islamist group associated with al Qaeda attacked areas controlled by government troops and peacekeepers Friday, leaving 12 dead and at least 30 injured, witnesses said. Two of the 12 were members of al-Shabaab, according to Sheik Ali Mohamud Raghe, a spokesman for the militants. Al-Shabaab is an extremist group that the United States considers to be a terrorist organization. Somali government officials downplayed the offensive, calling it ""small and careless.""

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The captors of a kidnapped 5-year-old British boy included someone who was close to the family, Pakistan's Interior Minister said Sunday. ""There is someone who is very close to the family because the way the situation happened; the way the entry was made,"" Minister Rehman Malik said. Malik, who spoke to reporters after meeting the boy's father in the Pakistani town of Jhelum, said authorities were close to finding the kidnappers. ""We have certain leads which we would not like to disclose, but I have a warning to those who abducted the boy: leave the boy because we are very near to you,"" he said. The boy, Sahil Saeed, is of Pakistani descent. He was on the last day of a two-week vacation in Pakistan before he planned to return home to Oldham in northern England. Gunmen barged into Sahil's grandmother's home in the eastern province of Punjab and took him at gunpoint Wednesday. They have reportedly demanded a ransom of 10 million rupees ($118,000).","Five-year-old snatched by armed robbers while on holiday with family in Punjab .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Four people found dead in a southeastern Afghan compound appear to be victims of an honor killing, a senior U.S. military official said on Friday. The bodies were discovered during an operation by Afghan and NATO-led forces in Paktia province, a volatile region along the border of Pakistan. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the bodies of two men and two women were found, with the women bound and gagged, and the U.S. official said the people were shot ""execution-style."" An honor killing is a murder carried out by a family or community member against someone thought to have brought dishonor onto them. The U.S. official said it isn't clear whether the dishonor in this case stemmed from accusations of acts such as adultery or even cooperating with NATO forces. ""It has the earmarks of a traditional honor killing,"" said the official, who added the Taliban could be responsible. Afghan and NATO officials are investigating the incident, which occurred in the village of Khatabeh in the province's Gardez district. The operation unfolded when Afghan and international forces went to the compound, which was thought to be a site of militant activity. A firefight ensued and several insurgents died, several people left the compound, and eight others were detained. Paktia is the same province where a military base was the target of an assault that wounded five U.S. soldiers on Thursday, authorities said. Both the U.S. official and a Paktia province spokesman confirmed that a suicide attacker, apparently wearing police garb, carried out the action. The U.S. official said it may never be fully determined if the uniform was stolen or the bomber was a turncoat. On December 30, a suicide attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan killed seven CIA officers and a Jordanian army captain. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, also on a base in eastern Afghanistan. Meanwhile, more than 20 ""enemy militants"" were killed Friday by Afghan and international forces in the country's western region, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. The deaths occurred during an operation in Farah province targeting a Taliban commander thought to be responsible for planning suicide attacks, the military said. When a militant threw a grenade at troops approaching a building, the forces called for his surrender, it said. The troops tried to enter the building when the militant detonated a suicide vest. After that blast, a large number of armed militants tried to confront troops, who killed the insurgents, the military said. One alleged militant was injured and five were detained, it said. Troops found weaponry, such as grenades, firearms and handheld radios. Farah borders Helmand province, where international and Afghan troops are gearing up for a major assault on the Taliban.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Without issuing a recall of its iconic Prius hybrid vehicles, Toyota said Thursday a software glitch is to blame for braking problems in the 2010 model. ""We would want to be given a little time,"" Hiro Yuki Yokoyama, Toyota's managing officer, said when reporters asked whether a recall was in the works. The company changed its braking system software in January as part of what it called ""constant quality improvements,"" but did not say what it would do about vehicles manufactured before then. Toyota officials described the problem as a ""disconnect"" in the vehicle's complex anti-lock brake system (ABS) that causes less than a one-second lag. With the delay, a vehicle going 60 mph will have traveled nearly another 90 feet before the brakes begin to take hold. Brakes in hybrids such as the Prius operate differently from brakes in most cars. In addition to standard brakes, which use friction from pads pressed against drums or rotors, the electric motors in hybrids help slow them. The process also generates electricity to recharge the batteries. The Japanese government has warned Toyota to take seriously mounting complaints with the Prius. Toyota Vice President Shinichi Sasaki met with Japan's transport minister on Wednesday. iReport: How are Toyota's problems affecting you? In Japan, 14 complaints about brakes in the Prius have been lodged since July. Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has asked Toyota to investigate, according to the Japan Automobile Dealers Association. ""The complaints received via our dealers center around when drivers are on a bumpy road or frozen surface,"" said Paul Nolasco, a Toyota Motor Corp. spokesman in Japan. ""The driver steps on the brake, and they do not get as full of a braking feel as expected."" Full coverage of Toyota recall . In the United States, more than 100 complaints alleging poor brake performance have been lodged with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration against the 2010 Prius, a newly designed version of the car that was introduced last summer. ""NHTSA has received a number of complaints about a potential defect affecting the brake system in Toyota's Prius hybrid and is conducting field work to examine the issue,"" the agency said Wednesday. A search of NHTSA's complaint database turned up many similar-sounding complaints in the United States. ""I have been driving my 2010 Prius for 6 months and have experienced the following nearly 10 times,"" one owner wrote. ""When braking, if a pothole or bump in the road is hit, the car seemingly jerks forward/accelerates for a split second."" The Prius is Toyota's third best-selling model in the United States, ranking behind the Camry mid-size sedan and the Corolla compact car. Toyota's public image, and its sales, have been hit by recent recalls involving unintended acceleration. The automaker recalled 2.3 million vehicles on January 21 because of problems with sticking gas pedals and later halted the sale of the eight models involved in the recall. Toyota's U.S. sales plunged 16 percent in January as a result, even as sales of other automakers rose. Toyota announced third-quarter results Thursday, posting a 10.2 percent rise in net revenue from the year before. The quarter ended December 31, three weeks before Toyota stopped selling the recalled models. In a separate recall, about 4.2 million vehicles were called back in November for a problem in which the cars' gas pedals could get stuck in some floor mats. The last-generation version of the Prius was included in that recall, which was expanded to include an additional 1.1 million cars last week.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Thirty-two Taliban insurgents and three Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting between security forces and militants in southern Afghanistan, a local government official told CNN Thursday. The violence took place on Wednesday in the Khushal Khan village of Nad Ali district in Helmand province, said the provincial governor's spokesman, Dawood Ahmadi. The district is where the U.S. Marines are cranking up plans for a major operation against the insurgency, a push targeting a swath of territory considered the last major stronghold of the Taliban in Helmand province. The Wednesday flareup in Khushal Khan occurred during an Afghan-NATO-led joint operation. Along with the deaths, three Afghan soldiers and a soldier from NATO's International Security Assistance Force were injured. The Marines plan to launch a big push on Marjah, a town with 80,000 to 100,000 people in the Nad Ali district, considered to be under Taliban control. The insurgency there has influence stretching to Pakistan and the bordering provinces of Nimruz and Farah. The Marine-led operation will ""alter the ecosystem of this area significantly,"" Col. George Amland, the deputy commander of Task Force Leatherneck, said at a briefing Wednesday. Amland didn't say when the operation will start, but indicated it will be soon. He noted that the backbone of the force will be made up of some of the 30,000 additional U.S. troops being sent to Afghanistan by President Obama and will include a large contingent of Afghan security forces. The push will follow other big operations in Helmand -- Cobra's Anger in December and Khanjar last summer.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama and Republican and Democratic leaders engaged in a spirited but civil debate at a health care summit Thursday, finding agreement on some issues but appearing to find little common ground on how to move forward in a bipartisan way. ""I don't know, frankly, whether we can close that gap,"" said President Obama as the day-long meeting closed. If agreement is not reached, he said, there will be ""a lot of arguments about procedures in Congress about moving forward,"" an apparent reference to using a parliamentary shortcut under which a health care bill could be passed with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority the body requires to overcome the filibuster which Republicans have threatened to use. ""My hope had been there might be enough areas of overlap to realistically think about moving forward without a situation in which everyone just goes to their respective corners and this ends up being a political fight,"" he said. ""Frankly, I was discourage by the outcome,"" Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, told reporters after the meeting. He urged the Democrats to ""start over and go step by step and target the areas of possible agreement that we discussed in the meeting today."" Sen. John Boehner, R-Ohio, sounded equally unenthusiastic. ""I think the American people want us to work together on common steps to make our current system work better,"" he said. ""We can't do it within the framework of a 2,700-page bill."" Live updates from the health care summit . ""The president let everybody talk and talk and talk,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who called Obama ""the most patient man in the world."" Though there were areas of agreement, he said, ""every Republican used the same talking points."" He, too, appeared to raise the specter of attempting to move forward through the parliamentary shortcut, known as reconciliation. ""It's time we do something and we're going to do it,"" the Nevada Democrat said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was ""not overly optimistic"" that the Democrats would be able to attract Republican votes for the health care bill. Obama said in opening remarks that ""it is absolutely critical to begin now moving on what is one of the biggest drags on the economy."" The situation affects not just people without health insurance, but also those who have it, he said. ""The problem is not getting better,"" he said. ""It is getting worse."" Share your reaction to the summit . Obama called on Republican and Democratic leaders at the much-publicized summit to ""not focus on where we differ, but focus on where we agree."" The differences were evident, though, in what each side believes should happen next. Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander, who made the opening remarks for his party, said Democrats should scrap existing bills passed by the House and Senate and start over on new legislation.  Watch what areas Democrats and Republicans can agree on . That's not going to happen, Democrats answered, saying Americans cannot wait. ""For them, they don't have time for us to start over,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. Jon Kyl, the Senate Republican Whip, pointed out that a major philosophical difference between the two sides is who should be in charge of the health care system -- the government or private industry. ""There's so much in the bills you have supported that puts so much control in Washington,"" Kyl said to Obama. House Republican Whip Eric Cantor also highlighted that concern, pointing out that Republicans are nearly unanimous in their opposition to the bills. ""There is a reason we voted no,"" Cantor said to Obama. ""It does have to do with the philosophical differences you pointed out. It also has to do with our fear that Washington can define what are essential health benefits."" Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin made an impassioned plea for passage of health care reform, saying the current system discriminates against people who are already sick. Watch Harkin's plea for everyone to have insurance . Racial segregation has been outlawed, he said, ""however we still allow segregation today on the basis of your health."" Fellow Democratic Sen. Jay Rockefeller urged greater oversight of the health insurance sector, which he called ""a shark that swims just below the water."" ""This is a rapacious industry that does what it wants, unknown to the people of America except on an individual basis,"" Rockefeller said. Critics had said before the nationally televised summit started that it would amount to a public relations stunt. ""This is about theater,"" said Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican. ""This is not about substance, unfortunately.""  Watch what's at stake at the health care summit . Obama addressed that concern in his opening remarks. ""I hope this isn't political theater where people are playing to the camera,"" he said. Obama said Republicans and Democrats seem to agree that costs have to be contained. ""It's absolutely true that if all we're doing is adding more people to a broken system, then costs will continue to skyrocket,"" he said. Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, who is a physician, listed several ways to cut costs, including focusing on disease prevention and management as well as cracking down on fraud. Coburn also blasted what he called the ""extortion"" behind frivolous lawsuits that make doctors victims of the current legal system. ""A large number of the tests we order every day are not for the patients, they're for the doctors,"" Coburn said. Another Republican physician, Rep. Charles Boustany of Louisiana, said doctors also would like a plan that would ""simplify, streamline and standardize all paperwork that is involved."" The cumbersome paperwork, he said, ""takes you away from patient care."" The discussion took a testy tone when Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona complained about how the Democrats handled the process of approving the legislation. McCain, who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential race, said candidate Obama had pledged eight times that the health care debate would be conducted in the open and televised by C-SPAN. Instead, McCain said, the legislation was ""produced behind closed doors ... with unsavory deals."" Obama tried to break in, but McCain asked to be allowed to finish. After McCain was done, Obama seemed to flash some anger when he said, ""We're not campaigning. The election is over."" Said McCain with a slight laugh, ""I'm reminded of that every day."" At one point, both men tried to talk over each other. ""The focus should not be on the issue of how we get a bill done,"" Obama said. McCain replied that ""the American people care about what we do and how we do it."" Obama cut off the discussion when he said, ""We can have a debate about process or we can have a debate about how we help the American people.""  Fact Check: How common is the Senate use of reconciliation? After the meeting, McCain told reporters in a conference call, ""A conversation like this is bound to be a good thing. I just wish we had started it a year ago instead of jamming it through."" He said he hopes the Democrats will refrain from using reconciliation, urging that ""the 60-vote procedure of the Senate be protected."" Obama also seemed to take a shot at Cantor, who stacked the voluminous House and Senate health care reform bills on the table in front of him. The president called the display ""props"" and said, ""These are the kinds of political things we do that prevent us from having a conversation."" On Wednesday, Sen. Chris Dodd, a key author of the Senate health care bill, told reporters flatly that if Republicans continued to demand that Democrats scrap their health care proposals and start over, ""then there's nothing to talk about."" But McConnell argued that starting over is exactly what Republicans want. ""Unless they're willing to do that, I think it's nearly impossible to imagine a scenario under which we can reach agreement because we don't think we ought to pass a 2,700-page bill that seeks to restructure one-sixth of our economy,"" McConnell said.  Watch as opposing sides protest at health summit . He warned the political consequences would be severe if Democrats moved forward without Republican support. Dodd said Democrats and Republicans could find common ground in some areas, such as the Republican push to allow insurers to sell insurance across state lines. He called the GOP proposal ""a legitimate issue,"" but said Democrats already have a version of that proposal in their legislation. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs expressed confidence Thursday that a bill will pass. ""We're very close to health care reform for the American people,"" he said. Three top Democratic sources privately told CNN the new goal is to pass the final legislation by the end of March or else Congress will have to move back to other issues like job creation and unfinished spending bills. The meeting took place across the street from the White House, in the Garden Room at Blair House. The summit discussions were based around four themes -- controlling costs, insurance reforms, reducing the deficit and expanding coverage.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Profits at celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay's British restaurants plunged by nearly 90 percent in the last 12 months. Gordon Ramsay has become as successful on television as he has been off-screen. Run by the Scottish-born chef and his father-in-law Chris Hutcheson, Gordon Ramsay Holdings reported a drop in annual turnover from £41.6 million ($68 million) to £35 million ($57 million) in the year to August 2008, Britain's Press Association reported Friday. Pre-tax profits plummeted by over £3 million ($4.9 million) to £383,325 ($627,000), while net debt in the group, which includes London restaurants such as Claridges, Maze and the flagship Royal Hospital Road, soared to almost £9.5 million ($15.5 million). With spiraling debts and crippling tax bills, the star of TV shows such as ""Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares"" and ""Hell's Kitchen"" was forced to pump huge amounts of his own money into the business, even selling his prized Ferrari to raise funds, The Guardian newspaper said. Ramsay has attributed his business problems to over-ambitious expansion plans, in addition to the closure of two of his 11 London eateries. The Michelin-starred chef opened ten restaurants between 2007 and 2008, while The Savoy Grill was forced to close as the Savoy hotel was refurbished, and the lease at the Connaught expired. The 42-year old was also forced to review his company's international operations, closing restaurants in Paris, Los Angeles and Prague, The Times newspaper reported. ""Ambition overtook me. We thought we could do anything, that we couldn't fail,"" PA quoted Ramsay as saying recently. A full review of the group's operations was instigated in December as part of a refinancing deal with the Royal Bank of Scotland and to help the business get through the troubled economic times. ""2008 brought its own challenges, not just for our group, but for the industry as a whole and the broader economy,"" Hutcheson told PA. ""Whilst the restructuring has benefited the group, the significant contribution and commitment of all 750 staff to the business has been integral to moving us to a position of strength."" Ramsay has endured a difficult time recently. Last month he was criticized by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd after reportedly comparing television star Tracy Grimshaw to a pig during a live cooking show in Melbourne. His trademark colorful language also came under fire last year by another Australian lawmaker. However Ramsay told the country's Channel Nine Network, which broadcasts Kitchen Nightmares and Hell's Kitchen, that the shows emphasize the ""pressures of working in a restaurant kitchen.""","Turnover by Gordon Ramsay Holdings drops from $68M to $57M .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ten Americans detained and accused of child trafficking in Haiti after they allegedly tried to bus 33 children into the Dominican Republic insist their effort was an attempt to get the children to a shelter. But Haiti's prime minister said Sunday that the group was kidnapping the children. ""From what I know until now, this is a kidnapping case,"" Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN. ""Who is doing it -- I don't know. What are the real objectives or activities -- I don't know. But that is kidnapping and it is more serious because it's involving children,"" he said. ""The children certainly were not fully willing to go, because in some cases, from what I heard, they were asking for their parents, they wanted to return to their parents."" How far should aid workers go? U.S. embassy officials visited the Americans over the weekend at a jail near the airport in Port-au-Prince, where they are being detained. They are being treated well and are holding on to their faith, the Americans said. ""We came into Haiti to help those that really had no other source of help,"" Laura Silsby, a member of the Idaho-based charity, New Life Children's Refuge, told CNN on Saturday. ""We are trusting the truth will be revealed and we are praying for that.""  Full coverage . The group of five men and five women said they were trying to move the children to the Dominican Republic in the aftermath of the January 12 earthquake that devastated parts of Haiti, flattening the capital and killing tens of thousands. But a Haitian judge has charged the 10 with child trafficking, they said. The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said Sunday that the Americans have been detained for ""alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration."" ""God is our provider and God gives us strength and comfort,"" said Carla Thompson, one group member. ""We have our Bibles and we are OK."" Government approval is needed for any Haitian children to leave the country, and the group acknowledged that the children have no passports. Jeanne Bernard-Pierre, general director for Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare, said the children will be interviewed in the coming days to determine whether they have living relatives.  Search for the missing . The group said it believed the children were orphaned, and it was going to house them in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic. George Willeit of SOS Children's Villages -- who said that Haitian police and the social ministry brought the children to his group -- said some of the children have living relatives. ""Some of them for sure are not orphans,"" he told CNN. ""Immediately after she arrived here, a girl -- she might be 9 years old -- was crying loudly, 'I am not an orphan, I do have my parents, please call my parents,' "" he said. ""And some of the other kids as well, they have their phone numbers, even, with them from their parents,"" he said. He said he believes that at least 10 are not orphans. Mel Coulter, the father of 23-year-old Charisa Coulter, who is among those arrested, told CNN affiliate KTVB that the group thought it had all of the necessary documents to transport the children out of the earthquake-ravaged country, but apparently lacked some paperwork. ""They want to bring kids out who have no home, who have no parents, who have no hope -- and this was an attempt to give them the hope that they've lost in Haiti,"" he said Saturday. The group ""went down on Thursday night fully expecting that they had everything they needed, all the documentation that they needed,"" he said. ""When they tried to bring some of the kids out [Friday] night they were stopped at the border and [they] said that there was a paper missing,"" he said. ""So they returned to Port-au-Prince, where they went in early [Saturday] morning to try and get the last documentation, and apparently were arrested on the spot and jailed."" He said the group wants ""to do everything according to the processes that are required."" The Rev. Clint Henry, the senior pastor with Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho, where at least some of the group members worship, told KTVB Sunday that the church was hopeful that the group would soon be released. ""We're waiting ... and hoping and praying that that outcome will be the one that we're looking for, so the team that has been falsely charged will be vindicated, and that the whole world is going to know that we weren't here doing the kind of things we're being accused of doing,"" he said. He said the accusations have prompted a number of phone calls to the church that include ""obscenities, accusations about those false rumors, things that I don't care to repeat."" The children were being rescued from ""one or more orphanages"" that had been damaged in the quake, a statement on the church's Web site said. Henry told CNN affiliate KIVI Saturday that the group had been planning to build an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, but that the earthquake sped up the timetable for transporting the Haitian children there. ""We weren't ready to start this yet, everything was in process,"" he said, and the construction on the orphanage has not yet begun. Many of the children said they are from Fort Jacques, a town about seven miles from Port-au-Prince, according to Bernard-Pierre. CNN's Karl Penhaul, Jill Dougherty and journalist Jessica Desvarieux contributed to this report.","Idaho-based missionaries arrested for trying to move children across Haitian border .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama huddled with the Chinese premier Wednesday on the final day of his visit to China. Obama's meeting with Prime Minister Wen Jiabao took place at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, continuing a theme of cooperation between the two nations and development of mutual interests. The men greeted each other in public before meeting privately. The White House hailed this week's meetings between Obama and Chinese leaders. ""President Obama's visit to China has demonstrated the depth and breadth of the global and other challenges where US-China cooperation is critical,"" a White House statement said Wednesday. ""His discussions with President Hu have strengthened possibilities for future cooperation. ""In order to continue to develop this important relationship, President Obama has invited President Hu to visit the United States in 2010. President Hu has accepted with pleasure."" During his final hours in China, Obama visited the Great Wall before flying to South Korea, where he will meet with President Lee Myung-bak. Obama described the Great Wall as ""spectacular,"" as a bone-chilling wind whipped around him. ""It gives you a perspective on a lot of day to day things that don't amount to much."" Asked if the harsh weather reminded him of his home town, Chicago, he said, ""It does feel the same doesn't it?"" His day began with a series of short interviews with American television networks. Wednesday's session with Wen follows Obama's meeting a day earlier with Chinese President Hu Jintao, with the two speaking of a common vision of shared responsibilities and economic opportunities after their talks. Trade, nuclear proliferation and the sticky issue of human rights were part of their discussions. The two leaders ""talked about continuing to build a positive, cooperative and comprehensive relationship between our nations,"" according to Obama, who said he welcomes China's desire for a greater role in world affairs. ""China and the United States share extensive common interests and broad prospects for cooperation on a series of major issues important to mankind's peace and stability and development,"" Hu said, naming the economy, climate change and cultural exchanges among those issues. On economic and trade issues, Hu called for Beijing and Washington to build a positive relationship in the 21st century, to build a partnership. ""Our two countries need to oppose and reject protectionism and all its manifestations,"" Hu said. Sentiment favoring protectionism has grown in the United States, as hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese products pour in each year. Some analysts say the Chinese goods are artificially cheap and come at the expense of American jobs. The issue of human rights has often been a sticking point between Beijing and Washington. China regularly cracks down on its religious and ethnic minorities. Though Hu said China was willing to discuss issues such as human rights and religion to broaden understanding between the nations, he acknowledged that each side had agreed to respect the other's cultural sovereignty. In addition, China and the United States, the largest producers of greenhouse gases, have agreed to team up to fight climate change and create clean energy. Hu and Obama said their nations will cooperate to advance technologies and work toward a global agreement on reducing carbon emissions. The leaders did not offer a timeframe, however.","U.S. President Barack Obama meets Chinese premier on final day of his visit to China .

"WEST HOLLYWOOD, California (CNN) -- We halfway expect the four members of Kings of Leon to roll into Bar 1200 drunk and brawling, a burly tour manager leading them in by the scruff of their necks. Kings of Leon is a family affair, consisting of three brothers and their cousin. Instead, a uniformed valet ushers them in, one by one, offering each a flute of champagne -- which Caleb Followill, the singer, and Nathan Followill, the drummer, politely accept. ""We have a bunch of rooms at the hotel, and the valet came with the floor,"" they explain, shaking their heads in amazement. The hipster lounge we've gathered in is in the lobby of the Sunset Marquis in West Hollywood, California. A framed black-and-white photo of the Kings hangs in a spot of honor: closest to the bar. It's autographed, with a inscription that reads, ""Scene of the crime!"" Kings of Leon's fourth album, ""Only by the Night,"" has sold 5 million copies worldwide and spun off three hit singles, catapulting the group into that elite fraternity of bona fide rock bands that enjoy airplay on both pop and rock stations. These days, the Followill four -- brothers Caleb, Nathan and Jared, along with their cousin, Matthew -- are fulfilling the promise that so many critics predicted early in their career. Their majestic, tension-filled brand of Southern garage rock has its roots in, of all things, the church. The brothers' dad, Ivan, was a traveling Pentecostal preacher who led raucous, revivalist-style congregations. Both he and his father went by the name Leon. His boys have carried on in his road warrior tradition. The stage is their pulpit, their congregation, 20,000-seat arenas. The following is an edited version of our interview. CNN: It's been a great couple of years for you. Do you feel your lives have changed? Caleb Followill: Absolutely. It's just a strange thing for us, because we've had success in the past, but a great majority of it hasn't been in America. And when it starts to happen in America, you turn into a wild person again. ""Oh, let's party!"" CNN: Is it really true that you guys can consume more alcohol than any other band out there on the road? Jared Followill: Collectively, it's a possibility. Caleb: I mean, we can consume more alcohol than any other popular band that actually works. As soon as we say ""thank you"" and ""good night,"" that means it's time for us to have fun. We're sober in the mornings. Most mornings. CNN: Are you sober now? Caleb: Yes. Nathan Followill: Not really. (Laugh) CNN: You guys are also famous for your fights. Rolling Stone had two of you at each other's throats. A $7,000 mirror was apparently involved -- . Caleb: And we were so mad about what they said that we got into a big fight. Nah, I'm kidding. A lot of the stories that come out about us fighting absolutely aren't true. CNN: Are all of you still in your 20s? Nathan: I cracked the 30s! June 26th. Caleb: We're about to Menudo his ass and get someone younger. CNN: You grew up with religion at the center of your life. How do you think it's worked its way into what you do now and what we hear coming out of the stereo? Caleb: I grew up with my dad as a preacher, and so you hear Bible verses. I've always looked at the Bible as poetry, so I kind of learned to write in that style from time to time. And a lot of people misconstrued that as me trying to push something on someone. We're all sinners. (Looks at Nathan) Look at him drinking the devil's grape juice. (The others chuckle) CNN: You played music when you were growing up, but it was associated with the church. Nathan: It was more like black gospel music, like Aretha Franklin, Al Green -- fun music to play. Most people hear, ""Oh, you played in church,"" and they picture an organ, and just very quiet. It was very lively and wild. Caleb: The thing that inspired me about the music we grew on is that it was human music. The people that got up to play, they basically just got up there and told the story of what happened to them that day. Nathan: It was like the blues. With a little Jesus. Caleb: (demonstrates by imitating a blues singer) ""Today, I went to Walmart. Da da da da. I saw someone walking down the aisle, da da da da."" For me, it was inspiring. I thought, ""Man, I want to make up some songs."" CNN: On your current album, ""Only by the Night,"" your music has gotten bigger and more anthemic. Can we attribute that to the time you've spent hanging out with U2? Caleb: We spent a big chunk as the opening band for U2 and Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam -- and when we walked out into these venues, let's face it, there might have been 200 people in a 20,000-seat venue. And so we would start playing our songs, and when we'd play it, it would sound bigger than anything we'd ever heard, because it was bouncing off the walls. So then we'd start to soundcheck in all these big places, and the songs started to build. But you never know. The next one could be raw and dirty and gritty and really small. We like to keep people guessing. CNN: How did your parents react to your saying, ""Hey, Mom and Dad, I want to be in a rock band."" Caleb: They took it pretty well. They supported us pretty good. We had to lie our way through it a little bit. Matthew's family didn't know he was actually going to be in the band. We told them he was going to spend the summer with us but -- . Matthew Followill: Never came home. CNN: Right now, your dad is on the road with you, Matthew. Matthew: Yeah, he's only out for a couple of shows. Our family always comes to hang out. CNN: Looks like you'd better get him some sunscreen. He's a little red. Caleb: That's not from sun. That's actually from alcohol. He gets really red in the face after a long bender.","Kings of Leon sold 5 million copies worldwide of CD ""Only by the Night""

"(CNN)  -- We have met the enemy, and he is us. Debate on health care reform has once again become a miserable exhibition of seemingly irreconcilable differences, which President Obama is trying to address in his health care summit. There is a path forward, and it starts with understanding that waiting for the government to lead an uncertain reform effort isn't necessary. Prepaid integrated health systems like Kaiser Permanente, Geisinger Health System, Group Health Cooperative and HealthPartners are succeeding and innovative. It's no coincidence that these organizations are often mentioned when describing health care providers that offer high quality care while staying affordable. Legislators should encourage such proven successes and make them available to all Americans. Integrated health systems simply assume responsibility for both the financing and delivery of care, so they try to keep patients healthy and avoid costlier illnesses and hospitalizations down the road.  They are more likely to provide preventative care, such as vaccinations and cancer screening. Basically, the system we are all accustomed to in the United States separates insurance from the provision of care. That is, your doctor and hospital and your health insurance company are different institutions. This pits them against one another, because one wants to cut care whenever possible, while the other wants to provide as much care as possible, with little incentive to keep costs down. Integrated systems are simply both -- they are either  insurance companies who own their own hospitals and hire their own doctors or hospital and physician groups that offer a health plan. Other innovations routinely seen in integrated systems include digital medical records, direct electronic messaging with providers, instant access to health records and test results, telehealth and home-based medical services and affordable access to primary care. Many people are determined that the United States should emulate the rest of the industrialized world and adopt a publicly subsidized system of universal coverage. Admirers of these foreign systems point to their low costs and accessible primary care services, but they may be surprised to find that successful integrated health systems in this country are organized very similarly to the most admired state-sponsored systems found overseas. Whether taxpayers help fund an institution is not the main factor for success; rather, it is the integration between delivery and payment that creates an incentive to provide high-value care that keeps members healthy and out of hospitals. This is the mantra that guides care delivery in both the best-performing systems overseas and in prepaid integrated systems in the United States. Meanwhile, there are, of course, publicly supported health programs in the United States, including Medicare and Medicaid. Yet the same people who lament that a state-subsidized health care system would lay an unrelenting path to outright socialism hardly ever call  for a dismantling of Medicare. Whether that's because of political expediency or simple hypocrisy can be left to conjecture. What's important is that a high-performing, state-sponsored health institution already operates in the United States -- the Veterans Health Administration. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, however, the VA has a tightly integrated health care system that has managed to dramatically improve quality and introduce innovations, all while keeping costs in check. Killing off all state-sponsorship of health care in this country in a shortsighted resistance against progressivism would be a grave mistake. The bottom line is that we've been arguing over the wrong question. The best health care system isn't a matter of private vs. public, or us vs. them. The debate should be about how to foster a system that is organized in a way such that its utmost concern is providing value to its patients. There is no need to import a foreign system; we already have many similar systems in existence. The biggest hurdle is that, despite their advantages, integrated systems only serve about 5 percent of the population. Entrenched players in the health care industry stand opposed to integrated care. If legislators truly want to make health care better, they will encourage the development of more integrated systems so that everyone has access to multiple options in a competitive marketplace. Maintaining a vibrant, innovative private sector is critical, but we also can't ignore the success of many integrated, publicly subsidized systems abroad. Fostering the growth of our own integrated health systems in the private sector addresses the right question and offers the opportunity for us to have the best system of all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jason Hwang.","Jason Hwang touts integrated health systems, which handle finances and care .

"(Mental Floss) -- For most of us, college donations entail little more than occasionally dropping a small check in the mail after receiving repeated pleas for cash from our alma maters. Some people, though, tend to be a bit more individualistic with their generosity. Let's take a look at some of the quirkier donations schools have received: . 1. Bequest puts jocks on the ropes . In 1907, fledgling Swarthmore College received a bequest that was estimated to be worth somewhere between $1 and $3 million. If the school wanted the cash, though, it would have to stop participating in intercollegiate sports. Swarthmore badly needed the cash -- its entire endowment was only in the $1 million range -- but in the end, the school turned down the gift and the sports survived. 2. Ivy League has to produce homemakers . When former Massachusetts Attorney General A.E. Pillsbury gave Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia $25,000 apiece in his 1931 will, he had a catch in mind: the schools had to use the bequests to combat the feminist movement that had ""already begun to impair the family as the basis of civilization and its advance."" Pillsbury envisioned the schools creating a lectureship that could help keep women in the home. 3. Auburn goes to the dogs . When Miss Eleanor Elizabeth Ritchey, granddaughter of the founder of the Quaker State Oil Refining Company, died in 1968, she left Auburn University a generous gift of $2.5 million. She also gave the school something a bit more unusual: the responsibility for 150 dogs. Ritchey, who owned a ranch in Florida and loved to adopt homeless dogs, made the large cash donation contingent on the school finding good homes for all 150 of her dogs. The cash was then earmarked for veterinary research. Mental Floss: Videos: Dogs welcoming home soldiers . 4. Bryn Mawr goes on the clock . Did Bryn Mawr need any new clocks in 1957? It didn't matter. They were getting one. Philadelphia physician Florence Chapman Child left the school $50,000 in her will if they would also agree to take her 150-year-old grandfather clock. The doctor stipulated that the school's administrators had to ""install it in an appropriate place, keep it in proper condition and repair, make no changes in the fundamental appearance, and are not to have it electrified."" 5. Donor wants flowers in perpetuity . For years, Indiana University offered a scholarship with a strange condition: the recipient was supposed to drive from Bloomington to Indianapolis once a year to put flowers on the donor's grave. The school gradually decided it was a bit much to ask a student to take a roadtrip to a stranger's headstone, though, so for 20 years it didn't enforce the requirement. Eventually the donor's attorney found out that the flowers weren't being placed, but instead of being indignant he worked with the school to remove the clause from the bequest. 6. Colleges find a fountainhead of cash . In 2008, Marshall University received a $1 million gift to establish the BB&T Center for the Advancement of American Capitalism. The catch was that the school had to agree to teach Ayn Rand's ""Atlas Shrugged"" as part of its curriculum. BB&T executives said the requirement was designed to spark debate on the ethical underpinnings of capitalism. This wasn't the first time BB&T had made this sort of gift, either. In 2005, it gave the University of North Carolina Charlotte another million big ones to make ""Atlas Shrugged"" required reading for its students. 7. Small potatoes lead to big cash . In 1950, the government had a surplus of potatoes and started looking for ways to get rid of the excess tubers. The Department of Agriculture decided to give the potatoes to Hiwassee College, a small Methodist school in eastern Tennessee. College president D.R. Youell told the government that he didn't want its charity, though. A short time later, the school received a $10,000 donation with a note praising the institution for taking a stand against ""the dangerous trends toward socialism in our Government."" Mental Floss: 7 College Cheating Scandals . 8. College profits from a racist will . When Dr. Jesse C. Coggins died in 1962, he left his estate to the Keswick nursing home so it could construct a new building. Coggins made a last-minute change to the will, though, that stipulated that the building would only house white patients. In 1999, a court ruled that the racist stipulation effectively voided the gift and gave the entire estate -- which had grown to $28.8 million -- to the will's backup beneficiary, the University of Maryland Medical Center. 9. Donor affects fashion from beyond the grave . Radcliffe once received a piece of jewelry as a bequest. A nice gift, to be sure, but the late donor was a bit bossy. She wasn't just donating the piece of jewelry; she stipulated in the gift that the president of Radcliffe must wear the accessory. 10. Small college enters the Scientific Instrument Business . By the time Erick O. Schonstedt died in 1993, he had built his 40-year-old business, the Schonstedt Instrument Company, into a $6-million-a-year enterprise. There was a problem, though. If he wanted to leave the business to a relative or an employee, the estate taxes would have been nearly $3 million. None of his prospective heirs had that sort of loot on hand. Schonstedt, a University of Minnesota alum, got creative. He gave the company to Augustana College, a school that, like Schonstedt, had Swedish Lutheran affiliations. Rather than simply turning around and flipping the business for cash, though, Augustana decided to run it. The school instituted new sales models, found cost savings, and changed the company's product mix, and after two years was exceeding profit targets by 25 percent. In 2008, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at North Carolina State received a similar gift; a donor left the school controlling interest in a company he had started to raise sturgeon for caviar in North Carolina. 11. A different kind of monument . Back in 2008, writer Katie Kelly covered an interesting donation: . ""Endowing a school, building, or even a classroom with one's name is a pretty typical fundraising practice among universities today. Demanding a bathroom to commemorate yourself isn't quite as common. Brad Feld, a local venture capitalist, donated $25,000 to the University of Colorado on the condition that a plaque would be placed on the door of a second-floor men's restroom in one of the campus' technology centers. He originally made the conditional offer to his alma mater, MIT, but was rejected. ""Feld, in an interview with Boulder's Daily Camera, stated: 'I just wanted a plaque outside of the men's room to inspire people as they walk in to do their business.' Quite fittingly, the quote reads, 'The best ideas often come at inconvenient times -- don't ever close your mind to them.'"" Mental Floss: 11 majors your college probably didn't offer . 12. School doesn't say ""Danke Schoen"" to Wayne Newton . In 1993, Wayne Newton made his first appearance in Branson, Missouri. He offered to give his cut of the first night's show to the nearby College of the Ozarks. It was a pretty generous gift; Newton's take would have ended up being $15,000 to $25,000. Unfortunately, the school's president, Jerry Davis, went to see Newton's set. He was horrified by Newton's double entendres and jokes about the elderly having sex. The next day Davis announced that the school wouldn't accept a cent of Newton's money. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- The wife of former New Life Church pastor Ted Haggard said Thursday that she never considered divorce after she discovered her husband had sexual encounters with men. ""I knew that he was more than this struggle,"" Gayle Haggard said on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" while promoting her new book ""Why I Stayed."" ""I knew that we spent almost 30 years together, and I knew there was so much to salvage in our relationship that was worth fighting for,"" she said. Ted Haggard, the former president of the National Association of Evangelicals and the head pastor at the 14,000-member New Life, was outed publicly in 2006 by a former prostitute, Mike Jones, who said Haggard had paid him for sex over three years and had used methamphetamine in his presence. Haggard also later admitted to an inappropriate relationship with a 20-year-old male church volunteer. Haggard said Thursday night that he no longer has same-sex urges, attributing the change to therapy. He blamed his homosexual experiences on a sexual encounter with an adult man when he was in second grade, which ""formed the way my mind processes things."" ""Certainly on many levels it was devastating to me,"" Gayle Haggard said of her husband's encounters. ""But I started on a path to real education on the subject and I learned so much about the diversity of our human makeup and that all of us are the way we are for a reason. And I learned that things happen in our life that condition us in our sexuality."" Both Haggard and his wife say they have a normal physical relationship -- one that ""never stopped"" even in the wake of the public scandal. ""What is so wonderful is the intimacy we have on all levels in our marriage,"" Gayle Haggard said. The couple said they currently don't belong to a church. Both agreed to leave New Life and the Colorado Springs, Colorado, area in a settlement following the scandal, but make a living by speaking about their story to church congregations around the country. ""I haven't doubted my faith in this process but I have redefined it,"" Gayle Haggard said. ""Early on, I was so satisfied with my faith walk and I felt as though my life was just wonderful. ""But then I went through this very dark time where I felt like there was nothing good. ... But I held on by a thread because I trusted God was going to show me the way through that and he did.""","Ted Haggard's wife, Gayle, reveals why she stayed in wake of public scandal .

"(CNN)  -- Republicans' tough task of taking back control of the Senate next year now looks even tougher. Sen. Pete Domenici, R-New Mexico, says he will retire at the end of his term. Republican Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico announced Thursday that he will not seek re-election. ""For the past 35 years my friends and neighbors have given me the honor of allowing me to serve them as their United States senator,"" he said. ""Who could ask for anything more? Domenici joins three other Republican senators who also are retiring at the end of their terms next year. Democrats took back both houses of Congress last November, but hold thin majorities. In the Senate, they have a 51-49 margin. Their advantage in the House of Representatives is 233-202. Of 34 Senate seats being contested next year, Republicans hold 22. With the four senators retiring and four others facing difficult re-election bids, the numbers are stacked against GOP hopes of recapturing the upper chamber of Congress.   Read more about the senators who are retiring » . Domenici, a six-term senator, earlier had hinted he would run for re-election despite some criticism of his role in the controversial firings of U.S. attorneys. One of the prosecutors, David Iglesias, contends Domenici and U.S. Rep. Heather Wilson, R-New Mexico, wanted him to push harder on a corruption investigation of state Democrats before the 2006 midterm elections. Iglesias said he felt ""leaned on"" when Domenici called him to inquire about when indictments would be brought. The senator, who nominated Iglesias for the post, apologized for making the call but said he never pressured Iglesias. Domenici said he had complained to Justice Department officials about the pace of prosecutions in Iglesias' office. Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said Domenici had complained to him about Iglesias in the fall of 2005, saying the U.S. attorney ""was in over his head."" Iglesias, a Naval Reserve lawyer listed in a Justice Department evaluation as a ""diverse up-and-comer"" before 2006, was told to resign that December. Domenici, 75, was first elected to the Senate in 1972 and hasn't faced a tough re-election battle since then. But New Mexico's other senator, Jeff Bingaman, is a Democrat, as is Gov. Bill Richardson, who is running for president, and Democrats are likely to pour a lot of resources into trying to capture Domenici's seat. Republicans also face tough competition to hold onto the seats of retiring senators in Nebraska, Virginia and Colorado. In Nebraska, former Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns has told friends he will run for retiring Sen. Chuck Hagel's seat. Johanns is a former Nebraska governor, and Hagel said he has encouraged him to run. Nebraska Attorney General John Bruning had planned to run against Hagel and still could run against Johanns for the Republican nomination. Two other Republicans are also in the hunt for the open seat. Former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey also is considering running for Hagel's seat. President Bush handily carried Nebraska in his 2004 re-election, but an unpopular war and an unpopular president could give the Democrats hope next year. The state's other senator, Ben Nelson, is a Democrat. In Virginia, where longtime Republican Sen. John Warner is retiring, Democratic former Gov. Mark Warner, no relation to the senator, intends to run for the open seat. Mark Warner's term as governor ended in January 2006, and he left office with high favorable ratings. Democrats have won three major statewide elections there this decade. In 2006, Democrat Jim Webb ousted Republican Sen. George Allen by a margin of fewer than 10,000 votes, or less than half a percentage point. Webb's victory helped give Democrats their slim Senate majority. On the Republican side, there could be a bitter primary fight between Rep. Tom Davis, a moderate from northern Virginia, and conservative former Gov. Jim Gilmore, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this year. In Colorado, Sen. Wayne Allard announced this year that he's retiring after his term finishes, and Democrats made major gains there in the 2004 and 2006 elections. In addition to those races, tough re-election fights lie ahead for Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, John Sununu of New Hampshire, Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Gordon Smith of Oregon. As of now, only one Senate Democrat -- Mary Landrieu of Louisiana -- appears to face a challenge. The recent scandal involving Sen. Larry Craig's arrest in an airport restroom should not hurt the GOP's chances of holding on to his Senate seat in Idaho in 2008, even if the Republican does leave office. Democrats haven't won a Senate seat in Idaho in more than 30 years. Craig had said he would resign from the Senate if he could not get his guilty plea to a disorderly conduct charge withdrawn by September 30. But last week, Craig said he wouldn't resign until ""legal determinations"" are made. On Thursday, a judge denied Craig's request to withdraw his guilty plea. While the controversy over his arrest and guilty plea may not cost the GOP a Senate seat, it won't help his party either.

"Washington (CNN) -- A trio of congressional Republicans passionately appealed to the Pentagon on Thursday to drop charges against three Navy SEALs accused of assaulting an Iraqi suspected of orchestrating the 2004 killing and mutilation of four U.S. contractors. Flanked by about a dozen retired Navy SEALs at a news conference near the Capitol, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California; Rep. Dan Burton, R-Indiana; and Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, insisted that the U.S. is sending the wrong message to its troops. ""These Navy SEALs were apprehending a terrorist murderer, and they are being accused of roughing him up? Give me a break! These men should be given medals, not prosecuted. These men are heroes,"" Rohrabacher said. Burton agreed, saying, ""These people are laying their lives on the line every day, and they can't go into a combat situation with kid gloves on."" The congressmen said they plan to present to Pentagon officials petitions signed by thousands of people supporting the SEALs. The Iraqi suspect, Ahmed Hashim Abed, complained to investigators he was punched during his detention. One of the three SEALs, Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe, 24, accused of assault, stood next to his attorney at the event Thursday. McCabe did not speak. Gohmert said those who bring harm to Americans should not get the same judicial treatment as U.S. citizens. ""They get all their constitutional rights. Well, we've got heroes around who deserve the constitutional rights of an even better caliber. And yes, there are different levels of constitutional rights,"" he said. In January, a military judge ruled that the trials of the two other SEALs should be held on a base in Iraq. Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonathan Keefe, 25, and Petty Officer 1st Class Julio Huertas, 28, are charged with dereliction of duty and impeding an official investigation surrounding the Iraqi's detention last September. Their trials are set to begin next month. The case against the Navy SEALs has sparked outrage that the sailors are being tried at all for handling a suspect in the contractors' murders, one of the most notorious incidents in the Iraq war. The killings got widespread news coverage when the burned bodies of two of the contractors were paraded through the streets of Falluja and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered. ""In this case, we've turned logic upside down on its head,"" said Rohrabacher. ""Our government is taking the word of a terrorist and attacking our defenders.""","Three Navy SEALs accused of assaulting an Iraqi .

"(CNN) -- Former child actor Gary Coleman remained in a Utah jail Monday after being booked on an outstanding arrest warrant relating to a domestic violence case, authorities said. ""He's still our guest here,"" Utah County sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dennis Harris said Monday afternoon. Police visited Coleman's Santaquin City, Utah, home Sunday in response to a civil disturbance call, but no criminal charges were filed, a police spokeswoman said. A computer check, however, revealed a misdemeanor failure to appear in court warrant for the former ""Diff'rent Strokes"" star stemming from a domestic violence incident last year, the spokeswoman said. Coleman, 41, was arrested and booked without incident Sunday in the county jail in Spanish Fork, the spokesman said. Coleman could get out of jail by posting a $1,725 bail, but that has not happened, Harris said. Coleman's mug shot released by the jail showed that he was ""not too happy,"" Harris said. Police did not release details about the previous case related to the arrest warrant.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The star of the show did not appear -- and the film in question was not shown -- but Hillary Clinton's big-screen moment was all the talk Tuesday at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is tackling a First Amendment case involving a movie about Hillary Clinton. The justices heard arguments in a free-speech case over a 2008 documentary, shown in theaters, that was sharply critical of the onetime presidential candidate and current secretary of state. At issue was whether the 90-minute ""Hillary: The Movie"" and television ads to promote it should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or should have been seen as a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech. The high court's decision will determine whether politically charged documentaries can be regulated by the government in the same way as traditional campaign commercials. A ruling is expect by late June. A conservative group behind the movie wanted to promote it during the heat of the presidential primary season last year, but a federal court had blocked any ads, as well as airings on cable TV video-on-demand. The film later aired in several theaters and was released on DVD, outlets that were not subject to federal regulation. The Supreme Court justices appeared divided on how to find balance between Congress' expressed desire to control the power of well-financed private groups to spread their political messages and concerns over the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. ""This is targeted at a specific candidate for a specific office to be shown on a channel that says 'Election '08',"" said Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""Now if that isn't an appeal to voters, I can't imagine what is."" ""There's a possibility,"" said Justice Antonin Scalia, ""that the First Amendment interest is greater when what the government is trying to stifle is not just a speaker who wants to say something, but also a listener who wants to hear what the speaker has to say,"" noting that viewers would have paid to see the film on cable television. On its Web site, Citizens United promoted its film as featuring 40 interviews.as well as a ""cast to end all casts."" It promised, ""If you want to hear about the Clinton scandals of the past and present, you have it here! 'Hillary: The Movie' is the first and last word in what the Clintons want America to forget!"" The group, a Washington-based nonprofit corporation and advocacy organization, had balked at campaign finance rules that would have required them to disclose their financial backers and would have restricted when the film could air. The film was partially financed with corporate funds. A three-judge U.S. District Court panel last spring rejected the group's arguments that the documentary was more akin to news or information programs such as PBS' ""Nova"" or CBS' ""60 Minutes."" During Tuesday's oral arguments, the justices seemed uneasy about arguments from both sides. ""This sounds to me like campaign advocacy,"" said Justice David Souter. But attorney Theodore Olson, representing Citizens United, said the law ""smothered"" free speech. He said groups like General Electric (which owns NBC News), National Public Radio and progressive financier George Soros (who often privately funds his political projects) could air such films in the name of informing the American people, but not his clients because of the film's perceived negative tone. ""If it's all negative it can be prohibited, and it's a felony. Or if it's all favorable, you can go to jail. But if you did half and half, you couldn't"" be convicted, said Olson, criticizing the law's ""incomprehensible"" regulations. Several on the court wondered whether a 90-minute message was different than a 30-second commercial. ""It seems to me you can make the argument that 90 minutes is much more powerful in support or in opposition to a candidate,"" said Justice Anthony Kennedy. ""We have no choice, really, but to say this is not issue advocacy, this is express advocacy saying don't vote for this person,"" which is subject to regulation,"" Souter said. ""The difference between 90 minutes and one minute is a distinction that I just can't follow."" The comprehensive 2002 McCain-Feingold law bans broadcast of ""electioneering communication"" by corporations, unions and advocacy groups if it would be aired close to election dates and would identify candidates by name or image. The law also requires an on-screen notice of the groups financing such ads, as well as public disclosure of all donors to the sponsoring organizations. Lawyers representing the Federal Election Commission urged the justices to subject the ads to the disclosure law, arguing that without it, voters would be ""unable to know who's funding the ads."" Justice Department attorney Malcolm Stewart called it ""an easy case."" Some on the bench were not sure, probing the limits of the definition of candidate advocacy. ""So if Wal-Mart airs an advertisement that says we have candidate action figures for sale, come buy them, that counts as an electioneering communication,"" asked Chief Justice John Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito wondered about the differences between broadcast or cable TV, where the film could not be run, and the Internet or theaters where it could. When Stewart implied ""additional media"" could also be subject to future regulation, the newest justice replied, ""That's pretty incredible. You think that if a book was published, a campaign biography that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy, that could be banned?"" Most book publishers are corporations subject to campaign finance restrictions, he noted. Legal observers say Alito and Roberts' votes could be key to the case's outcome. At the time of the movie's premiere, Clinton was locked in a tough primary fight with then-Sen. Barack Obama for the Democratic nomination for president. Critics slammed her qualifications and character. People say, ""Well, she's flipping, she's flopping. No, she's not flipping and flopping, she's lying,"" Bay Buchanan, a political commentator and regular analyst for CNN, said in the film. ""We must never understate her chances of winning,"" warned Dick Morris, a former political adviser to President Clinton. ""And we must never forget the fundamental danger that this woman poses to every value that we hold dear. You see, I know her."" Ads for the movie were available on the Internet, which is not subject to federal regulation. ""I've seen this movie,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wryly noted, ""It's not a musical comedy."" David Bossie, head of Citizens United and producer of the ""Hillary"" film, was also behind several conservative documentaries, including a rebuttal to Michael Moore's anti-Bush film ""Fahrenheit 9/11."" The case is Citizens United v. FEC (08-205).","Supreme Court takes up First Amendment case involving Hillary Clinton movie .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actor Charlie Sheen checked into a rehab clinic ""as a preventive measure,"" his publicist said Tuesday. Sheen will ""take some time off"" from his acting job on the CBS series ""Two and a Half Men"" while he undergoes rehabilitation, publicist Stan Rosenfield said. In a joint statement, executives from CBS and Warner Bros. Television and ""Two and a Half Men"" creator/producer Chuck Lorre said they ""support Charlie Sheen in his decision today to begin voluntary in-patient care at a treatment center. We wish him nothing but the best as he deals with this personal matter. Production on 'Two and a Half Men' will be temporarily suspended."" Rosenfield's short statement did not say what issue Sheen needed to address with rehabilitation or the kind of facility he is entering. The announcement comes a day after a lawyer for Sheen's wife, Brooke Mueller, confirmed she had switched rehab facilities in her battle with substance abuse. There was no information given about who was caring for the couple's twin boys. Sheen, 44, and Mueller, 32, were involved in an alleged domestic dispute in Aspen, Colorado, on Christmas Day that resulted in a felony assault charge against Sheen. Mueller's lawyer said Monday that she pulled out of The Canyon, a Malibu, California, rehab center, over the weekend after a ""major breach of her privacy."" She immediately checked into ""a private, secure facility"" to continue her substance-abuse rehabilitation so she can be ""the best mother"" to her children, attorney Yale Galanter said. Galanter said he was planning a lawsuit against the rehab center after confidential details of Mueller's treatment there were given to journalists over the weekend. ""I am going to make them pay like you can't believe for screwing over my client,"" Galanter said. ""You can quote me on that."" A call to The Canyon by CNN was not immediately returned. Mueller voluntarily entered rehab in the wake of the Christmas Day incident with Sheen, Galanter said. Aspen police charged Sheen with felony second-degree assault, felony menacing and a misdemeanor charge of criminal mischief. He was booked under his birth name, Carlos Irwin Estevez. Sheen and Mueller married in 2008. Their twin sons -- Max and Bob -- will have their first birthday in March. Separately, a Los Angeles county social worker visited Sheen's home Sunday to check on his children, Sheen's publicist said. ""The visit from [the department of children and family services] was routine and procedural,"" Rosenfield said. Los Angeles County was asked by Pitkin County, Colorado, child protection officials to check on the family as part of a follow-up to Sheen's arrest in Aspen, Rosenfield said. Agency officials declined to confirm or comment on the visit because of privacy laws. CBS did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment. Sheen's history of trouble began in 1990 when he was dating actress Kelly Preston. Reports surfaced then that Preston had been shot in the arm. In 2001 Sheen told Playboy magazine that it was a ""complete accident. I wasn't even in the room. She picked up a pair of my pants. ... A little revolver fell out of my back pocket, hit the bathroom floor and went off. It shot a hole through the toilet and she got hit in the leg with shrapnel."" The couple split soon after the incident and Preston married actor John Travolta in 1991. In 1994 Sheen was the only celebrity client whose name was publicly released during the trial of ""Hollywood Madam"" Heidi Fleiss. In 1996, adult film actress Brittany Ashland accused Sheen of throwing her on the floor and splitting her lip. Sheen pleaded no contest to battery charges and was fined $2,800. He entered rehab in 1998 after an alleged drug overdose. During the course of his divorce from model-turned-actress Denise Richards in 2006, Richards filed a restraining order against Sheen, saying he tried to kill her. Sheen released a statement at the time saying: ""Obviously, what has taken place is vile, is unconscionable, is without merit, is a transparent and immature smear campaign. She's claiming certain things. It's baseless."" CNN's Alan Duke, Brittany Kaplan, Marc Balinsky and journalist Jo Piazza contributed to this report.","Publicist does not say what Sheen is being treated for or the kind of facility he is entering .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In patches across the Haitian capital, many earthquake survivors are not waiting for an international clearing and rebuilding effort to begin. They are pulling out shovels, wood and cement to slowly repair and rebuild themselves. ""This is what we have to do now,"" Jean-Fritznel St. Claire said as he hammered away at huge, fallen slabs of a Digicel office building, breaking them into chunks to be shoveled into a truck and taken away. Digicel is a telecommunications company. St. Claire and three friends working with him at Digicel expected the company to pay them for their hard labor, but the group insists that they and others who stayed in the earthquake zone are eager to start clearing rubble and building what they can. ""The people who left [Port-au-Prince] have no hope,"" he said, his face dripping with sweat. ""We have hope. So we're here."" Elsewhere in Port-au-Prince, businesses and families repaired cinderblock walls and pounded new beams into fractured roofs. One work crew near the airport replaced several broken sewer pipes that were part of a system set up for their neighborhood. But this individual rebuilding alarms teams of engineers studying the damage in Haiti after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake January 12. ""It worries me,"" said Reginald Desroches, a Haitian-American engineer from Georgia Tech who is part of a volunteer assessment team working with the United Nations' mission in Haiti. Desroches and his crew say many Haitians are using broken pieces of buildings as construction material, including the metal rebar, or reinforcement bars, that critically strengthen concrete but now lie twisted and bent in the rubble. That makes the bars weak and potentially unsafe. But Haitians are turning to what's available -- even though the materials might be deemed unsafe -- to rebuild structures that ultimately may be declared unsound. ""This is a problem,"" fellow engineer Jean-Philippe Simon said. ""These things can just collapse all over again."" Indeed, the Digicel building where St. Claire is working contains massive cracks, is missing a two-story wall and leans over the area he's cleaning up. Asked if he's worried that the place could collapse, undermining his backbreaking work, St. Claire responds, ""We can't control that. That is up to God.""","Jean-Fritznel St. Claire and 3 friends clean up rubble of office building, load it into trucks .

"(Budget Travel) -- Last October, more than 40 people followed signs depicting a skull and crossbones, with a knife and fork in place of the bones, to a secluded Bavarian-style hunting lodge 30 minutes north of St. Louis. An Entre dinner party was hosted in a Missouri hunting lodge. The attendees didn't have any idea where they were headed or what to expect. All they knew was that they were in for a five-course meal courtesy of John-Jack, an undercover chef who'd invited each of them via a top-secret e-mail to the latest of what he calls his Entre dinner parties. Guests arrived to a bluegrass band jamming in a room decorated with deer antlers. As a fire crackled in the massive stone fireplace, they dined on wild-elk medallions, home-cured bacon, grapefruit confit, and butternut squash ice cream -- and toasted their good fortune with pumpkin ale from nearby microbrewery Schlafly. Welcome to the world of underground supper clubs. Getting a reservation requires a little detective work, but once in, you may never go back to eating out the old-school way again. The idea behind these dinners is to let talented chefs work their whisks in an affordable, relaxed setting. And since they're often operating out of their own kitchens, without a license to serve the public, these cooks have to keep the locales, and their own identities, under wraps. Budget Travel:  The utterly random dinner party . ""The trend started in food-centric cities like San Francisco, but in the last year, groups have been popping up across the country,"" says Jenn Garbee, author of ""Secret Suppers,"" which spotlights some of the more than 80 clubs now up and running in the U.S. One such is Guerrilla Cuisine, founded by an incognito cook in Charleston, South Carolina, who uses the alias Jimihatt and wears a ninja mask at his gatherings. As at many clubs, diners must submit their reservations weeks in advance on Jimihatt's Web site and then wait for an e-mail with directions to the hush-hush locale. Based on his track record, you won't be disappointed: The bearded Jimihatt and his rotating crew of sous-chefs have served secret, Southern-style suppers (andouille sausage gumbo, Cajun smoked chicken, chocolate beignets) in galleries, wineries, even a grocery store. Budget Travel: Haute diners . Jimihatt now has a little friendly competition from an Atlanta cook named Lady Rogue. Her RogueApron shindigs each have a different theme. At a recent event, a Great Depression-style repast in Lang-Carson Park, guests stood in a soup line for pancetta minestrone with porcini mushrooms, and lemongrass-spiked corn broth. Then they divided into teams for an impromptu game of Wiffle ball. ""Our goal,"" Lady Rogue says, ""is to make dining more inclusive and to have strangers connect over food. What better way to meet people?"" For those hoping to break bread with their own buddies, there's 12B in Vancouver. To keep operations simple, its mastermind, Chef Todd, hosts the six-course dinners in his own apartment, hence the name. And unlike most supper clubs, 12B cooks only for groups of friends (up to 12 at a time). Budget Travel: Pay-what-you-like restaurants . ""Even after working 16-hour days, I would sit at home and think, 'I've got to find a way to feed more people,'"" Chef Todd says. Money isn't the incentive. His minimum-donation fee of $50 just covers costs for a feast (stuffed artichoke hearts, five-mushroom ravioli, butter-poached scallops served with BBQ pulled pork) that would average twice as much in a restaurant. But as Chef Todd will attest, these clubs are less about saving and more about spending a night eating exceptionally well in the unlikeliest of places, whether a cozy lodge straight out of a fairy tale or a humble living room.

"New York (CNN) -- Decades ago, when the Department of Defense was creating the predecessor to today's Internet, one of the main goals was to create a communications system that could endure catastrophic disasters. The Internet was designed to have no central point of failure, allowing anyone to run his or her own communications channel. This was a system that could withstand a nuclear attack. Today, the services built on top of that network have done a great job in enabling communications, perhaps none more dramatically than Twitter. During the days since the Haiti earthquake, the popular social networking and microblogging service has been used for rescue efforts and for fundraising to help stabilize and rebuild the country. So it was big news when Twitter was offline for 90 minutes  Wednesday morning. Technology pundits promptly began hand-wringing -- the weaknesses of having a single point of failure to critical communications had been revealed again! Could we trust Twitter? Did this mean the Web couldn't help us fulfill our most basic obligations to those in need? Not at all. There's no reason that organizations or individuals who want to use the Web to relay critical information have to rely on Twitter or Facebook or Google or any other giant of the technology industry in the first place. We've just forgotten a bit about how the Internet was supposed to work. Rescue organizations and charities should simply be able to use the Web sites they already have to deliver those messages. And wasn't that the promise of the Web in the first place? Weren't we going to stop relying on individual companies as gatekeepers for communication? When blogs took off a few years ago, wasn't it with the promise that we'd all be able to share our voices without having to ask any company for permission? Why did we give that up? Maybe it's because they made it look so easy. Twitter has done an impressive job of growing to handle its enormous number of users, while keeping its service simple. The company has even shown a reassuring sensitivity to the civic and social obligations that come from running such a popular communication service. Companies such as Facebook and Google have stepped up, too. Their hearts appear to be in the right place, and they're doing real work to help people communicate. But the Web is bigger than any one site or any one social network. In my own work, I run a nonprofit that strives to connect government policymakers to the expertise of ordinary people using the Web. We'll naturally make great use of Twitter and Facebook and all the other services, but it'd be unforgivable to pick only one of them as a platform for civic engagement. Telling people the only way to talk to the White House is on Facebook is like saying you can only call your senator by using a particular phone company. And that's the key lesson to learn from Twitter being down while people are depending on it for communication: Some needs are too important to put in the hands of any single company. Communicating in real time about emergency information is clearly one of them. Fortunately there's good news. Smart inventors have already made cutting-edge technologies that let any site deliver messages with the same immediacy as Twitter or Facebook. Now the challenge is reminding all of the social institutions, media organizations and government agencies that they need to use their own communications infrastructure just as much as they participate in services such as Twitter and Facebook. The reality is social networks come and go. Ten years ago, otherwise-sensible companies were paying millions of dollars to America Online to buy ""AOL keywords."" These were shortcuts to parts of the AOL service, which dominated U.S. Internet access at the time. In fact, many of us have allowed companies to become intermediaries to all our communications, whether it was AOL 10 years ago or Facebook today. But we don't need to ask gateways for permission to publish. We can run our own Web sites, at our own Web addresses and keep control over how we communicate. Think how ludicrous it would seem for someone to decide, say, to offer emergency services as an AOL keyword called ""911"" instead of having people just dial their phones? That sounds absurd, but you can see advertisements today that essentially say ""Find us on Facebook at facebook.com/AcmeWidgets!"" Now, Facebook probably won't fade away entirely, like early networks such as Friendster. But those Facebook addresses are just like AOL keywords 10 years earlier. And it is conceivable that the organizations and companies who communicate on Facebook today may want to become more independent. Whether due to emergency or just the everyday requirements of doing business, they ultimately will stop depending on a single point of contact for their communications. This is, after all, how the Web was designed to work. We already see governments and civic organizations using the Web as effectively as the best corporations and media. In the United States, we have a White House that's got an iPhone application and a State Department that's asking us to define democracy by responding on Twitter. Judging by how much technology has affected society already, those first experiments will soon evolve into full-fledged platforms for citizen participation and charitable action. And let's hope they won't have to worry if any one Web site goes down. Because we'll have a web of independent but connected communications systems, just as the Internet was always designed to be. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Anil Dash.","Anil Dash says Internet was designed to endure disasters, free up communication .
Dash: If Web's goal is decentralization, why was Twitter crash so disabling for many?
Dash reminds us that social networks come and go; remember when AOL ruled?
Web users should take charge of their own communication efforts, Dash urges ."
"(CNN) -- Newburgh, New York, was a main military headquarters for George Washington during the American Revolution. More recently, authorities say, it was the birthplace of a foiled terrorist plot. If Mayor Nick Valentine gets his way, the town of 30,000 will host the terror trial of accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged accomplices. ""We've got nothing to lose,"" said Valentine, who also runs a tailor shop. About 60 miles up the Hudson River from New York City, Newburgh struggles with poverty, unemployment and crime. In 2004, the town was dubbed the third worst metropolitan area in the country. ""Sometimes, we're the top five in crime, which is not a very good recognition,"" said Valentine, a lifelong resident. ""We struggle with everything."" That's why, he said, the trial would be a boon for his town. The influx of security personnel would chase the bad people out; journalists and lawyers in town for the trial would provide a much-needed economic boost. ""People have said: If you have a trial, bad guys will come. My comment back to them: We've got bad guys right now,"" the mayor said. ""If I had a police presence here for an extended period of time, this place would be a safer place. And in the end ... the city of Newburgh would be up a couple notches than where it was before."" The White House has said it is considering changing the current plan to hold the 9/11 trial in lower Manhattan after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other officials expressed concerns about security, costs and disruption to the city. Four alternative locations around New York have been discussed: Governors Island, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, a prison complex in Otisville and Newburgh. Three of the sites, including Newburgh, fall within Orange County, which lost 44 residents in the 9/11 attacks. The top county official is doing everything he can to make sure the trial stays out. ""I don't want to be known as the terrorist capital of the world,"" said Orange County Executive Edward Diana. ""I don't want them here. Nobody wants them here."" This is one battle, he said, ""I will fight tooth and nail."" ""If I have to shut down roads, if I have to sue the federal government, I will do just that. ... That's my stance, and I will never back off from there."" Several senators on Tuesday lined up against a civilian 9/11 trial, saying that they would try to cut off funding for it and that it should take place in a military court. Mayor Valentine said he would allow the trial in his town only if Newburgh received the estimated $200 million needed for security. ""If it's going to cost us money, then forget it,"" he said. He also agrees with many lawmakers -- that the accused terrorists don't ""deserve a trial like any other citizen in the United States."" ""But if the president of the United States wants a trial, let me put together a jury of peers from the Hudson Valley area,"" he said. The town recently built a $22 million courthouse, mandated by the state, and is struggling to pay its bills as a result, Valentine said. The federal funds would help get the town out of a mountain of debt. Ever since he's spoken up for Newburgh, he said, people have been abuzz in his tailor shop. ""Customers have come in saying, 'You give it your best shot.' "" He added, ""I've had a couple of negative, but very, very few."" The town has a diverse population -- 36 percent Latino, 34 percent African-American and 28 percent white -- with a median household income of roughly $30,000. The town is the home of the 105th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard. Within its four square miles, there are 70 places of worship, including two synagogues and one mosque, the mayor said. A tree planting last May honored a Muslim U.S. soldier from Newburgh who was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. The soldier, 1st Lt. Mohsin Naqvi, had signed up with the Army Reserve just four days after 9/11. ""We're a proud city,"" the mayor said. Last June, four men, dubbed the Newburgh Four, were indicted in what prosecutors said was a plot to bomb two New York City synagogues and fire surface-to-air missiles at U.S. military planes. The mayor lauded his law enforcement for its participation in that federal probe. ""We have challenges. We have risen up to challenges in the past. We're very formidable,"" he said. Now, he hopes the town ""where George Washington refused the crown"" will have a new place in history: the town that sentences the 9/11 mastermind to death.","Newburgh, New York, is being considered as a potential site for 9/11 trial .

"(CNN) -- The University of California San Diego has suspended a student who admitted to hanging a noose in a campus library, school officials announced Friday.

The student's admission came the day after police were alerted to the presence of the noose in a library bookcase at the school.

They include the establishment of a task force on minority faculty recruitment, a new commission to addressing declining African-American enrollment and finding space for an African-American resource center. ""I want to emphasize these are the initial steps, and I realize we have a lot of work ahead of us,"" Fox said.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- In the best of times, the Champs de Mars square in downtown Port-au-Prince was an awe-inspiring sight for Haitians. The broad boulevard was home to the majestic presidential palace, the seat of the country's power and prestige. Not anymore. The century-old gleaming white palace is in ruins. And in the shadow of its wrought-iron gates, the immaculately maintained plaza has been overtaken by row upon haphazard row of makeshift shacks as far as the eye dwells. These are the new homes of the capital's displaced residents: rickety quarters comprised of bed sheets, propped up on sticks and held together with ropes. Nearly 500,000 Haitians have moved here, rendered homeless by a 7.0-magnitude earthquake that devastated the impoverished island-nation a week ago. Throughout the capital, and in other affected areas of the country, similar tent cites have risen -- cramped, squalid encampments filled with the few belongings that residents have salvaged. As rescue and recovery efforts continue, these mini-cities pose Haiti's next challenge. ""This is the biggest one,"" National Police Chief Mario Andresol said on Monday. ""We have new area to protect and new people to protect. It's another kind of security we have to ensure. This is the toughest one."" Full coverage | Twitter updates . It will be an overwhelming task. The Port-au-Prince police force of 4,000 has plunged to about 1,500 -- the rest of the officers dead, wounded or missing, Andresol said. Complicating matters, about 4,000 convicted criminals are on the loose. The capital's 95-year-old, badly overcrowded National Penitentiary collapsed after the quake, and the inmates escaped. ""We have an emergency now,"" Andresol said. ""Because, probably next week, we will have more confusion on the street. The bad guys will be organizing themselves, and they can be the most principal threat to the police and the population."" Police presence at these new neighborhoods is sporadic. With electricity lines down throughout the city, residents bunch up their meager belongings into pillows and sleep on them after dark. iReport: Looking for loved ones . ""You put something down, and they steal it,"" said one resident, who identified himself as Ruben. ""You know, there's no jail in the country. All the prisoners go out. You don't know the good people or bad people. That's why you have to be careful."" In some camps, residents have far worse fears. ""By night, with not enough electricity, some people try to rape and steal and kill people also,"" Andresol said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday that he would ask for an additional 2,000 U.N. troops and 1,500 U.N. police officers to bolster the 3,000 U.N. police and soldiers currently deployed in Port-au-Prince. Haiti police ill-equipped to handle crisis . But security is just one of the many immediate needs that tent-dwellers are praying for. They await food and medical help. In one tent, an 8-year-old boy suffers a seizure as family members look on helplessly. In another, a little girl cries in pain, her leg wound oozing. iReport: I'm alive -- message from Haiti . ""The people of Haiti need help. Quickly! Quickly. We need help!"" a woman screams, tears streaking her face. In another part of the square, an old man sits quietly, thumbing a Bible. ""My situation (is) very bad, very bad,"" he says. ""God only know that. God can help me. God can do everything for me."" For many residents, there is little else to do but pray -- and wait. The men mill about aimlessly, wondering when help will arrive. Teenagers rush off when they hear that water and food are available somewhere. Most of the time, they return empty-handed. Gallery: Devastation in Haiti . With little else to play with, children kick up dirt and squeal in delight. Their mothers squat by portable stoves, fanning the fire with pieces of cardboard. All around, trash piles up. The stench is unbearable, worsening by the hour under the hot sun. When night falls, the residents gather by flickering candlelight and sing spirituals to keep their spirits up. Occasionally, gunshots ring in the distance. Eventually, they drift off to sleep on tattered mattresses and cardboard boxes. Tomorrow, they hope, will bring a better day.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A blast hit near a building housing Pakistan's intelligence service, ISI, in the eastern city of Multan on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people and wounding 20 others, police said. The explosion took place at a security checkpoint, said Jamshed Akram of the city police. Four soldiers and four children were among the dead, said Dr. Kaleem Ullah of Multan's emergency services. Pakistan has blamed the violence on Islamic militants who have vowed to avenge a intense military offensive to rout them from their haven along the country's border with Afghanistan. The nation has come under increasingly frequent attacks. On Monday, a blast at a crowded market in Lahore killed 54 and wounded more than 150 people. The same day two other bombing attacks -- in Peshawar and Quetta -- killed at least 11 and wounded at least 41. The attacks came three days after militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel. At least 36 were killed and 75 wounded. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, but there were no immediately claims for Monday's attacks. In an e-mail to CNN about the mosque attack, the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan said: ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it, and will do more which are already planned. We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces."" The United States has pressed Pakistan to rout out Taliban militants. Fighting the war in Afghanistan is ""inextricably linked to our partnership with Pakistan,"" President Barack Obama said Tuesday of U.S. strategy. ""We are in Afghanistan to prevent a cancer from once again spreading through that country,"" he said in a speech at West Point. ""But this same cancer has also taken root in the border region of Pakistan. That is why we need a strategy that works on both sides of the border."" The United States says Pakistan looms large because Taliban and al Qaeda militants operating in Afghanistan also have had a presence in Pakistan's northwestern region near the Afghan border and have threatened the governments and troops in both countries.","NEW: Four soldiers, four children among the dead, a doctor says .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The venerable Smithsonian Institution, often dubbed ""America's Attic,"" said no Tuesday to adding a piece of 1990s history to its collections. A day earlier, a California judge approved an agreement to donate the brownish-green suit O.J. Simpson wore the day in 1995 that he was acquitted of murder -- if museum officials wanted it. But they didn't. ""The curators feel that it doesn't fit with the collections here at the National Museum of American History,"" Valeska Hilbig, spokeswoman for the museum, told CNN Radio Tuesday. The museum houses iconic memorabilia, such as a pair of Judy Garland's ruby slippers from ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the hat Abraham Lincoln wore the night he was assassinated and a piece of a lunch counter from a Woolworth's in Greensboro, North Carolina, that was the site of a civil rights sit-in. The museum on the National Mall in Washington is also home of the original ""Star Spangled Banner,"" which inspired poet Francis Scott Key to pen the lyrics to what would become the national anthem. The agreement to donate the suit ended a years-long battled between Fred Goldman, the father of the man the ex-National Football League star was accused of killing, and Simpson's former sports agent, Mike Gilbert, who has possession of the suit. But no one checked with the Smithsonian before making the announcement. Hilbig said there was no official offer to donate the suit and that officials learned of the potential deal on the Internet. With the Smithsonian's rejection, the parties will look for another museum to take the suit, per the Los Angeles County Superior Court order on Monday. ""I suggested to go back to USC (the University of Southern California, where Simpson starred in college football), even though they've distanced themselves, or maybe the Pro Football Hall of Fame museum,"" said Simpson's attorney, Ronald Slates, who said he was disappointed in the Smithsonian's decision. ""We had worked six hours on Monday to reach the settlement, and to find the finest museum in America turning down what is truly a piece of highly controversial litigation in the United States -- it was very disappointing,"" he said. ""Of all the museums in the United States, this would be the one most open because it is our national museum,"" he said. ""It deals with the ups and downs of America. You don't see the Smithsonian walking away from days of the Depression -- which were certainly horrible days in our history -- because it was so horrible. So, I thought this would be the museum to house this, even as controversial as it is."" Simpson stood trial on charges of stabbing to death his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Fred Goldman's son, Ronald, outside her luxury townhouse in Brentwood on June 12, 1994. The  trial lasted more than nine months and ended on October 3, 1995, with a jury finding Simpson not guilty. Later, the families of Brown and  Goldman took Simpson to civil court to seek damages for wrongful death. That jury found Simpson liable for the deaths and awarded $8.5 million in compensatory damages to the Goldman family and to Ron Goldman's biological mother. Since then, Fred Goldman has been trying to collect the money. Simpson has consistently said he did not kill the two and should not have to pay. In 2008, Gilbert appeared on the ""Dr. Phil"" television show, claiming he had the suit and pants Simpson wore on the day of the acquittal. He also said the ""acquittal suit"" -- as it came to be known -- was worth $50,000. Monday's decision, said Goldman, ""takes any option out of the killer's hands or Gilbert's hands to sell it and make money on it."" Meanwhile, Simpson, 62, is serving a nine-year sentence in Nevada after his conviction on robbery and kidnapping charges in an unrelated case. The case involved a botched attempt in September 2007 by  Simpson to retrieve items that he said had been stolen from him by memorabilia dealers.

"Washington (CNN) -- No decision has been made on whether to change the current plan to hold the September 11 terrorist attack trial in a civilian court in lower Manhattan, White House officials said Sunday. Last week, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other politicians expressed concern over the costs and disruption of holding the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four accomplices at a New York City courthouse. David Axelrod, the senior adviser to President Obama, and White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Sunday that Obama believes the trial should take place in a criminal court instead of before a military commission, as permitted for some terrorism suspects. However, Axelrod and Gibbs acknowledged that Obama and the Justice Department were considering moving the trial from New York City. ""We've made no decisions on that yet,"" Axelrod said on the NBC program ""Meet the Press."" Gibbs, speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" also said the location of the trial was under discussion, but he expressed certainty that Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11, 2001, attacks, ""is going to meet justice and he's going to meet his maker."" Gibbs and Axelrod criticized Republican opposition to the plan to hold the trial in a criminal court, saying no one complained when the previous administration of Republican President George W. Bush put terrorism suspects such as ""shoe bomber"" Richard Reid on trial in U.S. criminal courts. ""Now we have a Democratic president and suddenly we hear these protests,"" Axelrod said. ""What has changed between now and then that would cause people to reverse positions?"" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told the CNN program that the Bush administration was wrong to hold terrorism trials on U.S. soil. Instead, trials for dangerous terrorism suspects should be held by military commissions at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility where they currently are held, McConnell said. Obama intends to shut down the Guantanamo facility by transferring the roughly 200 suspects to the United States to stand trial or face indefinite detention, or to third countries. McConnell said Sunday he would fight that plan by trying to withhold federal spending for it. ""'I think that will be done on a bipartisan basis,"" McConnell said of congressional opposition, adding that ""whatever domestic support they had for this is totally collapsing."" White House officials say the decision about any possible alternate sites to try Mohammed and the others will come from the Justice Department. New York police estimated that the cost to the city would be more than $200 million per year in what could be a multi-year trial and that more than 2,000 checkpoints would need to be installed around Lower Manhattan. Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said additional protection would have to be deployed for the city, not just ""the core area of Manhattan."" Bloomberg initially supported the move, saying ""it is fitting that 9/11 suspects face justice near the World Trade Center site where so many New Yorkers were murdered."" However, Bloomberg used different rhetoric last week when asked about a community agency's proposals to relocate the trial, saying he would prefer the trial be held elsewhere, perhaps at a military base where it would be easier and cheaper to provide security. ""It's going to cost an awful lot of money and disturb a lot of people,"" Bloomberg said. On Thursday, several New York Democratic politicians urged the Obama administration to thoroughly re-examine locating the trial in downtown Manhattan. Julie Menin, chairwoman of a city community advisory agency, proposed four alternative locations for the trial within the Southern District of New York: Governors Island, Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the Bureau of Prisons jail complex at FCI Otisville. The latter three are in Orange County, New York, less than an hour from New York City, county executive Edward Diana told CNN. Diana thinks the trials should not be held anywhere in New York, and definitely not in Orange County, which lost 44 residents in the terror attacks, he said. ""I've contacted my legal department and I'll tell you I'll do whatever it takes to stop those trials from coming here, even if it means closing down our roads,"" Diana said. ""I'll sue the federal government if need be."" Diana said he'd be worried about the safety of Orange County residents if the trial comes there. Diana, who shot down an offer from Newburgh to host the proceedings in their new courthouse, said the suspects should not be tried in civilian courts. But Newburgh Mayor Nick Valentine said the boost in media presence and police funding during the trial would help his ""very poor, very urban"" city. Newburgh's new $22 million courthouse is safe and has ""every security you could want,"" Valentine said. An alternate proposal at the West Point location has not been fully reviewed. A West Point spokesman said no one has officially requested a review of demands for such a trial, which would require in-depth study of legal and security concerns. U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Dean Boyd said the Justice Department ""can safely prosecute this case in the Southern District of New York while minimizing disruptions to the community to the greatest extent possible, consistent with security needs."" New York Gov. David Paterson will meet with the U.S. Marshal Service on Monday to discuss possible 9/11 trial locations in the state, Paterson spokeswoman Marissa Shorenstein told CNN.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- The scene was horrific, the stench unmistakable. Sadly, it was nothing new here. But because it unfolded so many days after the earthquake that took at least 112,000 lives, it was shocking. Three bodies trapped in a crushed taxi. A man, two women. Set ablaze. Even for those who have witnessed so much these past 13 days, the torching of the Toyota in the capital's central plaza Monday was difficult to take in. It highlighted one of Haiti's many quandaries: how to dispose of bodies. The taxi had been smashed by collapsing concrete during the devastating earthquake, and the bodies were decomposing in tropical temperatures, the smell unbearable to the thousands who have temporarily sought shelter under tarpaulins and tents across the street at the Champs de Mars plaza. The foul smell prompted people to dig the car out of the rubble, but those living on the street in the area said disposal trucks never arrived to take the bodies away. ""They couldn't find anyone to dispose of the bodies so they had to burn them,"" said Gidel Fellmon. In the days after the January 12 quake, Haitians and rescue and relief crews have struggled to find proper disposal methods for bodies. Thousands of corpses have been pulled from the rubble and burned. Bodies have been bulldozed and dumped into open pits. Find loved ones in Haiti | Full coverage . At one of the capital city's cemeteries, people opened up old crypts and shoved corpses into them before resealing them. Workers loaded bodies -- piled on the sides of roads -- into the basket of a front-loader tractor, which then deposited them into blood-stained dump trucks, according to CNN correspondents. On Monday, as the taxi burned, people stood stoically around the charred flesh and exposed bones. Two pairs of shoes lay in the car's twisted metal.

"(CNN) -- President Obama took his renewed jobs push beyond the Washington beltway again Tuesday, heading to the politically critical state of New Hampshire for a town hall meeting. The president used the event to spotlight his call for a $30 billion investment in a new small-business lending fund. Obama's initiative would recycle $30 billion of the remaining Troubled Asset Relief Program funds into a government lending program offering cheap capital to community banks that boost their small-business lending this year. This measure will help ensure ""small businesses are once again the engine of job growth in America,"" Obama said in the city of Nashua. It's ""absolutely critical that Congress acts"" to help pass this and other job creation legislation. While credit conditions for large businesses have improved over the past year, small companies are still widely reporting problems finding the capital they need to fund their operations. Since small businesses employ about half of American workers, policymakers worry that the ongoing credit crunch they face is contributing to the nation's high rate of job losses. Under Obama's plan, banks with assets of less than $10 billion would be able to borrow money from the Treasury at a dividend rate as low as 1 percent if they use the cash to make more small-business loans this year than they did in 2009. Obama's visit to New Hampshire, several political analysts said, was part of the White House's ongoing effort to recapture sorely needed political momentum. The state, which is home to the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, is considered in many ways to be a political bellwether for an administration struggling to maintain the support of independent voters. More than 40 percent of the state's voters were registered as independents as of last November, according to the New Hampshire secretary of state's office. Obama easily carried the state in the 2008 general election, but a slight plurality of New Hampshire voters disapproved of his job performance in a December 2009 American Research Group survey. Tuesday's trip was Obama's second visit to New Hampshire since becoming president. While the town hall participants gave his small-business proposal a warm reception, they also raised questions about a series of other issues, including education, energy independence, government transparency and health care reform. ""We're in the red zone. We've got to punch it through,"" Obama said about the stalled health care legislation. ""I do not quit. We are going to get that done."" Obama said supporters of the legislation ""have to move methodically and [ensure] the American people understand exactly what's in the bill."" Efforts to pass a comprehensive reform bill have been frozen since Massachusetts GOP Sen.-elect Scott Brown won the seat previously held by Ted Kennedy, who died last August. Brown's victory stripped Democrats of their 60-seat Senate supermajority and gave Republicans enough votes to block most bills. CNN's Catherine Clifford and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.","NEW: Town hall participants give warm reception to small-business lending fund plan .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's proposed spending freeze could help him recapture the favor of centrist voters, but critics blast the move as nothing more than political posturing. The president is expected to call for a partial, three-year freeze on discretionary spending in his State of the Union address Wednesday, according to two senior administration officials. The cuts, which Obama will say would save $250 billion, would not apply to national security spending and would not affect major entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. The proposal comes as the president's poll numbers dip and concerns about the economy and the federal deficit flare. It also comes after a shocking election loss for Democrats in Massachusetts, which many have interpreted as an expression of voter frustration with the way Washington is handling the economy. ""I applaud [Obama] for attempting to have some fiscal restraint,"" Republican strategist Ed Rollins said. ""But at the end of the day, he's got to make sure the Democrats are disciplined and they don't have big spending programs alongside of this."" Under Obama's plan, all federal discretionary spending would be frozen at its current level of $447 billion per year. Individual federal agencies would have the power to give some programs increases, while cutting money elsewhere. Both chambers of Congress would have to approve the freeze when they take up the president's budget for fiscal year 2011, which starts in October. Obama will send his budget plan to Congress after the State of the Union. Jeffrey Sachs, an economist and director of The Earth Institute at Columbia University, said Obama's move doesn't make much sense, following a year of unprecedented government spending and a $787 billion stimulus package. ""A little bit of disarray, it seems. Last year, just spend, throw everything into a stimulus package ... and then this year, just across-the-board freeze. Frankly, the government has to make better choices and better plans than throwing things into a big pot in one year and then freezing across the board the next year,"" he said. Obama dismissed the idea of an across-the-board spending freeze during a presidential debate in October 2008. ""It sounds good. It's proposed periodically. It doesn't happen,"" then-candidate Obama said. ""In fact, an across-the-board spending freeze is a hatchet, and we do need a scalpel because there are some programs that don't work at all. There are some that are underfunded. I want to make sure we're focused on the programs that work."" Republican reaction to Obama's proposal was split, with some senior GOP aides saying it is something they could support, and others saying it did not go nearly far enough. ""Given Washington Democrats' unprecedented spending binge, this is like announcing you're going on a diet after winning a pie-eating contest,"" said Michael Steel, a spokesman for House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio. ""Will the budget still double the debt over five years and triple it over 10? That's the bottom line."" The senior administration officials acknowledged that discretionary spending is only about one-sixth of the entire federal budget, but said the White House believes that cuts need to start somewhere. The move is Obama's latest step down a path to a more populist message, aimed at reassuring Americans nervous about the slow pace of the economic recovery. The president on Monday proposed nearly doubling the child care tax credit for middle-class families. Obama is expected to talk about efforts to create more jobs and spur the economy in his speech Wednesday. iReport: Deliver your State of the Union address . The White House has put a greater emphasis on the economy in the days since Democrats lost their 60-seat supermajority in the Senate. Republican Scott Brown defeated Democrat Martha Coakley in a special election last week to serve the remainder of the late Ted Kennedy's Senate term. Brown capitalized on voter frustrations and captured the independent vote in Massachusetts, a Democratic stronghold. ""I think that is a wake-up call for everybody in this town,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said a day after the election. Obama's proposal will likely set the stage for a fight with some liberals, but polls suggest it might not be a bad thing for the president to occasionally break ranks. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Monday indicates that seven in 10 Americans think that the Democrats' loss of their 60-seat supermajority in the Senate is a positive step for the country. Observers note it will also put Republicans in a position where they can show if they are willing to meet the president halfway. Democratic strategist James Carville said Tuesday that Obama needs to take control of the narrative in order to get back on track. ""Until this administration stands up and says 'This is what we will face, and this is what we did, and this is our strategy' -- these things are going to continue to happen,"" he said.

"(CNN)  -- Peruvian President Alan Garcia left Singapore on the eve of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit after reports surfaced that an air force officer was accused of spying for the Chilean government, Peru's foreign minister said Saturday. ""We do consider, from the information that have received, that we need an explanation and sanctions to those involved,"" Foreign Minister Jose Antonio García Belaunde told CNN en Espanol Saturday. He added that he does ""not have all the elements of the story here in Singapore,"" but confirmed that the suspect is ""under arrest and in the hands of the judicial power in Peru."" Garcia and his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet had planned to attend a workshop Saturday with other world leaders, but the Peruvian leader canceled his agenda to return to Lima. However, there were no plans for a bilateral meeting between leaders from both countries, Belaunde said, dismissing reports that there had been such a session scheduled for Sunday. Belaunde said he has spoken to Chilean Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez Amunategui about the case, but that his counterpart would not have information until he returns to Santiago. Meanwhile, a Chilean spokeswoman dismissed the espionage allegations. ""Chile does not spy,"" Carolina Toha, spokeswoman for Chile's Interior Ministry. ""Chile takes international relations as a serious matter."" APEC's 21 member nations -- ranging from Thailand to United States, Chile to China -- represent more than half of the world's economic output. The forum sees its goal as ""facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region."" Chile and Peru have a history of animosity, having fought in the War of the Pacific from 1879 to 1883. Hard feelings linger to this day. The two nations nearly came to war in 1975 when left-wing Peruvian leader Juan Velasco, who was backed by Cuba, wanted to invade Chile, which was led by right-wing Gen. Augusto Pinochet. The invasion was called off and Velasco was deposed in a coup a short while later. Tensions rose again when Peru discovered a Chilean spy mission, but war was averted. More recently, tensions between the two South American nations flared in December after the revelation that Peru's top army general said at a party that Chileans in neighboring Peru would be sent back in coffins or body bags. At the time, Peruvian Defense Minister Antero Flores-Araoz said relations between the two nations will be repaired, calling the incident involving Peruvian Gen. Edwin Donayre ""a bump in the road."" Bachelet had made similar assertions. Also last year, the World Court agreed to look at an issue concerning Peruvian claims to a disputed maritime area.","President Alan Garcia left Singapore on the eve of the APEC summit .

"(CNN) -- A Florida woman has been arrested in connection with the death of a lottery millionaire, whose body was found buried under recently added concrete at a home, authorities said. Dorice Donegan Moore, 37, was arrested Tuesday evening on charges of accessory after the fact regarding a first-degree murder in the death of Abraham Shakespeare, 43, said Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee. Moore befriended Shakespeare after he won a $31 million Florida lottery prize in 2006 and was named a person of interest in the case after Shakespeare went missing, authorities said. Before her arrest, Moore proclaimed her innocence during a tearful, impromptu news conference outside her home. She said was planning to help Shakespeare write a book about the challenges of winning millions and that she was helping him manage the money. ""Abraham had a life of drama because of the money,"" she told CNN affiliate WTSP. ""The money was like a curse to him. And now it has become a curse to me."" Moore might have committed fraud to obtain parts of Shakespeare's fortune, and she bought lime to deal with his body and was trying to find someone to move the corpse to another location, Gee said. Shakespeare was killed on April 6 or April 7, and Moore has admitted trying to convince Shakespeare's family members that he was still alive, Gee said. ""In December 2009, Dorice Moore wrote a letter to the victim's mother, claiming to be the victim and to be all right,"" Gee said. ""Dorice Moore also used the victim's cell phone and sent text messages to the victim's family."" Deputies found Shakespeare's body outside a home in Plant City late January after receiving a tip from an associate of Moore, Gee said. Moore could face more charges, and authorities are looking for other suspects, Gee said. Reporters were at the scene during Moore's arrest Tuesday and she again denied having anything to do with Shakespeare's death as she was led to a police cruiser in handcuffs, WTSP reported. ""I'm deeply saddened for his family,"" Moore said.","Dorice Moore says she helped manage Abraham Shakespeare's lottery winnings .

"(CNN) -- War-plagued Somalia, with its crumbling government infrastructure, is the world's most corrupt country, according to a global survey by the international watchdog Transparency International. The group's annual Corruption Perception Index measures perceived levels of public sector corruption. As was the case last year, the 2009 survey found that countries that scored lowest all have something in common: they are fragile, unstable and scarred by war or long-standing conflicts. The group scored 180 countries on a scale of 0 (perceived to be highly corrupt) to 10 (perceived to have low levels of corruption). Somalia scored 1.1. Next came Afghanistan at 1.3, Myanmar at 1.4, and Sudan and Iraq -- both at 1.5 . On the other end of the scale, New Zealand ranked highest at 9.4, followed by Denmark (9.3), Singapore and Sweden (9.2) and Switzerland (9.0). The United States came it at 19 (7.5) and the United Kingdom was at 17 (7.7). ""When essential institutions are weak or non-existent, corruption spirals out of control and the plundering of public resources feeds insecurity and impunity,"" the group said. On the other hand, countries that fared well in the survey have oversight to stem corruption. These include a well-performing judiciary, an independent media, and vigorous law enforcement, it said.","Transparency International's annual Corruption Perception Index measures perceived levels of public sector corruption .

"DAYTON, Ohio (CNN) -- Early on, Maria Lauterbach knew exactly what she wanted to do in life. Dressed in her high school soccer uniform, Maria Lauterbach said she wanted to be a Marine, then a cop. ""After high school, I am going into the Marines,"" a smiling Lauterbach, dressed in her high school soccer uniform, says in a video made available exclusively to CNN. ""I'll probably be doing that for 20 or 25 years, and then hopefully after that, becoming a cop."" Lauterbach became a Marine, but her dreams were cut short. Her body was found buried in the backyard of a fellow Marine, Cpl. Cesar Laurean, near Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, in January.  Watch Lauterbach talk about her future plans » . Mary Lauterbach, Maria's mother, wants to know why the Marines didn't do more to protect her daughter from Laurean, whom Maria Lauterbach had accused of rape in May 2007. ""My concern is I want women to be better protected,"" Lauterbach, of Dayton, Ohio, told CNN.  Watch how mother wants answers from Marines » . Laurean now faces murder charges. He fled the Camp Lejeune area on January 11. The FBI says he went to his native Mexico, and a cousin of Laurean's reported seeing him in Zapopan, Mexico, in mid-January. Mary Lauterbach has sent a list of more than 30 questions to the commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, through her congressman. She says she's unconvinced her daughter's rape allegation against Laurean was treated seriously. Maria Lauterbach was 20 years old and eight months pregnant when she was reported missing after she failed to report for duty at Camp Lejeune in mid-December. Her body was found nearly a month later beneath a fire pit in Laurean's backyard. It is unclear whether he was the father of her unborn child. After Maria Lauterbach accused Laurean of rape, she was moved to another office, and military protective orders were issued to keep the accused from the accuser. But Mary Lauterbach and her congressman, Rep. Mike Turner, say the Marines didn't do enough to protect her. ""My daughter wanted to be transferred to another base,"" her mother said. She said her daughter told her in phone conversations that she would occasionally see Laurean at meetings and that it traumatized her. The questions Turner, an Ohio Republican, sent to Conway include what steps were taken to protect Lauterbach after she accused Laurean of rape; why no search was launched immediately after she failed to report for duty; whether she requested a transfer to another base before her death; and whether Laurean was asked for a DNA sample after her pregnancy was confirmed. A Marine Corps spokesman told CNN the service would respond to all of the questions submitted through Turner and would not comment further until those answers were complete. Merle Wilberding, Lauterbach's family attorney, said the military protective order ""really wasn't very effective."" Wilberding also questions the length of the investigation. The next step would have been an Article 32 hearing, the military's equivalent of a open grand jury proceeding. Lauterbach disappeared in mid-December when she failed to show up for work. ""May 11 to December 14 is a long time for resentment to fester, if that's what it was,"" Wilberding says. ""The longer these cases go on, I think the more difficult it is for the victim,"" he adds. After Maria Lauterbach first leveled her charges, she changed her story but later continued to claim she was raped by Laurean. ""The problem is when someone has perceived credibility issues, you still must protect the person who is making those claims,"" her mother said. The Marine Corps has said it reviewed its handling of Lauterbach's rape allegations. Turner says a general told him everything was done appropriately. ""I disagree that the review is complete,"" Turner told CNN. ""This is a matter where clearly there is a tragic death, there is a national interest in other women that are serving, and this is a matter that deserves higher scrutiny."" Laurean denied the rape allegation or any other sexual contact with Lauterbach. In a statement issued after her death, the Marine Corps said Laurean's denial ""was believed to significant evidence."" During a press briefing after Lauterbach's body was found, the Marines described her as a ""solid Marine"" and the fugitive Laurean as a ""stellar Marine."" Turner called the latter statement ""really unexplainable."" ""I don't know how you can be a stellar Marine and have another Marine buried in your backyard,"" he said. ""And when that statement was made, those Marines already knew of the tragedy that had befallen Maria."" Mary Lauterbach said her daughter would be proud of her persistence: ""I do this totally for her and for the protection of everyone else's daughter.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Lady Gaga has paid tribute to pop icon Cyndi Lauper as they join forces to raise HIV and AIDS awareness among women. Gaga and Lauper told CNN's ""Connect The World"" women ""need to put their foot down"" in the bedroom. ""Cyndi is a lot of my inspiration,"" Gaga said, before relating how she and Lauper had met playing gay clubs in gay neighborhoods. Lauper replied: ""That's very sweet. You know I get inspired by her. I get inspired to remember myself."" Pop icon Gaga, who has enjoyed worldwide success thanks to songs such as ""Poker Face,"" ""Just Dance"" and ""Telephone"" is known as much for her distinctive fashion sense and extravagant performances as she is for her music. But she told CNN's Becky Anderson that she was surprised a viewer had asked her whether she wrote her own songs. ""People are asking that question?"" queried Gaga. ""I have written every single song I have ever sang and also produced a lot of the music."" Gaga and Lauper are on a mission, along with cosmetics giant MAC, to ensure women are tested for HIV and AIDS. ""This is not a gay disease, this is a disease plaguing women,"" said Gaga. ""And I just want to clarify that. Because I think that's the very sort of pre-assumption, that women aren't getting tested and allowing negotiations to go on in the bedroom and are not putting their foot down.""  Lauper added: ""I lost a lot of friends in the eighties and nineties and it was a big heartbreak and I can't just stand by."" Gaga said that she had been a fan of MAC since she was young. ""MAC is a lifestyle, it is sort of this place and Mecca near my house where I could be who I wanted to be and find myself as an individual."" She described being a role model to girls and young women as being not a burden but a privilege. ""I'm so blessed that I'm here,"" she said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Creating and saving jobs while boosting investment in the future are among the top goals of the Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus plan. President Obama chats with students at a Silver Spring, Maryland, elementary school this week. And according to a preliminary report on stimulus funding for schools by the Department of Education and the Domestic Policy Council, the stimulus plan has created jobs. State governments have created and saved at least 250,000 education jobs -- and restored nearly all their projected education budget shortfalls for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 -- according to preliminary findings released Monday by the White House. But some states that used the funds to fill existing budget gaps could face a crisis when the money runs out after 2010. And the Department of Education has chastised certain states for their stimulus funding programs and warned them that they risk their chances at getting other DOE grants down the road. The stimulus funds appropriated $48.6 billion for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to help keep and create jobs and advance education reforms over a period of two years, the report said. The program dedicates $39.8 billion for public elementary, secondary and higher education and other services. Another $8.8 billion will go for other activities such as public safety or government services. ""To date, $35.5 billion of the SFSF allotment has been obligated and $13.2 [billion] is forthcoming,"" the report added. In a recent memo, the Department of Education's inspector general's office warned Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania about not following the rules. At issue is the government's ""maintenance of effort"" provision, which makes states receiving stimulus funds promise to maintain funding at fiscal year 2006 levels. The provision also requires states to pledge to use these funds to advance certain education reforms: increasing teacher effectiveness, implementing statewide data systems, and providing  support for struggling schools. The September 30 memo pointed out states are using K-12 stimulus funds to fill gaps in their education budgets due to decreasing revenues and resources. Pennsylvania's actions led to a terse letter on June 18 from Education Secretary Arne Duncan to Gov. Ed Rendell. The letter said: ""If a State has disproportionately reduced its education budget and/or if a State has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the State had other resources available to it, such as a rainy-day fund, the State's competitive position to receive ... competitive grants may be negatively impacted."" Those states employing the practice, some argue, will face dire straits in fiscal year 2011 when the stimulus funding runs out. ""States and districts were repeatedly warned about funding [problems],"" said Chad Aldeman, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan think tank Education Sector. But Aldeman notes that there may have been a lack of communication between states and the federal government over how to spend the money. ""They [states] were told to focus on one-time investments as much as possible,"" he said. ""At the same time, the Department of Education sold this as a job and reform package. ... They say on one hand, preserve and create jobs. On the other hand, they talk about education reform."" The Obama administration argues the early results from Monday's report show the money already is having an effect. ""This is one more indication of how the Recovery Act is helping soften the blow of tough times, by keeping educators on the job and teachers in the classroom,"" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement. But there has been criticism over the way the government is handling and tracking the Recovery Act. ""If these issues and the stimulus money being made available ... are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue,"" said Pedro A. Noguera, a professor at New York University and director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, in a recent CNN.com commentary. ""The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers."" Aldeman points out that some of the accountability problems seen with the Recovery Act likely occurred during the time the federal government was doling out money to states. ""The states were cutting employees that were designed to draft federal grants and to track and follow money as it flowed through [at the same time the federal government was giving out stimulus funds]. ... They were cutting monitors and accountants that would have been able to follow this better,"" he said. Despite some of the accountability and tracking problems, Duncan said early feedback from states ""also tells us that many districts are using stimulus dollars in ways that will move us beyond the status quo."" And Duncan's concept can be seen in school programs cited in Monday's report. Jim McIntyre, superintendent of the Knox County, Tennessee, schools, said the stimulus funding is not only helping to create jobs in the short term but also investing in the future after the funding is gone. ""Our philosophy has really been around making some investments in the short term to build our capacity so that those investments will continue to pay off in the long term around student achievement and learning, long after the dollars are gone,"" he said. McIntyre's school district was cited in the stimulus report as a success story for facilitating greater inclusion of students with disabilities into the regular educational setting. The funds, according to the report, helped the district to add special education instructors in its middle and high schools, ""while supporting needed training for teachers and aides who work with special education students."" Tennessee, McIntyre said, has been supportive in helping his school district plan and obtain stimulus money to ""really invest in our people and hopefully invest in our kids for the long term."" The Department of Education report offered other examples that it said showed funding is working, such as: . ""In several communities these dollars are being used to enhance information systems to help measure progress by both teachers and students in meeting educational standards,"" the report added. CNNMoney.com's David Goldman contributed to this report.","American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 signed in February .

"(CNN) -- After two days of violence and looting that claimed the lives of at least 48 people, relative calm settled over Madagascar Wednesday. But the possibility of further violence loomed as anti-government protesters gathered in a central square, vowing future demonstrations. At least 48 people were killed during the riots that broke out in Madagascar. President Marc Ravalomanana and other senior government officials surveyed some of the damage Wednesday and vowed to restore order ""whatever the cost,"" a government statement said. Ravalomanana ordered a member of his joint chiefs of staff to work with the protesters and opposition leader Andry Rajoelina to keep the calm. Meanwhile, Rajoelina -- mayor of the capital, Antananarivo -- addressed the protesters at a downtown rally Wednesday afternoon, calling for two days of general strikes and another mass demonstration Saturday. The strikes would prevent stores and schools from opening. On Tuesday the authorities tried to control protesters who set fire to the state-run media complex the day before. Ravalomanana said he initially held off on ordering troops to fight off looters, saying he wanted to avoid more casualties. ""It is better that equipment be destroyed rather than human lives,"" he said in the statement, adding that looters would not be prosecuted because he ""understands the Malagasy people are poor and hungry."" A spokesman for Joseph Ravohanjy Hospital said 48 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in the violence since Monday. By Wednesday, a relative calm had fallen over the area and Rajoelina's rally at the square was peaceful, a Western observer told CNN. The violence began when protesters stormed the government's radio and television station in Antananarivo, Monday morning in response to Ravalomanana shutting down Rajoelina's radio station hours earlier. Ravalomanana's move came just weeks after closing Rajoelina's television station last month after the airing of an interview with ousted ex-President Didier Ratsiraka. Viva Radio was back on the air Tuesday as the protesters broadened their focus from restoring freedom of speech to targeting businesses owned by Ravalomanana, including food distribution centers, according to an American community worker in Antananarivo. By Tuesday afternoon, some of the protesters had broken from the group, looting private electronic shops and grocery stores that sat alongside the Ravalomanana-owned buildings, Christi Turner said. ""Today and yesterday, it's been a collective disappointment and shock and sadness for me and my friends and other aid workers,"" Turner told CNN on Tuesday night. ""People have lost their heads in the mob mentality."" She added that the government ""is not taking the most effective steps controlling the situation,"" noting that military and police didn't publicly address the looters until Tuesday. Reports of injuries and deaths from resulting fires could not be immediately confirmed. Rodney Ford, public affairs officer for the U.S. Embassy in Antananarivo, said the United States is calling for calm and pushing for dialogue between the president and the mayor. Both sides have offered to negotiate, which a group of ambassadors is working toward. ""We are worried about the loss of life,"" Ford said. ""The Malagasy people need to work this out, it's not an issue outsiders can fix. The U.S. Embassy is calling for calm and restraint. We are working to mediate within both parties.""","NEW: At least 48 people die in the violence in Madagascar, official says .

"New York (CNN) -- A country with a Mediterranean climate and sparse snowfall, Israel is seldom considered a viable competitor in winter sports. So when Roman Zaretsky and his sister Alexandra take the ice in Vancouver on Friday, they will be skating for more than just a medal. The ice dancing pair hope to show the world that Israel can be a fierce competitor, no matter what the season. For Roman Zaretsky, 27, the weather was never a deterrent and competing in the Winter Games was always the goal. ""I always knew I wanted to be in the Olympics, since I was 10,"" Zaretsky says. Zaretsky and Alexandra Zaretsky, 22, who is called Sasha, were taught to skate by their mother when they were young. The siblings began ice dancing, a form of figure skating that focuses more on choreography and draws from the world of ballroom dancing. ""I don't remember a moment of life without skating,"" Roman Zaretsky said. ""In Russia, that was one of the biggest sports and then it kind of became my life slowly. Then we started skating together and it became our life."" The Zaretskys were born in Minsk, Belarus, under the former Soviet Union. Their family decided to leave the country as soon as it was possible and moved to Israel. They settled in Metula, a city near the Lebanese border, which boasts the country's only regulation size ice rink. Metula held a number of challenges for the two young skaters. The Zaretskys often found themselves with little time on the ice, because they had to share it with other skaters and hockey players, who would come to the rink to practice. ""The ice time was not enough. We had 45 minutes a day and we need much more than that,"" Sasha Zaretsky said. ""Usually one practice here is an hour and a half, so it's not enough to become an Olympic athlete."" Living and practicing so close to Lebanon's border also meant dealing with warfare and instability. They had to evacuate the area several times, and the ice rink itself was bombed three times while they were living there. Despite the difficulties, the pair continued training under their mother's tutelage until she had taught them everything she knew. ""Our mom was coaching us until we reached the moment where she said, 'OK, I cannot give you anymore,' "" Roman Zaretsky said. "" 'You need to go somewhere else if you want to move on.' "" So in 2001, when Roman was 17 and Sasha 13, they left home for the United States, where, for the second time in their lives, they had to adjust to a new culture and learn a new language. They decided to settle in New Jersey, one of several East Coast states renowned for its excellent skating coaches. For the past three years, the Zaretskys have been coached by Galit Chait, a former Olympic ice dancer. Chait has known the siblings for a long time and even helped pave the way for their Olympic appearances. Along with her partner, Sergei Sakhnovski, Chait competed in Winter Games three times, including the 2002 Winter Olympics where she placed sixth overall. However, Chait and Sakhnovski did not receive much funding from the Israeli government in the beginning, and Chait's parents often supported them. ""We were the pioneers. We didn't get money until we started placing and getting medals,"" Chait said. ""Roman and Sasha have it a little bit better than we did."" Although funding is still hard to come by, Chait's father, Boris, has provided the majority of the money for the Zaretskys. Training Olympic athletes can bear a hefty price, because there is also a lot of work done off the ice. In addition to a coach and booking time on the ice, a choreographer, a Pilates trainer, a stretch coach, a weight training coach, a masseuse and a costume designer are necessary. ""It is a project. It's not only money, you become involved in the everyday life of these kids,"" Boris Chait said. ""You become like a second father or a foster family."" But it is a project the Chait family is willing to undertake in order to help build a legacy in Israel and cater to the large percentage of the population from the former Soviet Union. Boris Chait believes Soviet culture, even when transplanted into a warm climate, is still intricately entwined with winter sports. He is confident that this segment of the country wants to see Israel compete in the Winter Games and he said he believes the Zaretskys can display Israel's competitiveness in Vancouver this year. The siblings made their first Olympic appearance in 2006, where they finished 22nd. They had only learned they had qualified two weeks before the ceremonies began and were in awe of the entire experience. This time, however, they feel confident they will do better. Their coach agrees. ""They've been skating really well this year and it's been a really good year for them,"" Chait said. The Zaretskys recently placed seventh in the European Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia, and have been practicing diligently for the Olympic Games in Vancouver. While they would love to bring home a medal, they are also grateful for the opportunity to represent their country. ""Our country never won an Olympic medal, so we're hoping for a medal, but placing in the top 10  would be amazing,"" Roman Zaretsky said. Win or lose, the Zaretskys are hoping to inspire kids back home to pick up the sport and to aim for the Olympics. ""Everything is possible,"" Zaretsky said. ""If you want to be there, you'll be there, so just work hard!""","Brother and sister team is representing Israel in ice dancing .

"(The Frisky) -- There's no question that I find Don Draper sexy. If I lived in ""Mad Men"" land for a day, I would totally make out with him on his Sterling-Cooper purchased desk. In real life? Not so much. At least not anymore. Don Draper of ""Mad Men"" is a complicated man underneath a confident exterior, columnist warns. What makes Don Draper so drool-worthy on screen does not translate in real life. Actually, certain things do translate -- tall, dark and handsome is still tall, dark, and handsome in the real world. But that aloof, secretive, and calculating personality that seduces his onscreen paramours and the show's viewers? Not easy to live with. Don Draper is written as an extremely complicated and deeply flawed man who does some awful things, like cheating repeatedly on his wife, Betty, and using information he gleans from her therapist to manipulate her. But the reasons and motivations behind his repulsive actions are slowly being revealed with each new episode. As with any TV show or movie, we itch to know what possesses someone to do the things he does, and we expect that writers as glorious as the ones behind ""Mad Men"" will eventually lead us to deep understanding of who Don Draper is and how he will evolve into a better man. In real life, such life-changing revelations don't always come. I dated a Don Draper-type for years. There were superficial similarities, like that they both worked in similar industries (just decades apart) and had a knack for always being ""on."" Guys like Don Draper are great at their jobs for a multitude of reasons, but one of them is that they present themselves as calm, collected, and unmoved by the opinions and emotions of others. In a business situation this comes across as professional, confident, and reassuring to the client that the task at hand will be accomplished flawlessly. In a real-life romantic relationship, the refusal or inability to ""turn it off"" can be frustrating and painful for the other person involved. At the same time, being one of the few who is able to get past the facade feels powerful. When you're in love, having that power only makes you feel even more special. The Frisky: 10 things women don't understand about men . There are reasons why Draper's wall is so high and impenetrable. Knowing those reasons -- or at least some of them -- makes viewers sympathetic to him. There's an abused boy beneath that tough exterior! A man with secrets so big, he has to hide behind a wall all of the time. Betty Draper may not know Don's secrets, but they do share a bond he doesn't have with other people. The women he cheats with? They don't know him at all and they don't have the ability or even the interest in seeing something deeper like Betty does. They're not threatening to his persona, but she is. These are, of course, just excuses for his bad behavior that should never fly in real life. My ex had his own reasons for presenting a facade, for not letting anyone get too close, for acting like a jerk; some he shared, some I figured out, but all made me want to stay with him. The Frisky: Could you get past hearing ""I don't love you anymore?"" I don't know if my Draper-esque ex cheated -- though I suspect he did -- but I do think he broke up with me because I was a threat. I saw something deeper that was fragile but wonderful, and I wanted more of it. It was enough to make me overlook the shallowness of his outward persona. Similarly, Don Draper gives viewers plenty to love and root for, like his support of Peggy Olson, his disinterest in Pete Campbell's brown-nosing, his delivery of that Kodak pitch in the first season, and the punch he landed on Jimmy Barrett's jaw. Like Tony Soprano before him, the behavior that would be massively unacceptable in real life is sometimes dwarfed by his acts of kindness, loyalty, and strength. The Frisky: When did you know it was over? That's why I (and I think lots of other women) mostly love -- and sometimes hate -- Don Draper. This season -- which started August 16 -- I'm sure we'll see more cracks in Don Draper's facade, and it should be compelling and exciting to watch. But in real life, with a real Don Draper, I could only do so much. I made as many cracks as I could, but they repaired themselves and I wasn't able to get close enough to try again. In retrospect, thank God. That's why I'll give my attention to Don Draper once a week, from the comfort of my couch, but never again in real life.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- The most memorable moment of the 52nd annual Grammy Awards on Sunday may be the onstage appearance of Michael Jackson's two eldest children to accept their father's lifetime achievement award. ""To all his songs, his message was simple, love,"" 12-year-old Prince Michael said. ""We will continue to spread his message and help the world."" With a voice that sounded more mature than his age, he then thanked ""God for watching over us these last seven months and our grandma and grandpa for their love and support."" Paris, 11, then spoke: ""Daddy was supposed to be here. Daddy was going to perform last year. Thank you. We love you Daddy."" Prince Michael and Paris, along with several cousins, wore black suits with red stripes on their pants, and red armbands. The children appeared after a rousing performance of Michael Jackson's ""Earth Song,"" with a recording of Jackson accompanied by live performances from Celine Dion, Usher, Carrie Underwood, Smokey Robinson and Jennifer Hudson. Grammy producers used the head-to-head competition between Beyonce and Taylor Swift to lure viewers to stay tuned through the three-and-a-half hour telecast. List: Major Grammy winners . Swift got the biggest Grammy of the night, album of the year, for ""Fearless."" ""I just hope that you know how much this means to me,"" she said in her acceptance speech. ""Our families are freaking out in their living rooms."" Swift also won best country album. She won four Grammys overall. Beyonce won a pair of Grammys over Swift, including for best female pop vocal performance. Beyonce carried home six Grammys, including one in the major category of song of the year. That honor, a songwriters' award, was given to Beyonce for co-writing ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)."" For the best female pop honor, won for ""Halo,"" the nervous singer thanked her family, ""including my husband -- I love you."" Beyonce is married to hip-hop star Jay-Z. Gallery: Red-carpet arrivals . Alternative rock band Kings of Leon upset favorites Beyonce and Swift to win the record of the year Grammy for ""Use Somebody."" The win gave the Kings of Leon three Grammys out of four nominations this year, all thanks to last year's ""Only by the Night"" album. The same album gave them three nominations last year, one of which they won. ""Use Somebody"" lost out earlier in the show to Beyonce's ""Single Ladies"" for song of the year. ""The best thing about winning Grammys is really it's the first time our family gets to see the success we're having,"" Kings lead singer Caleb Followill said backstage. ""We're getting my mom wasted."" What do you think about the Grammys? Other triple Grammy winners were The Black Eyed Peas and Jay-Z. Winners also included Stephen Colbert, the Zac Brown Band and Green Day. The Zac Brown Band won best new artist. Lady Gaga, considered by many to be this year's biggest breakout act, was ruled ineligible because she had a song released and nominated last year. Behind-the-scenes: Our Marquee blog .

"(WIRED) -- Apple's decision to not include a camera in the new iPod Touch is somewhat surprising. After all, there is already a perfect camera for the job, and it sits inside the iPhone. By not adding a camera to its iPod Touch, Apple may boost sales of its iPod Nano. That Apple included a video camera inside the iPod Nano makes this more inexplicable still -- the Apple of today is clearly happy to put cameras into its media players (unlike the first iPhone, whose camera was so poor we thought it was just a petulant capitulation to cellphone norms). Leaving the camera out is also a clear signal not to upgrade the Touch, as -- apart from a larger 64GB model -- the only hardware change is the juiced-up processor, making the iPod Touch run faster like its older brother the iPhone 3GS. Perhaps Apple is putting the Touch on a two-year update plan like the iPhone, letting people keep their pocket computers for a little longer than usual. Had the Touch included a camera, I would be knocking on the store doors right now to buy one, along with 64GB ready to be filled with photos and video. So the excitement falls to the Nano, which, sports a new shiny coating, a 640 x 480 video camera (no stills) and a larger screen on the outside, and an FM radio on the inside with a Tivo-esque live-pause feature. The radio itself is odd enough, and the first to be included in any iPod. More on that in a moment. The Nano's video camera was introduced with reference to Flip's own tiny, no-zoom camcorder. There are two Flip camcorders at the 8GB Nano's $150 price: the 2GB Mino and the 4GB Ultra. To get 4GB and 8GB you jump to $200. The 16GB Nano costs $180. Why would somebody buy a Flip? The easy, one button recording, perhaps (with the Nano, you need to go to a menu item to open the video camera application), but that's it. Take a look at the sample videos at the Apple store and you'll see that the Nano's quality is easily ""good enough."" There is another surprise in there, too. The tiny Nano frame has a chip big enough to add real-time effects to video. Gimmicky, but as we guess this is aimed at the teenage market, a nice feature. The Nano is the fitness iPod, too, and in this guise it makes another piece of hardware obsolete: The shoe-mounted Nike+ dongle. The Nano comes with the Nike+ software, with workout history, power songs and the like, but the accelerometer now works as a pedometer, counting your steps to flab-loss. You can also connect it to a Nike + iPod compatible cardio-machine via the dock connector. One mystery remains, though. Why would Apple put an FM tuner into an iPod, something it has refused for almost ten years? The answer comes with iTunes-Tagging. In addition to live pausing of the radio stream (and rewinding up to 15 minutes through the buffer) you can tag tracks by hitting the center button. If a radio station supports it, the song info is saved and later you can see a list in iTunes alongside, you guessed it, the option to buy the song. Of course, the fact that the new Zune HD has an HD radio inside may also have influenced Apple's decision. So now I'm torn. Do I buy a new Touch to replace my current model which has a loose headphone connection, or should I get the Nano, with its video camera and sport-friendly features? If Apple had piled the features onto the Touch, the decision would be made, and Apple would have $400 of my money. As it is, I think I'll wait.

"Boston, Massachusetts (CNN)  -- Republican Scott Brown won a major upset victory in Tuesday's special election for the U.S. Senate seat formerly held by liberal Democrat Ted Kennedy. Brown defeated Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley, the Democratic candidate. Brown's victory made real the once unthinkable prospect of a Republican filling the seat held by Kennedy, known as the liberal lion, for almost 47 years until his death from brain cancer in August. Voters across Massachusetts braved winter cold and snow for an election with high stakes -- the domestic agenda of President Obama, including his priority of health care reform. Brown's victory strips Democrats of the 60-seat Senate supermajority needed to overcome GOP filibusters against future Senate action on a broad range of White House priorities. Senate Democrats needed all 60 votes in their caucus to pass the health care bill, and the loss of one seat imperils generating that support again for a compromise measure worked out with the House. In a subdued concession speech, Coakley said she expected a tough assessment of her loss and lots of ""Wednesday-morning quarterbacking"" after losing a seat held by Democrats for more than 50 years. ""I am heartbroken at the result,"" Coakley said, later adding: ""Although I am very disappointed, I always respect the voters' choice."" Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin said last week that certifying Tuesday's election results could take more than two weeks -- potentially enough time to allow congressional Democrats to pass a final health care bill before Brown is seated. But multiple Democratic sources said this is unlikely. Even if House and Senate Democrats could reach a deal to meld their bills and pass them in the next couple of weeks, there would be a huge outcry from not only Republicans, but also an increasingly distrustful public if they appeared to be rushing it through. Galvin had predicted as many as 2.2 million of the state's 4.5 million registered voters would vote -- at least double the turnout from December's primary. In one sign of high interest, more than 100,000 absentee ballots were requested ahead of the election, according to Galvin's spokesman, Brian McNiff. Coakley was initially expected to easily win the race to replace Kennedy, who made health care reform the centerpiece of his Senate career. Until recently, Brown was underfunded and unknown statewide. In addition, no Republican has won a U.S. Senate race in Massachusetts since 1972, and Democrats control the governorship, both houses of the state legislature, and the state's entire congressional delegation. However, Brown surged in the weeks preceding Tuesday's vote and led in all the final polls. Democratic sources told CNN that Coakley called Brown on Tuesday night to concede. In a sign of the high stakes involved, the Coakley campaign held an afternoon news conference Tuesday to complain that voters in three places received ballots already marked for Brown. iReport: Send us your thoughts on the special election . McNiff confirmed that the secretary of state's offices received two reports of voters saying they got pre-marked ballots. The suspect ballots were invalidated and the voters received new ballots, McNiff said. Kevin Conroy, the Coakley campaign manager, said the ""disturbing incidents"" raised questions about the integrity of the election. In response, the Brown campaign issued a statement criticizing Coakley's team. ""Reports that the Coakley campaign is making reckless accusations regarding the integrity of today's election is a reminder that they are a desperate campaign,"" Daniel B. Winslow, the counsel for the Brown campaign, said in the statement. Obama has been both ""surprised and frustrated"" by the race, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. Obama and former President Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail over the past three days in an attempt to save Coakley's campaign, which observers say was hampered by complacency and missteps. Obama crushed Sen. John McCain in Massachusetts in 2008, beating the GOP presidential nominee by 26 points. ""If you were fired up in the last election, I need you more fired up in this election,"" Obama urged a crowd at a Coakley campaign rally on Sunday. Vicki Kennedy, the late senator's widow, called on state Democrats to turn out to save her husband's legacy. ""We need your help. We need your support. We need you to get out there and vote on Tuesday,"" Kennedy said. ""We need you to bring your neighbors. We need you to bring your friends."" Brown, who has trumpeted his 30 years of service in the National Guard, hewed to traditional GOP themes at the end of the campaign. He promised at a rally Sunday that, if elected, he would back tax cuts and be tougher on terrorists than Coakley. He also repeated a pledge to oppose Obama's health care reform effort. ""Massachusetts wants real reform and not this trillion-dollar Obama health care that is being forced on the American people,"" he said. ""As the 41st [Republican] senator I will make sure that we do it better."" Forty-four percent of Massachusetts voters cited the economy and jobs as their top concern in a recent 7 News/Suffolk University poll. Thirty-eight percent mentioned health care as their top concern. Voters more concerned with the economy were split almost evenly between the two candidates; voters more worried about health care narrowly supported Coakley. Brown's surprising strength came in part because some independents and conservatives who have supported Democrats in the past were having second thoughts. Democrats far outnumber Republicans in Massachusetts, but there are more independents than Democrats and Republicans combined. Several Democratic sources say multiple Obama advisers have told the party they believed Coakley was going to lose, despite Obama's campaign appearance for Coakley on Sunday. Facing the possibility of Coakley's defeat, Democrats were trying to figure out if they could pass health care reform without that crucial 60th Senate vote. The seat is currently held by former Kennedy aide and longtime friend Paul Kirk, who was appointed to the seat on an interim basis. Two Democratic sources in close contact with the White House told CNN on Monday they've urged the administration, in the event of a Brown victory, to push House Democrats to pass the Senate's health care bill as currently written. Doing so would prevent the plan from having to be taken up by the Senate again. ""I think the Senate bill clearly is better than nothing,"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said Tuesday. A third option would be for Democrats to revisit the idea of trying to push health care through the Senate with only 51 votes -- a simple majority. But to do that Democrats would have to use a process known as reconciliation, which presents technical and procedural issues that would delay the process for a long time. A number of Democrats are eager to put the health care debate behind them and move on to economic issues such as job creation as soon as possible this election year. Senate Democrats could also try again to get moderate GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine to vote for a compromise health reform plan. Multiple Democratic sources, however, have said they believe that is unlikely now.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Casey Johnson, heiress to the Johnson & Johnson fortune, died of natural causes related to diabetes, the Los Angeles County coroner said Thursday. The 30-year-old socialite was found dead at a friend's home January 4, authorities said. Johnson was one of the great-great-granddaughters of Robert Wood Johnson, a co-founder of the pharmaceutical giant, and was the daughter of Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets professional football team. She died of diabetic ketoacidosis, the coroner found. The Mayo Clinic describes the condition as a serious complication of untreated diabetes. Johnson was in the news recently because of her relationship with Internet and reality television star Tila Tequila. Several messages on Tequila's official Twitter page mentioned Johnson in the wake of her death. ""I can't stop these haunting visions of her and I. We made such a lovely couple, only beginning to spend the rest of our lives together,"" a posting said the day after Johnson died. ""Everyone please pray 4 my Wifey Casey Johnson,"" Tequila wrote the day of Johnson's death. ""She has passed away. Thank u for all ur love and support but I will be offline to be w family."" Johnson's family also expressed sadness.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Investigators found testosterone, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in the body of professional wrestler Chris Benoit, who killed his wife and son last month before hanging himself in his Atlanta home, a medical examiner said Tuesday. Investigators found steroids in the body of pro wrestler Chris Benoit, who killed his family in June. Dr. Kris Sperry, Georgia's chief medical examiner, said the body of Benoit's wife, Nancy, also contained painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs. Sperry said it's likely the Benoits' 7-year-old son, Daniel, was sedated at the time he was murdered, because a high level of the anti-anxiety drug Xanax was found in the boy's system. Xanax is not normally prescribed for children, Sperry said. Chris Benoit's body contained an ""elevated"" level of testosterone and therapeutic levels of Xanax and the painkiller hydrocodone, Sperry said. But, he said, the level of testosterone revealed nothing conclusive about the wrestler's state of mind before his death. ""There's no reliable scientific data that says elevated levels of testosterone lead to psychotic rage,"" Sperry said. ""The only thing we can ascertain is that this level of testosterone indicates that he had been using testosterone at least in some reasonably short period of time before he died,"" he said. ""It could be an indication he was being treated for testicular insufficiency."" The investigators found no other drugs, including steroids, in Benoit's body. The investigation into the Benoits' deaths led to speculation that the wrestler may have been injecting steroids and had experienced what is called "" 'roid rage,"" leading him to kill his wife and son. An official who is part of the investigation told CNN last month that Benoit's name was on receipts that indicated he had purchased shipments of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones from Signature Pharmacy. The Orlando, Florida, facility is at the center of a nationwide investigation into the sale of illegal steroids. Phil Astin, Benoit's personal doctor, has been indicted by a grand jury on seven charges of improperly dispensing and distributing painkillers and other drugs. Astin has been released on $125,000 bond and is under house arrest. Although Benoit's name was not mentioned in Astin's indictment, his arrest stemmed from the investigation into the Benoits' deaths. ""Through prescription records for Mr. Benoit maintained at a pharmacy in Fayetteville, Georgia, Dr. Astin was identified as prescribing, on average, a 10-month supply of anabolic steroids to Mr. Benoit every three to four weeks from May 4, 2006, through May 9, 2007,"" the U.S. attorney's office said. Sperry said the body of Nancy Benoit also contained therapeutic levels of hydrocodone and Xanax, along with hydromorphone, which he said is a byproduct of the breakdown of hydrocodone. Nancy Benoit's blood alcohol level was .184, which is over the legal limit for intoxication, but Sperry said all of the alcohol found in her body ""could come from the decomposition process."" Sperry said investigators did not have enough specimen to test for steroids or human growth hormone in Daniel's body. Daniel's body showed signs of needle marks at the time of his death, but Sperry could not speculate why. District Attorney Scott Ballard would not answer questions about the state of the investigation into the Benoits' deaths, which he said is ongoing. ""We'd rather wait until we have more of the pieces so we can be more accurate and discuss more of a whole what happened,"" he said. ""We're trying to envision as best we can what happened inside that household. This (the toxicology report) adds one element to all the other elements."" Police have said Benoit, 40, strangled his wife, Nancy, and suffocated Daniel, then placed Bibles next to their bodies before hanging himself on a portable weight machine over the weekend of June 23.

"Baltimore, Maryland (CNN) -- President Obama and House GOP leaders promised greater efforts to step back from the partisan brink Friday, acknowledging that Washington's toxic political climate has made it increasingly tough to tackle major problems. The pledge was immediately called into question, however, as the two parties repeatedly expressed sharply differing viewpoints during a rare meeting at a House Republican retreat in Baltimore. Obama accepted an invitation from House GOP leaders to address their caucus. His speech Friday was followed by an often pointed question-and-answer session. ""House Republican leaders are grateful for [Obama's] willingness to come ... and have a frank and honest conversation,"" said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Indiana. ""We welcome the dialogue with the president."" The president accused Republicans of frequently mischaracterizing his policy proposals, particularly in the health care debate. Republicans, in turn, complained the White House and congressional Democrats had ignored their ideas, locked them out of the policy-making process and unfairly labeled them as obstructionists. ""Both sides can take some blame for a sour climate on Capitol Hill,"" Obama said, adding that Democrats and Republicans need to be careful in choosing their rhetoric. ""A ton of civility instead of slash and burn would be helpful."" The president highlighted what he said was problematic GOP rhetoric on his health care proposals. Republicans, he said, had characterized the proposed program as some ""kind of Bolshevik plot."" In fact, he said that much of his plan was similar to what Republicans had proposed during the failed Clinton-era push to overhaul health care. Both sides need to ""close the gap a little bit between rhetoric and reality,"" the president argued. Calling his health care plan ""some wild-eyed plot to impose big government in every aspect of our lives"" leaves little room for bipartisan negotiation, Obama said. The president questioned how Republicans could negotiate in good faith after using such rhetoric without exposing themselves to conservative primary challengers. House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he tried to be honest about differences over administration proposals. ""I truly believe a government takeover of health care ... is the essence of their bill,"" Boehner said. Obama conceded there's been a failure on his part to ""try to foster better communications even if there's disagreement."" He has promised regular meetings with GOP leaders in the future. Boehner welcomed the gesture but said it is equally important for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Republicans a greater role in the legislative process. Bipartisanship ""isn't about taking one little Republican idea and throwing it in a 2,000-page bill,"" he said after Obama argued that Democratic leaders had taken GOP proposals into account in the health care debate. ""If you're really serious about building a bipartisan product ... you need to do it from the beginning."" Republicans criticized the president for failing to fulfill a promise to televise all the health care negotiations on C-SPAN. Obama called the criticism ""legitimate"" but noted the overwhelming majority of committee hearings on the legislation had been conducted in front of TV cameras. After the bills had cleared the committees, however, it became a ""messy process,"" he conceded. ""I take responsibility for not having structured it in a way where it was all taking place in one place that could be filmed,"" he said. Obama and Republicans strongly criticized each other on a range of issues tied to taxes and spending. GOP leaders said Obama's $862 billion stimulus plan had been ineffective and repeatedly urged the president to consider an across-the-board tax cut. Obama said it would be wrong to slash taxes for the richest Americans or the banking sector in a weak economy. He also argued that the stimulus program had saved key jobs in GOP districts across the country. ""There is not a single person in here who, had it not been for what was in the stimulus package, wouldn't be going home to more teachers laid off, more firefighters laid off, more cops laid off,"" he said. ""The component parts of the Recovery Act are consistent"" with what many Republicans say are important, he said. The stimulus helped in terms of ""rebuilding our infrastructure, tax cuts for families and businesses, and making sure that we were providing states and individuals some support when the roof was caving in."" The president said he agrees with the GOP emphasis on fiscal responsibility but hinted that Republicans could do more to help control spending, including curtailing legislative earmark requests for their own districts. He also said he is willing to work with Republicans on the enactment of a line-item veto. ""There's not a president out there that wouldn't like that,"" he said. Despite their disagreements, both sides agreed the day's dialogue was a step in the right direction. ""I hope that the conversation we begin here doesn't end here, that we can continue our dialogue in the days ahead,"" Obama said. The day ""went very well,"" Boehner replied later. ""There are issues we do agree on"" and Republicans will work to find ""common ground."" We should ""set aside perhaps the things that the president believes in that we philosophically don't, but if there is some common ground we ought to go ahead forward with those,"" said Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Virginia. Friday's meeting, he said, was ""the kind of discussion, frankly, that we need to have more of.""","NEW: House Minority Leader John Boehner says the day ""went very well""

"(CNN) -- To hear leaders of the ""Draft John Mellencamp for Senate!"" Facebook group tell it, this is a story about ""insider"" politicians, ""street-level voters"" and whether a likeable rock star with strong grass-roots appeal will run for the U.S. Senate. The ""movement,"" as the group calls it, was born less than three weeks ago with Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh's stunning announcement he would not not run for re-election. The next morning, Gabrial Canada, 21, was at home watching cable news reports about a Facebook page aimed at bringing Mellencamp, 58, into the race. ""After I saw that I went right to the Facebook group,"" Canada said Wednesday from his home in Indianapolis. ""By then it had only been a matter of hours and it had already gotten a thousand members. It was incredibly exciting to see that catching hold."" He contacted the group's founder and from then on he was hooked. So far, the group has garnered more than 7,000 members in 16 days. ""There's all this faux populism out there -- people who get paid millions of dollars to generate campaigns that look like they're supporting the people,"" said Canada, a self-described community ambassador for a local PBS TV station. ""When you have the prospect of somebody as genuine as Mellencamp campaigning as someone people can relate to, it's unique, it's something you can't replace."" But there's another turn in this twisted tale. Because Bayh waited until February 15 to announce his decision, he essentially forced the party to choose its candidate instead of leaving it up to voters in the state's May 4 primary. According to party rules, Indiana's 32-member Democratic Central Committee will vote by secret ballot to decide who will run. The committee chairman said members won't consider anyone who hasn't officially declared themselves a candidate. ""I don't think [Mellencamp's] going to declare,"" said chairman Dan Parker. For his part, Mellencamp continues to issue nothing but a terse ""no comment,"" through a spokesman. The idea that Indiana Democrats would not hold a primary to choose their Senate candidate felt like a ""punch in the face"" said Canada. It's ""anti-democratic."" ""I don't think that the decisions of insiders are necessarily reflective of the popular political will,"" he said. Through meetup.com, Canada is organizing the first of a statewide series of planned rallies set for Friday at a 1950s-era hangout on Indianapolis' folksy South Side. At Edwards Drive-In, home of the ""Jumbo Tenderloin"" and 99-cent root beer floats, Canada hopes to attract a dozen Mellencamp supporters, whom he'll ask to sign a petition to be submitted to Indiana newspaper editors. In the coming days, Canada plans a much larger rally in the Democratic stronghold of Bloomington -- right in the small-town rocker's own backyard. The fact that his Facebook campaign comes during an election cycle influenced by a larger, grass-roots Tea Party movement -- with polar opposite political views -- isn't lost on the Facebook page founder John Patterson. ""The end result of moving out the status quo in favor of new faces is probably the same goal,"" he said with a laugh. The Draft Mellencamp campaign is racing against a deadline. The state's Democratic committee will hold its vote as early as May 15, and any candidate, including Mellencamp, must officially declare 72 hours prior, according to Parker -- that would be noon May 12. As for Mellencamp himself, he's ""never expressed overt interest in running for anything,"" said the musician's longtime publicist, Bob Merlis, by phone from his California office. Much has been written in the past few weeks about Mellencamp's 2008 campaign performances for presidential candidates Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as his years of public support for family farmers and his opposition to the Iraq war. ""I don't think it's a crazy idea,"" Merlis said about the draft campaign. ""I mean that from the point of view of someone who knows him and knows his intellect and knows that he is an aware person. But he's not a very politicked person -- meaning he is not prone to pull his punches."" Opinion: Senator Mellencamp? Crazy talk . Pundits and party officials say they're stymied by this question: Instead of, ""No comment,"" why doesn't Mellencamp just say, ""No thank you?"" Why doesn't he declare that he's just not interested to reduce political confusion and streamline the nomination process? ""I've said something along the same lines,"" said Merlis. Indianapolis Star political columnist Matthew Tully, who has been covering Hoosier politics since 1992, offered his theory: ""Why not just allow the buzz to go out there? He's a businessman, like a politician he knows it doesn't hurt him to have people talking about it. So it is kind of interesting that he hasn't officially said anything either way. My guess is he's just enjoying the moment."" However unlikely, a Mellencamp campaign could be formidable, said pundits, despite Indiana's strong Republican establishment. ""A lot of Hoosiers think that he speaks for them,"" said Brian Howey of the daily online brief Howey Politics Indiana. ""He's pretty well tapped into the Indiana soul."" In the short time since Bayh's announcement, two Democrats who were considering running have decided not to. Most of the Democratic establishment, said Tully, has coalesced strongly around moderate Rep. Brad Ellsworth, a former county sheriff. ""I was with a friend of Mellencamp's in Bloomington last week,"" said Howey. ""His comment was, 'There's no way John could last in the U.S. Senate. It would be absolutely stifling for him. He wouldn't be able to say exactly what's on his mind.'"" ""It's one thing to be [ex-Saturday Night Live comedian and Minnesota Sen.] Al Franken, Harvard grad, who has some seriousness about him -- not that Mellencamp doesn't -- I'm just not sure the Senate's an appropriate forum for him."" Apparently, the Senate was becoming unpalatable for Bayh, who announced he was leaving because an overly partisan ""Congress is not operating as it should."" ""The people's business is not getting done,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A man authorities want to question in the slaying of a 7-year-old girl, whose body was dumped in a landfill, appeared in a Florida court Wednesday on child pornography charges after being extradited from Mississippi. Jarred Harrell, 24, faces 29 counts of possession of child pornography in Clay County, Florida. Clay County Sheriff Rick Beseler has said Harrell is also sought for questioning in the abduction and murder of Somer Thompson, but has not said why. Harrell was arrested in Meridian, Mississippi, by federal agents earlier this month, and Florida Gov. Charlie Crist asked Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour to extradite him. The arrest followed a search of Harrell's residence, Clay County authorities said. Somer Thompson was last seen in the Clay County town of Orange Park on October 19. Her body was found in a landfill in Folkston, Georgia, about 55 miles north of there. Authorities have not said how she was killed. Somer's 10-year-old sister told police that Somer had been in a fight with another girl at school earlier that day and that she brought up the subject while she and her brother walked Somer home from school. Somer ran off, apparently upset. The sister said she lost sight of Somer in a group of other children leaving the school, according to a police report. Police said in October that witnesses including several children reported seeing her that day on a sidewalk in front of a vacant house that was being renovated following a fire. At Wednesday's hearing, a judge continued Harrell's $1 million bond.","Jarred Harrell, 24, faces 29 counts of possessing of child pornography .

"New York (CNN) -- Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui was convicted Wednesday of attempting to kill Americans in Afghanistan in 2008. The jury found Siddiqui guilty of seven counts, including attempted murder and armed assault on U.S. officers. The Manhattan jury began deliberations Monday afternoon and sent a note shortly before 2 p.m. Wednesday saying they had reached a verdict. Siddiqui listened to the verdict without emotion but let out an outburst once the jury was escorted out of the courtroom. ""This is a verdict from Israel, not America,"" she said. ""Anger should be directed to where it belongs. I can testify to this. I have proof."" Authorities removed her from the courtroom. She will be sentenced May 6. Siddiqui's family said she had been unjustly found guilty. ""Today's verdict is one of many legal errors that allowed the prosecution to build a case against our sister based on hate, rather than fact,"" they said in a statement released through the International Justice Network. ""We believe that as a result, she was denied a fair trial, and today's verdict must be overturned on appeal."" Prosecutors said Siddiqui shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. Authorities said Siddiqui used an officer's rifle to fire two shots at the personnel, who were hidden from her view by a curtain. She hit no one. The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol, hitting Siddiqui at least once. Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor's compound in central Afghanistan after finding her with bomb-making instructions, excerpts from the ""Anarchist's Arsenal,"" papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks, and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars, according to a September 2008 indictment. The indictment said Siddiqui had ""handwritten notes that referred to a 'mass casualty attack' "" listing several locations in the United States and ""construction of 'dirty bombs.' "" The notes also ""discussed various ways to attack 'enemies,' including by destroying reconnaissance drones, using underwater bombs, and using gliders,"" the indictment said. ""Siddiqui also possessed a computer thumb drive that contained correspondence referring to specific 'cells,' 'attacks' by certain 'cells,' and 'enemies,' "" the indictment said. ""Other documents on the thumb drive discussed recruitment and training."" Siddiqui, whom the FBI had sought for several years for suspected ties to al Qaeda, was extradited to the United States in August 2008. Since 2003, the whereabouts of Siddiqui, an American-educated neuroscientist, had been the source of much speculation. According to Amnesty International, Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi, Pakistan, in March 2003, shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location. Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi. But in May 2004, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members.","Aafia Siddiqui convicted of attempted murder, armed assault on U.S. officers .

"(CNN) -- The latest trend at teen parties isn't warm beer or prescription medicines pilfered from parents' medicine cabinets. Instead, increasing numbers of youths are turning to an herb-based product to get high, and unlike marijuana, it's perfectly legal. It's known as K2 or Spice, a synthetic substance that, when smoked, gives users a marijuana-like high, according to drug authorities. Its growing popularity is causing increasing alarm among health care professionals, law enforcement authorities and lawmakers, with one Drug Enforcement Agency official calling its use the equivalent of ""playing Russian roulette."" Should some illegal drugs be legalized? Manufactured in Asia and sold online or in local stores, K2 and similar substances are marketed as herbal incense. A disclaimer on a K2-selling Web site reads: ""K2Herbal products are novelty incenses and are not for consumption."" Sold in various flavors in 3-gram bags, the product consists of herbs that are sprayed with synthetic substances that mimic THC, the high-causing natural chemical found in marijuana. A call to regulate K2 . Health and drug officials say the danger in using such products is the unregulated nature of their production and makeup. ""Our biggest concern is that this particular chemical is likely manufactured in a dorm-room setting. And these dorm-room scientists are not going to be exhibiting a lot of quality assurance techniques,"" says Dr. Gaylord Lopez, a toxicologist and head of the Georgia Poison Center. As a result, there's a potential for users to inhale contaminants along with the substance they think they're smoking, Lopez said, which may be a contributing factor in the adverse symptoms some of its users have been experiencing. Political activist wants K2 banned . ""Synthetic drugs and herbal drug products like Spice and K2 are not made in a controlled environment and thus you are playing Russian roulette when it comes to these types of products,"" said Dawn Dearden, a spokeswoman for the DEA, which first began receiving reports about abuse of the substance last year. ""There is no way, outside of a controlled laboratory environment, to determine the chemical makeup, synthetic ingredients or amounts, and therefore there is no way to determine with any accuracy what the potentially harmful effects may be."" Lopez says his center first heard of the substance in December when Georgia hospitals began reporting patients who had used K2 or Spice. Since then, the center has seen a spike in cases, with 20 people -- mostly teenagers -- visiting emergency rooms with such symptoms as heart palpitations and respiratory issues. In the most serious case, an otherwise healthy teenage boy, who has since recovered, lapsed into a coma, Lopez said. According to Dearden, additional side effects can include panic attacks, hallucinations, delusions, vomiting, increased agitation and dilated pupils. Around the center, Lopez said his employees have begun referring to the substance as ""Scary Spice."" Earlier this month, Kansas became the first state to ban synthetic marijuana. Kansas state Sen. Jim Barnett, a supporter of the effort, said the ban was prompted by reports of abuse of K2 and similar products in cities across the state among high school students and prison parolees who were using it as an alternative to pot to avoid a positive drug test. Lawmakers in several other states are considering similar legislation, including Georgia, Utah, Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, North Dakota and Illinois. ""Although it is a synthetic drug, it is still a drug with a high potential for abuse,"" says Barnett, who is a physician. ""It was our desire in Kansas to be ahead of the problem."" K2 has already been banned in some European countries, including Britain, Germany, Poland and France, and the DEA lists it as a drug of concern in the United States. ""We are seeing several indications that these THC-like substances could become a significant problem both domestically and internationally,"" Dearden says. She says the agency is in ""the preliminary stages of determining whether or not some or all of (synthetic substances) need to be controlled.""","K2 or Spice, when smoked, gives users a marijuana-like high .

"New York (CNN) -- A driver for Naomi Campbell told police that he was assaulted by the supermodel Tuesday, according to the New York Police Department. NYPD Deputy Commission of Public Information Paul Brown said Campbell left the scene of the alleged assault on Manhattan's East Side on foot. He said police were interested in speaking with her but did not know her whereabouts. Campbell's spokesman, Jeff Raymond, told CNN in a written statement, ""There shouldn't be a rush to judgment. Naomi will co-operate voluntarily, and there is more to the story than meets the eye."" Brown said the 27-year-old male driver pulled over about 3 p.m. in the vicinity of 58th Street and Second Avenue and reported to a traffic agent that he had been assaulted by Campbell. Campbell fled the scene while the traffic agent called for police, Brown said. The driver told officers that Campbell had struck him in the back of the neck and caused his head to hit the steering wheel, according to police. The driver, who was taken to a local precinct for questioning, had a small bruise and swelling under his right eye, according to police. The driver had been hired for the day to drive Campbell to a studio in Queens. Campbell, 39, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge in 2007, admitting she hit her former housekeeper with a cell phone in March of 2005. In 2000, she pleaded guilty to a 1998 charge of assault against an assistant. And in October 2006, she was arrested again, this time in London, for allegedly attacking her drug counselor. Last month Campbell admitted on CNN's Connect The World she had been working on controlling her anger after her recent outbursts. ""I took a lot of time out,"" she said. ""Everybody has their demons and I had to look in the mirror and face mine. ""Until I did that there was not going to be a change in my life. I didn't want to be the way I was. I'm a work in progress Every day is a new day ... every day I'm learning something new.

"London, England (CNN)  -- A British man who strangled his wife in his sleep while dreaming that she was an intruder walked free from court Friday after the case against him was withdrawn, prosecutors said. The UK's Crown Prosecution Service requested that the case against Brian Thomas, who killed wife Christine while they were on vacation in 2008, be dropped due to a ""unique set of circumstances."" Thomas, 59, of Neath, South Wales, had been on trial for murder at Swansea Crown Court, with prosecutors seeking a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity that would have resulted in psychiatric custody. But they said a closer study of evidence led them to believe the defendant should be released without further action. ""We have duty to keep cases under continuous review, and following expert evidence from a psychiatrist it was suggested no useful purpose would be served by Mr Thomas being detained and treated in a psychiatric hospital,"" prosecutor Iwan Jenkins said in a statement. Jenkins said that there had never been any doubt that Thomas caused his wife's death, but the prosecution accepted evidence from experts on sleep disorders that indicated he should not be convicted of murder or manslaughter. ""We therefore have offered no further evidence and asked the jury to return a simple verdict of not guilty."" The court erupted in shouts of ""yes"" as family members greeted the outcome with jubilation, according to the UK Press Association. ""The death of Christine Thomas was thoroughly investigated by Dyfed Powys Police. Investigations continued after Mr Thomas was charged and involved the instruction of experts in several fields,"" Jenkins said. ""I must emphasize that the circumstances of this case are almost unique in the UK and there have been fewer than 50 instances recorded worldwide. It is only because of highly sophisticated tests carried out by sleep experts that Mr Thomas's condition could be confirmed. ""Our thoughts remain with the family of Brian and Christine Thomas, who have remained dignified throughout this difficult time."" The brief trial, which opened Tuesday, heard that Thomas killed his wife while the pair were taking a camper van vacation in western Wales, PA reported. One night, Thomas -- who experts said may have been suffering worsening dreams due to withdrawal from anti-depressants -- experienced a violent nightmare in which he attacked and fought an intruder and got him in a headlock, only to wake and find he had strangled his wife. Dismissing the charges, High Court Judge Justice Davis described Thomas as a ""decent man and devoted husband"" who bore no responsibility for his wife's death, PA reported. Thomas's brother Raymond Thomas said the family were ""delighted"" by the outcome, the news agency said. ""He has always been a loving husband and a family man,"" he said. "" This was a tragic, tragic episode and we are all very emotional.""","Prosecutors described trial involving Brian Thomas as a ""unique case""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Power-driven wheelchairs are costing Medicare and its beneficiaries nearly four times what suppliers pay for them, and competitive bidding could have reduced those costs, according to an inspector general's report released Wednesday. Competitive bidding would have cut costs on a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the report says. A standard power wheelchair costs the federal health insurance program for seniors an average of $4,018 to lease, compared with $1,048 for suppliers to buy, the Department of Health and Human Services' internal watchdog reported. ""Medicare and its beneficiaries paid suppliers an average of $2,970 beyond the supplier's acquisition cost to perform an average of five services and cover general business costs,"" the report found. The difference was not as dramatic for more advanced wheelchairs used for physical rehabilitation patients, but at an average lease of $11,507, those chairs still cost Medicare about twice as much as the $5,880 paid by suppliers, the report found. More than 173,000 Medicare beneficiaries received power wheelchairs in the first half of 2007, at a cost of about $686 million, the report said. The cost could have been reduced considerably had Congress not delayed a planned system of competitive bidding for what Medicare classifies as ""durable medical equipment,"" such as wheelchairs and oxygen tanks, the report said. Competitive bidding would have cut Medicare's average cost of a standard power wheelchair by nearly $1,000, the inspector general found. ""Medicare and beneficiary payments under the Competitive Bidding Acquisition Program would have decreased by an average of 26 percent across all included categories of [durable medical equipment], saving up to an estimated $1 billion annually,"" the report found. ""However, Congress delayed the program and exempted complex rehabilitation power wheelchairs from future competitive bidding."" Medicare's annual budget for 2008 was $444 billion. In January, it cut its payments to suppliers by 9.5 percent to make up for what it thought competitive bidding would have saved taxpayers, according to the report. In July, a CNN investigation found that a patient and taxpayers were billed about $1,200 over four years for a nonmotorized chair, while a nearly identical chair could be bought from the same supplier for $349. The issue has become controversial as the Obama administration tries to overhaul the U.S. health care system and rein in the cost of Medicare. Administration officials want to require competitive bids for items such as wheelchairs. But the American Association for Homecare, which represents many in the durable equipment industry, said the bidding program would reduce patient choice, limit access to home medical care and drive up Medicare costs by requiring more hospital stays.","Watchdog report says competitive bidding could have reduced costs .

"(CNN) -- Human remains found buried under recently added concrete at a home in Plant City, Florida, are likely those of missing lottery millionaire Abraham Shakespeare, police said Thursday. Deputies made the discovery after a tip came in, suggesting investigators would find a body near a home in Plant City, according to CNN affiliate WFTV. Hillsborough County Sheriff David Gee said the body was slowly being uncovered. They are awaiting positive identification. However, Gee said their investigation and information specifically led them to the area after they began to believe he might be dead because of ""sinister means and motives."" ""Our indications were it would be there,"" Gee said during a news conference Thursday night. Police on Wednesday had scanned the newly finished concrete slabs near the home on Wednesday and removed it. On Thursday, Gee said they discovered the remains buried five feet below the surface, and it appeared the remains had been there for awhile. Shakespeare, a 43-year-old truck driver, won a $31 million Florida lottery prize in 2006. A year later, he won a court challenge from a fellow trucker who accused Shakespeare of snatching the winning ticket out of his wallet while the two were delivering meat to Miami restaurants. Shakespeare's family reported him missing on November 9, telling the Polk County sheriff's office they hadn't seen him since April. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said when their investigation began, they had hoped to find Shakespeare alive ""and he truly had just wanted to hide from those who were asking him for money."" ""As our investigation continued, the information we developed led us to believe he may very well have ended up with an untimely death,"" Judd said. Both Judd and Gee said they would not comment on whether anything else was found inside the manmade grave, or whether a previous person of interest was connected to the area. The home, according to WFTV,  belongs to the boyfriend of a person of interest in the disappearance of Shakespeare. While they await identification of the remains, police said they would begin to shift their focus to a murder investigation. ""It's painfully obvious he didn't get there by himself,"" Judd said. Gee said police from Polk and Hillsborough counties were already working with prosecutors on the case and hope to bring to justice the person responsible for what they believe is clearly cold-blooded murder. ""Somebody put that body in that hole,"" Gee said. ""This isn't by any means just where we find someone on the side of the road. Somebody has obviously put him there.""","Remains buried five feet below recently added concrete in Plant City, Florida .

"(CNN) -- An unexpected and sudden spotlight on the Special Olympics, an organization that for more than 40 years has served and honored those with intellectual disabilities, comes less than two weeks before the nonprofit launches a new campaign: Spread the Word to the End the Word. Special Olympics is running a campaign to stop the use of the ""R-word."" March 31 is being billed a ""national day of awareness,"" a call to Americans to recognize and rethink their use of the word ""retard,"" or as the organization would prefer, the ""R-word."" ""Most people don't think of this word as hate speech, but that's exactly what it feels like to millions of people with intellectual disabilities, their families and friends,"" a statement about the campaign reads. ""This word is just as cruel and offensive as any other slur."" The push for increased respect is being spearheaded by young people who are collecting pledges or vows to not use the word at http://www.r-word.org/, and are leading online discussions on how people can get involved in this cause. So far, across the country, 300 schools have already committed to hosting rallies on March 31, Special Olympics President and CEO J. Brady Lum said. An aggressive print and online campaign, targeting people ages 18 to 30, will follow, said Kirsten Suto Seckler, who directs the organization's global brand marketing and awareness. The ads designed by BBDO New York, will challenge the public -- with language meant to raise eyebrows -- to think about the issue more deeply. The campaign uses slurs against Asians, homosexuals, Jews and African-Americans to make the point that language can be harmful to all groups, including people with intellectual disabilities. Attention on the Special Olympics skyrocketed Thursday when, in a quick and clearly unscripted moment, President Obama exhibited the power of words during his history-making visit with Jay Leno.  Watch Suzanne Malveaux's look at Obama's Tonight Show appearance » . While joking on The Tonight Show about his bowling prowess (during last year's campaign trail he shamefully scored 37 in a game), Obama said he'd been practicing at the White House. He told Leno that he bowled 129 in the White House bowling alley and said his bowling skills are ""like Special Olympics or something."" The comment during the taping of the show prompted Obama to pick up the phone on Air Force One and call Special Olympics Chairman Timothy Shriver to preemptively apologize for the remark before it hit television screens. He also reportedly invited Special Olympic athletes to Pennsylvania Avenue to hit the lanes and give him tips or shoot some hoops. The president ""expressed his heartfelt and sincere commitment to work with our athletes and make this country a more accepting place for people with special needs,"" Lum, the organization's president, said. What Obama said on The Tonight Show adds to the discussion that's needed to raise awareness and has proven ""an incredibly important and seriously teachable moment,"" Lum said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates will unveil the Pentagon's plan to prepare for repealing the controversial ""don't ask, don't tell"" law regarding gay soldiers at a committee hearing Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesman said. ""The Defense Department leadership is actively working on an implementation plan and the secretary will have more to say about this next week,"" Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said on Thursday. President Obama said in his first State of the Union address Wednesday night that he would work with Congress and the Pentagon this year to repeal the law that prohibits military members from acknowledging openly that they are gay. According to the Senate Web site, the Senate Armed Services Committee has scheduled an hour to discuss the issue at Tuesday's hearing on the fiscal year 2011 defense budget, which Gates will attend. The committee revised its schedule for the hearing, announcing that Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen will testify on the budget, as planned, as well as the ""don't ask, don't tell"" issue. Gates and Mullen are not expected to offer a specific legislative proposal to repeal the law, but rather to detail some of the preliminary steps that need to be taken inside the military in advance of formulating a legislative plan. Gates will discuss options for more ""humanely"" implementing the current ban, for example, according to a senior Pentagon official. The secretary asked his general counsel's office for options six months ago including how to possibly not expel personnel whose homosexuality is revealed by third parties, the source said. The 1993 law bars gay men and lesbians in the military from revealing their sexual orientation, and prevents the military from asking about it. Another military official familiar with the discussion said some of the issues to be considered include the cost of implementing a new policy, benefits for gay spouses, potential hate crimes, and even logistical questions such as the possible need to renovate barracks to separate straight and gay troops. According to the official, the idea of separate housing or showers was not considered a serious possibility, but would be discussed in order to rule it out. Previously, Gates has said the transition from the existing law should be done gradually and ""very, very carefully."" ""The president has been clear about where he wants to go and what he thinks needs to be done,"" Gates said in April at the Army War College when asked about changing the law. ""But I think that he is approaching this in a deliberate and cautious manner, so that if we do go down that road, we do it right and we do it in a way that mitigates any downsides, problems that might be associated with it."" At least one member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- Gen. James Conway, commandant of the Marine Corps -- has expressed reservations in the past about repealing the law. In November, Conway said through a spokesman: ""Our Marines are currently engaged in two fights, and our focus should not be drawn away from those priorities."" Some Congressional opposition already is clear. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, a former Navy pilot, released a statement after Wednesday night's State of the Union address saying ""it would be a mistake"" to repeal the law. ""This successful policy has been in effect for over 15 years, and it is well understood and predominantly supported by our military at all levels,"" McCain's statement said, later adding: ""At a time when our Armed Forces are fighting and sacrificing on the battlefield, now is not the time to abandon the policy."" Others support the change. Gen. John Shalikashvili, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said it was time to repeal the law. ""As a nation built on the principal of equality, we should recognize and welcome change that will build a stronger more cohesive military,"" Shalikashvili said in a letter sent to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, who supports repealing the policy. The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an organization that works with those affected by the ""don't ask, don't tell"" law, praised Obama's call for repeal. ""We very much need a sense of urgency to get this done in 2010,"" the group said, later adding: ""The American public, including conservatives, is overwhelmingly with the commander in chief on this one.""","President has called on Congress to repeal policy on gays in military .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Two British men were convicted Thursday of torturing and killing two French students in London last June, London's Metropolitan Police said. Gabriel Ferez (left) and Laurent Bonomo were graduate biochemistry students at London's Imperial College. Nigel Farmer, 34, and Daniel ""Dano"" Sonnex, 23, were also found guilty of arson, false imprisonment and burglary. The bodies of Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, both 23, were found in Bonomo's burned apartment in southeast London last summer. Ferez's mother, Francoise Villemont, told the judge that her son's killing was ""indescribable and inexcusable."" ""No human being deserves such a death,"" she said. ""My life stopped on the 29th June 2008. I feel battered and bruised as a mother forever scarred."" The lead detective in the case, Mick Duthie, said at the time that the two had fallen victim to a ""frenzied, brutal, horrific attack."" During a five-week trial, the jury heard details of how the two students were tied up for hours, tortured for their credit-card personal identification numbers and repeatedly stabbed in an early morning attack June 29, 2008. Farmer went back to the apartment that night and set fire to it in an attempt to destroy the evidence, police said. Emergency services were called to the address after neighbors heard an explosion and saw flames leaping from the premises. Investigators initially believed the French men died in the fire, but an autopsy showed each had been stabbed dozens of times in the head, neck and torso -- 196 times, in Bonomo's case and 47 times for Ferez. Police believe they were bound during the assault and an accelerant was used to start the fire after they were killed. Hand-held Sony portable games, mobile phones and credit cards were missing, police said. Bonomo's card was used to withdraw £360 (about $580) in seven transactions. A bank machine seized Ferez's card when someone tried to use it. Farmer turned himself in to police in the early hours of July 7, 2008, ""demanding to be seen and claiming to have committed a double murder. After hospital treatment, he was questioned for three days but chose to say nothing to police,"" Duthie said. Police appealed to the public for tips, prompting someone to name Sonnex as someone ""with a propensity to use violence and whose family lived very close by,"" the police said in a statement. Farmer and Sonnex were arrested in July. Bonomo's father, Guy Bonomo, said he is ""tormented"" by images of his son's suffering. ""Not only have you taken Laurent's life, you've taken my heart and soul,"" he told Farmer and Sonnex. ""I wish from the bottom of my heart that you will stay in prison for the rest of your lives. I can't bear to think that someone so evil will walk the streets again, that my daughter or a member of my family could encounter you again."" In court, each blamed the other for killing the two men, police said. ""Throughout the case, neither has had the decency or courage to admit any part in the fatal assault on the two students with both men telling different stories and ultimately blaming each other,"" Duthie said. ""I'm sad to say that we have not yet heard what did happen that early morning."" The two men are due to be sentenced later Wednesday. The victims were biochemistry graduate students on a three-month course at Imperial College, London, studying genetic developments. They were planning to return to France in July.","Daniel Sonnex, Nigel Farmer convicted of killing Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ten Americans detained last week while trying to take 33 Haitian children out of the country were charged Thursday with kidnapping children and criminal association, a government official said. Information Minister Marie Laurence Lassegue's announcement came shortly after the five men and five women left a hearing at the prosecutor's office. Under Haitian law, anyone accused of kidnapping a child is not eligible for bail, the attorney general's office said. Conviction on the kidnapping charge carries a maximum penalty of life in prison; the criminal association charge carries a penalty of three to nine years, according to a former justice minister. Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Thursday night that the judge in the case has three months to decide whether to prosecute. ""We hope that he will decide long before those three months,"" he said. ""He can release them, he can ask to prosecute them."" If a decision is made to prosecute, the case would be heard before a jury, he said. Told that the families of the detained Americans had pleaded for him to intervene, Bellerive said he could not. ""Those people are not in the hands of the government; they are in the hands of justice,"" he said. ""We have to respect the law. It is clear that the people violated the law. What we have to understand is if they did it in good faith."" Bellerive said the Haitian government was open to the possibility of the case being transferred to a U.S. court but said the request would have to come from the United States. ""Until now, I was not asked,"" he said. He expressed gratitude for the work of the vast majority of Americans who have helped in the aftermath of the January 12 earthquake that he said killed at least 212,000 people. The Americans were turned back Friday as they tried to take the children across the border into the Dominican Republic without proper documentation. They said they were going to house them in a converted hotel in that country and later move them to an orphanage they were building there. ""We can confirm that the 10 American citizens remain in custody in Haiti,"" said State Department deputy spokesman Gordon Duguid. ""We continue to provide appropriate consular assistance and to monitor developments in the legal case."" The Americans have said they were just trying to help the children leave the earthquake-stricken country. Some of the detained Americans have said they thought they were helping orphans, but their interpreters said Wednesday that they were present when group members spoke with the children's parents. Some parents in a village outside Port-au-Prince said they had willingly given their children over to the Americans, who promised them a better life and who said they could see their children whenever they wanted to. Government approval is needed for any Haitian child to leave the country, and the group acknowledged that the children had no passports. Some members of the group belong to the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho. One of the church's ministers asked for privacy and would not discuss the matter.

"(CNN) -- Authorities in Cleveland, Ohio, brought in cadaver dogs Wednesday to search the childhood home of a registered sex offender accused in the deaths of 11 women. ""We're just trying to cover all our bases,"" said Scott Wilson, spokesman for the FBI, which is assisting local detectives in the case. Anthony Sowell, 50, was arrested in October after authorities serving a search warrant in a rape case discovered six bodies in and around his current home. Subsequent searches turned up five more bodies, all African-American women. Authorities have said they are looking at the unsolved murders of three women in East Cleveland to determine whether they share any similarities with the remains found at Sowell's home. Wednesday's search comes a day after Sowell was indicted on 85 counts -- including aggravated murder, rape and kidnapping -- in the killings. In addition, Sowell is charged with ""brutalizing"" three other women and raping two of them, Cuyahoga County prosecutor Bill Mason said Tuesday. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty against Sowell, Mason said. He is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday. Sowell is now charged with 11 counts of aggravated murder with a ""mass murder specification,"" meaning multiple people were killed in a similar fashion, Mason said. He also is charged with abuse of a corpse, kidnapping and tampering with evidence. The indictment also alleges that Sowell assaulted women on December 8, 2008, and on September 22 and October 20 of this year. The September and October victims were raped, and the other woman was punched and choked before she escaped, Mason said. Sowell's charges in those incidents include attempted murder, rape or attempted rape, kidnapping, robbery and felonious assault. Sowell already faced charges in the September 22 rape and has pleaded not guilty. On October 20, neighbors reported seeing a naked woman fall from the second floor of his house. Firefighters responded and later notified police. But the woman told officers that she fell off the roof while she was at the home ""partying,"" police said earlier. No charges were filed at the time. Sowell threatened his victims and warned them not to contact police, Mason said. It's possible there are other victims, he added, and urged anyone who has not come forward to do so. Sowell ""knew what he was doing was wrong at the time he was doing it,"" the prosecutor said. As of last month, Sowell was on suicide watch at the request of his public defender, Kathleen DeMetz. She had said a psychiatric evaluation had been ordered but was unlikely to happen until after an indictment was filed. Cuyahoga County Sheriff Bob Reid said Tuesday that Sowell has been a ""model prisoner,"" is kept in an isolated unit and has declined visitation requests. Most of the victims were strangled by ligature -- which could include a string, cord or wire -- and at least one was strangled by hand, officials said. Seven still had ligatures wrapped around their necks. All that has been found of one woman is a skull that was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home's basement. Sowell served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape and was released in 2005. He was required to register as a sex offender. After the 11 victims were found, police used thermal imaging in mid-November in an attempt to see whether any additional human remains were on the property, and they dug certain areas by hand. No more were found.","Police ""trying to cover all our bases"" at Anthony Sowell's childhood home .

"New York (CNN) -- A jury has begun deliberating in the case of a Pakistani scientist accused of trying to kill U.S. officers. The jury began deliberating Monday in the trial of Aafia Siddiqui, who is charged with attempted murder and assault for allegedly shooting at U.S. officers while she was in Afghan custody. She allegedly shot at two FBI special agents, a U.S. Army warrant officer, an Army captain and military interpreters while she was being held unsecured at an Afghan facility on July 18, 2008. Authorities said Siddiqui was behind a curtain and fired two shots at the personnel with an officer's rifle, hitting no one. The warrant officer returned fire with a pistol, hitting Siddiqui at least once . Afghan police had arrested her a day earlier outside the Ghazni governor's compound after finding her with bomb-making instructions, excerpts from the ""Anarchist's Arsenal,"" papers with descriptions of U.S. landmarks, and substances sealed in bottles and glass jars, according to a September 2008 indictment. The indictment said Siddiqui had ""handwritten notes that referred to a 'mass casualty attack'"" listing several locations in the United States, and ""construction of 'dirty bombs.'"" The notes also ""discussed various ways to attack 'enemies,' including by destroying reconnaissance drones, using underwater bombs, and using gliders,"" the indictment said. ""Siddiqui also possessed a computer thumb drive that contained correspondence referring to specific 'cells,' 'attacks' by certain 'cells,' and 'enemies,'"" the indictment said. ""Other documents on the thumb drive discussed recruitment and training."" Siddiqui -- whom the FBI had sought for several years for suspected ties to al Qaeda -- was extradited to the United States in August 2008. Since 2003, the whereabouts of Siddiqui -- an American-educated neuroscientist -- had been the source of much speculation. According to Amnesty International, Siddiqui and her three small children were reported apprehended in Karachi, Pakistan, in March 2003, shortly after the FBI issued an alert requesting information about her location. Several reports indicated that Siddiqui was in U.S. custody after her arrest in Karachi. But in May 2004, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller identified Siddiqui as being among several sought-after al Qaeda members.","Aafia Siddiqui is charged with shooting at U.S. officers while she was in Afghan custody .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama proposed nearly doubling the child care tax credit for middle-class families Monday, the latest administration initiative meant to reassure Americans nervous about the slow pace of the economic recovery. The proposal is one of five new recommendations from the president's Middle Class Task Force, which was established one year ago this week. It comes as an increasingly populist White House struggles to regain the political advantage among swing independent voters who have flocked to the GOP in recent elections in Massachusetts, New Jersey and Virginia. ""The middle class has been under assault for a long time,"" Obama said in remarks delivered near the White House. ""None of these steps alone will solve all the challenges facing the middle class,"" he said. ""But hopefully, [they] will re-establish some of the security that's slipped away in recent years."" Specifically, Obama will push to increase the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit rate from 20 percent to 35 percent for families making under $85,000 a year. Families making from $85,000 to $115,000 also would see an increase in their tax credit, the statement said. At the same time, lower-income families would receive a $1.6 billion increase in child care funding, the largest one-year increase in two decades. In addition, the White House will propose limiting federal student loan payments to 10 percent of a student's income above a basic living allowance. The administration also will push for the creation of a system of automatic workplace individual retirement accounts, requiring all employers to give workers the option of enrolling in a direct-deposit IRA. The ""saver's tax credit"" would be expanded, with a government match of 50 percent of the first $1,000 of contributions for families making $65,000 or less. Fourth, the White House will propose expanding tax credits to match retirement savings, while also enacting new safeguards to protect retirement savings. Fifth, the administration will push to expand federal support for families caring for elderly relatives, ""helping them manage their multiple responsibilities and allowing seniors to live in the community for as long as possible,"" a White House official said. Since its establishment, the Middle Class Task Force has held 11 meetings around the country and at the White House, according to the statement. All five task force recommendations will be included in Obama's proposed fiscal year 2011 budget, which is set to be unveiled February 1. The president is also widely expected to stress middle-class economic themes in Wednesday's State of the Union address. CNN's Suzanne Malveaux contributed to this report.","Plan is one of five Middle Class Task Force recommendations .

"Vancouver, British Columbia (CNN) -- Thousands of Canadians turned the streets of Vancouver into rivers of red on Sunday in jubilant celebration of the country's Olympic gold-medal win in men's ice hockey. Canada defeated the United States 3-2 in overtime, with national hero Sidney Crosby scoring the winning goal in the hard-fought game. The win capped off a historic Winter Olympics for the host nation just hours before the closing ceremonies. The country took home a record 14 gold medals -- the most in Winter Olympics history. Fans spilled out of the exits at Canada Hockey Place after the medal ceremony, ""clanging cowbells and screaming like madmen,"" according to Sports Illustrated's Luke Winn. ""I'll remember this day for the rest of my life as will all Canadians who are here tonight,"" one fan at a Vancouver viewing told CNN affiliate CTV in Canada. Watch fans celebrate in a sea of red and white . Police told liquor stores in Vancouver to close early at 2 p.m. -- about an hour before the game ended -- ahead of the celebrations. Lines of people were seen at one store 30 minutes before the game even started. In Toronto, officials were forced to close down streets due to swelling masses of revelers waving Canadian flags and standing shoulder-to-shoulder in some of the city's main intersections, video showed. And in downtown Vancouver, people swamped the city's main Robson Square. Strangers high-fived each other in the street and fans were seen jumping onto cars, hugging each other, singing the country's national anthem and chanting ""Ole!"" and ""This is our game."" The celebrations were the culmination of a Winter Games that got off to a rocky start, with warmer-than-usual weather that forced delays in some early contests, and the death of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili during a training run hours before the opening ceremony. The feeling of celebration and resiliency was being carried into the night's closing ceremonies. Canadian figure skater Joannie Rochette -- whose mother died of a heart attack just days before her bronze-medal-winning performances -- was set to carry the nation's flag before thousands in attendance at BC Place.

"(The Frisky) -- The new year is a time for taking stock, a time for looking back and learning as well as looking ahead towards a richer future, secure in knowing that the lessons we've learned this past year will help us lead a better life in the next. Obviously, there is no better source for these life lessons than within the annals of celebrity gossip. Celebrities are richer than us, prettier than us, and -- with rare exception -- skinnier than us. We watch them onscreen and/or listen to their songs -- why shouldn't we learn from their mistakes? Sadly for them, 2009 was a rough year for famous people in relationships. There were more breakups than there were deaths! But luckily for us, there are valuable nuggets of knowledge contained within almost every celebrity split. You aren't going to love the same guy at 30 that you did at 13. Susie Sprague reportedly had the hots for Corey Feldman since she was a wee child mooning over ""Goonies."" And while Corey had been an adorable little moppet, his grown-up years were filled with drugs, 12-step programs, and reality TV. Five years and one kid into their marriage, Susie wised up and ditched her Lost Boy.

"(CNN) -- Remember ""You're money, baby""? Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau making the L.A. bar scene in ""Swingers"" back in 1996? In the film, couples go to the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal on relationship counseling. They were young and hungry then, and there was insolence in their hustle, but at least they pressed their case: They knew they were sharp enough to be players. Since then, Favreau has gone on to direct blockbusters like ""Elf"" and ""Iron Man,"" and his buddy Vaughn has stacked up a string of hits in the company of Frat Packers Will Ferrell, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. Well, they're not hungry anymore, and not so young either. Between them (and with an assist from Dana ""What Happens in Vegas"" Fox), they have cooked up ""Couples Retreat,"" a marriage comedy that coincidentally doubles as an enviable excuse for an extended shoot in Bora Bora.  Watch the stars talk about the shoot » . That's the tropical location of the Eden Resort, which is offering a great package deal for married couples looking for relationship counseling. Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell) want to give it a shot, and persuade their supposedly happily married friends Dave and Ronnie (Vaughn and Malin Akerman), Joey and Lucy (Favreau and Kristin Davis), and Shane and his 20-year-old girlfriend Trudy (Faizon Love and Kali Hawk) to join in the fun. Apparently, nobody has trouble raising the fare, even in these recessionary times. Once there, however, they are dismayed to find Eden is run with iron discipline, and the mandatory therapy sessions soon expose serious cracks in each of the relationships. Directed by Peter ""A Christmas Story"" Billingsley -- another old friend of Vaughn's -- ""Couples Retreat"" can't decide if it's satirizing New Age-y therapies or exploring marital breakdown. So it gives us a little of both, with some sub-Apatow sex humor on the side. As a commercial recipe, that's fine. America's ticket buyers have shown time and again they're desperate for a laugh and willing to overlook widespread mediocrity to get it. But you might hope for something a bit less lazy from this team. And shouldn't a movie with ""Couples"" in the title be less lopsided in its approach to the sexes? I guess in contrast to such boys-will-be-boys romps as ""The Hangover"" and ""Wild Hogs,"" at least this time the wives get to come along, not that any of them has much to say for herself. Trudy wants to party. Lucy has eyes for the yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce). Ronnie wants some romance. And Cynthia ... I don't know what Cynthia wants, but getting away from her control freak husband certainly seems like the way to go. The guys are noticeably chubbier, but equally one-dimensional. It's just that that dimension enjoys rather more screen time as Billingsley indulges Vaughn and Favreau's less-than-inspired improvisational riffs on marital frustration, machismo and middle-age spread. We even have to endure a Guitar Hero duel. For a movie made by a bunch of friends, it's strange that we don't get any sense of how or why these couples hang out together. But so long as there's a pretentious Frenchman to scoff at, an officious Brit and a sexy Hispanic, at least they're united by what they're not. Whether by accident or design, ""Couples Retreat"" does such a good job exposing what selfish, insensitive jerks these guys are, the contrived and conventional ending actually has a feel-bad undertow. You've got to suspect that back home in suburbia, these couples are doomed to live unhappily ever after.

"(CNN) -- A California man sold his 14-year-old daughter to an 18-year-old man for cash, beer and meat -- then called police when the prospective bridegroom didn't live up to his end of the deal, authorities said Tuesday. Marcelino de Jesus Martinez faces felony charges, according to police in Greenfield, California. Marcelino de Jesus Martinez, 36, of Greenfield, California, was arrested Monday and booked into the Monterey County Jail, Greenfield police said in a statement. He faces felony charges of receiving money for causing a person to cohabitate, police said. Martinez had arranged through a third party to have his daughter marry the older teenager, identified by authorities as Margarito de Jesus Galindo, of Gonzales, California. In exchange, Galindo was to pay Martinez $16,000 and provide him with 160 cases of beer, 100 cases of soda, 50 cases of Gatorade, two cases of wine, and six cases of meat, Greenfield Police Chief Joe Grebmeier told CNN. All those involved in the case are from the western Mexican state of Oaxaca, the police chief said. In the Oaxacan community, such an agreement is ""normal and honorable,"" he said. ""In California, it's against the law.""  Watch for a list of the groceries dad reportedly wanted » . In Oaxacan culture, the food and beverages are provided by a prospective bridegroom for the wedding, Grebmeier said. Authorities believe the young girl went with Galindo willingly, and no coercion was involved, he said. However, the girl is four years younger than California's age of consent, although the law does allow 16-year-olds to marry with parental consent. ""The 14-year-old juvenile moved in with Galindo and when payments were not received, the father, Martinez, called Greenfield PD to bring back the daughter,"" according to a written police statement. The girl was reported as a runaway juvenile on December 18, Grebmeier said, and police took a missing-persons report and put out a flier. But ""as we investigated, it started to develop into something that may not have been a runaway,"" he said, and police began to believe Martinez wanted them to bring back his daughter, since he had received no payment. On January 2, Galindo and the girl returned from a trip to Soledad, a town a few miles north of Greenfield, and were interviewed. Police learned the couple had never married, but had engaged in sexual relations, Grebmeier said. Galindo and Martinez were neighbors at an apartment complex and were apparently from the same area in Mexico, the police chief said. A third party was brokering the marriage deal, he said, and is cooperating with authorities. But the young couple apparently left for Soledad before the negotiations were complete. Martinez was arrested Sunday after undergoing additional questioning by police, Grebmeier said. He remained jailed Tuesday. Galindo was cited for statutory rape and released, Grebmeier said. The girl was returned to her family, he said, as authorities believe she is in no danger. However, police reported the case to child protection officials. The Greenfield area has had a large influx of Oaxacans. A presentation on understanding Oaxacan culture is posted on the Greenfield police Web site. ""Arranged marriages are common in several cultures, and this is not an issue among consenting adults over the age of 18,"" police said in the statement. ""But California has several laws regarding minors, the age of consent and human trafficking."" Police are trying to be culturally sensitive, Grebmeier told CNN, but ""when I'm in Mexico, I have to respect Mexican laws. When you're in the United States, you have to respect United States laws. That's the bottom line."" He said he wanted to send a message to immigrant communities that such behavior is unacceptable. He said his department has long heard rumors of children as young as 12 being sold or offered for sale. The Greenfield police statement said arranged marriages between young girls and older men ""have become a local problem."" Greenfield is about 140 miles southeast of San Francisco.","Third party set up marriage between 14-year-old girl and 18-year-old man, police say .

"TAIJI, Japan (CNN) -- Mention a dolphin to someone in the United States and they'll think about a trip to Sea World or the 1960s-era TV program ""Flipper."" Residents in Taiji, Japan, have been hunting dolphins for hundreds of years. Talk about a dolphin in rural Japan and some people think of dinner. Fishermen hunt dolphins about every day in Taiji, a town of about 3,000 in southwestern Japan that juts into the Pacific Ocean. Locals know they offend Western sensibilities by eating dolphins, but they say it's a tradition hundreds of years old. And they say outsiders have no more right to tell them to stop eating dolphins than they would have to demand that Westerners stop slaughtering, say, chickens or cows.  Watch fishermen catch dolphins » . ""I know there are many different ways of thinking in different societies, but for us who've been eating this for a long time ... it's an awkward thing to be criticized for,"" says Kayoko Tanaka, a retired middle school teacher. ""I either fry dolphin meat or turn it into a stew."" That disgusts Ric O'Barry, a 68-year-old retired dolphin trainer from Miami who makes a second home in Taiji, where he goes to unusual lengths to fight against the tide of local tradition. O'Barry sometimes dresses as a woman or wears a large surgical mask to disguise his Western identity on trips to spots overlooking the ocean. He prowls the cliffs with a video camera, hoping to catch fishermen in the act with footage that could stir emotions and raise awareness in the West. ""This here is ground zero for the largest slaughter of dolphins on planet Earth,"" says O'Barry, who trained five dolphins to play ""Flipper"" on the TV series of that name. ""It's absolutely barbaric and it needs to stop."" He says the dolphins face a cruel fate. ""It takes a very long time to die. They bleed to death. And some of them are dragged in the boats with hooks while they're still alive,"" he says. ""Many of them are gutted while they're still alive."" Looming beyond questions of whether the slaughter is humane, however, are larger and more complex questions of culture and perspective. To some puzzled people in rural Japan, the question comes down to this: What's the difference between killing and eating a dolphin and killing and eating a fish? Or a chicken? Or a cow? Most Japanese do not eat dolphins -- it's common in a few small fishing villages -- but the government respects the rights of people in towns like Taiji, says Joji Morishita, the international negotiator for Japan's Fisheries Agency. Many Japanese consider the deer a sacred messenger from the gods, he says, but they would never suggest that people in other parts of the world stop venturing into the woods on a quest for venison, Morishita says. ""We don't like to play God to say this animal is just for food and this is not,"" he says. ""Because we know nation to nation we have totally different ideas."" That's obvious in the growing clash between Australia and Japan over whale hunting. Japanese ships crisscross the Antarctic Ocean each winter to capture and kill up to 1,000 whales. Whaling is allowed under international law when done for scientific reasons, which Japan cites as the legal basis for its hunts. Legal justifications aside, however, the whale hunts offend many people in Australia, where new Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has turned up the political pressure on Japan. His government has dispatched a customs ship to monitor and videotape the whalers. And Rudd says Australia could even file charges against Japan in an international court to try to stop the whaling. Back in Taiji, the fishermen are well aware of the Western sentiment that motivates whaling opponents. They realize the danger to their way of life that can come with prying cameras from other countries. When CNN trained its cameras on fishermen gutting some freshly killed dolphins, the fishermen erected some tarps to obstruct the view. Representatives of the Taiji Fishermen's Union declined CNN requests for an on-camera interview. So did the town's mayor and several others. And O'Barry says he's gotten into a few shouting matches with fishermen, who resent him and his camera. So what does O'Barry say to their claim that he has no right to tell them to abandon a tradition that has flourished in their small corner of the world for more than 400 years? ""If someone came to my hometown and told me what to do, what to eat, I'd be outraged,"" he says. ""But that's not going to stop me from doing it. I mean, tradition? It used to be traditional for women not to vote. So do we keep that going because it's traditional and cultural? Of course not."" Complicating the debate are findings suggesting that eating dolphins may not be good for one's health. The Japanese government said in 2005 that bottlenose dolphin meat contains 12 times more mercury than blue fin tuna -- high levels of mercury in fish can cause health problems in pregnant women and young children. A city councilman in Taiji, Junichiro Yamashita, grew so concerned about mercury levels that he persuaded locals schools to stop serving dolphin meat at lunch. He even plucked some of his hair, sent it off for testing and discovered that it contained seven times as much mercury as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. The mercury findings have not swayed Masaru Matsushita, a Taiji fish dealer. He says that dolphin activists like O'Barry only see their needs without understanding the culture in his town. ""I understand that they think the dolphin in a cute animal, and I agree they're cute doing performances,"" he says, ""but it is our culture to eat dolphins.""

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN)    -- Thousands of protesters battled riot police in downtown Seoul early Sunday morning after a rally opposing South Korea's decision to import U.S. beef turned violent. More than 100 were wounded, the state news agency reported. Police use a water cannon to disperse protesters during a rally against U.S. beef imports in Seoul on Sunday. Clashes broke out after more than 15,000 protesters headed toward the presidential office, news agency Yonhap said. The demonstrators used ropes to pull down police buses that had been parked around the presidential office to block the marchers from entering. Many carried steel pipes and hurled rocks at officers. Police fired back with water cannons and fire extinguishers. South Koreans have protested regularly since April when the government announced it would resume importing beef from the United States after a five-year ban. That ban was instituted over a case of mad cow disease in 2003.  Watch police and protesters battle in streets » . The widespread public protests essentially paralyzed the government of President Lee Myung-bak, who replaced seven top aides this month and plans to reshuffle his cabinet. After a series of negotiations, Seoul and Washington came up with a revised agreement on June 21 -- one that limits imports to cattle less than 30 months old. Animals more than 30 months old are considered at a greater risk for mad cow disease, which can be transmitted to humans. The revised agreement also excludes the import of certain parts believed more susceptible to mad cow disease. The initial deal would have allowed the import of all U.S. beef imports. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during a visit to visit to Seoul as part of an Asian tour, emphasized Saturday that American beef is safe and that her government will continue efforts to win consumer confidence. The assurance did little to placate demonstrators who took to the streets late Saturday night, leading to the latest riots. Scientists believe mad cow disease spreads when farmers feed cattle recycled meat and bones from infected animals. The U.S. banned recycled feeds in 1997. Eating meat products contaminated with the illness has been linked to variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare and fatal malady in humans. Until the 2003 ban, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. The U.S. beef industry has lost up to $4 billion since the market closed, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. The imports are expected to resume this month.","About 15,000 people stage street demonstration in Seoul .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States has committed an additional million dollars to fight child trafficking in Haiti in the wake of last month's earthquake, U.S. officials said Wednesday. Word of the action came as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton chaired the Obama administration's first meeting of the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons. Clinton, speaking in the meeting, called trafficking in people ""one of the most important human rights issues we deal with."" Yearly meetings of the task force were mandated by the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, passed 10 years ago. Before the earthquake, the United States provided $500,000 for programs to protect children in Haiti from trafficking. The additional million is being shifted from other programs, officials said. In a briefing at the State Department, Ambassador Louis CdeBaca of the department's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons told reporters that traffickers take advantage of vulnerabilities resulting from race, class, migratory status and displacement from natural disasters. On Haiti, he said, ""we are hearing anecdotal evidence from UNICEF"" about trafficking of children but there are no firm figures on it. ""We are hearing about men coming into the camps offering food and water to girls to come with them in trucks,"" he said, adding that ""we don't have hard evidence"" on this. Before the earthquake, he said, there were 300,000 ""restaveks,"" children given up by their families for domestic servitude, in Haiti. Another 3,000 were estimated to have been taken to the Dominican Republic. He added that according to estimates by the International Labour Organization, 12.3 million people worldwide are ""laboring in bondage."" Other estimates, he said, put that number at 27 million, although there is no independent confirmation. More than half of them, as much as 60 percent, are females, he said. Nine million to 10 million are forced laborers, and 2 million to 3 million are in sexual slavery, he added.","Before the earthquake, the U.S. provided $500,000 for to protect Haitian children from trafficking .

"DOVER AIR FORCE BASE, Delaware (CNN) -- His name was Phillip A. Myers. A staff sergeant in the U.S. Air Force, he was killed in a roadside bombing in Afghanistan on Saturday. The body of Phillip Myers, 30, arrived at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Sunday. The return of his body to the United States aboard a charter aircraft Sunday marked a solemn moment that has been repeated more than 5,000 times at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware since the start of the war in Afghanistan in late 2001. Much of this night was like so many of the others: The well-practiced and crisp movement of the carry team silently transferring the body from the plane to the truck that would transport it to the base mortuary and the presence of Myers' family, quietly watching every step and order, ensured dignity and respect for the fallen in an atmosphere that does not lend itself to peace and quiet. This night, however, was not like the other nights. Watching all of this were about 40 journalists allowed to cover the return of Myers' remains. It was the first time in almost 20 years the return of a fallen U.S. service member was able to be recorded by the media. Myers' widow was the first to be asked by the military, under a new policy by Defense Secretary Robert Gates, if she wished to have news media at Dover Air Force Base for her husband's final return home. Her decision to do so was historical and allowed the public to see a side of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq the country has not yet seen. The only noise on the flight line was the perpetual whine of the Atlas Air 747's power generator. This was the plane that had brought Myers and another fallen soldier back to the United States. The media were not allowed to cover the other soldier's transfer and were not given his name or the circumstances of his death, because the family had not granted permission. On the flight line, journalists were asked not to speak, use camera flashes or make undue movement while watching the transfer. With cameras rolling, an eight-member carry team wearing battle-dress uniforms and white gloves stood by the flag-draped transfer case carrying Myers, as the chaplain, Maj. Klabens Noel, said a prayer.  Watch the coverage of the return of the fallen service member » . The team slowly moved the transfer case from the aircraft onto the loader. With a jolt, the quiet of the night was shattered as a diesel engine was started to lower the loader toward the ground and then was shut off. Bathed in light from the giant floodlights along the flight line, the team hoisted the transfer case and carried it to a waiting panel truck. As the transfer case was secured, the carry team saluted, the doors of the truck were slowly closed and then driven under police escort to the base mortuary. Seven family members watched the truck until it was out of sight, one man among them crying into a tissue. Myers was from Hopewell, Virginia, and died Saturday of wounds suffered in a roadside bombing, the Air Force said. He was assigned to the 48th Civil Engineer Squadron, with the Royal Air Force Lakenheath, UK, and in March 2008 received the Bronze Star for valor. He was 30 years old. Casualties: Afghanistan | Iraq . The ban on media coverage of returning war dead was implemented by President George Bush in 1991 and the policy has been the subject of much debate since. Some called it censorship; others said it allowed privacy and respect for the families during a very difficult time.  Watch an Army widow call the policy is 'dignified' » . An exception on the ban by President Bill Clinton in 2000 allowed coverage of the return of sailors killed in the attack on the USS Cole. Shortly after taking office, President Obama asked Gates to take a look at the policy. In February, Gates reversed it, but with conditions. Family members would be asked if they wanted news media to cover the transfer of their loved one's body. iReport.com: What do you think about this decision? Service members' support groups had mixed opinions on the change. Some welcomed the change to show the human cost of war, and others opposed it. ""We are committed to seeing that America's fallen heroes are received back to their loved ones and their country with the honor, respect and recognition that they and their families have earned,"" Gates said after his decision. ""The overriding principle is that decisions about media coverage should be made by those most affected: the families,"" he said.","Media on hand for first time in almost 20 years as fallen service member returns .

"(CNN) -- Travelers across the United States arrived en masse at airports, hit the roads and boarded trains Wednesday, a day before the Thanksgiving holiday. ""It's actually surprisingly not as much of a disaster as I thought it was going to be,"" said Rafi Samuels-Schwartz, 25, who was waiting at New Jersey's Newark International Airport to board a plane to Minneapolis, Minnesota -- a flight that was on time, he added. ""It wasn't pandemonium, it wasn't a scene from 'Independence Day,' "" he said. ""I thought it was going to be considerably worse."" The number of people traveling this holiday weekend is expected to increase slightly, compared with last year, although the number traveling by air is expected to decline, according to the American Automobile Association, a motorist and traveler organization. The AAA, which surveyed 1,350 American households, projects that 38.4 million people will travel over the holiday weekend, up from 37.8 million last year. However, the number traveling by air is expected to decline to 2.3 million, the automobile association said. In 2008, 2.5 million people traveled by plane for Thanksgiving. See the FAA's flight delays map . AAA said the slight increase in the number of Thanksgiving travelers from last year reflects improved consumer confidence as well as ""a growing sense among many consumers that the worst of the global economic crisis is behind us."" Citing excess baggage fees and surcharges for jet fuel, along with delays and flight groundings, AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said it's ""not a very friendly environment this decade for the airline industry or the airline traveler."" David Ross, who was at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, with his wife and four children to catch a flight to Cancun, Mexico, offered some advice. ""You have to be calm and collected when you come to this airport, especially on a day like today,"" Ross, from Libertyville, Illinois, told CNN affiliate WGN. However, by 1 p.m. ET, delays at the country's airports appeared to be minimal, according to the Federal Aviation Administration's Web site. It reported that some arriving flights at the airports in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey, and at LaGuardia Airport in New York were delayed because of low cloud ceilings. ""So far, so good,"" traveler Andy Warman told CNN affiliate WABC at LaGuardia Airport. ""My flight's on time, so I'm pretty happy about that,"" added Warman, who was headed to Miami, Florida, to see family. At Washington's Reagan National Airport, the morning lines seemed like those of any other day. ""It's deserted,"" one woman told CNN affiliate WJLA. ""There's nobody here."" Of course, the bulk of Thanksgiving travelers will be going by car, AAA said -- about 33.2 million. ""I'm going to probably end up sitting in traffic for five hours,"" said Jack DeManche, 21, a student at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who plans on driving home Wednesday night to Uxbridge, Massachusetts. The drive is usually only about two hours from Amherst, but DeManche -- a resident adviser at the school -- won't be able to leave until he closes one of the student residence halls. ""I have to work until at least 6 p.m., and then I have to pack up,"" he said, adding that in years past, the drive has taken more than twice as long as it does on nonholiday weeks. But even so, he said, he'd rather brave the drive home Wednesday night than Thursday morning. ""I'd so much rather get home tonight,"" he said. In Oklahoma, the state's department of public safety said multiple accidents had shut down Interstate 35 in both directions around Billings. CNN affiliate KWTV said the closures occurred around 12:25 p.m. In California, an accident on the Golden Gate Bridge prompted authorities to close the bridge for a time, snarling traffic. The bridge reopened shortly after noon (3 p.m. ET), but Golden Gate Bridge District spokeswoman Mary Currie said the backup of traffic would take some time to clear. About 2.9 million people will travel by train, watercraft, bus or a combination of transportation modes, and 2.3 million will travel by air, the automobile association predicted. Jennifer Burrell, from Tucker, Georgia, said she, her husband and their two daughters were driving Thursday morning to just outside of Asheville, North Carolina. They'll return Sunday. She said she wasn't expecting traffic on the way up, but ""it always gets heavy"" on the way back. Of course, some Americans are not traveling at all. Heather McKinnon of Broomfield, Colorado, said she is staying home with family for Thanksgiving. ""I don't like to fly and really rarely like flying on holidays,"" she said, adding that she would consider driving. ""I know what it's like going through the airport,"" she said. Plus, she added, ""everything I love is here."" CNN's Taylor Gandossy and Augie Martin contributed to this report.","AAA predicts 38.4 million Americans will travel over the holiday weekend .

"(CNN) -- While several high-profile actors and directors have rallied around Roman Polanski, not everyone in Hollywood believes he should be freed and forgiven. The case surrounding the arrest of director Roman Polanski has both supporters and critics. In the face of a  petition signed by notables such as Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and John Landis calling for the immediate release of Polanski following his detainment in Switzerland, a backlash is building against such support. ""I can't believe that Hollywood has separated itself so completely from American morality,"" said Paul Petersen, a former child actor and president of A Minor Consideration, which advocates on behalf of young performers. ""It is yet another case of Hollywood being out of sync with most of America."" Polanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, but fled the United States before he could be sentenced. In the years since, the director known for ""Chinatown"" and ""Rosemary's Baby"" settled in France and avoided authorities until he was arrested Saturday while on his way to the Zurich Film Festival. In the aftermath of Polanski's arrest last weekend, a number of performers -- including Penelope Cruz, Tilda Swinton and Monica Bellucci -- appear as supporters on a petition which states, ""Roman Polanski is a French citizen, a renown and international artist now facing extradition. This extradition, if it takes place, will be heavy in consequences and will take away his freedom."" Polanski's detention has stirred debate over whether he should be returned to the United States to face possible imprisonment. Supporters make note of his age, the years that have passed, his talent and the victim's own assertion that pursuing the case opens fresh wounds for her as reasons the director should be left alone. But critics observe that Polanski's supporters might be downplaying his crime. ""I don't think a lot of people take the sexual assault of children very seriously at all, and it's something we battle everyday,"" said Grier Weeks, executive director of Protect, a national organization to protect children. ""We say at Protect that we are the most bipartisan group in America because we've got everyone from Hollywood liberals like Alison Arngrim [Nellie Oleson] from 'Little House on the Prairie' to extremely conservative people. ... But I will say with the notable exception of a few people from Hollywood, we get blank stares from some of that crowd."" Weeks pointed to the example of a discussion on ABC's ""The View,"" in which panelist and actress Whoopi Goldberg made the comment that she didn't believe the original charges against Polanski were for ""rape-rape,"" as what he views as a pervasive attitude. ""I assume [Goldberg] regrets saying what she said, but she really didn't say anything that is not under the surface anyway,"" Weeks said. ""This is just the attitude, that children are property and crimes against them are not real crimes.""  Watch a discussion of about Polanski's supporters » . Goldberg's fellow panelist, Sherri Shepherd, said during the show that she believed Polanski should still be punished. On Twitter, she tweeted, ""Whew... long day at 'The View'... two shows today... hot debate over the Statutory Rapist Polanski. 45-year-old man plies a 13-yr-old w/drugs & Liquor and anally & orally penetrates her w/o her consent is a RAPIST. We hunt down 75-year-old Nazis. We must protect our children."" Actress Kirstie Alley wrote on Twitter ""JUST FOR THE RECORD....RAPE IS RAPE...this is one HOLLYWOOD STAR who does not CELEBRATE or DEFEND Roman Polanski..his ART did not RAPE her."" ""The Biggest Loser"" trainer Jillian Michaels said ""If she's [the victim] OK and feels that they are resolved then who are we to say"" referring to the now adult victim, Samantha Geimer. Despite that, Michaels said, ""If somebody drugged and raped my 13-year-old I'd shoot them.""  Watch stars discuss Polanski's arrest » . Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, said it is understandable that Geimer would want to move on given what has occurred. ""I think that it's deplorable that some celebrities, and I emphasis the word 'some,' are supporting rape, supporting the destruction of the life of a 13-year-old girl,"" O'Neill said. ""You look at what happened to the victim in this case and how she was re-victimized over and over again. First by [Polanski] himself when he claimed it was consensual, then by his pals all powerful, wealthy celebrities who supported him, then by the media who characterized her as the little Lolita, the 13-year-old temptress."" Petersen, who played son Jeff Stone on ""The Donna Reed Show,"" said he believes there are many in the industry who would like to speak up against the support Polanski has received. ""They are afraid of the Hollywood power structure that is tilted distinctly to the left and plays favorites,"" Petersen said. Thomas J. Reese, S.J., a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, wrote a piece for The Washington Post's ""On Faith"" column titled ""Father Polanski Would Go to Jail."" Reese said Hollywood might learn a lesson from the scandals involving pedophiles and the Catholic Church. ""I think that perhaps there is a sense of entitlement that comes with being a celebrity and a star and part of that whole industry where people are always fawning over them and idolizing them,"" Reese said. ""I think that kind of goes to your head and makes you think that you are special and above the law. The clergy used to think that at one time, inaccurately, and it's just not a healthy attitude."" On Wednesday, the BBC reported that the French government had dropped its public support for the release of Polanski stating that the director ""is neither above nor beneath the law.""","Some stars speak out against Roman Polanski's crime .

"(CNN) -- Australian authorities have declared several coastal areas near Brisbane disaster zones after a massive oil spill earlier this week, according to the Queensland government. Large stretches of Queensland's coastline are being affected by the oil. ""This is a very serious situation,"" Queensland Premier Anna Bligh said, according to a news release on Friday. ""It appears the volume of oil involved is much greater than originally reported by the Pacific Adventurer. And the effect of the oil spill is more widespread."" The Pacific Adventurer sustained damage early Wednesday when Cyclone Hamish struck the waters of eastern Australia with more than 125 kph (77 mph) winds. The cargo ship lost 30 of its 50 containers of ammonium nitrate about 13 kilometers (8 miles) off the coast of Cape Moreton. Those containers are still missing. The damaged ship also spilled a large amount of oil that is covering at least 60 kilometers (37 miles) of beach in and around Brisbane, according to Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC).  Watch sludge washing up on shorelines » . The ship's owner, Swire Shipping, initially said no more than 42,000 liters (11,100 U.S. gallons) of oil escaped from the ship, but now says that ""substantially more oil was spilled,"" ABC reported Friday. The ship is currently in the custody of Australia's Maritime Safety Authority in Brisbane, as the investigation into the spill continues. A massive clean-up effort is also under way. So far, 13 oil-covered birds have been recovered, according to the Queensland government.","Pacific Adventurer sustained damage when Cyclone Hamish struck .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Massive food distribution coordinated by the World Food Programme, international aid agencies and the Haitian government will begin Sunday in the quake-ravaged capital. WFP will roll out food at 16 distribution points across Port-au-Prince, the United Nations agency said. Each location will receive 42 metric tons of rice each for the next two weeks, and each family will receive a 25-kilogram ration of rice. Only women will be allowed into the distributions sites to collect the food, WFP said. Women are receiving the food vouchers because they tend to be responsible for the household food supply, said WFP spokesman Marcus Prior. ""Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men,"" Prior said. The agency said it will work with its partners to ensure that men in need of assistance are not excluded. The distribution sites will be set up with proper security, making it difficult for those not entitled to receive food to enter, he said. The WFP said the 16 fixed sites are a key step in establishing food security. ""It is the most complex challenge we have ever confronted, but this distribution system will not only allow us to reach more people, it will give us the qualitative step we need to facilitate the delivery of all kinds of humanitarian assistance in the weeks and months to come,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a statement from Rome, Italy. The food aid plan involves at least eight private humanitarian agencies: Samaritan's Purse, Catholic Relief Services, CARE, World Vision, ACTED, Save The Children, GOAL and ADRA. ""Together with our NGO partners we are working with the local authorities, churches and other civil society organizations to ensure that all male-headed households and others with special needs are not excluded from these distributions,"" Prior said. Details of the plan were finalized at a meeting attended by WFP, the aid agencies and senior members of the Haitian government, said Ken Isaacs, vice president of programs for Samaritan's Purse. He said those attending the meeting were given coupons, which are being handed out to needy families in the districts drawn up around each distribution point. The distribution will begin early Sunday. The two-week effort aims to reach 2 million people in Port-au-Prince but does not expand to those living in other quake-devastated cities like Leogane. Aid distributions to outlying areas will continue, Prior said. ""Up until now the nature of this emergency has forced us to work in a 'quick and dirty' way simply to get food out,"" Sheeran said. ""This new system will allow us to provide food assistance to more people, more quickly through a robust network of fixed distribution sites."" Multinational troops, including the U.S. military, will help secure food convoys and the distribution sites, Prior said. CNN's Alec Miran and Moni Basu contributed to this report.","The World Food Programme will roll out food at 16 distribution points across city, agency says .

"(CNN) -- AC Milan wasted a golden opportunity to close the gap on leaders and city rivals Inter at the top of the Italian Serie A table after being held to a 1-1 draw at home to lowly Livorno. With Inter's match at Parma postponed because of heavy snow, a Milan win would have closed the gap at the top of the table to eight points -- with both teams having played 21 matches. Veteran midfielder Massimo Ambrosini put Milan ahead on the stroke of half-time when he hooked the ball home after goalkeeper Francesco Benussi failed to deal with a David Beckham cross. But Cristiano Lucarelli poked home a mis-hit Claudio Bellucci shot just before the hour mark to earn Livorno a point. It completes a difficult week for Leonardo's side following their surprise Italian Cup defeat to Udinese and last weekend's 'derby' reverse at the San Siro. Milan's failure to win means in-form Roma have joined them on 41 points after a narrow 2-1 home win over bottom side Siena. Second-half substitute Stefano Okaka struck the winner three minutes from time in his final match before joining English Premier League side Fulham in a six-month loan deal. Jon Arne Riise had put the hosts in front in the 29th minute before Siena's Simone Vergassola equalized just before half-time. However, striker Okaka flicked home the late winner to earn Cluadio Ranieri's side a fourth successive Serie A victory. Elsewhere in Italy, striker Antonio Cassano has confirmed he has turned down the chance to join Fiorentina, choosing to remain with Sampdoria despite reports of a fall-out with coach Luigi Del Neri. On the pitch, Sampdoria maintained their Champions League challenge with a comfortable 2-0 win over strugglers Atalanta. Meanwhile, Juventus moved up a place to fifth, going above Palermo, after a 1-1 draw at home to Lazio. Alessandro del Piero's penalty after 70 minutes looked like giving new coach Alberto Zaccheroni a winning start to his reign. However, Stefano Mauri converted a cross from Mauro Zarate to level matters with just 12 minutes remaining.","Milan waste a golden opportunity to close the gap on leaders Inter at the top of Serie A .

"Naoma, West Virginia (CNN) -- Staking out for news at the site of the mine explosion here, I remembered what I miss most about Appalachia -- the people. Their stories are what drew me up here in 2006 as a correspondent for the Associated Press. Their hardships, struggles, passions, faith and quirks shaped hard-hitting stories about a region that few give much thought to these days. I covered a mine disaster back then, too -- the explosion at Kentucky Darby Mine No. 1 that killed five coal miners -- and found myself marveling at the strength of the families and the community. And, despite their pain, they were hospitable, allowing a green reporter without a signal to use their living room phone, rest on their front steps and ask a few questions about their fears and worries. I left after more than two years of sharing their stories, and hoped to return someday to catch up with my mountain neighbors and the families who allowed me to walk into their homes and share their lives with the world. Instead, I returned for tragedy. Not much has changed this time around as I help cover the latest disaster for CNN -- this time four miners unaccounted for and at least 25 dead. I'm still amazed by the teachers who have allowed us reporters to use their classrooms as impromptu work areas, the nearby residents who insist on making sure we eat during the long days, the miners who bravely re-enter the mines just a day after losing some of their closest friends, and the victims' families, who remain patient as they wait for news. I don't know how they do it, how they stay so composed, so strong in the face of such a horrific disaster felt miles away. And through it all, they accept our presence with a dignified grace.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Searchers have found the flight data recorder from an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed Monday with 90 people aboard, the Lebanese army said Thursday. The data recorder, commonly called a black box, was found at a depth of about 1,300 meters in the Mediterranean Sea. The recorder had not yet been retrieved, the army said. The Boeing 737-800, carrying eight crew members and 82 passengers, crashed into the sea after takeoff from Lebanon early Monday. At least 14 bodies had been recovered from the crash of the airliner, which was bound for the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, officials said. The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh, which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut.

"Santiago, Chile (CNN) -- Sure, Luke Mescher felt a trembling fear when the walls around him started to shake Saturday, but standing around confused and scared wasn't an option. ""I was more focused on we need to get out of here and we need to get out of here as fast as we can,"" said Mescher, a University of Iowa student studying Spanish in Chile. Mescher, 27, was at the home of his host family when the 8.8-magnitude quake struck early Saturday. He was talking with friends on his computer when the power went out. Immediately after, he felt a subtle vibration that progressed into a violent shaking, he said. His host mom cried as the walls around them shook and her daughter attempted to comfort her, he said. ""They were ""paralyzed with fear,"" he said. ""I was like, we don't have time for this,"" Mescher said. ""We need to get the hell out of here."" He grabbed his head lamp, the two women, and ran barefoot and bare-chested into the dark street. The three met dozens others in the staircase scurrying out the 20-story apartment building, he said. The exit was ""surprisingly orderly,"" Mescher said. But others faced more of an ordeal. CNN iReporter Matias de Cristobal said the earthquake destroyed many homes in her Santiago neighborhood. Cristobal tried to climb upstairs to check on her three children -- age 6, 9, and 11 -- after she began feeling tremors on Saturday, but she was slowed by shifting ground and falling objects. Mirko Vukasovic, a 25-year-old illustrator in Santiago, had been dancing at a club early Saturday when the disco ball began swinging wildly. A chaotic evacuation was under way when the lights went out, but everyone managed to escape, Vukasovic said. ""Broken windows and falling building parts was what welcomed us in the streets,"" he said. iReport: Read Mescher's firsthand account . Vukasovic submitted iReport video showing the damage to his fourth-floor apartment. ""What used to be a beautiful bathroom is now torn, a beautiful crack,"" he said as his camera panned to a pile of tile and plaster that had been shaken loose from the walls. Some in Chile reacted to the quake with disbelief. ""It was 3 or 4 in the morning and I had come home late,"" said Aneya Fernando, an American who teaches English in Santiago. ""Suddenly my bed was moving so violently that it woke me up."" ""I'm on the 10th floor of a building and it was swaying and shaking,"" Fernando, 23, said. ""Suddenly it was just gone and I was confused. I thought it was in my head."" When Fernando's electricity returned 30 minutes later, she learned of the earthquake on TV. Scott Ireland, a business traveler from Rochester, New York, who was staying at the Sheraton San Cristobal when the earthquake struck, submitted iReport photos of cracks in the exterior walls of his hotel. Ireland, 48, had experienced two earlier earthquakes -- one in Turkey in 1966 and another in Southern California in 1971. ""Not only was this the most severe,"" he said, ""the duration was longer than anything I'd ever experienced. Luckily the damage here was minimal."" Meschler, the Iowa student, encountered faces of confusion and concern when he and his host family left their apartment building and entered the street. Some tried using their phones to call out with no luck, others ran to neighboring apartment complexes, looking to help. iReport: Watch video of damage at an apartment . Many throughout the city don't have their basic utilities, the Salvation Army reported. Mescher doesn't have gas, but his power and water are back on.

When the aftershocks began and kept rolling in jolts to his Santiago neighborhood, Mescher said some neighbors prepared for a night outside of their home. ""I did see a good portion of people go back upstairs an hour into it and put together what they could,"" he said, speaking of a sleep away bag. ""There were a lot of people that got their car and took off."" Mescher had also tested his luck, considering he was unsure of the building's stability after such a great temblor. ""After we were safely outside I made a quick run and grabbed a shirt and some shoes,"" he said. About 5 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) -- about 90 minutes after the quake -- he returned to the apartment to finally get some rest, just to be rattled by another aftershock. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, a 6.9-magnitude aftershock hit Chile about that time. Dozens of aftershocks later, Mescher was looking at cracks that had shaped around the door frames and crept up walls. Chunks of plaster littered the floors, he said. ""I've got to think there have to be some long-term structural issues,"" he said.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ten Americans accused of trying illegally to take 33 children from Haiti had met with a Haitian police officer and a Dominican official the week before being stopped at the border, interpreters who worked with the group said Wednesday. One interpreter said the officer offered to help the Americans with the paperwork required  take the children out of the country. The Americans -- five men and five women, some of whom are members of Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho --were arrested in Haiti after being turned back from the Dominican Republic border on Friday night. A Haitian lawyer representing the Americans told reporters Wednesday that the arrests were illegal and that their clients had only been trying to help. The Americans, who were interviewed Wednesday by Judge Isai Jean Louis, are to appear Thursday before the attorney general, who is handling the case, lawyer Edwin Coq said. Around noon Wednesday, Haitian authorities took away for questioning a Haitian police officer who works at the Dominican Embassy, officials said. They said he would be asked whether he provided illegal paperwork to the Americans to facilitate their efforts to remove the children from the country. Three interpreters who had translated for the Americans told CNN that the Americans met last week at least twice with the officer -- at the embassy and consulate. Full coverage of Haiti earthquake, aftermath . The Americans have said they had the permit they thought they needed from the Dominican authorities, but the Dominican consul general told CNN that that was not the case. Carlos Castillo said he met Friday with Laura Silsby, the leader of the group. He said he told her the documentation was not in order and warned her that, if she were to attempt the trip, she could be accused of child trafficking. ""The Haitian authorities contacted me, they called me, and they told me that she was telling them she had the authorization from the Dominican authorities to cross the border, which was a lie,"" Castillo said. CNN's Karl Penhaul attempted to get comment from the jailed Americans in Haiti's capital, but they would not discuss the matter, responding to his questions by singing ""Amazing Grace"" and praying. The group, New Life Children's Refuge, said it was ""rescuing"" abandoned children by moving them to the Dominican Republic, where it was building an orphanage. The group's effort came after an earthquake last month killed tens of thousands in Haiti. The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said Sunday that the Americans had been detained for ""alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration."" SOS Children's Villages, where Haitian authorities took the 33 children after the Americans' arrests, said at least 20 of the kids aren't orphans and many others have relatives such as aunts and uncles. Search for the missing, found . Several residents of the village of Calebasse, more than an hour from Port-au-Prince, told CNN this week they had voluntarily handed over their children to Silsby. The parents said Silsby told them she would give their children a better life and promised that they could see them whenever they wanted. Told Monday that many of the children had living parents, Silsby said during a jailhouse interview, ""I did not know that."" She added, ""In our hearts, our intention was to help children that had been orphaned or abandoned by their parents."" But the interpreters said they translated conversations between Silsby and the parents in Calebasse and that Silsby must have been aware of the children's status. Jean Sainvil, a pastor who helped find children from a camp in the Delmas neighborhood of the capital, told CNN that the Americans told him they were seeking orphans. Sainvil said he rounded up 20 children and handed them to the Americans on Thursday, though the translators put the number he helped at 13. Some of those who were receptive to his call apparently included parents. ""One of them turned five children over,"" he said. ""Mother came out with children, said 'You can have them all,' she doesn't have a home, she is hopeless."" He said no money changed hands. One interpreter said representatives of the group met with a Haitian police officer on January 26. The officer told Silsby that her group couldn't gather Haitian children as they were doing, but then offered his help, the interpreter said. ""They met a police guy and he told them that he could help, and he was helping them with some paper,"" interpreter Steve Adrien said. ""We did not meet him in a police station, but in the street in a car."" The Americans met again with the man in Port-au-Prince on Thursday, near the Dominican Embassy, the translator said. ""He was helping Laura [Silsby] to get in touch with the ambassador in the Dominican Embassy,"" said Isaac Adrien, Steve's brother and another of the interpreters. He said the group came away from the meeting with a document from the embassy that the Americans took with them to the border Friday. Though the group said it planned to start an orphanage in the Dominican Republic, it has no experience running an orphanage, has not registered as an international adoption agency and has not filed with the U.S. government as a nonprofit. Church pastor Clint Henry was unfazed. ""I believe that the kind of knowledge that it takes to begin an organization that works that way was in place,"" he told CNN. ""The kind of employees that it takes to successfully run an orphanage, those were going to be hired."" On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the matter ""unfortunate."" ""We know how to do this in the right way and it was unfortunate that, whatever the motivation, that this group of Americans took matters into their own hands,"" she said, adding that U.S. authorities were in discussions with the Haitian government ""about the appropriate disposal of their cases."" Government approval is needed for any Haitian child to leave the country, and the group acknowledged that the children have no passports. The number of Haitian orphans taken to the United States after the earthquake -- those whose approval and paperwork had been in the bureaucratic pipeline at the time of the disaster -- is 578, with 44 others awaiting transportation, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. CNN's Dan Simon in Meridian, Idaho; Karl Penhaul in Port-au-Prince, Haiti; and Jill Dougherty in Washington contributed to this report.","Interpreter: Policeman offered to help the Americans take the children out of Haiti .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- As Ricot Duprevil tells it, rescuers saved him after he spent two weeks under earthquake rubble. There's no question that Duprevil was pulled out alive from the rubble of a Port-au-Prince building Tuesday. But confirmation of his two-week account might just remain buried among the ruins. A doctor treating the 31-year-old man says he is inclined to believe Duprevil. The hospital where Duprevil was taken was unable to conduct an initial blood test that might have helped prove or disprove his account. And the U.S. soldiers who arrived and treated Duprevil after his rescue did not see which building area residents recovered him from -- a freshly collapsed one or one destroyed two weeks ago, when a 7.0-magnitude earthquake devastated Haiti. The residents who rescued him could not be immediately located. Full coverage . If the Haitian salesman did survive 14 days entombed in rubble, he would match a record set in 1990 by a man pulled free from the ruins of a hotel after a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in the Philippines. The Haitian government announced late last week that it was switching from rescue efforts to recovery operations, even as some survivors were found alive. On Saturday, a 24-year-old man was freed by a French rescue team, 11 days after the quake. That man, Wismond Jean-Pierre, had survived on soda found in the hotel shop where he was working at the time of the quake. And a 5-year-old boy named Monley flashed an ear-to-ear smile last Wednesday when he was rescued after eight days spent under the ruins of his collapsed home. Duprevil said he was selling soda when the quake hit and he ran inside a building in fear. The building then collapsed, he said. His family reported him missing after the quake, and feverishly looked for him. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Meanwhile, Duprevil said, he survived by rationing water from a 2-gallon jug he found among debris. The water ran out Tuesday morning, he said. U.S. military medics and doctors at the International Medical Surgical Response team field hospital said Duprevil was severely dehydrated after being rescued, but otherwise had strong blood pressure and pulse. On Wednesday morning, he was in stable condition while being treated for a fracture to his right thigh bone. ""Undoubtedly, this is very, very exciting, especially for all of us who have been deeply involved in this mission,"" said Dr. Henry Ford, who is treating Duprevil. ""To pull this one out ... is exhilarating."" CNN's Karl Penhaul and Kim Norgaard contributed to this report.","Ricot Duprevil, 31, was in stable condition with fractured thigh bone after rescue, officials say .

"(CNN) -- President Obama on Saturday urged a thorough investigation into a deadly explosion at a West Virginia coal mine that killed 29 people, hours after rescue efforts at the mine gave way to an operation to recover the dead. ""This has been America's worst mining disaster in forty years, and the toll on all West Virginians has been immeasurable, "" Obama said of Monday's blast at the Upper Big Branch mine. ""We cannot bring back the men we lost. What we can do, in their memory, is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability."" Obama's statement came just hours after rescue efforts came to a grim end after crews found the bodies of the last four miners unaccounted for in the explosion. Twenty-five people were previously announced dead. ""My thoughts and prayers are with the families of all those who were lost in this tragic accident, and my gratitude goes out to the rescue teams who worked so tirelessly and heroically to search for the missing,"" Obama said in his statement. The death toll makes the West Virginia mining disaster the worst in the U.S. since 1972, when 91 miners were killed in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. Of the 29 dead in the West Virginia blast, the bodies of 22 remain inside the mine. The cause of the blast is unknown, and state and federal officials have pledged a full investigation. The explosion has prompted renewed questions about mine safety. Obama said Saturday that ""all Americans deserve to work in a place that is safe, and we must take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that all our miners are as safe as possible so that a disaster like this doesn't happen again."" Obama will meet next week with Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and a Mine Safety and Health Administration official to hear their initial assessment of what caused the blast, along with their recommendations for steps the federal government should take to improve mine safety. Richmond, Virginia-based Massey Energy Co., which owns the mine, said in a statement released Friday that it will conduct ""extensive"" reviews of the mine accident ""to ensure that a similar incident doesn't happen again."" It said the mine has had less than one violation per day in inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and added that that rate is ""consistent with national averages."" Most of the blast victims were working in an area where long wall cutting was taking place. The technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal and creates large amounts of coal dust and methane gas, both of which are explosive. West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin said Saturday that even though it's not clear what caused the explosion, there needs to be a focus on better ventilation and on sensors to alert mine personnel when gas levels become dangerous. ""There was no way to protect them against this,"" he said. ""You just have to prevent it and make sure it doesn't happen again.""","President Obama calls for thorough investigation into mine blast .

"(CNN) -- Self-help guru James Ray was arrested Wednesday after a grand jury indictment charging him with three counts of manslaughter in the deaths of three participants at an Arizona sweat lodge ceremony he organized last year. Yavapai County Sheriff Steve Waugh said Ray was arrested at his attorney's office in Prescott, Arizona, Wednesday afternoon. He will eventually be housed at the Camp Verde Detention Center, the sheriff's office said, and his bond has been set at $5 million. Ray is charged with the deaths of Kirby Brown, James Shore and Liz Neuman. Ray's attorney, Luis Li, said that the charges were unjust and that Ray would be exonerated in court. ""This was a terrible accident -- but it was an accident, not a criminal act,"" Li said. ""James Ray cooperated at every step of the way, providing information and witnesses to the authorities showing that no one could have foreseen this accident."" As many as 65 visitors, ranging in age from 30 to 60, attended Ray's ""Spiritual Warrior"" program at the Angel Valley Retreat Center near Sedona in October. They spent as long as two hours inside a dome-like structure called a sweat lodge, which was covered with tarps and blankets and had hot rocks and water inside to create steam. Three people died after spending time in the sweat lodge October 8 and nearly 20 others were sickened. Brown and Shore were pronounced dead shortly after they arrived at a local hospital, and Neuman died October 17 after being hospitalized since the incident. Native Americans used sweat lodges in spiritual and physical purification ceremonies. Ray is widely known for programs that claim to teach people how to create wealth from all aspects of their lives -- financially, mentally, physically and spiritually. He has appeared on various national programs in the United States, including CNN's ""Larry King Live.""","Self-help guru James Ray was arrested Wednesday after a grand jury indictment .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Allow me to introduce myself. I am a gainfully employed, God-fearing, law-abiding citizen, and I come in peace. I don't bet on baseball, I take excellent care of my gums, I keep my tray table locked and upright from takeoff to landing. Oh, and there's one more thing: I am what is commonly referred to in polite society as ""an unmarried woman."" Truth be told, I now have a boyfriend and a baby girl --it's all very modern -- but much of my 30s involved ostensibly concerned bystanders averting their eyes, asking how many cats I own, and sharing their private theories on where it all went so hideously wrong for me. Ah, yes, I remember it well. And when I start to forget, I still have plenty of single girlfriends in various states of angst to remind me of the grotesque fix-ups, the ham-handed remarks, and the brutal Thanksgiving dinners. For those valiant, traumatized souls, I present my list of the ten things one must never say, think, or do when dealing with a single woman over the age of 35. 1. Hey, cousin Christy, how 'bout we break with tradition and dispense with that bridal bouquet toss? Believe it or not, it's actually a touch degrading to be shoved front and center next to your spinster aunt Mitzi from Winnipeg as a roomful of revelers hopped up on Champagne and jumbo shrimp chant, ""You're next, you're next."" 2. The word picky -- as in ""the reason you refuse to meet my podiatrist's brother-in-law for a night of miniature golf is that you're too picky""-- is not only offensive, it's inaccurate. Hell, I'd have dated Ted Bundy if he were willing to meet in a well-lit, public place. No, I suspect it was your description of his ""slight comb-over"" and ""profound desire to one day shake Dick Cheney's hand"" that made me release that ""catch"" back into the wilds of New Jersey. Oprah.com: The number one thing to look for in a partner . 3. Don't confuse being unmarried with being 11 . My love of SpongeBob-shaped macaroni and cheese notwithstanding, I never wanted to sit at the children's table. Nor did I want to ride in the backseat with your darling toddler, his pet tarantula, his Spider-Man glitter glue, and his melting Fudgsicle. 4. Kindly stop filling every conversational lull by announcing how much you love ""Will & Grace."" Being single is not the same thing as being gay, just as being married is not proof of being straight...but I'll cover that concept more fully in my upcoming ""Uncle Barry's Very Special Surprise"" article. Oprah.com: How to break the ice with anyone . 5. Has anybody out there noticed that the institution of matrimony is falling apart faster than Courtney Love on a can of Red Bull? Now, I honestly don't care if your marriage is so gothic in its dysfunction that it makes the couple from ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"" look like Will and Jada -- I'm not here to judge. All I ask is that you quit judging me. Perhaps we're not suffering a fear of intimacy as much as a fear of being trapped in a crummy marriage. 6. Remember that little factoid you used to bandy about -- you know, the one where 40-year-old women have a greater chance of being shot by terrorists than of making it to the altar? Then you may also recall that Susan Faludi refuted that myth 14 years ago. So, okay, Ms. Faludi is probably rethinking that (thanks a lot, Osama!), but you don't have to rub it in. 7. Enough with the ""constructive"" criticism already. We live in a world of stunning technological advancement, but it remains physically impossible to wear your heart on your sleeve and be emotionally distant, dress like a slut and a librarian, try much too hard and not make any real effort. 8. New rule: You may discuss everything from the fall of the Roman Empire to the rise of Rem Koolhaas with your single friend. But her uterus, ovaries, entire reproductive system are off-limits. Sending clippings about a 74-year-old Ukrainian woman who just gave birth to triplets along with a peppy little ""Keep hope alive!"" Post-it note will do irreparable damage to your relationship and -- if the woman is particularly resourceful -- may even get your tires slashed. 9. Here's a phrase that must never, ever cross your lips: ""Let me tell you why a terrific gal like you is still single...."" Because that terrific gal is then likely to explain in dark and visceral detail what happened to the last gentleman who uttered those very words -- and, trust me, you really don't want to know. 10. I've looked at single life from both sides now , and here's what I think: Single women are not Sarah Jessica Parker in ""Sex and the City"" any more than they're Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction."" For one thing, very few have Manolo Blahniks in their closets. For another, very few have sex with Michael Douglas in their kitchens. They sometimes get lonely, frustrated, they sometimes get flat-out goofy. They are human beings -- tickle them and they laugh, prick them and they bleed, offer them chocolate and they eat.... In other words, they're pretty much like all the married women I know. Oprah.com: 4 ways to talk so people listen . By Lisa Kogan from Oprah.com © 2010 .

"(Oprah.com) -- As a trained chef, restaurant owner, healthy-cookbook author, and confirmed food lover, I absolutely refuse to let the word diet hijack my life -- and I don't think you should, either. Smart eating is not about settling for less; it's about heaping more good stuff on your plate. Three-grain pilaf is a both mouth-watering dish and a contains a dose of healthy carbs. Let's change just one health habit a week -- shopping, cooking, and eating to meet that goal -- for four weeks? After a month of making basic grains, fruit, and vegetables into staples using my recipes, you'll find it much easier to plan delicious, satisfying meals. Try Laura Pensiero's four-week approach to transforming your eating habits! Week One: Make a produce-aisle hit list . Eating more fruits and vegetables is one of the most important dietary habits you can adopt to prevent heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension and to manage your weight. Vegetables in particular will cost you little in the way of calories while offering huge health benefits. Your weekly goal is to eat five to nine servings of fruits and veggies a day. That's not as challenging as it may seem. The serving sizes are reasonable one medium-size fruit, a half cup of cooked vegetables, three-quarters of a cup of 100-percent juice, one cup of raw leafy vegetables, a quarter cup of dried fruit. Mix fruit into your breakfast cereal, add lettuce and tomato to your sandwich (with a side of a vegetable-based soup), eat a piece of fruit in the afternoon and a vegetable side at dinner, and you've taken care of at least five servings. Before shopping, write down the names of five richly colored vegetables and fruits that you really like, then add to the list two that you're curious about and are willing to try. Week Two: Defy your white flour urge . Until recently, it seemed that only nutritionists (and cereal box labels) used the words whole grain. Now delicious whole grain soups, desserts, and breads --bursting with color, texture and flavor -- have become popular. It's also widely known that they have the power to deliver key antioxidants. Your weekly goal is to make sure that half of your grain servings per day (three to five one-ounce servings) are whole grains such as wild rice, brown rice, barley, bulgur, corn (polenta), faro, quinoa, wheat berries, or whole wheat couscous. Whole grain foods are not refined, which means they contain all three parts of the grain, including the two lost in the refining process -- the outer layer, bran, which provides fiber, B vitamins, and antioxidants; and the germ, the nutrient-packed inner portion, containing protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. The endosperm, the starchy part of the grain left in refined products such as white flour, contains some protein and lots of carbs but few nutrients. Look for the word whole on the ingredient list, followed by the name of the grain. Research shows that adding even a moderate amount of whole grain to your diet every day -- whole grain cereal topped with fruit for breakfast, toasty multigrain bread at lunch, and a pilaf or grain salad for dinner -- significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and digestive system and hormone-related cancers. Week Three: Get the perks of dairy -- without all the fat . This week, add some reduced-fat dairy, which will cream up your cooking and get healthy calcium into your diet (approximately 75 percent of adult Americans don't get the recommended daily allowance). Studies show not only that calcium helps prevent osteoporosis but that getting enough calcium each day (1,000 milligrams from ages 19 to 50 and 1,200 milligrams after age 50), along with adequate vitamin D (200 IU; 400 IU after age 50), helps control weight, lowers blood pressure, and may prevent certain types of cancer. Your goal is to eat three to four servings a day of low-fat cheeses, yogurt, and 1 percent or skim milk; the calcium in dairy products is the most readily absorbed by your body. If you're lactose intolerant, fortified soy products -- particularly those with calcium malate -- are a fine substitute in cooking and often contain similar amounts of protein, vitamin D, and calcium. I do not recommend fat-free dairy products, particularly cheese; instead of getting creamy, bubbly, and brown in recipes, it can turn rubbery and tasteless. Week Four: Get protein . In the past three weeks, you have learned how vegetables, fruit, whole grains, and low-fat dairy can help you fill your plate with quality nutrients that don't pack a lot of calories. Now it's time to address protein. Getting enough is not something most of us need to worry about, but selecting well is. Your goal is to eat five to six ounces of lean and healthy protein a day. Eat it all in one meal (most restaurant servings of protein are at least five ounces), or eat smaller portions throughout the day. I often tell clients to divide their plate into quarters: Three quarters should be filled with whole grains and vegetables; one quarter should be a serving of protein -- such as shrimp, fish, chicken, beans, tofu, lean cuts of beef, or pork -- about the size of a deck of cards. Poultry and meat can take little time to cook (grilling and searing in a hot, nonstick pan) or a lot of hands-off time (braising and stewing until they are fork-tender and flavorful). Some high-protein foods are rich in protective nutrients, such as the omega-3 fatty acids found in walnuts and fish like wild salmon. Use nuts as a garnish to add flavor, texture, and toastiness to salad, or eat a small handful as a snack. Beans are a near-perfect food -- high in protein, fiber, B vitamins, iron, calcium, and magnesium, and very low in fat. Puree them into dips and spreads, or add them to salads, soups, stews, and casseroles for extra protein oomph. E-mail to a friend .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- The Pakistani military on Sunday was looking into a local report that the region's Taliban leader had died, officials said. State broadcaster PTV reported that Hakimullah Mehsud, the Taliban commander in Pakistan, was wounded in a drone attack this month, and that he died and was buried last week. PTV cited local sources and its correspondent in North Waziristan. A Taliban source denied the report to CNN, saying that Mehsud has simply gone ""underground"" after being targeted by drone attacks. The source, who requested anonymity because he is not an authorized spokesperson for the Taliban, said Mehsud is alive and well and will release a taped recording to prove as much. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas told CNN that ""we cannot yet confirm"" Mehsud's death. Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik told CNN on Sunday that officials have received reports of the Taliban leader's death, but also could not immediately verify it. Mehsud has been the target of suspected U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan. The U.S. military routinely offers no comment on reported attacks by the pilotless aircraft. The Taliban leader's status came into question following two drone attacks aimed at him this month. U.S. counterterrorism officials contacted by CNN Sunday could not confirm whether Mehsud is dead or injured. CNN's Kiran Khalid and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","NEW: Taliban source says commander alive and well, will release tape soon .

"(CNN) -- Bastian Schweinsteiger rescued a point for Bayern Munich as the German Bundesliga leaders were held to a 1-1 draw by Cologne on Saturday. The Germany international grabbed an equalizer for Bayern in the 58th minute as Louis van Gaal's side missed the opportunity to increase their lead at the top of the table. Bayern had looked to be heading for their first defeat since November after former striker Lukas Podolski, who had earlier hit the post, gave Cologne the lead at the RheinEnergieStadion. Podolski struck a superb free-kick in the 32nd minute which deflected off goalkeeper Hans-Jorg Butt's hand and into the top-left corner of the net. But the impressive Thomas Mueller set up midfielder Schweinsteiger and he stroked the ball home from just inside the penalty area to secure a point for Bayern. Schalke are hot on the heels of the leaders after they cruised to a 4-1 win at Eintracht Frankfurt to close the gap to two points thanks to goals from Joel Matip, Benedikt Howedes Ivan Rakitic and Kevin Kuranyi. Marcell Jansen scored the only goal of the game to ensure Hamburg remain in touch with the top three as they claimed a 1-0 win over Hertha Berlin at the HSH Nordbank Arena which left Hertha rooted to the bottom of the table. Stuttgart threw away a two-goal lead as they drew 2-2 with Werder Bremen. Sami Khedira and Pavel Pogrebnyak gave the visitors a 2-0 half-time advantage but Portugal striker Hugo Almeida pulled a goal back for Bremen before Torsten Frings leveled with nine minutes remaining. Elsewhere, Wolfsburg scored four second-half goals as they came from behind to a record a 4-1 win over Bochum thanks to a brace from Edin Dzeko and a goal apiece from Obafemi Martins and Jonathan Santana. Hannover clinched a vital three points over fellow relegation strugglers Freiburg with a 2-1 away victory as Papiss Demba Cisse put through his own net for the home side after Yacine Abdessadki had equalized Elson's opener for the visitors. In the day's late kick-off Borussia Dortmund kept up the chase for the Europa League with a routine 3-0 home victory over Borussia Monchengladbach. Egypt international Mohamed Zidan, who scored against England during the week, struck twice in the second half after Kevin Grosskreutz had given Dortmund the lead.","Midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger rescues a point for Bayern Munich at Cologne .

"(CNN) -- Haiti's earthquake is creating ""a generation of amputees,"" something that will pose a challenge for Haitian society for years to come, experts say. The 7.0 earthquake resulted in thousands having their limbs crushed as Haiti's ramshackle buildings fell on top of them. The number of amputees created by the disaster is hard to measure, but Handicap International estimates it is at least 2,000 and growing. Dr. Mitra Roses of the Pan American Health Organization said some hospitals were performing between 30 and 100 amputations a day after the earthquake. At one small hospital in the capital that is now functioning under a tent, doctors say they are performing more and more amputations on children. ""We're having a generation of amputees,"" said one medical worker. She had just discovered that a 2-year-old girl cannot feel her left foot and may need an amputation. ""It's heartbreaking."" Amputations in Haiti are especially difficult for patients because so many people get around on foot or by bicycle. Sidewalks and roads are poor and wheelchairs, crutches and canes are few. ""What I fear is that if I can't walk, I can't go to school and I can't go to church,"" said a boy who lost his foot in the earthquake. Without his foot, he said, he can't pedal the bike he normally takes to church and to school. ""It's not an environment which is conducive to mobility for people who are not able to walk for a variety of reasons,"" Stephanie Stuart, director of Handicap International UK, told CNN. Amputees may have trouble getting to work, she said, and the problem is compounded if those people perform manual labor, which requires greater use of their limbs. ""Their circumstances are pretty dire, because an amputee in Haiti is highly disadvantaged in terms of being able to be mobile, have a job and look after family,"" said Eric Doubt, executive director of Healing Hands for Haiti International, which provides treatment and rehabilitation to people with disabilities. Young amputees face different issues, said Stuart. Like the boy who lost his foot, they may not be able to go to school, putting them at risk of losing education. They also can't play with their friends or enjoy the activities they used to, and they may be too young to understand why, Stuart said. Even if those children make it to school, they may have trouble adapting to an able-bodied environment. ""A lot of children, if they couldn't manage to go to the loo (toilet) in schools, would they feel they wanted to spend the day there?"" Stuart said. Parents of children with lost limbs may also find it hard to adapt, she said. ""However much they love them, are (parents) still going to be able to support them and help their education and well-being as much as they could with an able child?"" The Pan American Health Organization said disabilities can cause significant and long-term economic and mental health problems for earthquake survivors. With so many earthquake victims having had or facing the prospect of amputations, Haiti's government should prioritize the issue of disability and support for disabled people, Stuart said. Before the earthquake, Haiti had only one facility that produced prosthetic limbs. It survived the earthquake but will not be able to meet current needs, Doubt said. ""They actually are able to start fabricating but ... they're very small, and the need is much greater,"" Doubt told CNN by phone from the organization's offices in Georgetown, Ontario. Even before the earthquake, he said, ""we were only really touching the need at the time."" There were about 800,000 Haitians with handicaps and disabilities before the earthquake, Doubt said. ""Handicapped in Haiti have been largely unattended to or abandoned by their governments, and there are very few medical organizations who attend to them or provide a focus on them, so it was a very large job to begin with,"" he said. ""There are going to be many more disabled (now), and among them a large population of newly amputated patients, and that population is going to grow."" Stuart explained that many people with injuries requiring amputation may not have made it yet to hospitals. Others may simply have skin wounds, but if they can't get to a hospital and their wounds become infected, it could necessitate amputation. Anticipating the need, the group Physicians for Peace has begun to collect prosthetics, crutches, canes, walkers and wheelchairs. Amputees are typically fitted with new limbs after two to four months of healing. Used prosthetics will be particularly beneficial in Haiti, where manufacturing artificial limbs is likely to be difficult, said Heather Mills, a U.N. Association goodwill ambassador. ""What I'm trying to do is appeal to people to ... contact Physicians for Peace and take back any limbs that they're not using,"" Mills told CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""We can reuse the components."" Mills, who was once married to Beatle Paul McCartney, lost part of her left leg in a 1993 vehicle crash. She has since been active in charities to clear land mines and provide artificial limbs to tens of thousands of people. ""I'm fully aware that they're not going to need the limbs for weeks, but it takes weeks to coordinate,"" Mills said. ""It takes weeks for people to donate. It takes weeks to get them packed and shipped."" Handicap International plans to produce between 300 and 400 emergency  prostheses in the next six months to cover the need until patients can receive more permanent ones, the group said. Physicians for Peace plans to set up a prosthesis production facility in Haiti, according to the group's Web site. ""We will work with our partners to identify whether we can use existing structures or somehow build temporary work space and bring in the specialized equipment needed to prepare and fit prosthetic devices: ovens, routers, vacuum pumps, drills, sanders and saws, as well as generators and lights,"" the Website said. Refurbished prosthetic limbs and mobility devices collected by the group will also be shipped to Haiti. Handicap International is also expanding its staff to around 100, and they will train local prosthetic technicians to meet the needs of amputees in the long term, Stuart said. ""Prosthetics need to be fitted -- they're not off the shelf -- so you need technicians there,"" Stuart said. Prosthetics ""need to be changed if the child is growing, if the person gains weight, loses weight."" CNN's Ed Payne in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Experts say Haiti's earthquake is creating ""a generation of amputees""

"(SuperYachtWorld) -- They may not be big on looks but explorer yachts can realize even the most intrepid traveler's desire for far-flung and exotic corners of the globe. Explorers offer all the comforts of traditional superyachts but with souped-up specifications -- an ice-strengthened hull to cope with polar ice or ocean-going capability. Which means these tough boats can cruise from Patagonia to the islands of the Caribbean and from the Arctic ice to the Mediterranean. They also come with an impressive array of gadgets and gizmos: Helicopters, fishing boats, luxury speed boats and state-of-the-art navigation gear are all among the play things likely to be aboard. While chartering one of these yachts is not within everyone's budget -- prices range from about $100,000 to $500,000 per week, depending on the season -- most people can relate to the fantasy of escaping the crowds and exploring some of the world's most remote and beautiful spots. 'Atmosphere' Why we like it: ""Atmosphere"" is more than a yacht -- it is the perfect escape for the 21st century adventurer. It is a specially designed platform from which to explore undiscovered Chilean Patagonia in three ways -- by air, land and water, using the yacht's on-board vehicles, which include a helicopter. Where has it been? It has been based off the fjord-like coast of Chile since its launch. Its cruising area is 400 or so nautical miles from Puerto Montt in the north to the Taitao peninsula. What its captain says: ""My crew will fly you in helicopters, drive you to see wildlife in special tenders and take you on rugged shore-based excursions in one of a fleet of all-terrain vehicles we keep ashore in strategically placed locations along the coastline. We can fly you in the helicopter to isolated ski slopes with virgin snow."" Victor Espinoza . Web site: nomadsoftheseas.com . 'Allure Shadow' Why we like it: ""Allure Shadow"" was built for a yacht owner who purchased a shadow boat to carry the toys for his big white yacht but then discovered he enjoyed the shadow more than the other one. It's not short on luxuries: every cabin has its own balcony. Where has it been? Most recently it was deployed to Bimini in the Bahamas where its huge hangar and massive crane were used to launch a research submarine that was looking for the lost city of Atlantis. What its captain says: ""There is nowhere we can't go. And wherever we go, we do so in style, carrying more tenders, toys and cars than you can shake a stick at. When you talk about carrying a helicopter, we ask how many would you like!"" Kostas Andreou. Web site: iyc.com . 'Senses' Why we like it: ""Senses"" is packed with toys, including a luxurious 13 meter ""Nelson tender"" speedboat with its own slipway system enabling guests to step directly aboard from the main deck, an 8.5 meter Herreshoff sailing sloop, a ""Hobie Cat"" catamaran, a Waverunner, an  meter fishing boat and a 7.5-meter RIB. Where has it been? With a decade of adventures under it belt, it is one of the few charter yachts that can cruise from pole to pole. Its current owner has already taken ""Senses"" around the world twice. What its captain says: ""'Senses' can acclimatize to every use, be it diving in the Tropics, three month-long self-contained adventures up the Amazon, or entertaining. Its flotilla of tenders can be customized to suit the adventure at hand and that includes the seven-seat helicopter with a range of 600 nautical miles."" Geordie Nicholson . Web site: burgessyachts.com . 'Big Aron' Why we like it This capacious 2004 yacht was refitted in 2006. With five decks reserved for guests it commands vast interior and exterior spaces. Where has it been? South America and Brazil, where it explored some amazing uncharted river deltas, and the Angra dos Reis south of Rio -- a perfect charter area with 365 islands, beautiful beaches with wonderful fishing. What its captain says: ""Our French Polynesia charter trips show off some of my yacht's better features. Its seaworthiness sailing between island groups and its ability to carry a large tender on deck, which we use to explore lagoons and diving areas, make it the perfect yacht. Our large deck spaces are good for bringing entertainment on board -- including, once, a large Tahitian dancing group!"" Will Kaye . Web site: camperandnicholsons.com . 'Titan' Why we like it: Built for the Royal Navy as ""HMS Beagle,"" it was one of a flotilla that undertook voyages around the world to ensure that the Admiralty's hydrographic charts were fully up-to-date. It is a classic example of how a yacht should be converted from a ship. Where has it been? Following a change of ownership, ""Titan"" was refitted again in 2007. It changed its hull color from white to dark blue, and set off around the world. What its captain says: ""Having charted the world for the Admiralty as ""Beagle,"" ""Titan"" is now ready to charter the world for the discerning guest."" Luca Lazzari . Web site: ocyachts.com . 'Devotion' Why we like it: ""Devotion"" was the first superyacht to enter Desolation Sound in British Columbia. Reliable, solid, and seaworthy, this is a vessel with beautiful and timeless lines. Where has it been? After three circumnavigations of the globe, it's now based in Alaska, and what a place to explore -- from lush green forests to glacial fjords. What its captain says: ""'Devotion' heightens your awareness of the surroundings. The big deck spaces and windows allow our guests to experience nature's beauty virtually the entire time aboard."" Dan Stabbert . Web site: njyachts.com/#home . 'Maverick II' Why we like it: ""Maverick II"" is loaded with sailing dinghies, kayaks, wind surfing boards, tows and a fighting chair for fishermen. This Japanese-built yacht is a proven world cruiser. Where has it been? Just about everywhere, but it's now based in Phuket, Thailand, giving it access to Indonesia, Singapore, Myanmar and India, as well as being able to offer all-year cruising. What its captain says: ""My crew is highly service oriented with several taking classes to learn new skills in their spare time, such as new massage techniques."" Robert Hossack . Web site: burgessyachts.com . 'Leo Fun' Why we like it: ""Leo Fun"" has a range of 5,000 miles at a cruising speed of 15 knots. The night-vision cameras with infrared to make the boat more secure. With four generators instead of the usual three, it's got the power to back up its explorer credentials. Where has it been? Launched in April last year, this Turkish beauty is still very new to the blue planet. What its captain says: ""Because of its solidity, seaworthiness and state-of-the-art navigation gear, I would be happy to take 'Leo Fun' anywhere with more than three meters of water.''
