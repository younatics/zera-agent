"A 53-year-old man who has sent over $100,000 to a woman he has never met in Nigeria insists he is only providing financial assistance until she inherits $25.6 million from her dead parents. Steve appeared on Dr Phil to discuss his unusual relationship with 'Kelly' who he met on an online dating website in 2012. He says the pair are legally married in Nigeria, even though he has never met her and they usually only communicate online. Steve, 53, has sent over $100,000 to 'Kelly' a woman he has never met in Nigeria because he believes she will soon inherit $25.6 million from her parents . Steve appeared on Dr Phil to discuss his unusual relationship with 'Kelly' who he met on an online dating website in 2012, then got legally married to her long-distance . Steve says he has been giving her the money for the last few years to help her until she receives her inheritance from her parents - she claims they were killed in an Ohio car crash in 2012. Steve sells his plasma - a yellowish liquid that has to be separated from blood - twice a week to ensure he can make payments to 'Kelly' who lives with 'James,' her 'attorney.' 'I've sent Kelly about $103,000 in the last 29 months,' he said on the show as a flabbergasted audience listened. 'I've not met Kelly, but it doesn't matter. I love her just the same. 'She has an inheritance coming, and I've always wanted to be a millionaire, so it's like a match made in heaven.' Steve says that when Kelly came back to the US he tried to met her, but it didn't work out. But when Dr Phil's team analysed an email she sent Steve claiming she was in South Dakota, the IP address revealed it was sent from Nigeria . Steve's sister, Tammy (left) says her brother (right) has been scammed in the past, and she thinks it is happening again . 'I just love her. She is very beautiful and warm, kind, caring and loving.' Steve says he has not met 'Kelly' as she needs to stay in Nigeria to help with signing the inheritance forms. He said that 'Kelly' came back to the US he tried to met her, but it didn't work out. But when Dr Phil's team analysed an email she sent Steve claiming she was in South Dakota, the IP address revealed it was sent from Nigeria. 'Kelly' told Steve she went to a nursing school in North Dakota, but when the show contacted the school they said no-one with her name had ever been enrolled. But 'Kelly' is not only person Steve is sending money to -  he says he is an accountant, and insists he is on the verge of becoming a multi-millionaire from several pending inheritance deals with overseas clients. He says he is sending them money to cover their legal fees as they fight to obtain their inheritances.

However the bank picked up on it and he was arrested. Steve's sister, Tammy, says she is worried as he has been scammed in the past. She is asking him to cut ties with 'Kelly' - and his other so-called clients. 'My brother is delusional,' Tammy says.

"This pasta recipe is so simple that even a dog can crack it. And in a new Youtube video, canine cook Chef Panda does just that, effortlessly preparing a delicious dish of spaghetti carbonara. The Boston Terrier, who features in films produced by American cookery and food delivery website Blue Apron, guides viewers through the process in a number of easy steps. Showing off his his enviable cooking skills, he chops, tosses and stirs with ease to make the decadent and creamy Italian dish. Mmmm Bacon: Blue Apron's Boston Terrier Chef Panda licks his lips in anticipation of his Italian meal . Before he starts, he first heads to the computer to make sure he has the right recipe for his Italian feast. After choosing a soundtrack Chef Panda heads to the kitchen to start preparations. First he thoroughly washes his paws under running water.Then he fills a pot with water before putting it on to boil. Next it’s time to chop the bacon. Carefully lifting the waxed paper so his paws don’t touch the meat, the puppy chef cautiously slices bacon before placing it in a bowl. He then pours some oil into a saucepan before sautéing the meat, carefully shaking the pan and stirring so all the bacon is browned. First things first: The puppy chef boils spaghetti (left) before draining it in his red colander (right) He takes the pan off the heat and tosses in bacon, egg and cheese mixture into the cooked spaghetti . While the bacon is cooking Chef Panda cracks an egg into a bowl and whips it gently with a fork. He follows this by grating some pecorino cheese into a saucepan. As the water has now boiled, he throws some spaghetti into the pot. A few minutes later he lifts out a strand to test and nods in approval as it is perfectly al dente. Draining the pasta, the clever pup saves some of the starchy cooking water before he transfers the hot noodles into the pan with the bacon. With impeccable timing, he quickly combines the eggs, starchy cooking water, and cheese with the noodles. Time for dinner! The Boston Terrier can't wait to dig into his Italian feast, which is plated up in a blue bowl . Taking the pan off the heat, Panda thoroughly tosses the spaghetti so every strand is coated in the eggy-cheesy-bacony mixture. Chef Panda then plates the spaghetti in a blue bowl, puts a gingham napkin around his neck and digs into his delicious meal, which is accompanied by a large glass of red wine. The film, which was uploaded on YouTube by American cooking website Blue Apron was filmed by filmmakers Matthew Wadiak and Daniel Schloss. Puppy Chef Panda is the company’s resident Boston Terrier who, the company say, is a ‘really good cook.’ The video currently has over 30,000 shares.","Chef Panda is resident puppy chef for cookery website Blue Apron .

"They’re one of the most popular pets and are kept in captivity throughout the world, yet little is known about the quality of rabbits’ lives. Now, a new study has revealed that some pet rabbits suffer the side effects of living alone as well as health issues including dental problems and poor fitness levels. The findings show that the needs of rabbits are not always met and will be used by animal welfare charity, the RSPCA, to ensure owners know how best to look after their pets. Scroll down for video . a new study has revealed that some pet rabbits suffer from living alone, health issues such as dental problems and no access to exercising areas. A stock image of three happy rabbits is shown . Scientists from the University of Bristol’s School of Veterinary Sciences took note of how rabbits are housed and cared for by collecting questionnaires from a cross-section of 1,254 pet rabbit owners in the South West, North West and East of England. The researchers found that while most of the creatures had access to extra areas for exercise, access was often irregular. For example, many owners didn’t let their pets run around when they are naturally at their most active – in the early morning and evening. The researchers found that while most of the creatures had access to extra areas for exercise (stock image, left) access was often irregular. As in previous studies, dental problems were commonly reported in 12 per cent of rabbits. Rabbits teeth (pictured right) grow 3 millimetres every week . Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK, with 1.7 million kept as pets. They are highly sociable and need toys to play with, a suitable companion or human attention. They are inquisitive and need to interact and play with other friendly animals or people. Rabbits need access to safe hiding places so they can hide from anything that scares them, such as the smell of predators, like foxes. They are intelligent and can be taught to respond to commands using positive reward-based training. Rabbits are active animals and need to exercise daily - ideally in the morning and evening when they are at their most active. They eat droppings called caecotrophs to allow food to be re-ingested, but also need hay for their emotional wellbeing as well as dental and digestive health, the RSPCA says. Rabbits mark their territory with chin secretions, urine and droppings to communicate and also like to dig. The charity says that owners should look out for behaviour changes and signs of stress or fear. Pets that are frightened or in pain may become aggressive or timid and spend time hiding. Chewing cage bars, over-grooming, altered feeding and toilet habits, sitting hunched up, circling or a reluctance to move, are all signs of unhappiness in rabbits. Around 60 per cent of the 1,254 rabbits lived on their own, limiting their opportunity to be sociable, while a quarter lived with unsuitable companions, leading to fights or the animals ignoring each other. The study, published in BMC Research Notes suggests a small amount of this behaviour may be natural, but that regular and intense fighting can suggest the companions are unsuited and behavioural advice should be sought. As in previous studies, dental problems were commonly reported in 12 per cent of rabbits, as were eye problems, (13 per cent) digestive problems, (12 per cent) and parasites (11 per cent). Just under 60 per cent of rabbits were thought to be fearful of loud noises and a similar percentage panicked when handled by their owners. The researchers say that further studies are needed to explore the accuracy of the owners' reports, in case problems have been under-reported. ‘Many pet rabbits were found to be in good health, had compatible companions and were provided with enriched living areas,’ said Dr Nicola Rooney, Research Fellow in Farm Animal Science at the university. ‘However, we also found numerous unrecognised welfare issues that affect large numbers of pet rabbits. ‘These included living alone or in incompatible groups, numerous health issues, lack of regular access to exercise areas, showing fear of loud noises and behaving anxiously when handled by their owners. ‘Our findings highlight the ways in which the needs of pet rabbits are often not being met and this information will be used to help target education to best improve the welfare of pet rabbits.’ Dr Jane Tyson, Rabbit Behaviour and Welfare Expert at the RSPCA, said that the findings of this study will be ‘crucial’ in identifying advice and information for owners on how best to care for their rabbits. Around 60 per cent of the 1,254 rabbits surveyed lived on their own, limiting their opportunity to be sociable, while a quarter lived with unsuitable companions, leading to fights or the animals ignoring each other.","Study by the University of Bristol shows rabbits needs are not always met .

"A carjacker has been caught on camera stealing a woman's Mini and dragging the owner 30ft along the road before abandoning her in the street. Nikki Law-Priddey left the car engine running and the door open as she de-iced the vehicle sitting on her driveway in Birmingham on a freezing morning last week. Just moments later, a man in a baseball cap sprinted towards the £16,000 Mini Cooper and jumped into the driver's seat. Theft: A carjacker was caught on CCTV running over to Nikki Law-Priddey's car on her driveway . Taken: He jumped into the driver's seat of the Mini Cooper, which had its door open and engine running . Reaction: Mrs Law-Priddey ran back to her vehicle and tried to force the carjacker to get out . Mrs Law-Priddey, 30, tried to drag him out of the car, but he managed to drive off as she desperately hung on to the door. Eventually the business developer was forced to let go, and the thief got away leaving her lying injured in the street with a broken hand and bruising. Her pet dog Pippin - a Bichon Frise - ran after her, and woke her up by licking her face. The whole incident, which took place in the Bartley Green suburb of Birmingham last Thursday, was caught on a CCTV camera fixed to Mrs Law-Priddey's house. Police were able to retrieve the Mini, which the thief had apparently planned to sell on using false number plates, and have arrested a man on suspicion of robbery. Escape: The thief drove away from the house, dragging the car's owner along behind him . Callous: The carjacker drove 30ft into the public road as Mrs Law-Priddey desperately tried to cling on . Injured: Mrs Law-Priddey, circled in this image, was left with a broken hand and bruised back and legs . Anger: The carjacking victim, pictured, posted footage of her ordeal on Facebook . Mrs Law-Priddey, who is married and has a six-year-old daughter, posted video footage of the carjacking on her Facebook page in a bid to find the 'scum' responsible - and urged other drivers to be careful about leaving their engines running. 'These past 24 hours have been the worst time of my life, to say I am in total shock and disbelief to what has happened to me on my own doorstep in broad day light is a understatement,' she wrote. 'Carjacking is on the rise. Do not leave your car running to de-ice it, scum like this wait for people just like me to make this mistake. When you get in the car lock the doors and stay safe. 'Never in a million years did I think this would happen to me especially in broad daylight on my own drive.' She added: 'My car has been recovered by the police and is in forensics. 'I know these scumbags talk and he would have tried to sell this car, when it was found false plates were on it.' Speaking after the ordeal, Mrs Law-Priddey said: 'The car wasn't insured because I was selling it that day and that's what I was panicking about. I think if it was insured I'd probably have been like, ""Just take the car."" 'But I'm quite a feisty person, it was just my natural instinct to jump in on top of him. I kept saying to him, ""You're going to kill me, you're going to kill me,"" and he's like, ""Just let go of the car.""' Her sister Becky said Mrs Law-Priddey had been left traumatised by the carjacking, and is fortunate to be alive. Car: The Mini has been retrieved and a man has been arrested on suspicion of robbery . Home: Mrs Law-Priddey had a CCTV camera attached to her house allowing her to capture video footage . Damage: Mrs Law-Priddey with her jumper which was ruined during the ordeal . Ruined: Her shoes were also damaged while the jeans she was wearing were completely ripped apart . 'She was dragged under the car and out in the road by this person,' she said. 'She is very lucky that she was not even more seriously injured, or killed. 'We have been circulating pictures of the car in the hope that the person who took it can be found. 'After seeing footage of her being dragged along the ground under the wheels of her car I can't believe she's actually alive.' West Midlands Police said they had arrested a 25-year-old man on suspicion of robbery yesterday over the incident yesterday and he had been bailed while investigations continue. Detective Constable Stuart Parker added: 'We're doing all we can to find whoever was responsible and as well as arresting one man in connection with the robbery, we're also carrying out a forensic examination of the vehicle. 'This happened in broad daylight and we would urge anyone who witnessed anything which might be relevant to our investigation to contact us.' He added: 'We'd also like to remind people there are always opportunistic thieves around looking for an easy steal, and not to leave cars unlocked and unattended, with the keys in the ignition.' Mrs Law-Priddey has urged anyone with information to call police on 101 or ring Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.","Nikki Law-Priddey, 30, was de-icing Mini Cooper outside Birmingham home .

"Arrested: Isaac Tiharihondi, 19, allegedly murdered his parents and five-year-old brother last week . A teenager killed his pastor father, Sunday school teacher mother and five-year-old brother after his parents found out he'd lied about joining the Marines, according to authorities. Isaac Tiharihondi, from Houston, Texas, was arrested and charged with capital murder after police found him Jackson, Mississippi around 2.30am on Wednesday. His arrest comes two days after the bodies of Episcopalian Reverend Dr. Israel Ahimbisibwe, his wife Dorcus and their son, Israel Jr., were found stacked up inside their Houston apartment. Isaac Tiharihondi used items including a bat, a hammer and a lamp to beat his parents to death, while his little brother had been stabbed with a kitchen knife, according to the criminal complaint. Tiharihondi had told friends and family that he had joined the Marines and was leaving at the end of the month - but his parents did not believe him and planned to confront him about it, ABC13 reported. Recruiters in Houston said there is no record of him ever enlisting in the Marines. Family members and friends said the latest they heard from the couple was Tuesday January 27. After the murders, friends said that Tiharihondi seemed normal. He went to lunch with a friend and made an apparently fake phone call to his mother, who was already dead, ABC13 reported.

Neighbors said they last saw him at the home on Friday evening but had not seen him since. He is now awaiting extradition back to Harris County. Isaac, who graduated from Memorial High School last year, shared the apartment with his parents and little brother, who they called 'Jay', KPRC reported. The couple's third son, Emmanuel, 17, was at his private school in California at the time. Their bodies were found in a back bedroom by firefighters on Monday morning after parishioners raised the alarm when they failed to turn up to church on Sunday. It is not yet clear how long the bodies had been inside the home, and the results of their autopsies have not yet been released. Parishioner Keever Wallace told the channel on Monday that he and his wife Brooke had visited the family's apartment on Sunday but when they knocked, they received no answer. 'He didn't show up for church yesterday afternoon, which is totally out of character for them not to let us know, and didn't respond to text or phone calls,' Wallace added. Concerned, Brooke Wallace spoke to an apartment manager on Monday and firefighters were let inside. The bodies were found stacked up inside, according to sources. Scene: The victims' bodies were reportedly found stacked up inside their apartment on Monday after church members contacted authorities and were given permission to enter the home . Probe: Police investigate the scene on Monday after the bodies of the parents and little boy were found . Church: The Rev. Dr. Israel Ahimbisibwe served at Church of the Redeemer, Episcopal . The family died from fatal blows, sources told KPRC. No signs of forced entry were found. The Church of the Redeemer, Episcopal's website says the vicar was from Uganda and had studied at Princeton Theological Seminary, Harvard University Divinity School and Rice University. Dorcus Ahimbisibwe was a Sunday school teacher at The Church of the Redeemer, Episcopal, according to KTRK. In a statement, the Episcopalian Bishop of Texas, Bishop C. Andrew Doyle, said: 'This is a horrific and awful tragedy. We are in touch with the police and Israel's family here in Houston. 'Please keep the Ahimbisibwe and Redeemer families in your prayers.' A prayer service was held for the family on Tuesday evening.

"It is the festival that honours the Hindu god Muruga and involves devotees piercing their tongues, cheeks and even wearing hooks embedded in their backs. And joining the locals in Malaysia for the Thaipusam Festival was an Australian former diplomat, who for the first time decided to take part in the painful rituals that make up the colourful event. Carl Vadivella Belle, 64, joined more than a million Hindus who throng temples throughout Malaysia for the celebration, dancing to music, carrying heavy decorated frames that can weigh up to 220lbs as penance and piercing their bodies. Australian football fan and Hindu Carl Vadivella Belle receiving a tongue and cheek piercing during the Hindu Thaipusam festival in Malaysia . The devotee, from Adelaide, has spent 20 years attending the festival, but for the first time decided to join locals in having skewers put through his cheeks and tongue and carry and elaborate 'kavadi' frames decorated with peacock feathers. It was during a four-year stint at the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur that Carl developed an interest in Hinduism, so he returned to the Malaysian capital with 1.6million others to visit the iconic Batu Caves. The Australian, who lived on a farm with his wife Wendy, had to fast for 48 days before the festival began, with no alcohol, meat, TV or sex - and he slept on a bare floor. French photographer Eric Lafforgue, who followed Carl to Malaysia for the ceremony, said the Hindu convert is popular with locals for getting involved with the traditional kavadi dance, performed at the festival. 'He is the only white man who does the kavadi and has a huge popularity with Indians as they admire him,' said Lafforgue. Carl fasted for 48 days before the festival, and abstained from alcohol, meat, TV and sex. He even slept on a bare floor . Carl is popular with locals, as he is the only white man who gets involved in the traditional kavadi dancing that comes as part of the ceremony . The word kavadi also refers to this metal and wooden structure, which Carl must carry through the streets as part of the festival. It is meant to signify a heavy burden, and can be painful to carry under the hot Malaysian sun. Carl rents the kavadi for $150 USD . Before the ceremony Carl prayed with the priests, so he could get into a trance-like state before receiving his piercings. Thousands of people flock to Thaipusam ceremonies  during the Tamil month of Thai (January/February) across Southeast Asia. 'Pusam' means star in Tamil. As well as Malaysia, Thaipusam is also celebrated in countries with a large Tamil population, including Sri Lanka, Guadeloupe, Indonesia, Thailand and Myanmar. Carl joins the priests to pray before the ceremony, which will get him into a trance-like state before the piercing session . Everyone involved in the ceremony makes a special donation to the god Muruga, of inscensem fruits, coconuts and incense . As he waits his turn to be pierced, Carl watches and holds onto the needle that priest will use to pierce his tongue and cheek . Carl and other onlookers watch another man involved in the ceremony, in a state of trance, with a huge metal bar going through his cheeks . The moment Carl receives his piercing. He says he is not afraid of the pain that he will endure as part of the religious ceremony . It is believed that after fasting, people getting pierced during the Thaipusam ceremony will not feel any pain. After praying, Carl waited to be pierced, telling photographer Lafforgue he wasn't afraid of the needle, which slices through the flesh of the cheeks and tongue. 'He is not afraid of the pain of the hooks and the needles, his spirit is above pain in the trance,' explained Lafforgue. 'Even if Carl was told there would be no pain thanks to his fasting, it is hard to believe it, looking at his face. Carl could not speak as he has a needle in his tongue but I felt he was really in another world.' When Carl converted to Hinduism, his wife and three children followed suit. The former diplomat explained that his most significant kavadi procession was his third, in the 1980s, during which he prayed for his mother-in-law who was very ill with cancer. She lived for another six years afterwards, and was fit enough to travel all over the world. Carl believes that it was the god Muruga who saved her. The pain isn't quite over though - Carl is adorned with chains that are hooked onto his back and chest before he is ready to put on the kavadi . Carl dons his kavadi, which is decorated exactly as he wants. A kavadi usually weighs between 20 and 40 kilograms, depending on the design . Carl walks with his kavadi without shoes. Here, he has stopped for people to massage his feet and pour water onto his legs . Carl walks barefoot through the streets on hot tarmac, along with supporters and other people carrying kavadis. Some design their kavadis with peacock feathers, as Muruga often used these. Others prefer to decorate theirs with flowers or photos of Muruga . Carl changed his name to Vadivella Belle in the 1980s, after his third kavadi procession, which he believes saved his mother-in-law from cancer .","Australian Carl Vadivella Belle took part in the Hindu ceremony, having his tongue and cheek pierced .

"Prince Charles has fought back against speculation that he intends to be a ‘meddling monarch’. In a rare move, his most senior aide has written a public letter rejecting claims that the Queen is concerned her son will be an ‘activist’ king. A new biography, Charles: Heart Of A King by Catherine Mayer, says the prince wants a different model for his role as sovereign. Hitting back: Prince Charles has denied claims that he intends to be a politically active King . But in a letter to The Times, which is serialising the book, Charles’s principle private secretary William Nye calls the claims ‘ill-informed speculation’. Charles, he insists, is ‘inspired’ by his mother’s example and understands the ‘necessary and proper limitations’ on the role of a constitutional monarch. Clarence House declined to comment further, saying the letter ‘spoke for itself’ but it is clear it would not have been sent without the prince’s agreement. Officials also stressed that ‘no one has any way of knowing the content of the private conversations between His Royal Highness and Her Majesty’. Miss Mayer’s book, published today, portrays the prince as ‘driven by guilt’ and flying into fits of ‘royal rage’, leading some to dub his court ‘Wolf Hall’ – after Hilary Mantel’s best-selling novel about the court of Henry VIII. In his letter, published yesterday, Mr Nye says: ‘There has been ill-informed speculation recently, in your columns and elsewhere, about the attitude of the Prince of Wales to the role of sovereign. ‘His Royal Highness has always preferred not to comment on matters which relate to a future whose date is unknown and would arise only after the death of his mother. ‘In half a century in public life, few could be better placed than His Royal Highness to understand the necessary and proper limitations on the role of a constitutional monarch. 'Should he be called to the throne, the Prince of Wales will be inspired by the examples of his mother and grandfather [George VI], while drawing also on his own experience of a lifetime of service.’ Claims: Catherine Mayer, left, has made the allegations in a new book, right, based on interviews with aides . Defence: Charles's secretary Sir William Nye, pictured, wrote to The Times to defend the Prince . Sir, There has been ill-informed speculation recently, in your columns and elsewhere, about the attitude of the Prince of Wales to the role of sovereign. His Royal Highness has always preferred not to comment on matters which relate to a future whose date is unknown, and would arise only after the death of his mother. After half a century in public life, few could be better placed than His Royal Highness to understand the necessary and proper limitations on the role of a constitutional monarch. Should he be called to the throne, the Prince of Wales will be inspired by the examples of his mother and grandfather, while drawing also on his own experience of a lifetime of service. He will seek to continue his service to this country and the other realms, to the Commonwealth and to the wider world. William Nye . Principal Private Secretary to Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall . Miss Meyer, editor at large for Time magazine, claims that she was given ‘remarkable access’ to Charles and secured ‘exclusive interviews’ with his inner circle. Stung by the less-than-flattering portrayal of the prince, however, Clarence House made clear the book is not an official biography and claimed Miss Mayer exaggerated the level of access she enjoyed. Yesterday the author insisted her book was much more sympathetic to the prince than the extracts suggest. A spokesman for Charles told the Mail at the weekend: ‘The Prince of Wales cares deeply about this country and has devoted most of his working life to helping individuals and organisations to make a difference for the better – and not for his personal gain. 'He takes an active interest in the issues and challenges facing the UK and around the world through his own work and that of his charities.’ Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at King’s College London, has dismissed claims the prince has already forfeited his political neutrality. ‘[Charles] might comment on matters which are controversial, but he has never done so in a party political way,’ he told the Mail. ‘He knows what being monarch requires, and he will I am absolutely sure observe all the rules of constitutional monarchy.’","New book claims the Queen is worried about her son's plans for the throne .

"The owners and visitors of a southern California pet shop have been happily reunited with their mascot, a female iguana named Godzilla who was stolen from the store's courtyard. Paramount Pet Entertainment's store in  Los Angeles appealed for help after its mascot, the seven-year-old reptile, was stolen  in broad daylight on Monday. Store surveillance cameras captured video of a man reaching down and stealing the three-foot lizard up from the store's courtyard just after 12.30pm. Media coverage of the theft helped lead to Godzilla's return after a nearby pet shop owner who bought the lizard for $200 saw the news and gave it back, Paramount Pet's Holly Cepeda told Daily Mail Online. Scroll down for video . Godzilla the iguana has been returned to Paramount Pet Entertainment's store in Los Angeles by a nearby pet shop owner after being stolen Monday . A man was caught on camera dipping down to the ground and stealing Godzilla from the store owned by Holly Cepeda and her family . The lizard was sold to a store 15 minutes from Mrs Cepeda's for $200 and returned after the buyer realized it was stolen . The store appealed for help in identifying the thief, who took the iguana back to his Dodge Charger before entering another shop . 'My whole family is happy,' the store owner said after she saw the lizard again and it crawled up her husband's leg. A pet store about 15 minutes drive away from Mrs Cepeda's contacted the family-owned store Wednesday morning around 9.30am after he saw coverage of the iguana theft. Paramount Pets plans on fully reimbursing the owner of the shop, who did not want his store or himself identified. Mrs Cepeda said that she was anxious when driving over to find her pet, but was able to recognize the animal instantly after seeing her. The animal was cold, and its owners believe that the thief did not feed the iguana. Video footage of a mustachioed man taking the three and a half pound animal back to his car, a new gray Dodge Charger, circulated around Los Angeles after Monday's theft. Both thief and iguana remained at large after authorities pulled the man and lizard over for a traffic citation, but let them go because the police report had not yet been filed, Mrs Cepeda said. The store made a report and asked for assistance from the public in identifying the thief, who has dark hair with a widow's peak and was wearing baggy clothes. Paramount Pets uses their reptiles in shows for schools and parties and said that Godzilla is 'priceless' Godzilla, a seven-year-old female iguana, has her own Instagram account where her owners  asked for help finding her . Godzilla, which acts as the store's mascot and has an Instagram account, is sometimes petted by visitors who come to see her when she spends the daytime hours outside. Owners had hoped that spreading the story in the community would 'touch someone's heart and they bring her back'. Mrs Cepeda speculates that the thief probably tried to get rid of the lizard as soon as he could after the story was picked up by local news outlets. Video footage showed Godzilla fighting back against her kidnapper, who entered nearby shops both before and after putting the iguana in his car. The lizard, who generally not like being picked up, is seen scratching and whipping its tail at the man while being taken from her home. Iguanas are listed on Paramount Pet's website for $450, though Godzilla's owners told CBS Los Angeles that their pet is 'priceless'. The store also shows off its reptiles in performances at schools and birthday parties and Mrs Cepeda said that Godzilla 'will be a little bit more famous' at the performances. 'I'm going to keep a good eye on her from now on.' Mrs Cepeda said that the thief had been seen with an iguana two hours before they made a police report .","Paramount Pet Entertainment's store called the animal its mascot .

"London could soon become a popular destination for large cruise ships if plans for a new passenger terminal in Greenwich move forward. It is hoped that the mooring at Enderby Wharf would open in 2017 and become the capital’s first new terminal since the closure of the Royal Docks in 1981. The hub would allow ships up to 820ft long to stop near popular tourist attractions such as the Old Royal Naval College and Cutty Sark, The Times reported. Smaller cruise ships can dock alongside HMS Belfast after sailing past Tower Bridge's raised bascules . New plans from Westcourt Real Estate are to be submitted to Greenwich council within weeks and show that the mooring would be used for the start and finish of cruises, the newspaper reported. Westcourt has not revealed the cost of the new terminal, and lead architect Jonathan Manser said a previous design failed to meet the requirements. He told The Times: ‘In particular we have increased the size of the terminal building to accommodate baggage handling for passengers embarking and disembarking and to improve the overall experience within the terminal. ‘We have altered the access for vessel servicing, as longer stays mean that the cruise ships will need to load and unload stores and provisions.’ A terminal that can accommodate large ships would provide a boost for tourism by bringing more cruise options closer to London and delivering thousands of visitors to the city every year. A new cruise ship passenger terminal would be located near the Royal Naval College and Cutty Sark . According to The Times, vessels expected to use the terminal include Silversea’s 36,000-ton Silver Spirit, which is 682ft long and can accommodate 540 passengers and 376 crew. But Londoners should not expect to see some of the world’s largest ships because the Thames is not deep enough to accommodate them. Cruise ships of up to 682ft in length currently dock at Greenwich Ship Tier, a floating terminal where passengers have to board and disembark using a launch. Ships up to 518ft can moor alongside HMS Belfast after sailing past Tower Bridge’s raised bascules. Earlier this month, authorities in Venice, Italy overturned a ban on giant cruise ships passing through the centre of the canal city. The ban imposed last November applied to cruise ships of more than 96,000 gross tons and limited the number of ships of 40,000 tons or more to five per day.","It is hoped the new terminal would open in 2017 at Enderby Wharf .

"Although victory rolls and ankle length skirts may seem a little dated to many women in their twenties, for one it is a way of life. Holly Foster, 22, prides herself on her lady-like attire, adopting the style of women in 1950s, which has recently seen her crowned Miss Vintage UK. However, her floral prints and pearls are more than just a style statement as Holly says dressing this way - and 'not like Miley Cyrus' - is the only way to demand real respect from men. Scroll down for video. Holly Foster dresses in an entirely vintage style wardrobe and shuns modern day provocative dressing . Encouraging her peers to lengthen their skirts - the fashion enthusiast has controversially claimed girls today were often left 'vulnerable' because of their provocative clothing - and are led to believe they will achieve fame and fortune like the controversial singer by not wearing much. Holly, from Welling, Kent, even suggests that women who dress in a more revealing manner could encourage unwanted attention. Holly said: 'Girls my age will go out on the town in skimpy - largely unflattering - clothing and they are surprised when they are not treated with respect. Holly says that by dressing in this fashion young women can provoke a better reaction from men . Holly lives by the motto 'dress like a lady and be treated like a lady' 'If you dress like a lady you will be treated like a lady. A short skirt or perhaps more a see-through top, encourages a man to come and take advantage, it encourages unwanted attention.' Holly added that she had witnessed it in action when she has been on nights out with friends. 'I go to nightclubs like other girls my age and when I do I'm always struck by the same thing. 'You walk into a room all the guys are looking at you, just up and down like you're a piece of meat and I think if girls had longer skirts they would feel more confident and safe. The 22-year-old was recently crowned Miss Vintage UK (pictured here) and says her role model is Dita Von Teese . Controversial: Holly says dressing like Miley Cyrus attracts the wrong sort of attention . 'I think there is a certain element of responsibility that comes with designing clothes and an element of responsibility when it comes to wearing them.' Holly recommends converting to her strict dress regime in order 'to be treated like a lady.' 'I think if girls dressed more demurely they would find they would be treated more as adults particularly and treated like ladies. 'If you compare a modern day woman with a vintage 1950s lady, the difference is just that - she's a lady.' Despite her admiration of the burlesque stripper Holly shuns Miley Cyrus and says her provocative dress is a bad influence on young girls . Holly says that modern media is to blame for negative teenage body image and if young women were to embrace the 50s silhouette there would be less body confidence issues . The 22-year-old was quick to add that although she would never wish any harm on women because of the way they dress she believes they should be wary. 'I don't believe anyone under any circumstances anyone should be taken advantage of, however when it comes to clothes young women have to take responsibility for their look if they do not wish to be left in a vulnerable position. Holly blames current pop stars for their influence on young stars with her being particularly unimpressed by one chart topper. Favouring the style of Audrey Hepburn  she added: 'I think Miley Cyrus in particular who is always in the news for wearing very little just gives the wrong image to young girls. 'It tells her young fans that being naked means success and she is influencing them to wear very little in the hope of fame and fortune.' Holly's penchant for retro outfits has become more of an obsession over the years and she admits to spending her entire maintenace loan at uni on skirts, cardigans and cotton gloves . Holly didn't start her vintage transformation until she was 17 and said before she discovered the retro styles she had felt awkward in high street fashions . Despite her shunning of the scantily clad, Holly's idol may come as a slight surprise and slightly contradictory in the form of a Burlesque stripper. However, Holly claims this kind of nudity is slightly more tasteful. 'I think Dita Von Teese has got it absolutely right, though she is incredibly sexy and a burlesque dancer she dresses like a lady, she leaves something to the imagination - she looks classic.' Holly's vintage influence began at an early age. Growing up with her grandparents, Holly would watch endless old movies from the 1940s and 1950s and soon became a big fan of the musical Grease. Holly first became fascinated with all things 50s while watching the movie Grease as a child . The Miss Vintage UK winner controversially added that she believed that revealing clothing 'encourages a man to come and take advantage' But it wasn't until she joined a musical theatre course when she was 17 she had the confidence to undergo her vintage make over - first purchasing a 1960s crimplene dress in a charity shop. While studying at university of Norwich, Holly admits that her habit soon became an obsession blowing her 'entire maintenance loan' at vintage fairs becoming addicted with cardigans, cotton gloves and long circle skirts. Now she will only wear 'granny style' clothing and has spent more than £2,000 creating her pin-up 1950s collection. Holly says that not everyone is as keen on her vintage look with her mum dubbing her outfits 'granny style' Obsessed with homing the perfect look and collecting precious items, Holly hopes to purchase a Lilli Ann suit worth up to £3,000 which she describes as the 'Ferrari of the vintage world.' But Holly wasn't always so confident in her appearance, and says that before discovering retro styles she had struggled to accept her body growing up and blamed feeling awkward in 'ill fitting high street fashion'. The blogger, who works in retail, believes if women were encouraged to dress for their shape rather than fashioned on the 'straight up and down Primark mannequins' less teens would suffer from body image issues as she did. 'I definitely feel in the recent years we've seen more coverage of why its irresponsible for magazines to print stick thin models. Holly has now spent almost £2000 funding her habit . 'It encourages girls to want to try and emulate that kind of figure without considering the consequences - it results in anorexia, girls looking gaunt.' Holly added that the contemporary media obviously played  a large part in influencing young women and vintage influences had been more realistic. 'What is really interesting is when you look at vintage magazines the 1950s really embraces all shapes and sizes because young women were told how to dress for their shape. 'Someone like Audrey Hepburn was very slim but it was never about that it was about her fabulous style. 'Today in our fashion magazines, the fashion industry uses tiny models as clothes horses in baggy tops and tight jeans and young girls are left disappointed when they look fat or ill shaped in their clothes. 'If more girls dressed for their figures, they embraced the fifties outlook on fashion I believe we would have less eating disorders, less girls being so desperate to be skinny. 'Young people would concentrate on wanting to look nice rather than being as thin as possible. It would be about the clothes and not about the size of them.' Last August she was crowned Miss Vintage UK for ability to put together 'the perfect 1950s outfit' and now models within the Vintage community. 'I think I love the vintage community because it embraces more than just wardrobe, everyone is very respectful and well mannered. It has old fashioned values which has been lost in our society today.' Although Holly hopes to inspire others to join her way of dressing she admits that her friends and family are not entirely on board. 'I have friends who dress 'normal' and they accept me for the way I am. They find it funny sometimes but I suppose its each to their own. 'My mum struggles with it sometimes because I don't dress like her friends daughters she will describe them as my 'granny dresses' but overall my family are supportive of my look.' As for gaining respect from men Holly says that she receives a very positive reaction from the opposite sex. 'Men I meet tell me I look attractive because I leave a little something to the imagination and I find older people will often come up to me and say ""I used to wear that""'","Holly Foster, 22,  was recently crowned Miss Vintage UK .

"Indonesia's courts have rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who have been named in the new round of executions. Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law, and their transformation over a decade in jail. Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected. Scroll down for video . Indonesia's courts have rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Australians Andrew Chan (right) and Myuran Sukumaran (left), who have been named in the new round of executions . The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted. 'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali. Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts. Attorney-General HM Prasetyo on Wednesday told reporters some embassies had been notified their citizens would be among the next group of prisoners to be executed. Before the review, the Indonesian Attorney General claimed that the appeal would be rejected due to there being only one exhausted entitlement for judicial review. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Julian McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006. 'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. 'In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp. On Monday it was revealed that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law, and their transformation over a decade in jail . According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan. From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago. Meanwhile appeals for the two men's lives continue to be made, the latest of which has come from a British band known as one of the Indonesian President's favourites. Napalm Death's lead singer Mark 'Barney' Greenway penned a letter to Joko Widodo asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers . Napalm Death's lead singer Mark 'Barney' Greenway penned a letter to Joko Widodo asking him to grant clemency to the convicted drug traffickers and posting the open letter  to the band's Facebook page last month, for their 729,000 followers to read. Mr Widodo is said to be a big fan of metal, and recently revealed in an interview that he discovered the genre when he stumbled across a thrash metal band gig when he was just 14 years old. 'I am appealing directly to you to please spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australian citizens who are currently awaiting the death sentence in Indonesia for heroin smuggling,' the letter began. 'As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual. Mr Widodo is said to be a big fan of metal, and recently revealed in an interview that he discovered the genre when he stumbled across a thrash metal band gig when he was just 14 years old . Dear Mr Widodo, . I am appealing directly to you to please spare the lives of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, the two Australian citizens who are currently awaiting the death sentence in Indonesia for heroin smuggling. As a follower of our band Napalm Death, you would appreciate that our lyrics and ethos challenge the unbroken cycle of violence in the world, whether it comes from a state or as an individual. If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind. I understand that you are standing as a leader determined to change things for the better, and so I believe granting clemency would be a major step forward in this pursuit of betterment. I appreciate that heroin can be damaging on many levels, but I believe that this is a much deeper issue that cannot be changed or altered by simply taking away the lives of people. Again, I respectfully ask that you make a real difference and overturn these sentences. In hope and peace, . Mark 'Barney' Greenway (Napalm Death) 'If these things are not challenged and ultimately changed, I believe we will never truly move forward as humankind,' the post continued. Joko Widodo has been pictured posing while wearing a Napalm Death t-shirt on multiple occasions, and is reportedly a big fan of other heavy metal bands such as Metallica, Megadeath and Lamb of God. He is also known for his hardline approach to issues such as drug trafficking, selling his election campaign - in part - on tougher penalties for criminals. Napalm Death is a band credited with defining the grindcore genre - an amalgamation of elements from hardcore death and punk metal. They also hold a Guinness World Record for the world's shortest song - titled You Suffer with a duration of 1.316 seconds.","A judicial review application submitted by Andrew Chan and Myruan Sukumaran has been rejected by the Denpasar District Court chief .

"A student suffering from a tomato ketchup phobia claims her fear is so severe she starts gagging and is scared for her life whenever she comes into contact with the sauce. Lauren Dodd, a 21-year-old student at Newcastle University, is so terrified of the red stuff she feels sick whenever she sees it - and when a friend accidentally squirted her with some she almost fainted. Ms Dodd, who is in the third year of her studies, suffers from the extremely rare mortuuequusphobia - the extreme fear of ketchup and tomato-based sauces. Scroll down for video . Lauren Dodd (pictured), 21, said her fear of the sauce is so severe she feels scared for her life when she comes into contact with it . She said: 'I don't know what's wrong with me, but tomato sauce absolutely terrifies me. Whenever I see it, I just start gagging and feel genuinely afraid for my life - my friends say I'm condimental. 'Unsurprisingly, people tend not to understand, but to me it's the worst thing in the entire world - it's scarier than all the horror films rolled into one.' The journalism student is so afraid of ketchup that she has to leave the room whenever one of her five housemates has some on their dinner - despite not being bothered by brown sauce. Lauren Dodd lives in fear of tomato ketchup . Dr Sandi Mann, a senior psychology lecturer at the University of Central Lancashire and author of the book 'Overcome Phobias and Panic Attacks', said she was not at all surprised by Ms Dodd's unusual phobia. She said: 'I'm not surprised, I haven't come across that particular one before but there are all sorts of weird and wonderful phobias. 'I'd use a programme in which you combine relaxation therapy, desensitisation and gradual exposure to the feared stimulus.' Dr Mann said this involve teaching Ms Dodd the 'relaxation skills' to cope with the anxiety she felt when exposed to ketchup, then creating a hierarchy of what scares her from least to worst - such as a picture of a tomato or a tomato bottle, or the sauce itself. Finally, she would be gradually exposed to each of these images or products starting with the item which scared her the least. Dr Mann added: 'She'd learn to manage the stress that that produces. It's like a ladder - you go up each rung at a time so she's completely relaxed about the rung before. 'It's very, very effective as the client is motivated - they want to get it sorted and it can be treated very, very, successful.' Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, she said: 'I know it's weird, but for me, looking at a bowl of tomato soup is like staring directly into Hell. 'I don't mind brown sauce, I'm fine with mayonnaise and soup isn't an issue for me - as long as it doesn't contain tomatoes. 'I'm even not that bothered with whole tomatoes - it's just when they're all mushed up and evil that it makes me afraid. Even baked beans are too much.' Oddly, Lauren has no idea where her bizarre phobia came from. She said: 'It's not like I had a traumatic, tomato-related incident growing up. I never really liked it when I was a child, and then one day it just freaked me out and I started getting really scared of it. 'One time I was out for a meal with a new friend and she didn't know about my fear. Before I could stop her, she got this bottle of ketchup and dolloped it on her plate. 'It splashed and some went on my top but even worse some went on my face. 'I rushed home and threw the top in the bin, but I couldn't throw my face away so I ended up just sitting in the shower and crying. I'm more scared of Heinz 57 then I am of death.' Barmaid Kirstie Hughes (pictured) has to sleep with the wardrobe opening away from her bed . Phobias can range from the unsurprising - such as the all-too-common fear of spiders - to the truly bizarre. Barmaid Kirstie Hughes, from Merseyside, watched a horror film featuring a wardrobe as a child. Now as a 20-year-old she can't face looking at a wardrobe. But although it may seem unusual, Ms Dodd is not alone in harbouring a fear of sauces. Lee Sentino, 24, has a physical reaction to all types of sauce or condiment, and refuses to eat any 'wet foods'. The barman from Manchester says he starts gagging, feels sick and breaks out in a cold sweat when he is confronted with ketchup, gravy, custard or HP Sauce. And a U.S. woman named Shiseido was recently reported to have developed a phobia of the sauce when she was six years old, after her mother chased her around with packets of it as a joke. A north London teenager who choked on spaghetti as a child is today so terrified of food that she refuses to eat anything apart from chicken escalopes. Charlotte Snow has shunned most other foods since she was three years old, despite her parents' desperate attempts to improve their daughter's diet. However, such phobias are not restricted just to the young - Bradford, Yorkshire mother-of-four Zoe Ingleson has spent the past 20 years dreading mealtimes because of her fear of metal cutlery. Other unusual phobias to have been detailed in recent months include a fear of Guiness, onions - and even an irrational phobia of certain noises such as chewing. And perhaps most remarkably, last year a man claimed to have a phobia of the Kardashian family. Retail assistant Mike Amess, from Exeter, claims to break out in a cold sweat whenever he sees or hears the famous family and says the sight of a semi-naked Kim even makes him vomit with disgust. He explained: 'Just hearing the sound of the Kardashians' nasal voices or catching a glimpse of them on screen makes me feel nauseous and shaky. My hands get clammy, my breathing gets heavier and I start sweating. Sometimes, I get teary and want to retch.'

'My son was great, he told me, 'I support your decision and if this will make you happy then I'm on board,'' Tur told People. 'But my daughter was shocked. She had a great deal of difficulty and we stopped talking for a long time.' Scroll down for video .

Tur, formerly known as Chopper Bob, filmed a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase . Following 14 months of hormone treatment Tur  underwent successful sexual reassignment surgery in June 2014, transitioning from male to female. On Tuesday night Tur appeared on Inside Edition and said her daughter who lives in London was encouraging about her new role. 'My daughter found out about it and sent me a nice note saying congrats on the job and told me that I look beautiful, which meant a lot,' she said. 'She saw her father a certain way, a hero pilot' Tur said. 'Bob Tur was legendary, and she liked that. 'She has trouble with that, and she should. She has to meet me and find out who I am.' The 54-year-old from Santa Monica decided to begin the change in 2013 and said that once the process was complete 'Bob must die' to make way for Zoey. 'My son (left) was great, he told me, 'I support your decision and if this will make you happy then I'm on board,'' Tur (right) told People in an interview . She said she was 'done hiding', after starting to push family and friends away and had suffered from body dysmorphic disorder. Family and friends were supportive of Tur's decision, although she said that for some it felt like grieving as they prepared to say goodbye to Bob. 'For the most part, people didn't know. They were in a state of shock initially,' she told CBS Los Angeles. Tur, who married fellow reporter Marika Gerrard at age 23 and has dated Carrie Fisher, has more than 10,000 flying hours over war zones and riots. She said in 2013 the hormone therapy had already affected the way she flew, adding that her thought pattern had become more analytical than instinctive. She said that she planned to have surgery to make her face more feminine and to have sexual reassignment surgery. In an interview with TMZ she said: 'Transgender people really are misunderstood. It's not what you think'. The pilot says she has had a female brain since birth, but struggled to come to terms with who she is. 'It's a genetic disorder that happens in utero. Nobody knows exactly why, but you're born with a female or feminized brain,' she said. 'If you don't really know who you are. You think you're a woman, but you're a man.' Tur helped capture images of truck driver Reginald Denny being beaten during the LA riots .

"A new study has concluded e-cigarettes are not a safe alternative to smoking tobacco . E-cigarettes generate toxic chemicals similar to those found in tobacco and may harm the lungs and immune system, scientists claimed today. A new study, thought to be the first where animals were exposed to 'vaping', found it is far from being a safe alternative to smoking tobacco. In the experiments, mice exposed to e-cigarette fumes suffered mild damage to their lungs and became far more susceptible to respiratory infections. Their immune responses to both viruses and bacteria were weakened by such an extent that some animals died. Scientists also found that e-cigarette vapour contained 'free radical' toxins similar to those found in cigarette smoke and air pollution. Free radicals are highly reactive molecules that can damage DNA and cell membranes. Professor Shyam Biswai, from Johns Hopkins University in the US, who led the research published in the online journal Public Library of Science ONE, said: 'Our findings suggest that e-cigarettes are not neutral in terms of the effects on the lungs. 'We have observed that they increase the susceptibility to respiratory infections in the mouse models. 'This warrants further study in susceptible individuals, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) patients who have switched from cigarettes to e-cigarettes, or to new users of e-cigarettes who may have never used cigarettes.' For two weeks, mice were exposed to e-cigarette vapour in amounts equivalent to the doses inhaled by humans. The animals were then infected with pneumonia bacteria or a strain of flu virus. Compared with other  mice not exposed to the fumes, they were much more likely to develop a weakened immune response. Co-author Dr Thomas Sussan, also from Johns Hopkins, said: 'E-cigarette vapour alone produced mild effects on the lungs, including inflammation and protein damage. 'However, when this exposure was followed by a bacterial or viral infection, the harmful effects of e-cigarette exposure became even more pronounced. 'The e-cigarette exposure inhibited the ability of mice to clear the bacteria from their lungs, and the viral infection led to increased weight loss and death, indicative of an impaired immune response.' The research, thought to be the first where animals were exposed to 'vaping', found e-cigarette fumes cause mild damage to the  lungs and could make people more susceptible to respiratory infections (file picture) The study is thought to be the first to investigate an animal's response to e-cigarette inhalation. E-cigarettes generated just one per cent of the amount of free radicals in tobacco smoke, but this still posed a potential health risk, said the researchers. 'We were surprised by how high that number was, considering that e-cigarettes do not produce combustion products,' said Dr Sussan. 'Granted, it's 100 times lower than cigarette smoke, but it's still a high number of free radicals that can potentially damage cells.' E-cigarette sales in the US are expected to overtake sales of cigarettes in the next 10 years. In 2013, more than 250,000 American teenagers who had never smoked a cigarette reported using e-cigarettes.","New study at Johns Hopkins University found 'vaping' is not a safe alternative to smoking tobacco .

"A Texas man's capital murder trial opened Tuesday almost 17 years after he allegedly set an eight-year-old boy on fire. Twenty-nine-year-old Don Collins was 13 when prosecutors say he tied then eight-year-old Robert Middleton to a tree, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire in 1998, according to the  Chronicle. The attack was an effort to silence Middleton after Collins reportedly sexually assaulted him two weeks earlier, the Chronicle reports. Crime: In 1998, when he was 13 years old, Don Collins (left) tied eight-year-old Robert Middleton  to a tree, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire to silence him after Collins molested him two weeks earlier . Robert: Middleton (photographed)  was burned across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer . Not Guilty: Collins pleaded not guilty to the crime . Middleton was burned across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer. His death was ruled a homicide because the burns were almost exclusively to blame for the cancer. Collins, a convicted sex offender, turned his head from the screen Tuesday as prosecutors showed images of young Middleton's badly burned body. And the Chronicle reports that he has pleaded not guilty. A judge determined in March that Collins could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time. Last year, after learning the case would go to trial, Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said the journey for her son's justice has been a 'long road,' the Chronicle reports. 'When Robert died, we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen,' Colleen said. Maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him.' Defense attorneys said in a Galveston County courtroom Tuesday that there were no witnesses to the attack and prosecutors are playing to the jury's emotions. 'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' the Houston Chronicle reported attorney E. Tay Bond as telling jurors. 'There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.' Mother: Middleton's mother, Colleen (photographed), said last year, when she learned the case would go to trial, that the journey for her son's justice has been a long road . Homicide: His death was ruled a homicide because the burns were almost exclusively to blame for the cancer . But prosecutors countered that witnesses will testify that Collins admitted to them that he poured gasoline on Middleton as the boy walked through woods near his home, according to the Chronicle. 'Our case is based on the testimony of adults who have come forward and can tell you what this man did when they were children,' Montgomery County prosecutor Kelly Blackburn said in his opening statement. Middleton named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998. Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case. Disposition: Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack . Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack. The sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case. Prosecutors charged Collins with murder in 2013, but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take him to trial. After a three-day hearing last March, state District Judge Kathleen Hamilton ruled that Collins could be tried for murder by an adult court. A man who was sexually assaulted by Collins in 2001, when he was eight years old, testified in a hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Middleton. The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault.","The capital murder trial of Don Collins, 29, opened Tuesday nearly 17 years after the crime was committed .
In 1998, when Collins was 13, he allegedly tied then eight-year-old Robert Middleton to a tree, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire .
It was determined last year that Collins could be tried as an adult in the trial even though he was 13 at the time of the alleged attack ."
"Sen. Rand Paul shared a photo of himself receiving a booster vaccine Tuesday online, after his comments about childhood vaccinations Monday made waves and were picked up by news outlets. The photo shows Paul (R-KY) with his shirt sleeve rolled up and a needle in his right arm. The tweet that accompanied the image read 'Ironic: Today I am getting my booster vaccine. Wonder how the liberal media will misreport this?' Medical treatment: Sen. Rand Paul posted this photo of him receiving a booster shot to Twitter on Tuesday . Paul made the trip with New York Times reporter Jeremy W. Peters, who also posted a snap of Paul receiving his booster. Peters tweeted 'In which @SenRandPaul and I go to the doctor; he gets vaccinated. ""I think everybody should vaccinate their kids.""' According to Peters' report in The New York Times, while at the doctor's office Paul said 'It just annoys me that I'm being characterized as someone who's against vaccines.' Paul continued 'There's 400 headlines now that say ""Paul says vaccines cause mental disorders."" That’s not what I said. I said I've heard of people who've had vaccines and they see a temporal association and they believe that.' The newspaper reported that the senator and opthalmologist's booster was for Hepatitis A. On Monday, Paul said in an interview with radio personality Laura Ingraham 'What happens if you have somebody not wanting to take the smallpox vaccine and it ruins it for everybody else? I think there are times in which there can be some rules, but for the first part it ought to be voluntary.' Remarks: Paul, seen on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., said Monday ''I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines' During a Monday appearance on CNBC's 'Closing Bell,' when pressed about his remarks by Kelly Evans, Paul said 'Here's the thing. The thing is I think vaccines are one of the greatest medical breakthroughs that we have. I'm a big fan and a great fan of the history of the development of the smallpox vaccine for example. 'But you know, for most of our history, they have been voluntary. So I don't think I'm arguing for anything out of the ordinary. We are arguing for what most of history has had.' Later in the interview, Paul told Evans 'I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines. 'I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad a idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children. And it is an issue of freedom and public health.' Paul released a statement Tuesday, in which he backed vaccines. 'I did not say vaccines caused disorders, just that they were temporally related—I did not allege causation,' the statement said. 'I support vaccines, I receive them myself and I had all of my children vaccinated. In fact, today I received the booster shot for the vaccines I got when I went to Guatemala last year.'","Sen.

"Chancellor George Osborne (pictured)has said that no new tax rises will be needed after the election to fund his plans . Families face a huge tax bombshell whoever wins the general election, experts warned last night. The Institute for Fiscal Studies warned voters to brace themselves for a £5 billion tax rise after the election in May – equal to a 1p in the pound increase in the headline rate of VAT or income tax. Chancellor George Osborne has said that no new tax rises will be needed after the election to fund his plans, with the remainder of the deficit reduction programme coming from big cuts to welfare and spending. Most of Labour’s publicly announced tax rises have already been earmarked for spending on particular issues, such as the NHS, rather than reducing the deficit. But neither party has completely ruled out a rise in VAT. The Lib Dems will today break ranks by threatening ‘at least’ £8billion of tax increases after the election, but has not yet spelled out in full where they will fall. The IFS warned that the first year after each of the last five elections has seen tax increases totalling £5billion at today’s prices, whichever party has won. Paul Johnson, the respected think-tank’s director, suggested neither of the main parties may be telling the full truth about their tax plans. Asked whether the IFS was predicting tax rises following the election, Mr Johnson said: ‘Are we saying that tax rises are inevitable? No. The e IFS warned that the first year after each of the last five elections has seen hikes totalling £5billion at today's prices, whichever party has won . 'Are we saying that tax rises have tended to happen after elections and there is a big gap to fill? Yes. ‘I don’t know whether the next government will do but I wouldn’t fall off my stool if there were some tax rises there.’ A report by the IFS, the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in Britain, said the main options for raising significant tax revenues would be increases in VAT, income tax or National Insurance. British families are set to enjoy their best year since 2001 thanks to rising wages, falling petrol prices and bock-bottom interest rates, a leading economist has said. Andrew Goodwin, senior UK economist at forecasters Oxford Economics, said consumer spending would pick up by more than 3% this year, as families find they have more money to splash out. And he said that the outlook for business was 'very positive', with strong profitability and confidence about demand encouraging investment by companies which are sitting on 'the largest piles of cash for 15 to 20 years' after pulling in their horns in the wake of the recession. Growth in investment could top 5% this year, he said. Mr Goodwin made his optimistic forecast at the launch of the Institute for Fiscal Studies' annual Green Budget, produced in collaboration with Oxford Economics. It said increasing any of these would ‘weaken work incentives’. Other options include big rises in fuel duty, business rates or corporation tax. The IFS also questioned whether the parties would be able to focus tax rises on the rich, warning that tax revenues are already ‘highly concentrated’, with the top 3 per cent of taxpayers contributing half of all income tax. The warning came as the IFS launched its ‘Green Budget’, its annual assessment of the economy and the public finances ahead of the Budget. Economists predicted rising wages and falling inflation will leave the average voter more than £400 better off this year. They said plummeting oil prices, combined with the economic recovery, would produce a ‘real turnaround in household finances’ this year – providing the biggest boost to personal income since 2001. But they warned that the sickly public finances left behind by the last Labour government will need further major surgery after the election. The IFS said Tory plans to balance the books would require the biggest package of cuts among the world’s leading 32 industrialised nations, outpacing even those pencilled in for austerity-hit Greece. It said cuts on this scale would be ‘difficult’ to achieve and would require up to 900,000 job losses in the public sector. The report found the Coalition has achieved just over half of the cuts needed, with 45 per cent still to go. But the think-tank also warned that Labour’s plans, which involve smaller cuts, would saddle Britain with an extra £170billion of debt. The study said Labour would already be borrowing an extra £27billion a year by now if it had won the election. The Tories seized on the findings as evidence Labour could not be trusted with the economy. A Conservative spokesman said: ‘The independent experts say that Labour’s policy would mean £10,000 more borrowing for every household in Britain – more debt than our children could ever hope to repay.’ In 2010 the coalition increased VAT to 20 per cent, despite the Lib Dems vowing not to do so before election .","Families face a huge tax bombshell whoever wins the general election .

"A zombie cat who 'rose from the dead' five days after being hit by a car and buried has taken his first bite of food since crawling out of a Florida grave. Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, immediately returned to the home of his shocked owner Ellis Hutson on January 21. The nearly two-year-old pet was then taken to the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service where he had his eye removed and jaw repaired. Scroll down for video . Bart the 'zombie cat' who was run over by a car only to inexplicably return from the dead five days later took his first bite of food on Tuesday, two weeks after he rose from the grave . Because Bart can't eat enough to sustain himself, he will remain on a feeding tube for a few more weeks. He is expected to make a full recovery . Bart is expected to make a full recovery and is starting to eat on his own. Because he can't eat enough to sustain himself, however, he will remain on a feeding tube for a few more weeks, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Unable to afford the fees for Bart's operation, Hutson, 52, had reached out to the Humane Society of Tampa Bay. Through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund they were able to help cover costs of surgery on brave Bart who had been through quite an ordeal. But the organization does not plan on returning Bart to his owner, and it has not decided how or when it will put the cat up for adoption. Bart's owner, Ellis Hutson, left, was shocked to see his pet return, but the Humane Society of Tampa Bay 'does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family' Bart, a black and white cat from Tampa, Florida, had surgery to repair injuries at the Tampa Bay Veterinary Emergency Service in January . Huston was unable to afford fees for Bart's operation, so he reached out to the Humane Society, who now plan on not returning the cat . 'Recently we have learned new information about Bart's home environment and the circumstances leading up to his burial,' a statement from the shelter said. 'Therefore, the Humane Society of Tampa Bay does not intend to return Bart to the Hutson family. 'We are prepared to fight for the best interests of this cat.' The news of his amazing survival made headlines across the world - and Bart may soon be as famous - and financially rewarding - as Grumpy Cat. Hutson previously told ABC News he was devastated when he had to bury the animal.

Through the Save-A-Pet Medical Fund they were able to help cover costs of surgery on brave Bart who had been through quite an ordeal . The cat boasted gruesome injuries after his return, and has had surgery to remove his eye and repair his jaw . He said he was shocked after Bart showed up back at home five days after an apparently fatal accident. Hutson had found his pet in a pool of blood in the street, not moving, after a collision in January. Vets were baffled by Bart's mysterious survival - but Hutson believes his revival may be the doing of the cat's brother and playmate. Speaking to local news station Fox13 about the strange happening, he suggested that Bart's friend may have gone looking for him and clawed him out of his resting place. Bart was buried in this shallow hole not far from his home. He managed to dig himself out and return to his home . Experts believe Bart rose from the grave not long after being buried there - but was scared so stayed away from home for several days . He said: 'We have two cats and they play together all the time and they roam around with each other. 'He might have went looking for his brother and dug him up - but I have no idea'. The mystery deepened when Hutson revealed that he was so upset by his pet's apparent demise that he did not bury Bart himself - but asked his friend David Liss to do the deed. Liss said he had no idea how Bart could have been alive. He told Fox13: 'I looked at it, and I looked at it, and I didn't see the chest moving up and down or anything and I said, ""you know, well look at the blood, it's dead.""'

"Indonesia's courts have rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, who face execution. Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail. Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected. Scroll down for video . A judicial review application submitted by Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan (right) and Myruan Sukumaran (left) has been rejected by Indonesia's courts . The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted. 'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali. Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts. It comes after a slight glimmer of hope from the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, who was yet to make a decision on the matter on Tuesday. 'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono previously said according to News Corp. Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail . Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Julian McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006. 'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp. It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases.

According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan. From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners.

"He's got a piercing stare, brooding expression and body that can whip female fans into a frenzy but for male supermodel David Gandy, he would prefer to keep his looks off-screen. The Essex-born hunk, 34, who shot to fame wearing just his underpants in a Dolce & Gabbana campaign in 2006, is one of the most desired men on the planet and was offered the chance to play Christian Grey in Fifty Shades Of Grey. But in an interview with Square Mile magazine he says that while he respects the film, the role - now played by Jamie Dornan - wouldn't have been right for him. Scroll down for video . The model, who is well known for his smouldering M&S underwear ads, has revealed he turned down the role of Christian Grey in the Fifty Shades of Grey films . Disappointing his thousands of fans who would have loved to have seen him in the very steamy film, David said that the role didn't feel right for him and he doesn't feel the need to act . 'Critics and literary experts aren’t fans but I respect it for what it is. But was it right for me? No. It just didn’t feel right, in any way. And in my gut, it felt right to say no.' The hugely successful model, who is currently the co-designer and face of a new M&S campaign, revealed that he has been offered, and subsequently refused, several lead roles in box office hits. “I was offered Fifty Shades Of Grey, 300:2, Hercules, which a lot of people probably would have taken as actors but I’m in the fortunate position where I like what I’m doing. I don’t feel the need to act,' he said. And, while his legions of admirers may be bitterly disappointed not to see Gandy in the role, which would have had him naked much of the time, it's hard to see how he could have fitted it in. As well as a packed modelling schedule, Gandy has recently taken a step into retail. The model loved his pair of David Preston-designed Chelsea boots so much, he decided to buy the company. David Gandy in David Preston shoes: The model loved his pair so much he decided to buy the company . In January the label had a soft launch at London Collections: Men, for which Mr Gandy is also an ambassador. In an interview regarding his latest acquisition, the male supermodel, who has 230,000 followers on Instagram, told fashion website WWD: 'It was always my aim - which sounds really strange as a model - not to always be in front of the camera but to turn the other way and have an input. 'I don't just do one campaign and move on. I go in there, I look at the team and I want to help the brand move in a different direction.

Mr Gandy's plans for his new brand are to 'create a lifestyle' around the label and to think how men want to be seen in them.

The couple, whose 10-month relationship came to an abrupt end in 2011, confirmed they are back together in October last year and seem to be taking things very seriously. And of course, Gandy's refusal led to former model Jamie Dornan landing the coveted role of Christian Grey. Despite the film having yet to be released, Jamie's star has well and truly risen since accepting the part of the S&M-obsessed billionaire. The coveted role of Christian Grey was taken by former model Jamie Douran (right, in the role) Jamie, 32, who has a baby daughter with wife Amelia Warner, admitted that he is taking a laissez-faire attitude to his increasing fame, and how his life will change once the film is released on Febuary 13.

"Whitehall mandarins launched an extraordinary 13-month effort to block the Iraq inquiry from publishing explosive memos between Tony Blair and George Bush, it emerged last night. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood’s attempts to keep the correspondence secret led to a major stand-off with Iraq inquiry chief Sir John Chilcot — and pushed back the publication of his report by a year. Astonishingly, Sir John admitted he still did not know when the inquiry – which has already cost £9million – would finally be published, five-and-a-half years after it was launched. Scroll down for video . Sir John Chilcot told MPs it was 'really not possible to say' when he will publish his long-awaited report into reasons Britain went to war in 2003 . Critics, referring to the TV comedy series Yes Minister, attacked the ‘Sir Humphrey Mafia’ for blocking the crucial evidence on how Britain entered the Iraq conflict in 2003. MPs said that without the delays, the report would have been published by now and they criticised the ‘unnecessary suffering’ caused to the relatives of the servicemen and women who died. Sir John, giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, described how the lengthy negotiations with the civil service over his request to publish classified material – including 30 notes between Mr Blair and President Bush – was ‘crucial’ in causing the delay. He revealed that Sir Jeremy’s predecessor, Gus O’Donnell, ruled that the memos were ‘not disclosable’ as a group. Negotiations with Sir Jeremy – nicknamed ‘Sir Cover-Up’ by his critics – on what to release began in August 2013 and did not conclude until September last year. Sir John described the discussions as ‘agonising’ and ‘very long and difficult and challenging’ on both sides. Critics have questioned whether Sir Jeremy was the right person to arbitrate on the documents as he was principal private secretary to Mr Blair in Downing Street from 1999 to 2003 – when the decisions to go to war were taken. Sir John, himself a former civil servant, refused to criticise Sir Jeremy and denied his efforts amounted to ‘obstruction’. Foreign Affairs Committee Sir Richard Ottaway intervened during Sir John's opening statement to bring it to a close . The former top civil servant was hauled before Parliament to explain why his report will not be published before the general election . Sir John Chilcot was appointed by Gordon Brown . Sir John Chilcot, the former Whitehall mandarin charged with heading the Iraq investigation, sat on the 'whitewash' Butler Inquiry into the use of intelligence in the run-up to the conflict. Sir John was one of the leading members of the inquiry which exonerated the Blair government for 'sexing up' the case for war. His appointment by Gordon Brown raised fears in Westminster of the latest in a long line of establishment cover-ups - following Butler and the Hutton report into the death of Dr David Kelly. A career diplomat, Sir John, is an intelligence expert who was principal private secretary to William Whitelaw during his time as Tory Home Secretary and also spent seven years as top civil servant in the Northern Ireland office. But he said it took a ‘considerable time’ before Sir Jeremy finally gave way and agreed to publish redacted versions. ‘The initial view taken by the previous Cabinet Secretary was that the notes – for example that Mr Blair had sent to President Bush – were not disclosable,’ said Sir John. ‘There was a strong convention that interchanges of that sort should not be disclosed in public. ‘As we went through, point by point, with the current Cabinet Secretary, it became increasingly clear that, on the balance of argument, he would agree that a certain passage or a certain point could be disclosed because of the essential nature of our inquiry, which related to the workings of central government. 'That came to a point where it was no longer possible to sustain a doctrine that these documents, as a category, could not be disclosed.’ Sir John said that members of his committee insisted on their publication after ‘retiring politicians and statesmen’ referred to issues in them in their memoirs. Continuing on the subject of inquiry delays, Sir John pointed to departments being slow in producing documents he requested – saying the government ‘found it difficult to respond as quickly as we would have liked’. His revelations angered MPs demanding the report be made public as soon as possible. Former Tory shadow home secretary David Davis said: ‘We at last know that the Sir Humphrey Mafia tried every trick in the book to block the publication of the single most important piece of evidence, the correspondence between Blair and Bush, which will throw most light on the reasons we went into this disastrous war.’ And the Iraqi-born Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi said: ‘I’m convinced that if it hadn’t taken 13 months for these documents to be declassified we would have the report by now.’ He told the committee the failure to publish the report had created ‘uncertainty’ that was ‘clearly painful for the families’. However, the revelation that Sir John dug in his heels during his standoff with Whitehall is likely to raise hopes his inquiry will be full and comprehensive when it reports. He said he had a ‘duty to deliver the truth’ to the families of those who died and revealed the inquiry had examined some 150,000 documents. ‘The more we read the more lines of inquiry arose,’ he added. It was ‘really not possible to say’ when the report would be published, as letters to those criticised in it, informing them of its conclusions and giving them the chance to respond, are still being sent out. Tory backbencher David Davis has blamed the Civil Service, which has the final say over which documents relating to Iraq can be published, for the delay in the report's publication . Inquiry member Sir Martin Gilbert died last night . Sir John Chilcot paid tribute to the renowned historian Sir Martin Gilbert, who died last night after a long battle with cancer. He said Sir Martin, a member of the Iraq report's panel since 2009, had helped the inquiry with his 'wisdom and insights'. The 78-year-old was the official biographer of Sir Winston Churchill and also one of the world's pre-eminent Holocaust historians. He was born in London in 1936 but was evacuated to Canada as a toddler when the Second World War took hold. Still a young child, he returned to Britain and was living near Oxford as the war drew to a close . He authored over 80 books, many on Jewish topics, in a life that also saw a national service stint in the British Intelligence Corps. His works included classic histories of the first and second world wars, 'A History of the Jews of Europe During the Second World War,' and 'Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century.' Tony Blair . The former Prime Minister is expected to be rebuked for his role taking the UK to war in 2003 and therefore has a legal right to reply to any criticisms in the report. Tim Farron, the former Liberal Democrat president, has claimed 'well-known names' involved in the inquiry were seeking to 'water down' the strength of criticism against them in the report. But Mr Blair has repeatedly rejected any suggestion he is behind the delay, saying last year: 'I have got as much interest as anyone in seeing the inquiry publish its findings and then being able to go out and frankly restate my case and defend my position.' Mr Blair was also accused of holding up the report by not allowing correspondence with George Bush to be published – but, again, has repeatedly denied this was the case. Sir John Chilcot . The Inquiry chair is facing increasing criticism for his own responsibility for the delay. He has missed every deadline which he had set – and senior figures have privately said this has nothing to do with the witnesses . Those criticised in the report only received the draft inquiry conclusions about them just before Christmas – leaving them almost no time to respond before the May election. It also understood that the report is incredibly long – running to a million pages - and criticises many more people than just Tony Blair, increasing the amount of time it takes to respond. Sir Jeremy Heywood . The Cabinet Secretary – Britain's most senior civil servant – was allegedly behind moves to block the publication of personal correspondence between the former US president George Bush and Mr Blair in the run-up to the war.

"Inspired by Steve Irwin, a young man has quit his job to commit himself  to his goal of raising money for animal welfare through the creation of innovative paintings. Mornington Peninsula-based artist Mtich Gobel has pledged to donate $50,000 to fund the animal hospital at Australia Zoon, donating the funds to Steve and Terri Irwin’s foundation ‘Australia Zoo Wildlife Warriors’. ‘It’s a great experience, it’s been a pretty crazy journey and it gives me a fuzzy feeling to know I can contribute to Steve’s legacy,’ said Gobel. On Wednesday, it was announced that Gobel was halfway towards his goal and has donated $25,000 to the foundation. Gobel will now spend two days at Australia Zoo working on the finishing touches on his custom artwork. Mitch Gobel, a 24-year-old artist and activist, has donated $25,000 to the Australia Zoo's animal hospital and has promised another $25,000. He is raising the money through his beautiful artworks .

A koala and a cockatoo both had paint put on bottom of their paws/claws and were given the opportunity to give their own artistic input by walking across the artwork. ‘I named the painting after Steve – ‘The Crocodile Hunter,’ said Gobel. ‘The idea behind it was to incorporate animals into the design but still have it fairly abstract. ‘I wanted it to represent something like a billabong, something that was drying up and have their footprints to represent their tracks and where they have been,’ explained Gobel. The aim is for the artwork to hang in the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital by Friday – another kind gesture from the 24-year-old art activist. Wildlife Warriors director of development Cynthia Thompson says they are incredibly grateful for the compassionate contribution from the young artist. ‘Donations are incredibly important for the hospital, we don’t receive any regular government support so we’re an entirely non-profit organisation,’ Thompson said. ‘We depend on the gifts and generosity of individuals and companies throughout Australia and the world.’ Gobel will now spend two days at Australia Zoo working on the finishing touches on his custom artwork . The funds will go towards the ongoing treatment of sick, injured and orphaned wildlife at the hospital. They have treated over 55,000 native Australian wildlife patients in its ten year history. Nine months ago, Gobel quit his job in horticulture to pursue a life-long dream of creating art that reflects the beauty of the natural world and save wildlife in the process. Gobel is an incredibly talented self-taught artist whose art is his ‘life and full-time occupation’. His vision is to use his art to ‘create a voice to achieve goals in wildlife conservation'. He is a resin artist, which according to Gobel is ‘basically liquid glass’. The resulting artwork has a beautiful, glossy finish. Gobel has also created beautiful artworks to project his feelings about the inhumanity of whaling. All the profits from his art were used to help fund the works of Sea Shepherd.

"A former decorated detective who had sex with a woman at a police station and let her handle his gun will be sentenced on Thursday. Mark Garner had earlier pleaded guilty to two counts of misconduct in office while he was a sergeant on the NSW north coast. His legal team argued on Wednesday that Garner, who appeared before Sydney's District Court, was an otherwise 'conscientious and devoted officer' and had been suffering mental health issues at the time of the offences. Former police officer Mark Garner arrives at the Downing Centre Local Court, in Sydney . The 50-year-old cried when he gave evidence in court last week, recounting his downward spiral from the 1990s, when he received courage and bravery awards, to after 2007, when he was drinking up to four bottles of wine a day. It was in this low state in 2011, he told the court, that he met a woman, who cannot be named. She had visited Kingscliff station to make a complaint about an alleged assault. 'She would come into the police station where we would talk. We started building a friendship ... then it developed into something more,' Garner said. He said he had not been intimate with his wife for some time. 'At that time, I believe I was vulnerable ... all of a sudden this young, pretty girl comes along and takes an interest in me,' he said. Garner is awaiting sentencing for misconduct after allegedly letting a sex worker play with his gun . The court heard that in September 2011, Garner let the woman handle his Glock pistol and had sex with her at the station. He also admitted to inappropriately accessing police files to gain details of the address of a person who might have taken a laptop owned by the woman. Garner said the laptop contained photos of the pair in an 'intimate session', which would have been embarrassing and possibly career-destroying if they got out. He admitted to the court he had tried to assist in her plan to break into the person's home and retrieve the computer. The court heard he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2012, after years of investigating serious crimes .

"Babies might be smarter than we had previously thought and can understand complex social situations from the age of just 13 months old. A study has found that infants are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander. In an experiment with puppets they responded to different scenarios in a way that suggested they were more engaged than had been expected. A study has found that 13 month old babies (a stock image is shown) are able to comprehend what constitutes bullying, friendship and what it means to be a bystander . The researchers asked parents of 48 infants aged around one to bring them into the lab for the experiment. They were sat down in front of a stage where two puppets appeared. First, puppet A and puppet B interacted in a friendly manner so the children could get used to them. The scientists then put on a show with a variety of scenarios. Children watched a puppet show in which characters named A, B and C, behaved in a friendly way towards each other, as well as bullied and hit each other (a real scenario is shown in a stock image) A third puppet, C, walked up and was deliberately knocked down by B as A looked on. In the next scenario when puppet A wasn't present, B knocked down C, and in a third scenario, C was accidentally knocked down as A looked on. Children who can accurately depict the human form at the age of four are more likely to be brighter in their teenage years, according to a study published last summer. Psychologists at King’s College London studied pictures drawn by more than 15,000 four-year-olds who were identical ans non-identical twins. Those who drew with the most skill were likely to do better in intelligence tests a decade later. The children were asked at the age of four to draw a picture of a child. Each figure was scored between 0 and 12 depending on the presence of features such as a head, nose, ears, hair, body and arms. The children were given verbal and non-verbal intelligence tests at the time they completed the drawing, and again at the age of 14. The researchers found a definite correlation between the drawing scores and the two sets of intelligence scores. Dr Rosalind Arden, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King’s College London, said: ‘Our results show that there is a link between the ability to draw at the age of four and intelligence later in life. ‘Through drawing, we are attempting to show someone else what’s in our mind. 'This capacity to reproduce figures is a uniquely human ability and a sign of cognitive ability, in a similar way to writing, which transformed the human species’ ability to store information and build a civilisation.’ The researchers could not talk to the babies to see their response so they monitored how long they looked at the stage to gauge their interest and engagement. The findings showed that the babies looked longer at things that were unexpected and novel than things which were more predictable. For example, this happened when puppet A behaved in a friendly manner with B - even after he deliberately knocked down C. Psychological scientists and study authors You-jung Choi and Yuyan Luo of the University of Missouri said: ‘This to us indicates infants have strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others - his or her acquaintance or ""friend"" should do something about it’. Another instance when the babies looked longer at the stage was when puppet A shunned B even if he was not there when he knocked down C. The scientists said this suggested that the babies were able to keep track of what puppet A knew and use that information to make inferences about it’s behaviour. The findings indicated the newborns had ‘strong feelings about how people should deal with a character who hits others’, the researchers said. In their report they explained: ‘Our findings show that 13-month-olds can make sense of social situations using their understanding about others’ minds and social evaluation skills. ‘The research is innovative in that we show that infants are able to construe social situations from different participants’ perspectives.’ Previous research has suggested that babies are incredibly inquisitive and adaptable. However not all studies said they are smart and the UCLA's Institute For Child Development concluded they were ‘so stupid it’s not even funny’.","Psychologists at the University of Missouri used puppets to study how 13-month-old children responded to different social situations .

"People who buy herbal supplements over the internet could be putting themselves at risk because many do not contain ingredients listed on the labels and may include unknown herbs and even metal, a researcher has warned. Graham Lord, Director of NIHR Comprehensive Biomedical Research Centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ Hospital in London, said people who order herbal supplements online could end up taking contaminated products as well as toxic combinations of herbs which could lead to health problems and even kidney and liver failure. He said supplements produced in the EU - despite being subject to much tougher regulations than the rest of the world  - can still contain hundreds of unknown plant compounds which could be harmful. Experts are warning people about the dangers of buying herbals supplements over the internet, which could be contaminated with other harmful herbal combinations or in some cases even extracts of metal . The warning follows an investigation in America which found four out of five herbal supplements such as echinacea and ginseng for sale in some stores were contaminated or had been completely substituted by other herbs. Experts said it was possible the same could happen in the UK - particularly with products ordered online - and are calling for the test to be repeated here. 'The real risk is that products ordered over the internet are potentially dangerous because they are not regulated,' said Prof Lord. 'The assumption that if something is natural it is healthy is wrong, you don't really know what you are taking sometimes.' Tighter regulations were introduced in the EU in 2004 governing the production of herbal supplements, making these products some of the safest in the world. But Prof Lord said even more stringent controls do not go far enough and unknown compounds contained in plants could still be present in these products. He said the only way to make them completely safe was to subject herbal remedies to the same type of testing as medicines, but this would involve major changes. He added: 'It all stems from the fact that herbal products are not regulated in the same way as medicines. If you are given a prescription drug this will have been very precisely regulated and gone through clinical trials. With herbal remedies, they don't go through that kind of control. 'There can be hundreds of different compounds in there and it is very hard to tell.' Professor Graham Lord said people who order herbal supplements online could be putting themselves at risk . However, he said the greatest risk was with taking items ordered over the internet which if they are not produced in the EU can be subject to very little controls. He added: 'Particular herbs might get in during production and there have been cases of metal that can get in as a contaminant during the production process. 'There can be quite serious implications of taking the wrong herbs. The most obvious dangers are kidney disease and kidney cancer. Researchers are calling for a study in America, which found some herbal supplements contain little or no of the products they should, to be copied in the UK . 'There are some, rare, but very serious health outcomes.' Michael Heimlich, a professor at Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy at the University College London, agreed there was a risk unregulated herbal products in the UK could be contaminated with other substances. During his research he has found examples where chemicals have been used to replace certain plant extracts or plants from different species have been substituted. Prof Heinrich said in a current study of roseroot or Rhodiola rosea they found that at least 20 per cent of the samples do not contain it, but other Rhodiola species or a synthetic compound commonly used in food supplements. Some compounds have also been found to contain amino acids commonly used by body builders. He said: 'There are examples of chemicals replacing the plant extracts, low dose products, adulteration with related, but chemically different species. 'Consumers should only use products which are of good quality and especially products registered under the traditional herbal remedies scheme which must demonstrate that they are safe and of acceptable quality, including adherence to good agricultural and collection practices and good manufacturing practice (GMP). And, if in doubt, they should consult their pharmacist.' The traditional herbal remedies scheme was introduced in 2011 and means herbal products such as St John's Wort and echniacea must be registered with the MHRA. Registration does not mean herbal remedies have been tested and proven to work, but that it has been produced to good quality standards. An investigation in America used DNA barcoding technology to test six herbal supplements sold in New York. It found that only 21 per cent of the products tested contained the DNA of the plants listed on their labels. A study into roseroot, or Rhodiola rosea, available on the internet found that 20 per cent of samples do not contain it and some had even been contaminated with extracts from chemicals used by bodybuilders . A spokesman for the MHRA said:'These products are sold in the US as botanical food supplements and are not regulated as herbal medicinal products. The situation in the UK is different. Where herbals products are considered to be herbal medicinal products they will either hold a full product licence or a traditional herbal registration. 'The products are regulated by MHRA and the products are manufactured in accordance with GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice). Companies have to submit documentation to support the quality of their products and this is assessed before products can be placed on the market.'","Herbal supplements bought over the internet could be contaminated .

"A grieving mother has received a handwritten apology from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt after doctors failed to spot her son's cancer for six months. Musician Lee Wyatt was just 25 when he died of bowel cancer in 2010 after being repeatedly misdiagnosed during almost six months of visits to his GP practice. Suffering abdominal pain and struggling to eat, the DJ and music producer from Denton, Greater Manchester, was initially prescribed painkillers after being told he had pulled a muscle while playing tennis. Linda Wyatt (left) holds a picture of her son Lee (right) who died aged 25 after being repeatedly misdiagnosed. She has since received a handwritten letter from the Health Secretary to apologise . He was also given iron tablets after it was found he was severely anaemic and it was suspected that he had an ulcer. Fears that Mr Wyatt had cancer were finally confirmed in December 2008 but a scan failed to detect the illness had already spread to his liver. This led to him having a 14-hour operation at Stepping Hill Hospital to remove his bowel, spleen and part of his pancreas. An independent oncologist looking into the case has since found the operation was 'inappropriate and excessive'. Last year Mr Wyatt's mother Linda, 56, received an out-of-court settlement of £10,000 after a joint action against Stockport NHS Foundation Trust and the Windmill Medical Centre, in Denton, for alleged medical negligence. Now the heart-broken mother has received a letter from Mr Hunt in which he says he has raised the case with health regulators. 'Dear Ms Wyatt, . Thank you for your letter. I have replied formally but I wanted to reply personally to say how sorry I was to read about what happened to Lee. It is totally unacceptable to get a cancer diagnosis wrong so many times. Nothing I say will make up for the sadness of what happened, but I would like to apologise to you on behalf of the government and the NHS for what happened. 'There is much excellent care in the NHS but still too many things like this that go wrong. We are doing a number of things to improve the quality of cancer diagnosis, but your request shows there is much more work to be done. 'Once again I am sorry for what happened. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Hunt.' The first page of Mr Hunt's letter expressed how sorry he was to hear of her Ms Wyatt's son's death and apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS . He goes on to add that there is 'much more work to be done' in improving the NHS, before personally signing off 'Jeremy Hunt' A formal response from the Health Secretary (pictured) also pledged to pass on Ms Wyatt's concerns as a formal complaint to the NHS should she wish to do so . In a handwritten letter, Mr Hunt said: 'It is totally unacceptable to get a cancer diagnosis wrong so many times. 'Nothing I say will make up for the sadness of what happened, but I would like to apologise on behalf of the government and the NHS for what happened.' He signs off: 'Once again I am so sorry for what happened.' Ms Wyatt is now calling for people to be tested for cancer before any other illnesses, if they suspect they have symptoms. She urged: 'This is about finding justice for Lee. He put his trust in doctors and he was let down. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured left) said it was 'totally unacceptable' to get Lee Wyatt's (right) cancer diagnosis wrong 'so many times' 'I don't think bowel cancer was considered because of his age. Just because you don't fit that criteria, trivial things are ruled out, but lives could be saved.' Stockport NHS Foundation Trust expressed sympathy with the family. A spokesman said: 'In the time since, our MRI scanners have been upgraded and we believe lesions could be correctly classified with far greater confidence.' The Windmill Medical Centre declined to comment.","Musician Lee Wyatt was 25 when he died of bowel cancer in 2010 .

"A 28-year-old mother was left with thinning locks and bald patches after one too many dye treatments. Kellie Holloway, from Winchester, spent her youth bleaching and dyeing her hair so much, that it left her with a bald crown. 'I must have dyed it about 300 times. Once I started it became addictive,' she revealed on Channel 4 show Bodyshockers. Kellie, pictured after her hair started thinning, began to use styles that hid the bald patches . A close up of Kellie's scalp shows the bald patches she had as a result of dyeing her hair too much . The mother-of-one used to work as an assistant in a salon where she would frequently change her hair styles, trying different colours every other week and applying a mass of products to her hair. The natural brunette bleached her hair blonde and numerous other shades over the years but the products she used caused her hair follicles to become blocked. This meant new hair couldn't grow through leaving her with limp locks and bald patches. She said: 'I hate my hair, it's all thinned, you don't expect it at 28, it's awful.' The mother-of-one had dyed her hair numerous shades over the years, as pictured left and right, but lived to regret changing her style so often . Kellie was shocked her hair stopped growing and she felt self-conscious about the bald patches, pictured . Kellie said she tried her best to cover the bare spots through styling what hair she had but it made her feel self-conscious. She said: 'I was so conscious of my hair loss and trying to cover it up, it became a massive part of my morning routine. I never left the house feeling satisfied and felt rubbish for the rest of the day. 'My hair loss was never far from my mind which had a big effect on my confidence. 'I'm always thinking ""can people see the bald patches?""' She said she tried to find a solution for years and was terrified she'd go completely bald. 'I've tried shampoo and conditioners, lotions from the chemist, hair vitamin tablets. I have spent an absolute fortune and nothing works,' she said. She added that she 'totally regrets' dyeing her hair so much. Eventually she was referred to Simone Thomas, a clinician who herself had suffered from hair loss and believed she could help Kellie with her own condition. Kellie, pictured washing her hair, said she must have dyed it 300 times . The brunette said she used to spend hours styling her hair so bald patches wouldn't show . Kellie said about the consultation: 'Meeting Simone was amazing. I had been to loads of consultations for my hair loss but never truly felt that they understood me. That was totally different with Simone, knowing she had suffered from hair loss herself I could instantly relate to her and trusted her. 'For the first time I felt like I was not the only one with hair loss. We spoke for over an hour and I finally got the answers I had been wanting for 10 years.' Simone recommended 'Nioxin Dermabrasion' to Kellie - which is like a facial for the hair. Simone explains: 'After speaking with Kellie about her hair thinning we decided that a Nioxin Dermabrasion treatment would be the best course of action to treat her condition. Nioxin is massaged into the scalp and works to help rejuvenate the scalp helping to provide a foundation for thicker and fuller hair to grow.' For Kellie's transformation on Channel 4, Simone also provided Kellie with a specialised hair piece to help with her hair loss in the short term and boost her self-esteem. Kellie said the hair piece has made her feel more confident until her natural hair is rejuvenated. Kellie eventually found a solution to her hair loss thanks to meeting specialist Simone Thomas, right . As a temporary measure, Kellie has been given a hair piece, which she is pictured wearing here, while her scalp is treated to rejuvenate her real hair . She said: 'I no longer worry about having to cover my hair loss in the mornings as the system does that for me. It makes me feel so much more relaxed for the rest of the day and gives me more important time to spend with my son.' Kellie is also delighted with the Nioxin treatment Simone has been able to provide her and feels like she has finally 'seen the light at the end of the tunnel'. 'The treatment is like a facial for the scalp and feels better than any other treatments I've had, plus I am already starting to see results. I can't thank Simone enough for helping me finally find a solution,' she said.","Kellie Holloway, 28, from Winchester, dyed her hair hundreds of times .

"Sister Wives star Kody Brown is revealing why he traded  his 'official' wife for the youngest of his four 'spiritual' brides. Many were shocked with the announcement that Brown and wife Meri, who wed in 1990, had decided to divorce and that Brown would be marrying Robyn, his youngest bride. The decision however was not one of the heart but rather a legal maneuver that will allow Brown to give the children Robyn had when she entered the family, Dayton, Aurora and Breanna, access to insurance and other legal benefits. Of his 17 children, these three are the only ones who Brown is not the biological father of, meaning they had no claim to his insurance. Scroll down for video . Kody Brown is marrying Robyn legally to offer more stability to her three children from her first marriage. They are pictured here in 2010, before the couple's son Solomon was born . Kody Brown appears to live in marital bliss with his four 'wives' Meri (second from left), Janelle (far right), Christine (second from right) and Robyn (far left)  on TLC's Sister Wives . The extended Brown family last year: Kody holds son Solomon, his biological child with Robyn. Fourth wife Robyn is in the black dress at back. First wife Meri is in green and white. The four wives have 17 children . Kody was only legally wed to Meri after their wedding in 1990, while the the next three were 'spiritual' or 'sister' marriages. Kody has never been officially married to his middle wives, Janelle and Christine. And within just three months of his divorce with Meri, he had tied the knot with  wife Robyn, the youngest and most recent addition to the group. Meri has decided to stay with Kody and his polygamist family as a spiritual wife. According to records, the 44-year-old family head and his wife of 20 years jointly petitioned for divorce which was finalized on September 25, 2014. It is believed that Kody wanted to bring Robyn's three kids from a previous marriage better into the family, where they'll have more security. She has a son Dayton and two daughters, Breanna and Aurora, from her first marriage, and her fourth child, son Solomon, is her only biological son with Kody. On the show, all of Robyn's children refer to Kody as 'dad' and are referred to as Kody's children. Their biological father is alive and Robyn is divorced from him. On one episode of the show she tearfully revealed she as left the marriage and was driven to financial ruin getting out of it it. She also revealed her first child, Dayton, 15, was conceived out of wedlock despite her strong conservative beliefs. She then married his father and they had two more kids before divorcing. Polygamist reality TV star Kody Brown (left) divorced his 'official' wife Meri (right) last September . Meri and Kody on their 1990 wedding day. Meri was raised polygamist, Kody became one . After Meri Kody married Janelle, left, and Christine, pictured right. Neither wedding was ever legal . Solomon was born at home in Robyn and Kody's Las Vegas bedroom in 2011, a year after the couple wed in Utah. As a Christmas present for Kody in 2013, Robyn legally changed her name to Robyn Brown from Robyn Sullivan. The Brown family now lives in four neighboring homes, custom built, in a cul-de-sac in Las Vegas. Kody wed his first three wives in quick succession. He and Meri legally and spiritually wed in 1990, he and Janelle spiritually wed in 1993 and he and Christine were married in 1994. None of the children by his first three wives remember a time when their other two 'moms' were not part of the family. He has one child with Meri and six with Janelle and six and with Christine. After a long period with no new wives, there was obvious friction, captured by the television cameras on the first season of Sister Wives, when Kody decided to court and then marry Robyn, bringing her and her three children into the already bursting household. But no wife was more supportive than Meri, who also is the closest to Robyn. Meri, who struggled with fertility and only has one biological child, made no secret of always yearning for more children in the family. She encouraged Kody to court Robyn. The whole family isn't just married, they also work together for their online business, My Sister Wives Closet, which sells jewelry and knickknacks. Within three months of divorcing Meri (left) he had married the youngest of his four 'spiritual wives' Robyn (right) Some fans have expressed shock and sympathy for Meri online, but the decision is more likely to be legal maneuver due to the fact that it is still illegal to officially be married to more than one person. Kody and his wives first appeared in Sister Wives in 2010 and said at the time they hoped the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices. All his wives except Janelle were raised in polygamist families. But, Janelle's mother went on to become a polygamist after her daughter, and is now in a plural marriage with Kody's dad . The series led to the Brown family being investigated for possible prosecution although Kody believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman, and the other marriages are spiritual unions. The Brown family belongs to the Apostolic United Brethren- a polygamous Mormon fundamentalist church within the Latter Day Saint movement. No word yet if the divorce and new legal marriage will feature on future episodes of the family's TLC show. Meri encouraged Kody's courtship of and marriage to his fourth wife Robyn. Here, a still from their wedding reception which aired on TLC's SIster Wives. The ceremony itself was 'too sacred' for television .","Kody Brown stars in TLC's Sister Wives with his four 'wives' and children, but only his marriage to first wife Meri was legal .

"From Ellie Goulding's lush blonde locks to Louise Thompson's Chelsea girl tresses, many in the world of showbiz have received a helping hand from Kapello hair extensions. The top-quality Remy specialists are pioneering a pre-taped application method - which essentially involves attaching extensions to your real hair using a strip of, essentially, sticky tape. Many say this method is, for European hair, trumping micro-rings, weaves and even keratin bonds. Long locks: Deni pictured after having the extensions - which are a great colour match - put in . Deni's locks (before, left) was transformed with extensions (right) Pre-tapes are said to score higher for a seamless look. They lie flat on the head so there are no lumps or bumps, have a weightless feel, and are easy to apply. It takes just 40 minutes for a whole head. I've got lots of hair but it's fine and, thanks to bleaching my whole head for the best part of a year (I'm a sensible ombré now), loads of it is now short and many of the strands are broken. I was wary of having hair extensions as I have read the horror stories - matting at the roots, the wrong type of glue used, bald patches and head-shaving. And I hate the look of clumps of hair that can be created with micro-rings. A high pony  stays up and in place during hours of gruelling workouts at the gym . But with Kapello I was convinced they were risk-free enough to give them a try. I was in and out of the salon - hair going from limp and average to full, curly and glamorous - in just an hour. Pre-taped extensions take just 40 minutes to apply, then just add on some time for washing and styling the hair. For the application process, there's no stress on the scalp as the tapes are flat and comfortable. They feature a polyurethane base with integrated hair, and have a polyester film for applying the acrylic base. This makes them transparent, flexible and very resistant. The film comes off the tape, it's stuck behind the hair, then a double flap comes over to seal the extension. Kapello's pre tapes are unique in that they have an indentation in the middle of the tape for clear and precise application - plus curved edges for scalp comfort. They should only ever be applied by a professional. Once they're in, it's up to you to make sure they stay looking gorgeous. The main thing to consider is caring for the hair properly -  don't coat it in shine-sucking sulphates or use the wrong brush, for example (more on aftercare below). The film comes off the tape, it's stuck behind the hair, then a double flap comes over to seal the extension . For the application process, there's no stress on the scalp as the tapes are super flat and comfortable . If you lift your hair to reveal them they can contrast with the root, but look fabulous when the hair comes over . Several weeks in, Deni wears her hair in all sorts of styles and the tapes continue to stay discreetly in place . Bradley King, the hair extension technician from Urban Retreat in Harrods, London, who did my hair, is a huge fan of pre-tapes for the speed of application, plus the high quality of the brand's Russian hair. 'I use Kapello pre taped extensions because of how quick they are to apply,' he says. 'Most people lead busy lifestyles and many don't have the time it takes to apply traditional extensions. These extensions are luxurious and soft, I love using the Russian hair for my clients.' He has said that the best colour combination is when you mix two or even three shades to get a really natural look, and you can create the ombré look very easily by adding a blonde along with your natural colour. Bradley said he favours a mix of application methods - pre tapes plus a few bonds near the hairline - for the ultimate best result. I have to say though so far, three weeks in, I wear my hair up and down, straight and curly, and the tapes hardly ever poke through. And not one has fallen out. Revealing the tapes, they do look garish next to my root colour, but when it's tied up it looks very natural . Letting the hair dry naturally it goes into lovely soft beachy waves - and you can't see the tapes when it's up . Ethically sourced, the brand's pre taped extensions are reusable and suitable for all hair types - including very fine hair. Kapello won Best Human Hair Extensions in the 2014 Hair Awards, and the brand is taking the industry by storm. As well as glamorous celebrities it's working women who are buying into the pre tape takeover. The luxury hair extensions label have seen a soaring demand for these particular extensions as time-poor women seek out quicker (and cheaper!) extensions solutions. Make the most of your extensions by taking good care of them . Hair extensions require some maintenance and care. Once you have had them fitted your stylist will guide you through how best to look after your new hair. Extensions are often costly and can take a while to attach, so it's important to look after them properly. Make the most of your extensions by taking good care of them and using the correct products. Correct aftercare is just as important as going to a specialist who can fit the extensions correctly in the first place. Reduce the amount you wash your hair if you can . Washing hair too much - more than three times a week - can put too much stress on the extensions due to excessive heat and styling. Ban sulphate hair products . It is important to only use a shampoo and conditioner that your stylist says is safe for hair extensions. Many brands contain lots of sodium chloride (salt) which will dry out your hair and silicone based ingredients which can cause some bonds to weaken and break down. Continue conditioning . You also need to keep your hair in really good condition by using a moisturising conditioner. However, only condition from the mid lengths to the end of the hair. Do not apply any conditioner to the area where the extensions are attached as this could cause them to weaken. Take care drying and styling . The hair is at its weakest when wet so ensure it is dried gently and handled carefully. Sleep with it tied in a scrunchie . Tie your hair back in a loose ponytail or plait using a soft scrunchie for bed so it doesn't get tangled. Beware the three month rule . Never wear your extensions for longer than 3 months continuously without maintenance as during this time your hair will have grown by approx 1.5 inches and the roots of your hair will start to tangle. Brushing . Remember your extensions are attached to your own natural hair, pulling too hard or mistreating your extensions can result in your own hair being pulled out. The only brush you should use near to your extension bonds is an extension brush with soft loop bristles or a Tangle Teezer. When brushing the extensions always hold the where the extensions are attached making sure no additional stress is put on the hair.

"For years, Google has been driving around the world providing Street View images for people to explore when using Google Maps. But a new challenger could be on the scene, as cars owned by Apple been spotted with similar camera equipment on their roofs. While not confirmed, some think it may be that Apple is planning its own rival to Street View - or even testing self-driving car technology. Scroll down for a video of a similar car spotted last year . A car with cameras on it (shown) was spotted driving around San Francisco. The California DMV confirmed the car was registered to Apple. Some have speculated it could be getting images for a Street View rival . The Dodge van with the equipment on the top was spotted by the blog Claycord in San Francisco. They apparently asked the driver what he was doing, but he refused to give an answer. The head of self-driving cars for Google expects real people to be using them on public roads in two to five years. Chris Urmson says the cars would still be test vehicles, and Google would collect data on how they interact with other vehicles and pedestrians. But Mr Urmson wouldn't give a date for putting driverless cars on roads en masse, saying that the system has to be safe enough to work properly. He told reporters last month at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit that he wants to reach the point where his test team no longer has to pilot the cars. But a video from last year shows a similar car, which was known to be an unmarked self-driving Dodge caravan. The latest car seems to have some sort of camera system on the top, somewhat similar to the camera system on top of Google’s Street View car. It could also be a camera system for a self-driving car. According to 9to5mac, the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) confirmed the vehicle was leased to Apple. With 12 cameras on top of the car, some have said that is too many for it to be a mapping car like Google’s Street View. ‘Too many cameras,’ said technology analyst Rob Enderle, speaking to CBS. ‘It has cameras that are angled down at all four corners of the vehicle.’ Apple ditched Google Maps as the default navigation app on iOS devices in 2012 in favour of Apple Maps. But it has lacked a Street View function since then like Google Maps. Shown is one of their cars in Brooklyn . Google launched its Street View technology in 2007, and has considerably refined the technology since then (screenshot near Trafalgar Square in London shown) The would lend itself to the self-driving car theory. ‘Unfortunately for that theory, only six companies have been issued the permits necessary to test such vehicles, and Apple isn’t one of them,’ said 9to5mac. ‘This brings us back to a much more likely conclusion: Apple is preparing to take on Google’s Street View with a similar offering in its own Maps software.’ They said it might features as part of the iOS 9 upgrate due later this year, although it would likely begin only with select cities such as New York and San Francisco. This would plug a noticeable hole in Apple Maps, which has been sorely missing Street View ever since Apple made it the default maps app for iPhones. These cars would therefore signify a move to take on Google at their own Street View game. When contacted by MailOnline, Apple declined to comment on the car in question or what its purpose was. Apple ditched Google Maps (left) as the default navigation app on iOS devices in 2012 in favour of their own Apple Maps (right), but it has lacked the Street View functionality since then . Others have said the vehicle may be testing self-driving technology, again like Google has been doing (Google's self-driving car shown). Apple has so far declined to comment on the appearance of the car .","A car with cameras on it was spotted driving around San Francisco .

"Jesus Christ taught about the importance of people paying their tax, the Archbishop of Canterbury claimed today. The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money, but part of the problem was an 'unbelievably complex' tax system. The remarks will be seen as a highly political intervention as David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance. Scroll down for video . The Most Rev Justin Welby said companies and people should pay their 'fair share' in the country where they had made their money . Dr Welby, a former oil executive, said business was important and should be supported but there was a temptation to misuse the power that came through wealth. He told the BBC: 'There has always been the principle that you pay tax where you earn the money. If you earn money in a particular country, the revenue service of that country needs to get a fair share of what you have earned.' Highlighting the complexities of the international tax system, he said: 'Someone said the other day that the tax system was of biblical proportions. Well, the Bible's only a thousand pages - how many tax systems are only a thousand pages? They are several hundred times that. 'There needs to be simplification in tax so that people are responsible in the right place.' He added that there was a 'very basic principle' that 'as a Christian we see that Jesus Christ spoke of, about the importance of people paying what is due'. 'The Bible speaks of it endlessly,' he said. It is the Archbishop's latest intervention on economic matters, having spoken out about inequality in recent weeks. He stressed that 'business is important', adding: 'We need to affirm the significance of those who generate and create wealth, but we also need to be realistic about the fact ... that with wealth comes power and with power comes a temptation to misuse power. 'There's a reality of the human condition, of what Christians call sin, what the Bible calls sin, which says don't misuse the power you have got through wealth.' Asked whether some people were doing that he said: 'There's always elements where that happens, because people are people.' But the response to that was not to 'throw the baby out with the bathwater and say that business is bad' - instead, 'solidarity' and an improved regulatory framework were required. At Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron and Ed Miliband clashed in the Commons over tax avoidance . At Prime Minister's Questions,  Mr Miliband accused the Prime Minister of failing to act to close a tax loophole for hedge funds because 'too many of his friends would get caught in the net'. He repeatedly pressed the Prime Minister to close the tax loophole which allowed hedge funds to avoid stamp duty on stock-market transactions 'costing hundreds of millions of pounds'. The Labour leader claimed: 'This is a Prime Minister who won't tackle tax avoidance for the simple reason that too many of his friends would get caught in the net. 'They are the party of Mayfair hedge funds and Monaco tax avoiders and under him you will always know it's one rule for those at the top and another rule for everyone else.' But Mr Cameron hit back: 'When we came to office foreigners didn't pay stamp duty on the properties they bought. Foreigners didn't pay capital gains tax on the properties they bought. 'And because of your tax rates City hedge fund managers were paying lower tax rates than the people who cleaned their offices. That's what we had to sort out.'","Justin Welby says the Bible 'speaks endlessly' of paying what is due .

"A Washington state police detective is facing charges of sexual misconduct with a minor after she allegedly had sex with a 17-year-old she met while working as a resource officer at a high school. The relationship between Det. Dione Thompson and the transgender teen began in 2010, according to KiroTV, when the then-17-year-old was a student at Bothell High School and continued until February 2011. The 45-year-old reportedly had sexual encounters with the former student in her patrol car at a library and outside of a restaurant, Seattle PI reports. The teenager was living as a woman when Thomas first met him, but now identifies as a man. Dione allegedly even moved the teen into the home she shared with her girlfriend. Sexual Misconduct: Detective Dione Thompson (photographed), is facing charges of sexual misconduct with a minor after she had sex with a 17-year-old she met while working at a high school . According to court documents, the relationship began with Thompson contacting the former student on Facebook and the two soon began seeing each other outside of school. At the time, the former student identified as a female and court records state that Thompson persuaded him to live in the home Thompson shared with her partner at a time when he was facing 'a lot of turmoil' personally. He reportedly lived with Thompson for a long period of time and the two continued the sexual relationship, according to KOMO news. The former student initially denied the relationship when suspicions surfaced shortly after the two got together, but reportedly contacted Thompson's ex-partner in August who reported the claims to a King's County Sheriff's Office detective. Thompson, who is a 16-year veteran of the Bothell Police Department, was transferred out of the high school once she became a detective after serving at the school for six or seven years, Kiro reports. High School: Thompson reportedly met the student here at Bothell High School where she served as a resource officer for six or seven years . She is currently on paid, administrative leave pending the investigation and denied having sex with the then teen when investigators contacted her regarding the allegations in September. She has not been jailed, according to Seattle PI, but if convicted could face between six to 12 months of jail time. The victim told investigators that Thompson ended the relationship in 2011 but he only now realizes the harm Thompson caused by abusing her power and the trust he gave her.","Detective Dione Thompson met the transgender teen while working at a high school and pursued a relationship with the minor .

"A British holidaymaker who was seriously injured when a teenage boy crashed into her while they received ski lessons in the French Alps is taking legal action against the tour operator who organised the trip. Juliet Doyle, from Northfield in Birmingham, said she struggles to complete simple tasks and was forced to temporarily end her pursuit of a radiotherapy and oncology degree as a result of her injuries. The 50-year-old mother of three is seeking compensation to help with her recovery and rehabilitation after suffering torn ligaments in her left knee, a fractured right ankle and a torn rotator cuff in her right shoulder  at Saint-Gervais, France in April 2013. Juliet Doyle is seeking compensation after she was injured on a ski trip with her son in France . Juliet booked the family ski holiday and lessons with Peak Retreats Limited to celebrate her son’s 21st birthday. She was waiting for the rest of her group to ski to the bottom of the slope when a 14-year-old boy in the class crashed into her from behind. She claims the boy had been repeatedly warned about his behaviour and told that he was skiing too fast and beyond his capabilities. Juliet said she has had an operation on her ankle after a cyst developed on the bone and will undergo a bone graft this month. Juliet Doyle, 50, said her injuries forced her to end her pursuit of a radiotherapy and oncology degree . She also needs an operation to repair her damaged shoulder and requires ongoing physiotherapy to aid her recovery. She said: ‘This skiing holiday to France with my family was supposed to be a relaxing break to celebrate my son’s 21st birthday and an opportunity to improve my skiing. Instead, I have been left with injuries that have had a huge impact on me, both physically and in my career. ‘At the time of the accident I was training to be a radiographer and was working hard to reach my goals and start a new career. However, all my hard work may be wasted as I no longer have a place at the university and will have to reapply once I recover and am able to attend lectures. ‘The injuries have also affected my day-to-day life as I can no longer do simple tasks around the house or walk my dog. I’ve also missed a number of family occasions and I’ve been left feeling frustrated, angry and upset by the circumstances of my accident and the physical damage it has caused. ‘I’m taking legal action to help get the support for further rehabilitation for my injuries so that I can get my life back on track. But I also hope that my case acts as a reminder of the dangers that skiers face and that all ski holiday operators will make sure they keep their novice skiers safe during their lessons.’ Juliet Doyle said she booked the family ski trip and lessons with tour operator Peak Retreats Limited . A spokesperson for Peak Retreats Limited told MailOnline Travel: 'Peak Retreats was recently saddened to hear that Mrs Doyle had an accident during her holiday in 2013. 'It was first notified of the alleged incident over a year and a half after it was said to have occurred and is still investigating the matter with the local ski school and its insurers. 'It is therefore unable to add any other comments at this stage. Sadly accidents between skiers can occur anywhere on the slopes and for this reason Peak Retreats always insist its clients have adequate ski travel insurance in place.' Juliet has hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to seek compensation from Peak Retreats Limited. Joseph Dawson, a specialist travel lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: ‘What was supposed to be an enjoyable week-long break for Juliet has resulted in almost two years of pain and suffering and turned her life upside down. ‘We are now taking legal action, on Juliet’s behalf, to secure compensation, to include the necessary funds to cover her physiotherapy and rehabilitation costs so that we can maximise her chances of a good recovery. ‘ .","Juliet Doyle, 50, was injured while taking ski lessons at Saint-Gervais .

"We've all heard of mobile homes, but how about a mobile island? One designer has put forward a plan for the ultimate yacht accessory - a roll out platform that serves as a private spot in the middle of the ocean. Measuring some 33ft by 26ft when deployed, Henry Ward's design concept is a folding, floating platform, which  can be stored in the tender bay of a large yacht and opened out when needed. The pop-up island offers excellent facilities that can give you a closer feeling of being on the sea than on a large boat . Measuring some 33ft x 26ft when deployed, Henry Ward's design concept is a folding, floating platform, which in its folded position can be stored in a tender bay of a large yacht . Henry Ward came up with the design during his final year of his Transport Design degree at the University of Huddersfield . Deployed using standard overhead tender cranes it can be towed by tender in its folded position to a preferred location – either into a shallow bay that the yacht cannot access, or simply to act as a stern extension to the yacht's existing transom platform, thereby offering a large and flexible space for recreation, dining and relaxing. An option to configure the island for use as a portable helicopter landing platform is also being investigated, with such a feature allowing existing yachts with no landing facilities, or new designs to have a flexible facility on board, without the need to sacrifice valuable deck space. Ward is a recent graduate of Transport Design and the concept was initiated as part of a final year project. The talented designer told MailOnline Travel: 'We see many potential applications and whilst we continue to technically develop the design further, we are actively seeking a manufacturer who is interested in investing in the development of the product and bringing it to market. 'The Recreational Island started life as my final year project at the University of Huddersfield. I wanted to design an innovative superyacht accessory so began by researching what was being offered by the industry as a whole. An option to configure the island for use as a portable helicopter landing platform is also being investigated . 'I soon released that while superyacht guests were able to enjoy spending time on these impressive 265ft vessels, they were not actually connected to the splendour of the sea, being many decks above the waterline. As for visiting beautiful secluded bays, these vessels were also too big to moor up close and let guests enjoy the surroundings. 'I therefore thought to myself 'what if there was a way of launching a floating island that guests could spend the day on with everything they required on board?' The Recreational Island was then born as a versatile platform design that allows guests to create memorable experiences from a safe, private base.' BMT Nigel Gee, a subsidiary of the BMT Group, is working with Henry Ward Design in the development of the project. Recognising the creativity of HW Design, BMT has invested in the undertaking of technical studies to assess technical feasibility and engineer the design further. The floating island can be folded back up and placed back into the holding bay of the yacht, offering a separate luxury . 'This project is a perfect match for BMT Nigel Gee', said yacht design director James Roy. 'We recognise that creativity drives innovation and it is encouraging to see young designers such as Henry initiating ideas such as the Recreational Island. We are strong believers in recognising that the creation and development of new ideas is best accomplished in a collaborative manner - bringing together unique capabilities to achieve the optimum result.' The team are also investigating the possibility of applying the Recreational Island into the hotel industry, as well as the military and events sectors. After Ward's graduation he took the design work to the Monaco Yacht Show in September 2011 where he met BMT Nigel Gee, an industry leading independent yacht design consultancy based in Southampton. They were excited by the concept and offered to collaborate and assess the technical feasibility of the Recreational Island. The partners are now working to make the project to reality.","Measuring some 33ft x 26ft when deployed, Henry Ward's design concept is a folding, floating platform .

"No matter how small your house or flat is, chances are there are corners of rooms where you struggle to get a Wi-Fi signal. The eero system has been designed to banish these so-called Wi-Fi ‘dead zones’ by boosting a router’s signal inside, and outside, a house. A square eero box measures 4.75 inches (121mm), meaning it can be placed discreetly around a house, and it regularly runs checks on the network to avoid crashes and interference.

"A police officer in New Hampshire fired a Taser twice at a 78-year-old driver having a diabetic fit just after the elderly man had crashed into several cars. Officer Andre Wassouf fired the stun gun on Sunday morning at the fitting man when he came to a halt after he struck his squad car and made a movement as if 'he was going for a weapon'. The driver was handcuffed immediately after being incapacitated but was not charged with a crime when police realized the man was not intoxicated or on drugs but had dangerously low blood sugar. An officer in Portsmouth, New Hampshire feared he was in danger when he used a stun gun on a 78-year-old diabetic driver who crashed into several cars at BJ's Wholesale Club on Woodbury Avenue (above file photo) The 215-lb man, who suffered from from a diabetic fit, struck cars in the parking lot of store, including the officer's cruiser on Sunday morning (file photo) Police had received a call at 11.37am about a man who had crashed into two cars in the parking lot of the warehouse club chain on Woodbury Avenue, according to Seacoast Online. When Officer Wassouf attended the scene, the man, with his window raised down, started driving away. The driver then ignored Wassouf's order to stop the car, before striking an empty parked vehicle and eventually reversing into the police cruiser, breaking a headlight. As Wassouf thought the car was in park, he tried to pull the 215-lb man from the vehicle but failed as it kept moving in the neutral position. The driver was shot twice with the Taser after the responding officer thought he was going for a weapon (file photo) The man did not obey several commands to stop, and when he reached for something on the passenger's seat, the officer thought he was going for a weapon and used the stun device on him twice. 'This allowed the officer to finally take control of the situation and get the driver into handcuffs,' Corey MacDonald, deputy Portsmouth police chief. Fire Chief Steve Achilles said firefighters observed that the driver was 'weak' after being shocked and determined he was diabetic and his blood sugar was low. The condition the man suffered from can mimic alcohol abuse or a behavioral problem, he added. Achilles also said it is not uncommon for diabetics in that condition to be combative or angry which makes responses by emergency officials challenging. The driver was given intravenous treatment, and his condition rapidly improved. He was taken by ambulance to Portsmouth Regional Hospital as a precaution. 'Upon initial review, though the incident is regrettable for all involved, the officer appears to have used reasonable non-lethal force to end a potentially dangerous situation,' MacDonald said. 'Our police officers are not paramedics. They are charged with bringing dangerous situations under control. This driver could just as easily have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs, or engaging in willful criminal conduct.' The incident, like all use-of-force episodes, will be subject to review by a police committee.","Unidentified man struck cars in parking lot of BJ's Wholesale Club in Portsmouth, New Hampshire .

"A quick search on Instagram today reveals more than 228 million photos tagged with the hashtag #selfie - and that figure doesn't include the selfies taken without the tag. But which US states, and UK towns are the most vain when it comes to posting photos of themselves? Using data taken from Instagram's developer API platform, researchers have plotted these selfies on maps to discover Hawaii is the most narcissistic state, Brighton residents are Britain's vainest, and in London, the most selfies are taken in the borough of Westminster. Explore the interactive selfie maps of the US, UK and London below . The maps (US pictured) are based on data collected using the Instagram API platform, of images tagged #selfie with a geolocation. They were designed by Create It Now using open source mapping software CartoDB. The hashtags, collected between 1 November and the 5 January, were geolocated and placed onto the maps. Using these coordinates, experts merged the data with population figures taken from government and federal stats to give a 'selfies per 100,000 inhabitants' figure . Each of the maps were designed by personalised gift service site Create It Now using open source mapping software CartoDB. Using geolocation information from photos posted to Instagram with the #selfie tag, researchers plotted each selfie on respective maps of the US, UK and London. State/District . Hawaii . Nevada . District of Columbia . New York . California . Florida . Washington . Rhode Island . Maine . Selfies per 100k . 5.07 . 3.21 . 2.73 . 2.13 . 1.97 . 1.61 . 1.53 . 1.52 . 1.43 . The data was collected between 1 November last year and the start of January. It only included photos posted with the #selfie hashtag, and photos that had been geolocated. The actual number of selfies globally is much higher. Once the coordinates had been plotted, the designers merged the data with population statistics taken from official government, federal or stat figures, in order to determine how many selfies are taken per 100,000 inhabitants in each region. On each map, the blue dots represent the locations of selfies. But in the UK, larger coloured dots are designed to show the proportion of selfies taken per 100,000 people, at a glance. In the US, 72 photos were posted online by people in Hawaii. With an estimated population of 1.4 million, that equates to more than five selfies posted per 100,000 inhabitants. A total of 91 selfies were tagged on Instagram in Nevada, but because the state's population is double that of Hawaii's, the state came in second place with 3.2 selfies. New York was the third vainest state, with 2.1 selfies per 100,000. However, the District of Columbia also got a special mention, in addition to the US states, because despite its low population - estimated at 659,000 - it posted 2.73 selfies per 100,000 residents.

Create It Now explained: 'There are, as always, a couple of side notes to the research. 'We recognise that the data collected is only a fraction of the true amount of selfies taken; not everyone allows their location to be attached to their images and most people that take a selfie dont use the #selfie. 'However finding photos with both geolocation and the #selfie is the only method to accurately rank how 'vain' cities are.' The top 18 vainest London boroughs are pictured.

"Touch screen devices may soon become the norm in classrooms as schools are increasingly moving away from traditional learning methods by using tablets instead. A national survey has found that students as young as five from schools across Australia are using devices like iPads to enhance their education. While one expert says it is important to adapt to the way technology has changed children's learning, studies have found that 60 per cent of students are being exposed to more than the recommended two hours screen time each day. This can impact the child's development of fundamental skills as well as their sleeping patterns. Studies have found that students are being exposed to more than the recommended two hours screen time each day . Current paediatric recommendations and guidelines from the Australian Department of Health suggest screen based media use should be limited to less than two hours per day, according to a report by researchers from the University of Western Australia. The report found an average of 63 per cent of the surveyed 2,620 children exceeded the recommended guidelines of less than two hours. A breakdown shows that 45 per cent of children aged eight spend more than two hours of screen time each day while 80 per cent of 15 to 16 year olds surpass the recommended hours per week day. But child learning expert Kristy Goodwin isn't too fazed by the hours specifically but is more concerned about how these devices are used effectively. 'It all comes down to how the device is used,' Dr Goodwin told Daily Mail Australia. 'If devices are used appropriately it can really enhance children's learning. 'But they shouldn't be used as digital babysitters at schools, which is often the case for parents who use these devices to pacify children. 'Like anything in life, if it is used excessively it will have a negative effect.' A national survey has found that students as young as five, from schools across Australia, are using devices like iPads to enhance heir education . Dr Goodwin, a Macquarie University academic and director of Every Chance to Learn, further supports the increasing use of electronic devices and screen time at primary schools, as long as teachers are properly trained - which often isn't the case. 'Children today are digital natives,' she said. 'Young children should be encouraged to use tablets as emerging research and evidence shows that it can be a great learning tool in the classroom. 'Technology is also changing children's predisposition and their expectations of learning and they're craving visual information and processing visuals before text. 'But the problem is that all of a sudden, teachers are expected to know how to teach effectively using devices but are not given the right training for it and this is critical if we want to enhance the learning of young students.' A survey of 1267 Australian schools last year found that 27 per cent have implemented the Bring Your Own Dedicated Device strategy, which has increased from 19 per cent in 2013. The BYODD program, which urges students to bring tablets to school, include primary school students from ages five to 12. The Softlink 2014 Australian School Library Survey, which is due to be released next week, also shows that 12 per cent of schools that have a BYODD strategy are for primary education. What also troubles Dr Goodwin is that children's development of fundamental skills like handwriting may be affected as well as their sleeping patterns. 'What's concerning is that by exposing children to tablets they often don't develop the same kind of fundamental skills like handwriting and there's also impact on sleep as the use of these devices may affect sleep depth and sleeping patterns,' she said. 'But if children are given a task on tablets it increases their engagement and motivation to complete the exercise. 'Society is going digital so I think it's our moral imperative to use technology in our classrooms and look at right ways to use it as an effective learning tool. 'Banning it at schools purely because we fear the use of devices is not the right thing to be doing.' The Department of Health recommends that children under the age of two should not spend any time using electronic devices - that includes tablets. For ages two to five, they should be limited to less than an hour each day. Infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers should not be sedentary, restrained or kept inactive for more than one hour at a time with the exception of sleeping. Children aged five to 12 should use limit their use for less than two hours per day.","A report shows 45 per cent of children aged eight surpass the recommended two hours of screen time each day .

"It is the curse of tourists around the world - mispronouncing common place names such as Leicester Square, Llanelli, or New York's Houston. Now, Google could come to the rescue - with a pronunciation guide that tells you exactly how the locals say their streets. The firm's latest patent reveals the plans for the service. Scroll down for video . Google's guide will ask locals to record place names to find out the most common way. Google could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals. This could then be used to find the most common pronunciation. software could then find the most common recorded file, and play it to users when someone searches for the place on Google Maps. The patent details how Google could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals, then offer that pronunciation when someone searches for the place on Google Maps. This function could be handy, as Google says in the patent, 'when traveling in a foreign country.' 'Systems and methods are provided to select a most typical pronunciation of a location name on a map from a plurality of user pronunciations,' the application says. 'A server generates a reference speech model based on user pronunciations, compares the user pronunciations with the speech model and selects a pronunciation based on comparison.' 'Alternatively, the server compares the distance between one the user pronunciations and every other user pronunciations and selects a pronunciation based on comparison. 'The server then annotates the map with the selected pronunciation and provides the audio output of the location name to a user device upon a user's request.' The place name used in the patent filing is Worcester  - the name of a city in the UK, and also of one in South Africa and ten places in the US—and it is pronounced slightly differently in each country. Google could determine the most common pronunciation of a place name from audio clips submitted by locals. This could then be used to find the most common pronunciation. Google said the patent doesn't necessarily mean that Google will be adding this functionality to its maps anytime soon: 'Some of those ideas later mature into real products or services, some don't,' a spokeswoman said. Google also recently officially launched speech translation as part of its Translate app. Both iOS and Android users can now talk to the app and get a written translation of what they're saying, in real time, on the screen. The move builds on Google's current tools, which offer written translation of 90 languages, as well  spoken translations in a select number of languages on Android devices. 'Often the hardest part of travelling is navigating the local language,' said Barak Turovsky, product lead for Google Translate. 'Now Google Translate can be your guide in new ways. Asking for directions to the Rive Gauche, ordering bacalhau in Lisbon, or chatting with your grandmother in her native Spanish just got a lot faster.'","Google to ask locals to record place names to find most common .

"The stunning identical twins involved in an alleged stabbing row over a man were known as the 'Croatian Kardashians' and were jealous of one another's looks, friends have revealed. Sara Grkovic, 22, has been arrested and faces an attempted murder charge after she allegedly stabbed sister Dajana because she was believed to be envious of her relationship with a man they both liked. Police were called to their home on Saturday night after a violent row which ended when Sara plunged a kitchen knife into her twin sister leaving her critically injured and fighting for life. The pair would compete with one another to post the most attractive pictures to Facebook, and would even jealously compare their looks with the other, according to friends. Today, it can also be revealed that the pair were obsessed with the Kardashian family and dreamed of emulating the global success of Kim and her sisters. Accused: Sara Grkovic was remanded in custody accused of stabbing her sister Dajana in a jealous rage. Pictured is Sara's Facebook profile picture, where the pair would compete to post the most attractive picture . Stabbed: Dajana Grkovic (left) was allegedly attacked by her twin Sara (right) who was believed to be jealous of her relationship with a man. The pair were known to friends as the 'Croatian Kardashians' In custody: Sara and her sister were alleged to have argued frequently and had a huge row on Saturday, believed to be over a man they both liked . One friend of the two girls, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said: 'I find it incredible that the argument was over a boy, they used to have all the guys here chasing after them and everybody used to call them the Kardashian sisters. 'They seem to have everything, and it's really shocking to hear that Sara apparently stabbed Dajana. I have read the papers saying it was over a boy but the fact is only they know what went on behind the walls of the family home. 'It's a real shame they couldn't have sorted out whatever the problem was among themselves in a less violent way. 'I think both of them are quite volatile though, and I have to think about the only person they would ever listen to is the Kardashians. 'I reckon it would be a good thing to make them friends again and we all hope Dajana will recover soon.' Obsession: According to friends, the Grkovic sisters were obsessed with the Kardashian family - especially the success of sisters Khloe (left), Kourtney (centre) and Kim (right) Police were called to the house that the sisters shared together in the northern Croatian port city of Rijeka after neighbours reported hearing a violent row that ended with Sara plunging a kitchen knife into her twin sister leaving her critically injured. Medics revealed that Dajana is expected to fully recover but is still in intensive care. A hospital spokesman said: 'She is slowly recovering but we are not allowing any visitors. Police are also waiting to interview her but she is currently still too ill and they will not be allowed to speak to until she has had further surgery.' On Tuesday, Sara  made a brief court appearance before judge Ksenia Zorc who said that the young woman would have to stay in jail for another month, and set bail at £10,000. It's been reported that Sara is claiming that she had only acted in self-defence after he sister tried to strangle her, forcing her to grab a knife off a table. A police officer told the court that they did find bruising around Sara's throat indicating that somebody had tried to strangle her. Friends at the Rijeka Economics University said they were stunned that although they seemed successful and confident, the pair came from a broken home and were living in a tiny one-bedroom flat in the poorest part of town. Their mother struggled to provide for the family after her husband walked out and they later divorced. Neighbours believe she is working in Germany as a kitchen assistant and would send money back to her daughters living in the family flat. Model looks: Sara Grkovic has been charged with stabbing her twin sister. The girls were described by a neighbour as 'peas in a pod' and equally stunning . Friends said they struggled to make ends meet and would spend any income they had on looking as glamorous as possible, an image which was in complete contrast to their home in the poor Zamet area of Rijeka. One neighbour told local TV: 'They were apparently arguing about a man that they both liked. He seems to have settled down in a relationship with Dajana and Sara was not happy about it. 'I never would have thought it would come to her trying to kill her sister though. They were always immaculately groomed and polite, and as alike as two peas in a pod. I never knew which one was passing me in the corridor but they always said hello.' She said that she did not often see the two girls together although they lived at the same address, and thought that despite the fact they were identical twins there was an element of jealousy between the two over who was the more attractive. Happier times: Identical twins Sara and Dajana as children with their mother . Attack: The stabbing took place at in the northern Croatian port city of Rijeka . She said: 'Both of them were stunning, I don't think they worried about competition from other women, but they were certainly jealous of each other.' Dajana is currently in the intensive care ward at the local hospital with a deep wound to her chest and to her thigh. She remains in a stable condition. Their father is not in contact with the family, according to family friends. One told local media: 'They had been a bit wild since their mother went away, and they were left to their own devices. But we never thought it would come to something like this.'","Sara and Dajana Grkovic, both 22, lived together in Croatian city of Rijeka .

"Glen Codd, 27, was jailed for four years for raping a six-year-old girl in 2001 when he was about 12 . A father-to-be has been jailed after he raped a six-year-old girl when he was just 12 - telling her it was 'only a game'. Glenn Codd, 27, from Rochester in Kent, attacked the girl in 2001 - forcing her to perform a sex act and then raping her - but she only came forward more than a decade later, a court heard. The orthopaedic technician denied rape and indecent assault at Maidstone Crown Court but was convicted by an 11-1 majority and sentenced to four years in prison. The victim had told her mother what happened some years ago but she did not want to involve the police, the Kent Online reported. It was not until November 2013 that she finally informed officers and Codd was arrested days later and charged with the offences, which he denied. In a police interview, she reportedly said: 'He was trying to make a game out of it. He kept saying waggle was the game. I can see him saying ""Waggle - x marks the spot"".' She also said that she had told a male friend that Codd had done things to her that 'were not right' but was 'too embarrassed' to say what. Deborah Champion, defending, told the court that the 27-year-old already had a young son and was expecting another child. She said: 'He has been of good character since. He is an exemplary family man, hard working and productive. 'He has not accepted the conviction. He still doesn't accept his guilt. The passage of time tends to block out things that have happened in the past.' Judge David Griffith-Jones QC told Codd: 'The offences reveal you were somewhat precocious and because of your upbringing, which was somewhat harsh, you may have been more advanced about the ways of the world, in particular sexual matters, than your chronological age might have suggested. Codd denied the allegations at Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) but was jailed for four years after being found guilty by a 11-1 majority . 'The fact is you took advantage of her immaturity and naivete. You preyed upon her sensibilities and used your position of power.' Following the sentencing, Detective Constable Ally Smith, who investigated the case said: 'Codd took advantage of a young child's innocence in order to satisfy his own perverse sexual needs. 'This one incident has adversely affected the course of her entire life and she has had to adapt to deal with the trauma. 'I would like to pay tribute to the courage and fortitude she has shown in assisting us with this prosecution.' As well as a four year prison term, Codd will also be listed on the sex offenders' register.","Glenn Codd, 27, attacked girl in 2001 but she came forward 12 years later .

"Convicted: Ross William Ulbricht was convicted of seven drug and conspiracy counts on Wednesday for his role in the underground internet drug marketplace Silk Road . A San Francisco man was swiftly convicted Wednesday of creating and operating an underground website that prosecutors said enabled drug dealers around the world to reach customers they would never find on the street. Ross William Ulbricht was convicted of seven drug and conspiracy counts. The jury's verdict in federal court in Manhattan came after little more than three hours of deliberations and one day after prosecutors urged jurors to follow Ulbricht's 'digital fingerprints.' The government said drug dealing made up nearly all of Silk Road's sales during its nearly three years in business, which ended with Ulbricht's October 2013 arrest. Prosecutors also discounted defense claims that Ulbricht was framed by others in a murky Internet world where nothing is what it seems. Prosecutors said Ulbricht enabled more than 1 million drug deals on Silk Road and earned about $18 million in bitcoins. Sales of illegal drugs of every type were delivered through the website, representing at least $180 million in sales, they said. Ulbricht had several supporters among the spectators. When the verdict was announced, his father dropped his head in his hands. Later, a male spectator shouted out, 'Ross is a hero!' Another called out to him: 'It's not over Ross. We love you.' As Ulbricht was led out of court, he waved toward the spectator section. Lyn Ulbricht, his mother, exited the courtroom complaining that the defense had been barred from putting on evidence that would help her son. 'It was not a fair trial. It was not an even playing field, and I think that's a tragedy,' she said. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the conviction 'should send a clear message to anyone else attempting to operate an online criminal enterprise. The supposed anonymity of the dark web is not a protective shield from arrest and prosecution.' The government said the fallacy of Ulbricht's promise of anonymity in the dark corners of the Internet as a reason for customers to peddle their illegal merchandise online was exposed by numerous trial witnesses, including the first: Homeland Security Agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan. Major player: Ulbricht, 30, is seen in a courtroom sketch during his trial for his role orchestrating a scheme that enabled around $200 million of anonymous online drug sales using bitcoins . Defense attorney Dratel said his client quit Silk Road soon after creating it to sell anything on the Internet and before the website was overrun by drug dealers . He testified that shipments originating on the website first came to his attention in June 2011 when X-rays and canine detection dogs at Chicago's O'Hare Airport turned up envelopes from the Netherlands containing Ecstasy pills wrapped in vacuum seal and foil. Soon, the drugs were being sent through many countries. By late September, Der-Yeghiayan said he learned about Silk Road and began infiltrating it, taking over staff member accounts each time one was arrested or agreed to cooperate. The agent testified that the website's online boss went by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, a reference to the swashbuckling character in 'The Princess Bride,' and prosecutors presented numerous instant message conversations involving a person using that persona. Defense attorney Joshua Dratel insisted evidence proved Ulbricht was not Dread Pirate Roberts. But Der-Yeghiayan said he was the agent who was communicating online with Ulbricht when he was arrested while sitting at his computer at San Francisco's Glen Park Library. Agents, he said, were instructed to snatch the laptop before arresting Ulbricht. No sooner had authorities announced the shuttering of an alleged illegal online drug bazaar than another popped up claiming to take its place. Welcome to the 'dark Web,' an increasingly popular corner of the Internet where thousands of computer users from around the globe interact anonymously — and, in many cases, illegally. An underground website calling itself Silk Road 3.0 Reloaded claimed to be open for business on the TOR network, which is linked globally through special browsers that encrypt Internet traffic. Several other websites on the TOR network also claimed to be open for drug transactions. eBay of drugs: Silk Road worked as a veritable eBay of drugs, selling everything from marijuana to cocaine and pharmaceutical drugs . Prosecutors said Ulbricht enabled more than 1 million drug deals on Silk Road and earned about $18 million in bitcoins . The dark Web poses new and formidable challenges for law enforcement agencies around the world that have been dealing for decades with more conventional international drug trafficking. The reach and anonymity of these 21st century Internet operations is difficult to penetrate. Silk Road and copycats on the TOR network are not readily visible through popular Internet search sites. The buyers and sellers don't exchange cash, dealing instead in often untraceable digital currencies, usually Bitcoin. So there are no banking records for investigators to subpoena . Those who created and support the TOR network say it's a way to protect online users' privacy in the digital age. TOR boasts that none of its websites will appear in Google search. 'TOR was created to protect people's privacy and anonymity, and we don't condone its use for these illegal activities,' said Roger Dingledine, who co-created the TOR network originally for the U.S. Navy. But investigators around the globe say the network is also a place of flagrant and profligate illegal activity of all sorts — from prostitution to arms trafficking — and they vow to crack down. 'Underground websites such as Silk Road and Silk Road 2.0 are like the Wild West of the Internet, where criminals can anonymously buy and sell all things illegal,' said Homeland Security Investigations Executive Associate Director Peter Edge. In addition to the Silk Road site, authorities say they have seized or shut down other virtual marketplaces with names such as Hydra, Cloud Nine, Pandora and Blue Sky. Police in Europe seized $1 million in digital currency and $225,000 worth of cash, drugs, gold and silver. Big business: Sales of illegal drugs of every type were delivered through the website, representing at least $180 million in sales, prosecutors said . On it, he said, they discovered that Ulbricht was signed in as Dread Pirate Roberts and was immersed in a chat with Der-Yeghiayan. During closing arguments Tuesday, Dratel said his client quit Silk Road soon after creating it to sell anything on the Internet and before the website was overrun by drug dealers. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner said Ulbricht operated the site from beginning to end and was willing to do anything to protect it. He cited emails that he said showed Ulbricht was willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to kill as many as five people he thought were threats to his operation. Ulbricht faced no murder charges in New York, but still awaits trial in Baltimore in a murder-to-hire plot. His sentencing in New York is scheduled for May 15, and some of the charges carry a maximum of life in prison. Killer?

"Thousands of ISIS supporters took to Twitter in the days after Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh was captured to suggest sick methods of execution - including the two techniques that ultimately resulted in his death, it emerged today. Kasasbeh was seen being burnt alive before being run over by a bulldozer in a 22-minute-long video released by the terror group yesterday, in which the level of barbarism and brutality sunk to new lows, even by ISIS' depraved standards. The method of murder raises the chilling prospect that ISIS may have been influenced by the Twitter campaign, which used the Arabic hashtag #SuggestAWayToKillTheJordanianPilotPig to elicit ideas from the terror group's supporters. Brutal: The sickening decision to burn Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh alive may have come from Twitter after ISIS supporters launched a hashtag calling for execution ideas in the days after his capture . Captured: Kasasbeh was caught by ISIS militants on December 24 when his F-16 fighter jet suffered mechanical problems and crash-landed close to ISIS' Syrian stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa . Horror: A Twitter user calling himself Black Flag suggested using wild animals to execute Kasasbeh before suggesting death by chainsaw or melting with acid as possible alternatives. No escape: The idea to place the pilot in a cage may have come from a Twitter user calling himself Sham Islamic Echo, who tweeted: '[I] suggest bringing a hungry crocodile and put it in a cage with the pilot' In the days after Kasasbeh's capture - which occurred on December 24 when his F-16 fighter jet suffered mechanical problems and crash-landed close to ISIS' Syrian stronghold and de facto capital Raqqa - militants used Twitter to crowd source ideas for his execution. A film clip featuring a woman who claimed to be the mother of a Syrian man killed in a coalition airstrike suggested 'impalement, not with a mercy shooting or a mercy knife.' Another horrific idea from a Twitter user calling himself Abu Ishaq Sophistication was to either place Kasasbeh in a tank and set it alight, or to use acupuncture needles dipped in acid to disfigure him, before cutting of his head and sending it head back to Jordan. A second hashtag labelled #WeAllWantToSlaughterMoaz and carrying more brutal execution ideas and videos of children killed in coalition airstrikes, was retweeted over 11,000 times. It is not known whether any of those taking part in the campaign - including the organisers of the hashtag - have any sway with the ISIS leadership and whether any of the ideas influenced the eventual decision to murder Kasasbeh by burning him alive. But what the horrific suggestions do show is the outrageous levels of barbarism and hatred among ISIS' supporters, many of whom live in the West, far from the terror group's self-declared caliphate. It is also important to note that following the gruesome video's release ISIS supporters attempted to justify death by burning and bulldozer as a similar fate met by those killed in an airstrike - suggesting bombing victims are often burnt and crushed to death in their homes. Barbaric: An ISIS extremist lights a trail of petrol leading to the cage in which the 26-year-old stands . Depraved: The flames reach the cage holding the helpless pilot. It is later flattened by a bulldozer . The sickening Twitter campaigns appear to have been a reaction to the hashtag #WeAreAllMoaz where individuals praised the pilot and offered prayers and support for his family after his capture. That original hashtag was retweeted more than 200,000 times and was supported by Queen Rania and Crown Prince Hussein of Jordan. The early nature of the campaign suggests reports that ISIS executed Kasasbeh at the beginning of January may well be accurate. Experts add that the slick, professionally shot 22-minute video would have taken some time to edit. The footage of Kasasbeh's eventual murder was laced with highly symbolic imagery, not least the fact he appears to have been killed in a rubble-strewn courtyard damaged by coalition war planes. Shocking: A film clip featuring a woman who claimed to be the mother of a Syrian man killed in a coalition airstrike suggested Kasasbeh be killed by 'impalement, not with a mercy shooting or a mercy knife' Professional: Experts believe that the slick, professionally shot 22-minute video of Kasasbeh's murder would have taken some time to edit, suggesting he is likely to have been killed in early January . Jordanian officials have told the devastated family of the 26-year-old (pictured) that they believed the footage to be genuine and that the man branded a ‘hero’ in his homeland was dead . Even by the Islamic State's barbaric standards, the terror group's latest execution video reached a truly depraved new low. The footage shows the Jordanian pilot being burnt alive in scenes that are far too shocking to even consider publishing. As with previous beheading videos featuring British executioner Jihadi John, the 22-minute-long clip is characterised by its slick production values and graphics. But unlike the others, it contains an added cinematic dimension designed to achieve unparalleled impact on the viewer - as if the horror of watching someone torched to death wasn't enough. ISIS blames the F-16 fighter pilot for burning houses - and killing babies - with airstrikes before he was captured in December. Relatives of Moaz al-Kasasbeh held pictures of him at a rally calling for his release early yesterday . Grief: Anwar al-Tarawneh, the wife of Kasasbeh, appeared at a protest in Amman, Jordan yesterday morning calling for his release. Just hours later a sickening video emerged of her husband being burnt alive . The manner of his death is a symbolic show of strength to strike terror into 'non-believers' and encourage recruits or doubters within their ranks in equal measure. But it appears the ISIS PR machine was well-aware of the stir the execution footage would cause, even before the disturbing images were circulated online. Just ten minutes after the video was released, the jihadist group published a checklist of justifications, in a bid to encourage ISIS supporters to defend the barbaric actions. The post, uploaded onto pro-ISIS jihadi forum Al-Platform, offered guidance to ISIS sympathisers over what they should say if questioned about the merits of the brutal murder. In the post, entitled 'Moaz Was Burnt Alive, Below Is the Islamic Justification for Such an Act', it gives a list of apparent defences which it says might be in accordance with Islamic principles. The shocking video of Kasasbeh's murder comes just days after ISIS' British chief executioner, Jihadi John, killed Japanese journalist Kenji Goto in a shocking filmed beheading after days of intensive negotiations . Mr Goto joined a list of other victims of Jihadi John, including fellow Japanese national Haruna Yukawa (left). British aid workers David Haines (centre), and Alan Henning (right) have also been murdered . US journalist James Foley (left) was the first to appear alongside Jihadi John in one of the sickening videos, followed by Steven Sotloff (centre). American aid worker Peter Kassig (right) was also murdered by ISIS . The crowd sourcing of execution ideas, the digital release of the video and the way attempted justifications for the gruesome murder were posted online all reinforce the importance of social media to the ISIS propaganda machine. Although the group have been fighting in Iraq since at least 2004 and have had a presence in Syria for many years, ISIS' declaration of a caliphate last summer saw support for the terror group rocket, largely driven by the highly active social media use of its fighters. Jihadis who appear in the group's officially released propaganda videos become virtual online celebrities, holding question and answer sessions and giving advise on the website Ask.Fm, and using Twitter to share details of the daily life as a terrorist fighting in the Middle East. Many of the militants use English as a lingua franca, not least for its potential to reach, influence and possibly even  recruit would-be jihadis still living in the West. The use of a British national as ISIS' executioner in chief has had the same effect, leading to supporters regularly sharing images of the killer known as Jihadi John and sharing quotes taken from the sickening murder videos in which he has appeared. Jordan has executed two ISIS-linked prisoners, including a would-be female suicide bomber, it has been revealed this morning. The executions, at about 4am local time today, came just hours after Islamic State militants released a sickening video showing a captured Jordanian fighter pilot being burned alive in a cage. Jordan had vowed a swift and lethal response and government officials this morning revealed that two prisoners, Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouli, have already been hanged. Failed suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi (pictured inside a military court in 2006) and Ziad al-Karbouli, have already been executed after Jordan promised a swift response to the video of Moaz al-Kasasbeh's murder . Taken away: An ambulance believed to be transporting the bodies of Iraqis Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad al-Karbouli leaves Swaqa prison near Amman after the Al Qaeda militants were executed . Al-Rishawi had been on death row for her role in a triple hotel bombing in the Jordanian capital Amman in 2005 that killed dozens. The executions took place after gruesome footage emerged showing Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh being torched to death by his captors. This morning, government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani announced that two of those prisoners had been executed. Al-Rishawi was hanged at dawn alongside Ziad al-Karbouli, an Iraqi al Qaeda operative, who was convicted in 2008 for killing a Jordanian. The executions took place at Swaqa prison about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of the Jordanian capital of Amman. At sunrise, two ambulances carrying the bodies drove away from the prison with security escorts.","ISIS supporters launched sickening Twitter campaign after pilot's capture .

"INXS guitarist Tim Farriss may tragically never play guitar again after severing his finger in a horrific boat accident. On the Australia Day weekend the 57-year-old reportedly caught his left hand in an electronic anchor winch on a boat near his Fairlight home in Sydney's northern beaches, completely removing his ring finger, according to News Limited. Farriss is reported to have already undergone two operations, including an emergency six-hour microsurgery which successfully reattached his finger. Scroll down for video . INXS guitarist Tim Farriss, pictured in 2003, severed his finger in a serious boating accident . Farriss (pictured third from right) has always been a crucial part of the band INXS and is understandably passionate about music. There are fears he many never play again . INXS have experienced a surge in popularity following the 2014 telemovie 'Never Tear Us Apart'. Injured Farriss (far left) is pictured with (from left to right) Kirk Pengilly, John Farriss and Andrew Farriss last year . The Sydney-based rock star still does not have any movement in his ring finger. 'Thank you for your concern. I'm not at liberty to discuss it at the moment,' Farriss' son Jake told Daily Mail Australia. Although the surgery successfully reattached his finger, Farriss has a long recovery ahead of him after suffering serious damage. The extent to which he will be able to use his left hand will not be known for at least several months. Farriss will reportedly undergo intense physiotherapy for at least a year. 'Tim is now home from the hospital with his family and undergoing physiotherapy as part of the recovery process,' Murphy told the Daily Telegraph. 'He is getting the best possible care and we hope with time he will regain movement in his finger. This was a terrible accident, we are all here to support him.'

Farriss (pictured left with Sir Richard Branson in 2005) is the eldest of the three Farriss brothers in INXS . The eldest of the Farriss brothers, Tim is a talented guitarist and passionate about his music. The now 57-year-old was one of the driving forces of the band in their early days. He was their first manager, organising gigs and promoting the band. 'Initially it was only Tim who believed we could go somewhere. He was always the car salesman, the one pushing us, getting us gigs and talking about us,' INXS bass guitarist Garry Beers has said. The band has had renewed success following the release of the 2013 Telemovie series, 'Never Tear Us Apart' reliving the early days of the band up until the tragic death of lead singer Michael Hutchence in 1997. Following the telemovie their 2011 album 'The Very Best' rocketed up the charts, remarkably making them the highest selling Australian artists for 2014. As the spotlight returned to the band, so too did their fans. The horrific accident occurred near his Northern Beaches home in Fairlight where he lives with his wife Beth (pictured).

"For years, experts have warned that robots could soon take over our jobs - and for bank workers in Japan, this threat just became a reality. A humanoid called Nao will begin working at branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group from April, on a trial basis. But, if the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the Japanese bank by 2020. Scroll down for video . A humanoid called Nao (pictured) will being working at branches of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group from April, on a trial basis. It has two cameras mounted to its head, that act as eyes, as well as four directional microphones. The 1ft 11in (58cm) bot also has touch sensors, can speak 19 languages and reads emotions . Nao is designed by French firm Aldebaran Robotics. It has two cameras mounted to its head, that act as eyes, as well as four directional microphones to act as its ears. The 1ft 11in (58cm) bot also has touch sensors, can speak 19 languages and is able to read and respond to emotions, by analysing facial expressions. This analysis is made using embedded software called NAOqi. During a presentation in Tokyo this week, Nao welcomed customers to the bank, and asked which service they required. Aldebaran has produced more than 5,000 of its Nao humanoid, and it is primarily used for research and educational purposes. Artificial Intelligence has been described as a threat that could be 'more dangerous than nukes'. Now a group of scientists and entrepreneurs, including Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking, have signed an open letter promising to ensure AI research benefits humanity. Stark warning: Professor Stephen Hawking says we must be vigilant about artificial intelligence . The letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines, mankind could be heading for a dark future. The document, drafted by the Future of Life Institute, said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind. The authors say there is a 'broad consensus' that AI research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society. It highlights speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research. 'The potential benefits are huge, since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence; we cannot predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools AI may provide, but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable,' the authors write. But it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak. For instance, in the short term, it claims AI may put millions of people out of work. In the long term, it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming. During a presentation in Tokyo this week, Nao welcomed Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group customers and asked which service they required. If the trial is successful, the robotic employees will be rolled out to more branches of the bank across the country by the 2020 Olympics . Aldebaran has produced more than 5,000 of its Nao humanoid, and it is primarily used for research and educational purposes (pictured). The Alderbaran robots retail from 198,000 yen (£1,107) and can understand 80 per cent of conversations. They also have the ability to learn from conversations . Claims made by an expert in artificial intelligence predict that in less than five years, office jobs will disappear completely to the point where machines will replace humans. The idea that robots will one day be able to do all low-skilled jobs is not new, but Andrew Anderson from UK artificial intelligence company, Celaton, said the pace of advance is much faster than originally thought. AI, for example, can carry out labour intensive clerical tasks quickly and automatically, while the latest models are also capable of making decisions traditionally made by humans. ‘The fact that a machine can not only carry out these tasks, but constantly learn how to do it better and faster, means clerical workers are no longer needed in the vast quantities they once were,' Mr Anderson said. For example, a machine can recognise duplicate insurance claims by knowing it has seen a phone number or an address before. Nao is made by the same firm that builds Pepper. In December, Nescafe hired 1,000 Pepper robots to work across home appliance stores in Japan, where they help customers looking for a Nespresso coffee machine. Pepper robots are also used in Softbank stores as shop assistants, because Aldebaran is a subsidiary of the mobile carrier. Equipped with the latest voice and emotion recognition technology, Pepper is able to read people's facial expressions and listen to their tone of voice to analyse how they're feeling. 'Pepper will be able to explain Nescafé products and services and engage in conversation with consumers. 'I hope that this new consumer engagement model will expand across the world as an example of Japanese innovation,' said Kohzoh Takaoka, president and chief executive of Nestlé Japan.

Robotic companions are hugely popular in Japan, but they have failed to become commercial successes. Japanese electronics and entertainment company Sony discontinued the Aibo pet-dog robot in 2006, despite an outcry from its fans. At that time, Sony had developed a child-shaped entertainment robot similar to Pepper but much smaller, capable of dances and other charming moves. However, it never became a commercial product.

"A team of firefighters had to free a trapped toddler and her cat from a scratching post after the four-year-old followed her moggie inside. Amelie Kuester had been playing with her pet moggy Janko when he ran inside the 32-inch hollow post at their home in the city of Graz, in south-eastern Austria. But when little Amelie tried to crawl in after him she got her head wedged in the entrance and could not get out again. Firemen were called to a home in Austria where four-year-old Amelie Kuester had got her head and her cat trapped inside a cat scratching post . Firefighters called to the home had to lure the cat out before sawing the post in two. Mum Leah, 32, said: 'I was in the kitchen making Amelie lunch when I heard her start crying. 'Worried that she had fallen over or something I rushed in to the living room and found her lying on the floor with her head inside Janko's scratcher. 'I tried to get it off but her head was well and truly stuck and no amount of twisting or pulling was going to get it off.' 'Meanwhile, Janko was still inside and obviously thought this was part of the game and was playing with her hair.' Unable to free the youngster, desperate Leah decided to call the fire brigade. Three firefighters were pictured attempting to force the post from Amelie's head after she followed her cat inside and became trapped . Three firefighters lured the cat out and then sawed the post in two before freeing the girl's head using hand soap. A fire brigade spokesman said: 'When we arrived the little girl was very upset and clinging onto her favourite Elmo toy. 'The first thing we had to do was get the cat out, otherwise he might have been sawn in half. 'After luring him out with a piece of string, we then set about freeing the girl by sawing the tube in half and then using loads of hand soap to reduce the friction as we twisted it off her head. 'She was a bit red and dazed afterwards but otherwise fine.' Grateful mum Leah said: 'I felt very embarrassed because firemen have far more important things to do than cut up scratching posts, but they were very kind and helpful.'","Four-year-old Amelie Kuester followed her cat inside scratching post .

"When Ken Cherry says his marriage was a lie, he isn't exaggerating. That's because the St Louis man just learned that his wife Susan was committing bigamy the nine years they were together, since she never divorced her last husband. Cherry says he was supposed to be his wife's fifth husband, and he fears he might not be her last. Police have allegedly refused to charge Susan with bigamy and she is already listed as 'single' on  a free dating website, according to a report by KTVI. ‘What kind of dummy was I to get myself caught up in something like this?' Cherry said. Scroll down for video . A sham: Ken Cherry (right) married Susan Bozich (left) in 2006 and only realized last year that she was married to another man the whole time . Betrayed: Cherry says police have refused to charge his ex-wife with bigamy, since the statue of limitations on the crime is just one year . Cherry says he met Susan Bozich 11 years ago through mutual friends at a concert. They hit it off and two years later, in 2006, they tied the knot. But the marriage didn't last and last year the couple filed for divorcee. It was during their legal battle that Cherry hired private investigator Rick Burrows, who discovered Bozich's marital secret. ‘I started looking for the divorce file from husband number four. I couldn't find it. So I found him.’ Burrows said. 'I said: ""Did you two ever get divorced?"" He said: ""No""'. That revelation quickly brought the divorce proceedings to an end, with a judge ruling a 'consent judgement' declaring the Cherrys' marriage void. Getting back in the game: Apparently Susan is already listed on a free dating website as 'single' even its believed she is still married to her fourth husband . While Cherry says many people find the situation humorous, he finds it hard to laugh. When asked how he considers the years he spent in a false marriage, Cherry responds: 'Wasted'. 'There was some good, just not the marriage part,' he said. ‘You`d never be able to convince me it was an innocent mistake.’ And to add insult in injury, Cherry says local police have refused to arrest his ex-wife for bigamy based on the fact that there is a statue of limitations of only one year for bigamy and his marriage was nine years ago. However, such cases have been prosecuted in the area before, based on the time the bigamy was discovered. In this case, it was just a few months ago. Cherry also says that his ex-wife continues to live in their former home, even though he is the owner and his name is on the title.","Ken Cherry married Susan Bozich nine years ago .

"Opium, magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years, a study has revealed. An anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood-altering substances since the Stone Age. Professor Elisa Guerra-Doce has compiled evidence from around the world that Neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600BC and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000BC. Opium poppies, like those above, were among the earliest psychoactive plants to have been grown by humans . The professor, based at the University of Valladolid in Spain, said evidence of opium poppy farming has been found at La Marmotta, about 20 miles north west of Rome in Italy, a site occupied by Neolithic farmers around 6,000BC. There have been at least 17 finds of opium poppies from Neolithic settlements thoughout Switzerland, Germany and Spain. Alcoholic residues found in pottery and storage vessels suggest that ancient Eurasians drank fruity wines, beer made from barley and wheat and mead. They also consumed fermented drinks made from dairy products. The making of alcohol seems to originate in China in around 7,000BC. People living in the Zagros Mountains of north-western Iran were drinking wine made with pine resin in 5,000BC. Scientists have discovered a professional winery in south-eastern Armenia dating from 4,000BC. Experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby. Dr Guerra-Doce thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region. Traces of an opium poppy capsule were found on the teeth of a male skeleton buried at cave near Albuñol, Granada that dates back to around 4,000 BC. Writing in the journal Time and Mind, Professor Guerra-Doce said: 'Apart from its use as a food plant, there is also uncontested evidence for the exploitation of its narcotic properties.' Early humans also used hallucinogenic plants, according to Professor Guerra-Doce. The is evidence dating back to between 8600BC and 5600BC that ancient inhabitants of caves in Peru's Callejon de Huaylas Valley were using Echinopsis pachanoi - a cactus that contains the psychedelic substance mescaline. Archaeologsts have found traces of the cactus and pollen in the Guitarrero cave in the area. Researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in Duyong Cave on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines, which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant. It is still chewed through out much of Asia as a mild stimulant. Marijuana and the opium poppy have also been reported in Bronze Age ceremonial sites located in the Kara Kurum desert of Turkmenistan. Charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the Bronze age Pit-Grave culture that appeared in Romania around 2000BC. Professor Guerra-Doce also claims that tobacco was also used by many ancient human cultures with pipes for smoking being discovered in north west Argentina that date to 2100BC. Echinopsis pachanoi, or San Pedro cactus, pictured above, contains a number of hallucinogenic compounds . Ancient human stained red by chewing betel leaves (above) have been found in a cave in the Philippines . Traces of nicotine has been found in the hairs of mummies from several periods before the arrival of European settlers in South America. In North America there are smoking pipes that date back to 2000BC, although these could have been used for smoking other plants. Nicotine has been found in a pipe in North America that dates to 300BC . Magic mushrooms have also been commonly used though out history, according to Professor Guerra-Doce. Mushroom shaped carvings into rocky outcrops dating from the Neolithic and Bronze Age in north west Piedmont in the Italian Alps, have been interpreted as signs that psychotropic mushrooms were used in rituals. The use of hallucinogenic mushrooms has also been documented by small sculptures that resemble mushrooms which have been found at numerous sites dating back to between 500BC and 900AD in Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador. Magic mushrooms, like those above, have a long history of use in many parts of Europe and central America . There is evidence that tobacco plants (above) have been smoked by humans for thousands of years . Professor Guerra-Doce believes that rather than having recreational use as they do today, many of these sensory-altering substances were used in ceremonial rituals. Most of the traces found were in tombs and sites that are thought to have had ritual or religious significance. The details of the rituals are still unclear, but the hypothesis is that the substances were either used in the course of mortuary rites, to provide sustenance for the deceased in their journey into the afterlife, or as a kind of tribute to the underworld deities. She believes that the  right to use such substances may have been restricted due to the sacred role they played among prehistoric socieits. However, she added: 'The relationship between humans and psychoactive substances can be traced back over millennia.'","An anthropologist at the University of Valladolid in Spain has compiled evidence of psychoactive drug use in ancient cultures around the world .

"A Chinese council has built a giant outdoor escalator to take wealthy residents of a posh hill-top estate to their homes without having to take the stairs. The construction, built in the heart of the south-western Chinese city of Chongqing, has been criticised by engineers for being too exposed to the elements. The escalator was built following a series of complaints from the residents of the hill-top condominium development, but the council says they did not affect their decision. Stairway to heaven: The residents of a posh hill-top estate no longer have to walk up the hill to their homes . The council has been accused of bowing to the demands from inhabitants of the newly built estate  by putting a huge escalator directly to their doors. People living on the hilltop with a panorama view of Chongqing had complained they faced a long walk after coming out of the local underground station in order to get home. And although a stairway had already been put in, the council finally backed down and agreed to put in a huge escalator up the hillside. Engineers spent three months planning and extending the escalator from the underground station so that it carried on up the hillside, and it is now in operation despite criticism of the fact that the exposed escalator was at risk from the elements. No pressure: The council in Chongqing said the building of the escalators had nothing to do with the residents on the posh estate on top of the hill complaining about having to walk . Set to fail? Engineers have complained that the escalators are too exposed and at risk from the elements . There was already a staircase in place, but after residents complained, an escalator was also built . One engineer told local media: 'In autumn it is going to get covered in leaves, in winter it will be covered in snow and in the summer there will be rain flooding down. 'I would imagine the operators of this escalator will have an uphill struggle to keep it going. A government spokesman said: 'The decision to put escalator was nothing to do with influential people that live at the top of the hill, it was simply the fact that we want to provide a service to commuters. 'The escalators exist inside the underground station, so it was logical to also consider putting one that continued up the side of the hill.'","Chinese council builds outdoor escalator from underground exit .

"A six-year-old girl who was left at a Chinese bath house by her grandfather as a deposit after he claimed he forgot his wallet is still living there a month on as he failed to collect her. The girl, called Siyao, turned up at the facility in the city of Kunming in south western China's Yunnan province after her grandfather announced he wanted a good wash in a warm bath and a relaxing massage afterwards. But when he came to pay, staff say he suddenly announced that he had forgotten his money and would need to go home to collect it. Scroll down for video .

Siyao has now been living in the bath house for around a month, where she has made good friends with many of the staff there . Bath manager Mee Wang, 40, explained: 'He told the reception that would leave his granddaughter Siyao, behind as proof that he intended to return, and then left.' But by the end of the day staff found that the grandfather had still not returned, and they were left looking after the girl who has now been living there for more than a month. Siyao has now made good friends with the staff at the bath house, who have arranged a comfortable bed for her to sleep in overnight. Workers at the bath house bring in food and drinks for Siyao and she also uses the facilities there to keep herself clean .

"The Duchess of Cornwall was among those who attended the Service of Thanksgiving for the 11th Duke of Marlborough, John Spencer-Churchill, at the Guard's Chapel in London today. She joined a number of dignified guests including the late Duke's heir, Jamie Spencer-Churchill,   at the ceremony to commemorate the life of the man affectionately known as 'Sunny'. Jamie, the 12th Duke of Marlborough, arrived at the chapel with his second wife Edla and children Lord Caspar, six, and Lady Araminta, seven. He inherited the Oxfordshire family seat, Blenheim Palace, after his father died aged 88 on 16 October last year. Scroll down for video .

The Duchess of Cornwall looked elegant in a feathered black hat and tailored black coat as she left the chapel holding a service programme that was printed with a portrait of the late duke. Her son, Tom Parker-Bowles, was also in attendance, as was the Duke's widow, Lily Mahtani, and his grandson, George Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford. His third wife, Rosita Spencer-Churchill, remembered her former husband alongside their son, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill. Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, was on-hand to greet guests as they arrived. The Service of Thanksgiving comes nearly four months after the Duke's death, when a solemn funeral was held on the grounds of Blenheim Palace. His coffin was carried in a horse-drawn carriage through the parkland of his 11,500-acre estate, before reaching a private service. A flag bearing the family crest flew at half-mast over the palace, a Unesco World Heritage Site. The Queen's cousins, Prince Michael of Kent, left, and the Duke of Kent, right, attended the service together . The Duke's grandson, George Spencer-Churchill, left, and nephew, Alexander Spencer-Churchill . Remembered: The Duke's third wife, Rosita Spencer Churchill, left, and widow, Lily Mahtani both attended . Hundreds of people lined the streets of Woodstock to watch the funeral cortege pass by on its way to the church, where the new Duke of Marlborough gave a reading, as did his siblings Lady Alexandra, Lord Edward, and Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill. Sir Mark Weinberg also gave a tribute, and the Rector of the Benefice of Blenheim, Rev Canon Adrian Daffern, said the Duke was a 'man of authority, tempered by his humanity.' The 11th Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani. His four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38.

The Duke of Devonshire, left, and the Duke's son, Edward Spencer-Churchill, right, at the service today . The marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born. During this time the 11th Duke and his son the Marquess of Blandford were estranged for more than 20 years, but in 2008, in a move largely credited to behind the scenes work by the Duke's fourth wife, Lily Mahtani, they were finally reunited after a reconciliation. The 12th Duke and his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, who was said to have been a stabilising influence on him, moved into a farmhouse on the Blenheim estate and he was given a role developing the Blenheim farm shop. The 11th Duke, pictured in front of Blenheim Palace with his fourth wife, Lily Mahtani, died in October . Uniformed staff gathered to watch his coffin as it was pulled through the grounds of Blenheim Palace at his funeral last year . The Blenheim estate is one of Britain's most notable tourist attractions, and it was the Duke's life's work to preserve it for future generations. A gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, it was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession. Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke. The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year. Its grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it.","John George Vanderbilt Henry Spencer-Churchill died aged 88 in October .

"A bright green sea slug has been found to have stolen genes from the algae it eats so that it can produce energy from sunlight just like plants. The slug, called the eastern emerald elysia or Elysia chlorotica, has incorporated genes from algae into its own chromosomes enabling it to photosynthesis. This process essentially allows the slug to become solar powered, using the sun's energy to turn carbon dioxide and water in to the nutrients it needs to survive. Scroll down for a video Elysia chlorotica feeding . The eastern emerald elysia (above) has genes from algae within its own genome, making it solar powered . Researchers behind the discovery believe it may be possible to use this form of genetic hijacking between species to create new types of medical treatment for genetic diseases in humans. The first known instance of creatures growing their own 'disposable penises' was discovered by researchers studying the mating habits of sea slugs. Researchers in Japan were astonished when they realised that a group of sea slugs called Chromodoris reticulata lose their penises after sex but then grow another one a few hours later. The creatures, also known as nudibranchs, are hermaphrodites, meaning they had both male and female organs. But the revelation that their penises fell off and then re-grew was a surprise to scientists. The discovery was made after a team from Osaka City University and Tokyo's Nihon University collected the sea slugs from shallow coral reefs off the coast near Okinawa. They placed the slugs together in aquaria in pairs and observed them having sex. The researchers noticed that those who had recently mated were unable to do so again within 24 hours. Looking more closely, they saw that after having sex, the creatures detached themselves from their partner then crawled away with their penises dragging along behind them. About 20 minutes later, the used penis would fall off. Professor Sidney Pierce, a biologist at the University of South Florida and the University of Maryland, said: 'There is no way on earth that genes from an alga should work inside an animal cell, and yet here, they do. 'They allow the animal to rely on sunshine for its nutrition. So if something happens to their food source, they have a way of not starving to death until they find more algae to eat. 'Figuring out the mechanism of this naturally occurring gene transfer could be extremely instructive for future medical applications.' If it is possible to understand how the slug manages to use these plant genes may allow new types of genes from other species to be used to treat human diseases. Elysia chlorotica is found in shallow pools and salt marshes along the east coast of the United States, particularly in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Florida  and Texas . Juveniles are usually a reddish-brown colour before they begin feeding on algae. It has been known since the 1970s that the Elysia chlorotica is able to incorporate chloroplasts from algae into its own cells, turning them bright green. Chloroplasts are tiny capsules of biological machinery, or organelles, inside green leaves that use sunlight to power chemical reactions that plants need to survive. The slug sucks the sap out of the algae Vaucheria litorea and embeds into the cells of its digestive system. The slug is then able to use these chloroplasts to produce carbohydrates and lipids for itself for up to nine months. The slug incorporates chloroplasts, shown above in plant cells, into the cells of its own digestive system . The slug gets its bright green colour from the algae it feeds on (above) as it steals chloroplasts from the plants . Yet how it is able to maintain these chloroplasts for such a long time without the support provided by a plant cell was not known. Professor Pierce and his colleagues analysed the DNA of the slug and found that it had managed to incorporate a gene from the algae into its own chromosomes. It uses this gene to repair damage to the chloroplasts and to keep it functioning. Professor Pierce said: 'The gene is incorporated into the slug chromosome and transmitted to the next generation of slugs.' 'When a successful transfer of genes between species occurs, evolution can basically happen from one generation to the next.'","Biologists found Elysia chlorotica has hijacked a gene from green algae .

"Cleared: Dr Danuson Dharmasena has been cleared of carrying out female genital mutilation . A doctor who became the first person in the UK to stand trial over female genital mutilation was sensationally cleared yesterday. A jury took fewer than 25 minutes to acquit Dhanuson Dharmasena of carrying out the potentially lethal procedure on a new mother. He was cleared along with a co-defendant, 41-year-old Hasan Mohamed, whose lawyer said the verdict showed the failed case had been a Crown Prosecution Service ‘show trial’. Family and friends who had supported them throughout the two-week trial cried ‘yes’ as the verdicts were read out. Dr Dharmasena had been accused of illegally stitching a 24-year-old woman back up after she gave birth, redoing the mutilation she suffered as a six-year-old in Somalia. The prosecution had been hailed as a landmark in the campaign to stamp out the illegal practice. But Dr Dharmasena said he had simply put in a stitch to stop the woman bleeding after a traumatic emergency labour at Whittington Hospital in north London in 2012. He said in a statement yesterday: ‘I am extremely relieved with the court’s verdict and I am grateful to the jury for their careful consideration of the facts. ‘I have always maintained that FGM is an abhorrent practice that has no medical justification . ‘I would like to thank my family, friends, legal team and all those who supported me through this difficult time and I look forward to putting this matter behind me.’ Dr Dhanuson Dharmasena, pictured standing in a court sketch, was found not guilty by a jury after a trial at Southwark Crown Court in which he claimed to have been used as a 'scapegoat' by hospital bosses . Mr Mohamed's lawyer, Ali Hussain, said: ‘My client has suffered months of stress and the humiliation and lost precious time with his two young children. ‘My client strongly believes this case was nothing more than a show trial – an effort by the CPS to regain some confidence after failing to bring a prosecution despite FGM laws being in place since 1985.’ Last night, the CPS faced questions over why it had decided to bring a case against the highly regarded doctor and Mr Mohamed, who he had not even met before the incident on November 24, 2012. The alleged victim, who was herself taken to a police station where she was fingerprinted and had DNA samples taken, never supported the case. And even prosecutor Kate Bex pointed out that the case was a far cry from the stereotype of the ‘back street clinic’. The alleged victim fled civil war in Somalia in the 1990s, settling in Britain where she got a job at a London hotel and married. As a result of the FGM she was unable to have sex with her new husband and in 2011, she underwent defibulation – reversal of the procedure. This medical history was not considered when she went into labour at the Whittington, aged 27. Miss Johnson told Southwark Crown Court in south London: ‘We do suggest that Dr Dharmasena has been hung out to dry and made a scapegoat for the Whittington Hospital and their failings. Yet he is the one paying the price for the hospital’s ineptitude.’ Mr Mohamed, who was acting as the woman’s interpreter, had instructed him to do it, the prosecution said. But he was cleared of inciting FGM. Dr Dharmasena insisted he was not a ‘puppet’ who would give into patient’s demands. The victim, who had to give evidence about intimate medical procedures, was also against FGM. She told the court she did not want it as she wanted to continue having sex with her husband and they wanted more children. 'Scapegoat': Bosses at Whittington Hospital, pictured, were accused of exploiting Dr Dharmasena in order to cover up systemic failings . She went on to have another child, suffering no problems following the procedure by Dr Dharmasena, who is from Sri Lanka. Last night, Baroness Kennedy, a barrister and anti-FGM campaigner, questioned the CPS. ‘I was concerned about this prosecution because all the evidence pointed to a young doctor who was not adequately prepared for the circumstances which faced him,’ she said. ‘I have not felt adequate training is available to professionals – doctors, nurses, police, teachers and social workers.’ Katrina Erskine, consultant gynaecologist and head of obstetrics at Homerton Hospital, in east London, questioned the decision to charge at the time, describing it as a ‘political prosecution’. She said last night: ‘Such good news about the verdict – now we can get back to trying to stop FGM happening and support all the doctors and midwives who have been terrified by this case.’ Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, defended the CPS’s decision to take the case to trial saying it did not ‘shy away from difficult cases’. ‘It was right that we put this case before the court and on three separate occasions, once before trial and twice during the trial, the judge dismissed applications by the defence to stop the case, thereby agreeing that the evidence should be considered by a jury,’ she said. ‘The CPS does not choose which cases it is asked to consider for prosecution and we must apply the same test to every case. This will, of course, not affect our resolve to bring those who do commit FGM to justice where we have the evidence to do so.’ The practice of female genital mutilation dates back at least 2,000 years and was used in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction amongst the aristocracy. The FGM National Group, a UK-based charity, said primitive societies believed the procedure would ensure women’s virginity and lead to a reduction in female desire. In some cultures, it is valued as a rite of passage from childhood to womanhood but others believe it is a means of preserving a girl’s virginity until marriage. In most of these countries FGM is a pre-requisite for marriage, with marriage being vital to a woman’s social and economic survival. FGM is rooted in culture and some believe it is carried out for religious reasons. Although not confined to a particular culture or religion, it is most common in Africa. Female genital mutilation is illegal in the UK under laws introduced in 1985. This legislation was strengthened and updated in 2003 by a private member’s bill introduced by the Labour MP Ann Clwyd. Under this law, which came into force in March 2004, it is a crime to carry out, aid or abet any form of FGM. The penalties were also increased significantly and allowed the courts to impose prison sentences of between five and 14 years on those who carry out the procedure or on parents who allow their children to be mutilated. But the failed prosecution in the Dharmasena case that finished yesterday raises questions about future proceedings. Seven other cases are under investigation and three are with the CPS for consideration. There are also 11 cases in which the CPS decided there should be no further action and one case in which the police decided not to press ahead.","Dhanuson Dharmasena was accused of carrying out FGM on new mother .

"Police are hunting a man suspected of abducting and killing an elderly Ohio couple and believed to have committed armed robberies in three states over the weekend. The FBI said a $20,000 reward was being offered for information about 29-year-old Robert Clark, who is wanted on a charge of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Agents also are looking for Jeffrey Caley Jr., 28, and Tabatha Hazel, 26, who are suspected of participating in the robberies. Dangerous: Tuscarawas County Sheriff's Office have released this photograph of Robert Clark, who is suspected to have abducted and killed Doyle Chumney, 88, and his wife Lillian, 79, in northeast Ohio . Clark has been charged with one count of murder in last month's killings of 88-year-old Doyle Chumney and his 79-year-old wife, Lillian, of Strasburg, a village 20 miles south of Canton. The couple's remains were found inside their torched car on January 22, a day after they were reported missing. A second suspect in the slayings, 21-year-old Jeffery Stewart, was arrested on Saturday. He is also charged with one count of murder and is being held on $2 million bond. Authorities have said Stewart implicated himself and Clark in the killings. Clark, Caley and Hazel are suspected of being involved in the armed robberies of gas stations and convenience stores in West Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia on Saturday and Sunday. No one was hurt in the robberies. A Coshocton County sheriff's detective said Tuesday that authorities believe the three might be headed to Jacksonville, Florida. ""Someone who knows Tabatha said she had plans to go to Jacksonville,"" Detective Tom Couts said. On the run:  Coshocton County Sheriffs Department released this picture of suspect Tabatha Hazel.

Surveillance video shows Clark holding a sawn-off shotgun and Caley holding a pistol as a clerk walked in front of them, the detective said. Hazel is believed to have gone inside the store before Clark and Caley entered. Caley and Hazel were not involved in the Chumney slayings, Couts said, adding that it appeared Clark and Stewart knew each other through a landscaping service where they had worked, . Clark was released from prison in May after serving a 4 1/2 -year sentence for robbery and other charges. Mugshot: Robbery suspect Jeffrey P.

"NBC news anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Nightly News anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire. During a report on Friday, Williams went further and said that the aircraft he was on had actually been hit - a claim that quickly prompted denials from soldiers who were present. On Wednesday, Williams apologized during his NBC Nightly News bulletin and said that he was 'mistaken'. Later that evening he didn't seem too worried about the furor as he enjoyed a New York Rangers game with his good friend Tom Hanks. Scroll down for videos . NBC news anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' The NBC anchor had most recently repeated his old war story on Friday when he presented a segment on NBC Nightly News about a public tribute at a  hockey game in New York for Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, a retired soldier who had provided ground security for the grounded helicopters. 'The story actually started with a terrible moment a dozen years back during the invasion of Iraq when the helicopter we were traveling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG,' Williams said on Tuesday evening. 'Our traveling NBC News team was rescued, surrounded and kept alive by an armor mechanized platoon from the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry.' Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Williams appeared nonplussed about the scandal on Wednesday evening as he enjoyed a New York Rangers game with his good friend Tom Hanks . Williams pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack: In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the ‘fog of memory over 12 years’ for his error . The day after Williams' report, one crew member responded to the story on NBC NIghtly News' Facebook and said that he remembered things rather differently . Another man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response' Since the 2003 incident, Williams’ Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown. NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC’s Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.' However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News  it stated that a ‘chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.’ Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade. 'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.' In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a ‘flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters’. ‘Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours. 'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,’ he recalled. By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.' 'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote. 'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.' The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his. ‘Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,’ he told Letterman. Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now ‘the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.’ NBC Nightly News posted Williams' report on their Facebook page and the next day Lance Reynolds, who says he was present for the incident  responded to the story and wrote that he remembered things rather differently. 'Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft. I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened,' wrote Reynolds. Another man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response'. During the Nightly News broadcast on Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him. 'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize' he said. In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the ‘fog of memory over 12 years’ for his error. ‘I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,’ he wrote. ‘Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area -- and the fog of memory over 12 years -- made me conflate the two, and I apologize.’ Williams went on to strenuously deny that he was ‘trying to steal anyone's valor.’ ‘I was and remain a civilian journalist covering the stories of those who volunteered for duty. This was simply an attempt to thank Tim, our military and Veterans everywhere -- those who have served while I did not.’ One of the top trending topics on Twitter on Wednesday night was #BrianWilliamsMisremembers. ‘#BrianWilliamsMisremembers and then I said look Woodward you and Bernstein are in way over your head,time to follow a real man..lets do this,’ tweeted one person. ‘And I just knew we could make a better portable music player. Called it the iPod."" #BrianWilliamsMisremembers,’ wrote another. Since the 2003 incident, Williams’ Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown. NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC’s Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.' However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News  it stated that a ‘chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.’ Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade. 'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.' In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a ‘flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters’. ‘Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours. Williams apologized on the air during Wednesday's program and called his mistake a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier . Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire say the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that were flying in formation when they took fire in Iraq in 2003 . Actor Tom Hanks and Brian Williams pictured together at the Boston Bruins  game at Madison Square Garden . The two shared plenty of laughs and thrills at the game only hours after Williams apologized for his 'mistake' 'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,’ he recalled. By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.' 'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote. 'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.' The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his. ‘Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,’ he told Letterman. Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now ‘the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.’ Williams has anchored NBC Nightly News - the nation’s highest rated news program - since December 2004 when he replaced Tom Brokaw. His reporting from inside the New Orleans Superdome in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina the next year helped earn NBC a Peabody Award. DailyMail.com has reached out to NBC News for comment. Williams on not aboard a helicopter that was hit during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and in fact he arrived about an hour later after the aircraft had made an emergency landing .

"Thousands of cats rescued from the dinner table in Vietnam have been crushed to death beneath the wheels of a dumper truck in a grisly mass execution that has horrified animal lovers. The cargo of around three tons of cats crammed into bamboo cages stacked one on top of another were seized in the capital Hanoi last Tuesday on their way to be sold to restaurants. The terrified animals, many of them stolen pets, were smuggled from China to the Vietnamese capital where cat meat is called 'little tiger' and eaten as a delicacy. Some died in their cages in transit. Now, in a shocking twist, Mail Online has learnt that all of the cats dead and alive have been crushed while still in their bamboo cages soon after their rescue because of fears they might spread disease. Scroll down for video . Cruelty: Thousands of cats were crammed into bamboo cages as they were smuggled from China to  Vietnam . 'Delicacy': Three tonnes of cats, many stolen pets, would have been sold to restaurants in Hanoi . The cats initially appeared to have had a lucky escape when a police officer in Hanoi's Dong Da district stopped the truck which had come to the capital from a town near the Chinese border in north-east Vietnam. Pictures of the cats crammed into the pitifully small cages triggered a wave of offers from regional and international animal welfare groups to treat and find homes for the surviving cats. Brigitte Bardot offered financial help for the cats via the US embassy but it now appears that all the surviving cats were killed inside their cages shortly after the interception of the truck. Le Duc Chinh, who investigated the seizure of cats for animal welfare group the Asia Canine Protection Alliance (ACPA), said environmental officials told him all the cats had to be destroyed and buried in case they spread disease. A waste treatment company was hired and used a dumper truck to crush the cats in their bamboo cages before burying them in a the Kieu Ky waste treatment area near the centre of Hanoi, watched by police, Mr Chinh said. 'The cats were buried and covered with lime because of concerns that they might spread disease in the capital,' he said. 'Many of the cats had died during the long trip from China. 'I was appalled and asked them why they did this to the surviving cats, but the officials insisted they were following the law which says they should destroy animals immediately if they do not have health check certificates.' He denied claims that some of the cats were buried alive, adding: 'I checked with waste company Binh Minh who buried the cats. They said they killed all the cats and then they buried them.' Seizure: The truckload of cats (pictured) was seized by local police in Hanoi on January 27 . Horror: Police in Hanoi found thousands of cats, dead and alive, crammed into tiny bamboo boxes . Tragedy: After all the cats were killed, Le Duc Chinh from the Asia Canine Protection Alliance said: 'I was appalled and asked them [the authorities] why they did this to the surviving cats' John Dalley, of Thailand-based Soi Dog Foundation which led attempts by the coalition to save the lives of the cats, said: 'This is a particularly distressing case, not least because a number of organisations including ourselves offered to help. 'We had vets on standby from Thursday throughout the weekend ready to fly from Thailand. The Vietnamese authorities quite simply refused to give any information, or respond to calls. 'The fact that police intercepted the cats which were bound for restaurants and slaughter houses is commendable, but what followed is not acceptable in any civilised country.' Mr Dalley added: 'We can only hope that they did not die in vain, and the authorities will take steps to implement existing laws to end the inhumane trade in dogs, cats and wildlife that are not recognised as livestock in Vietnam. 'Appalling': The cats were crushed to death and buried by the Binh Minh waste company to stop them 'spreading disease' Illegal: Local activist hopes Vietnam will follow Thailand's lead and ban the killing of animals which are not livestock . 'The vast majority of these animals are stolen pets or illegally imported from other countries as with these cats. The dangers of spreading diseases such as rabies and cholera cannot be overstressed, even if one accepts the cruelty involved in the trade. 'The government of Thailand has recently introduced laws banning the killing of animals for food that are not considered livestock and we hope other nations in Asia will follow their example.' Cat meat is an illegal dish in Vietnam but restaurants serving it have boomed in popularity in Hanoi recently in part because of a crackdown on the dog meat trade. They are particularly popular at festival times and last week's seizure came ahead of the Tet, or New Year, festival in Vietnam later this month - the country's biggest annual national holiday. The lorry driver arrested over the illicit delivery of cats told police the cats originally came from China and were loaded on his vehicle in Vietnam's north eastern Quang Ninh province after being traded.","Cats were being smuggled from China to the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi .

"A mother-of-six who was once hooked on boob jobs admits she 'lost perspective' and has ended up with a 'comical' cleavage. Now Gemma, 32, from Halifax, wants to have a reduction because she worries her double-F breasts are setting a bad example to her daughters. 'I absolutely hate them. They just look like two bald men's heads down my top. It's like something from a Carry On film, they look comical,' she told Channel 4 show Bodyshockers.

Her husband, Lewis agrees. he said: 'Going out and about with Gemma she gets a lot of attention from men. They don't look at her face, they look at her boobs and that really annoys me.' Gemma admitted she is most concerned about the message she is sending to her daughters Sky, 10, and Pearl, five, with her cosmetically enhanced cleavage. She said: 'I have two impressionable daughters who look up to their mum. It worries me that I may have normalised massive breast implants to my daughters.

"Wondered about wives: Utah Rep. Brian Greene took issue with a bill that would make all sex without consent a criminal act . Utah state lawmakers considering a sexual consent law found themselves debating whether sex with an unconscious spouse constitutes rape. A measure to require clear consent won early House Judiciary Committee approval Tuesday, after advocates said Utah's current law doesn't adequately protect victims. However, Republican Rep. Brian Greene of Pleasant Grove said he feared the law would let prosecutors charge a man with sexual assault for having sex with his wife while she's unconscious. Greene said sex with an unconscious person on a first date shouldn't be allowed, but it's different for long-term relationships. 'If an individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious...a prosecutor could then charge that spouse with rape, theoretically,' Greene said in committee Tuesday, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. 'That makes sense in a first date scenario, but to me, not where people have a history of years of sexual activity.' Other lawmakers said the statute should be clear. Democratic Rep. Brian King of Salt Lake City says an unconscious person can't consent, and sex in that situation is rape. Sex with an unconscious person 'is rape. Period. End of story,' said King, a Democrat from Salt Lake City. 'Let's make the statute clear. Let's not dance around it.' Advocates for Utah's HB74 say the state's criminal code for sexual assault needs to be altered to clearly state that sex with an unconscious person is rape. The current law begins: 'The victim has not consented and the actor knows the victim is unconscious, unaware that the act is occurring, or physically unable to resist.' The bill was introduced by Salt Lake City Democrat Rep. Angela Romero. Taking sides: Advocates for Utah's HB74, like bill sponsor Angela Romero, say the criminal code needs clarification. But Greene wondered in Tuesday's committee session if the change might open a door to prosecution if 'a individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious, or the other way around if that is possible...' It's the 'and' in the language that appears to concern Romero. She wants to remove 'the victim has not consented,' according to KSTU. 'At the end of the day, when we took out that language, if somebody is unconscious you probably shouldn't attempt to try to have sexual relations with them,' Romero said. However, it's also the word of the law that concerns Greene, a public servant elected in 2012 with the help of a pro-business, pro smaller government platform. 'It looks to me now like sex with an unconscious person is by definition rape,' Greene said. 'I hope this wouldn't happen, but this opens the door to it — a individual has sex with their wife while she is unconscious, or the other way around if that is possible...' Greene scoffs at the notion of what 'the other way around' entails, and some gentleman at a dais beside him appear to chuckle, before he continues. 'But a prosecutor could then charge that spouse with rape,' he said. In the end, the committee voted unanimously, with Greene's consent, in favor of moving the bill along. Seen here with his wife Renee, Greene--a vocal proponent of small government elected to the state government in 2012--called rape 'abhorrent' but questioned the wisdom of a law that defines it so unequivocally .","Representative Brian Greene, a Republican from Pleasant Grove, questioned a measure to clarify the state's criminal code regarding rape .

"The ex-fiance of a young woman caught on camera having sex with a colleague in their office by a group of pub goers has spoken out saying no one wants to see their 'ex on telly doing that'. The secretary and her married boss were filmed having sex at their Marsh Ltd workplace in Christchurch after they left the lights on in their office building on Friday night. Gobsmacked pub patrons cheered them on from across the street and uploaded footage of their public sex show to social media. The young woman's ex-fiance, who only identified himself as Josh, told The Edge radio station she was not cheating because they broke off their engagement six months before she was filmed with her boss, the New Zealand Herald reports. 'You don't want to see your ex on telly doing that (but) it's nothing to do with me,' he said. 'She never made any mistake (when she was with me). Unfortunately she made this one and it's gone worldwide.' Scroll down for video . The young couple get to know each other in the Marsh Ltd offices in Christchurch . Josh said he knew the man his ex-fiance was filmed with but had never met him. He said he hadn't spoken with her this week but admitted he hoped she was okay. 'She is a really nice person ... she's lovely. We had a really amazing relationship,' he said. 'I think for everyone involved it's quite sad.' The two employees may be able to keep their jobs at the insurance company if they are brave enough to return to work again after footage of their sex romp went viral. But if they do return, they are likely to be working in different buildings. The company is taking 'their time' over the disciplinary process, a source told the paper. On Wednesday it was revealed the wife of the manager caught with his trousers down shockingly found out about the man's extramarital affair on Facebook. The married man, understood to have children, has still not shown his face at insurance firm Marsh Ltd in Christchurch as bosses conduct an employment investigation. The young secretary is also keeping a low profile having already deleted her Facebook account. A source told the New Zealand Herald that the man's wife is 'in pieces and can't even speak to him'. The couple had gone into the office after it had closed thinking they'd get some privacy when they were actually being watched by patrons across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery . Before long the pair start to undress in the office unaware that they were being watched . The mood at the Christchurch branch is said to be 'rather tense'. 'The other employees are all keeping their heads down and are just trying to get on with things. It's a pretty surreal situation for them,' an insurance industry insider said. The sexual antics of the man and the young woman were caught on camera last Friday night and footage quickly went viral across the world. The incident provoked a huge reaction with one witness saying that because it went on for 'a good half hour', patrons in the bar 'started to get bored and drift off back to the dance floor'. 'The entire bar united in cheering them on,' said one person on social network Reddit. 'It started with a casual flirt. Then the kiss, grabbing the attention of all. Get it, son! Finally they moved to the back of them room, thinking they were unseen. Off comes the tights, down goes his head. By this stage, 50 bar patrons were pressed up against the window yelling their approval. The couple even enjoyed a glass of wine as they enjoyed their own private party . Customers across the road at the Carlton Bar and Eatery got a front-row seat for the show . 'To be honest, after watching them f*** for a good half hour, people started to get bored and drift off back to the dancefloor.' However, it got so steamy at one stage that the band even stopped playing in the bar. But when calm was restored the cheeky musicians started up again with Kings of Leon song, Sex on Fire. 'The band had to delay playing because the customers felt the need to support this view. Props to them for their next song being Sex on Fire,' one Reddit user said. Rabobank's branding was also in many pictures on social media, only because it had naming rights to the building. Not that they escaped ridicule either. 'Congrats to the man who made a deposit at Rabobank this evening,' one Twitter follower posted. One Reddit user said: 'I guess it's not a bank for money.' While another also quipped on Reddit: 'When he withdrew he lost interest!' Twitter user Nick can't help making a quip about the couple and their antics . It got so steamy that the band even stop playing in the Carlton Bar and Eatery as the action continued . The Privacy Commissioner John Edwards told Radio New Zealand that there was little the sexy pair could do legally following some local backlash against those who filmed the incident in the bar. Several commentators in New Zealand claimed that the couple's privacy had been breached, but Mr Edwards said it was unlikely the police could take action if a complaint was made. 'The people who were watching, we may criticise them for a lapse of decency in taking advantage of that, but it is unlikely there'd be any legal liability for their action,' he said. Privacy lawyer Kathryn Dalziel also told Radio New Zealand even though the couple did not give their consent for the images to be taken, they would have to show their privacy had been breached to make a successful case under the Crimes Act. Marsh Ltd said they still had not made any decision on whether the couple would get the sack or face any disciplinary action. 'We are not giving any further comment other than what has already been provided. We're dealing with the matter internally that's all we can say,' a spokeswoman for Marsh Ltd told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's unknown what will happen to those involved at this stage, and what final decision will be made by the firm.'

"A Venezuelan man has taken body modification to the extreme in a bid to make himself look like comic book super villain Red Skull. Henry Damon, 37, had already had several subdermal implants on his forehead before having part of his nose removed in order to achieve the right Marvel madman look. Despite the drastic surgery, Mr Damon, from Caracas, Venezuela, is getting ready to take it even further to fulfill his dream. Scroll down for video . Real-life villain: Henry Damon, 37, from Caracas, Venezuela, has had his nose removed as part of his facial transformation into a real-life version of Marvel villain Red Skull . Before: Mr Damon poses with a friend before he started his process to become Red Skull . Mr Damon's goal is to look like Marvel character Red Skull, portrayed on screen by Hugo Weaving in 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger . The married father, who now calls himself Red Skull, also tattooed his eyeballs black before adding red and back face tattoos to look like the comic book villain. Red Skull first appeared in 1947 as the Nazi agent arch-enemy of Marvel hero Captain America and most recently appeared in the 2011 film Captain America: The First Avenger, played by Hugo Weaving. After meeting up with med-school dropout Emilio Gonzalez, who specialises in tattooing and extreme body surgery, Mr Damon 'knew that this was his opportunity,' a friend said. 'He has loved comic books since he was a kid and always dreamed of being Red Skull, but never got round to doing it,' friend Pablo Hernandez said. Before the surgery, Mr Damon underwent several physical and psychological tests, according to his 'surgeon' Mr Gonzalez. Step one: The married father began his process by putting subdermal implants on his forehead . Getting there: Mr Damon took this selfie shortly before undergoing surgery to remove a part of his nose . Documented: The Marvel fan ensured photographs were taken during and after the surgery . 'Henry aka Red Skull is a physically and intellectually healthy person,' Mr Gonzalez said. 'He's an excellent son, husband and father, who has an extreme taste for body modification. 'Most of my customers know that body modification is the last step of body art, everyone knows very well what they want and as well as Henry, many of them are waiting for me for many years to make their dreams a reality.' Mr Gonzalez added that Mr Damon is not done with his transformation, and is about to take it even further. Mr Gonzalez said: 'Next will be silicone implants on the cheekbones, chin and cheeks. 'Then we will tattoo his entire face red and then he will be Red Skull.' In recovery: After he had his nose removed, Mr Damon had further subdermal implants done . Final steps: After his nose healed and his forehead bulked up, Mr Damon started adding red and black tattoos to his face to get the right Red Skull look .

Heiress: In the suit, Bo, who separated from 32-year-old Paige (pictured) last March after just six years of marriage, reportedly says he misses living in a multi-million dollar home and going on luxury holidays . He would spend this money on 'necessities', including  a rental home (between $40,000 and $60,000 a month), a personal chef ($6,700 a month) and a personal trainer ($2,500 a month), according to TMZ. Meanwhile, $30,000 a month would go on vacations, a staggering $80,000 every month would be spent on entertainment and a further $4,000 would be used to pay for a driver, Bo apparently claims. Incredibly, he also wants Paige to pay him $2,500 so he can make charitable donations, it is said. In the suit, Bo reportedly points out that he had become accustomed to living in a $11million mansion with Paige, the daughter of Nancy Walton Laurie, whose father, Bud Walton, co-founded Walmart. But since their separation, he has been splitting his time between an apartment in Santa Monica, California, (where he spends six months of the year) and his parents' home in Jefferson City, Missouri, he says. He also claims that he had become used to $500,000 yacht parties, flying in a private jet and working for Paige's business, it is reported. He says  the cash will help him get back into the job market. Bo, who was previously accused of stealing thousands of dollars from the business he and Paige operated - a Malibu retail center - in another lawsuit, apparently cites his ex-wife's enormous wealth in the most recent suit. He claims Paige earns $872,000 a month from stocks and dividends, so she can easily afford to pay him the $400,000 a month he has requested it is said. And she should do so 'under 'California spousal support guidelines', Bo claims. Bo and Paige, who were high school sweethearts, married at a top-secret ceremony in Columbia, Missouri, in June 2008. Before the wedding, the couple signed a prenup to protect her fortune. However, the prenup also provided Bo with the right to spousal support if they ever divorced. Major retailer: He claims his ex-wife should fork over between $210,000 and $240,000 every month after taxes to help him adjust to his new single life, it is said. Above, Paige is the heiress of the Walmart fortune . Relatives: In the suit, Bo reportedly points out that he had become used to living in a $11million mansion with Paige, the daughter of Nancy Walton Laurie (left), whose father, Bud Walton (right), co-founded Walmart . Currently, Bo receives a $30,000 check every month, according to reports. This support will continue for three years - half the amount of time he and Paige were married, the celebrity news site reported. Paige's mother Nancy, who owns a $200million super-yacht, and her sister Ann Walton Kroenke between them own a stake in the retail behemoth worth more than $6billion. Nancy and Paige caused controversy in 2004 when they made a $25 million naming rights gift towards the building of a new $75million basketball arena at the University of Missouri in Columbia. On January 1, Paige (far left) celebrated New Year's in Sydney aboard her mother's $200 million super-yacht . Mother and daughter: Paige (right) and Nancy (left) both dressed in summery dresses for the occasion . The peroxide blonde matriarch and her husband, Bill Lawrie, decided to name the facility Paige Sports Arena after their daughter. Neither parents nor daughter had ever attended the university. Instead, Paige graduated that year from the University of Southern California. A former roommate told ABC’s 20/20 that she had been paid $20,000 over four years to do Paige's homework for her. Once the allegations emerged, Paige’s parents agreed to let the school rename the arena which is now known as Mizzou Arena. In 2005, Paige voluntarily gave up her USC communication degree.","Patrick Dubbert has filed lawsuit against Walmart heiress, Paige Laurie .

"A trial opened in Philadelphia Tuesday for a woman accused of beating to death her 10-year-old special-needs stepdaughter, whom the prosecution say the stepmother hated and wanted dead. Charlenni Ferreira was rushed to the hospital in October 2009, just days before her 11th birthday, after she was found unresponsive in her parents' home on C Street. She died a short time later. Doctors uncovered that the girl's lungs had collapsed due to an untreated infection caused by multiple broken ribs. Shocking abuse: Margaret Garabito (left), 48, is facing murder and child abuse charges in the 2009 death of her stepdaughter, Charlenni Ferreira (right), who succumbed to an infection caused by broken ribs . Charlenni's other injuries suggesting long-term physical and sexual abuse included a seven-inch head wound hidden from view by a weave, a broken hipbone, marks and bruises all over her body, and vaginal and anal scaring. The child's father, Domingo Ferreira, and her stepmother, Margaret Garabito, were charged with murder, endangering the welfare of a child and additional counts. In his opening statement, prosecutor Andrew Notaristefano told the jury at Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Tuesday that Garabito, 48, has admitted to hitting her stepdaughter on the head with a broom, which resulted in a skull fracture and brain damage, reported Philly.com. Too late: The child's father, Domingo Ferreira, 53, was also charged but he committed suicide in jail . 'She hated this child and she wanted this child dead and out of her life,' said Notaristefano. Garabito's defense attorney, J. Michael Farrell, argued that his client was only guilty of manslaughter for failing to stop her husband from beating and molesting his daughter. Ferreira is expected to testify that her spouse told her he would kill her and her three teenage children if she went to the police. 'My client was a victim too,' the attorney told the jury panel Tuesday. Domingo Ferreira, 53, committed suicide in jail three days after his arrest. Also on Tuesday, the jurors were shown graphic photographs of Charlenni’s gaping 7-by-4-inch head wound, which the prosecution said her stepmother concealed for a year by stuffing it with cotton and pinning a hairpiece over it. Assistant Medical Examiner Marlon Osborne testified in court that countless bobby pins and clips holding the weave in place were embedded in the child's badly scarred, almost entirely bald scalp. Sitting next to her attorney, Garabito appeared shaken to see the graphic autopsy images and was seen wiping away tears. The prosecutor said Charlenni, a native of Puerto Rico who came to live with her father and his new family in Philadelphia in 2005, sustained about three years of continuous abuse, beginning in the fall of 2006 and ending the day she died October 21, 2009. When Domingo Ferreira went to Puerto Rico for a month in the fall of 2009, the prosecutor said his wife subjected her stepdaughter to repeated beatings, striking her with a metal broom handle and sticks. Charlenni was found unresponsive in her parents' home on C Street in Philadelphia in October 2009 . Describing the 10-year-old child as 'broken from head to toe,' Notaristefano told the jury that every time her stepmother broke another one of her ribs, Charlenni suffered from internal bleeding, which eventually resulted in fluid buildup that sparked an infection. During a preliminary hearing in January 2010, it was revealed that Garabito admitted to police that that last time she struck the 10-year-old was six days before her death because the little girl wanted to use a calculator to do her homework.","Charlenni Ferreira died from untreated infection caused by five broken ribs in October 2009 .

"Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson has been arrested for punching a pizza delivery guy in the face and the back of the head during an argument over a parking space, police have said. The 31-year-old football player was arrested on a misdemeanor assault charge after the dispute around 8pm in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday. The pizza delivery worker told Jackson he was going to use the space on 12th Street NW momentarily, but Jackson allegedly became angry, according to ABC7. He told the man to 'get the [expletive] out of' his parking space before punching the driver in his face and on the back of his head, according to the police report. Arrest: Indianapolis Colts linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, pictured during an NFL football news conference last month, was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly punching a delivery guy in the face and back of the head . By his side: Jackson, pictured with his girlfriend Christina, allegedly punched the man after becoming angry that he wanted to momentarily take his space. He was taken into custody and released Tuesday night . Jackson was released on Tuesday night but will have to return to court at a future date. On Wednesday the Colts released a statement. 'The Indianapolis Colts have been made aware that D'Qwell Jackson was charged yesterday in Washington, DC with a count of simple assault,' it said. 'When the Club learns more of the surrounding facts, it will make an appropriate statement.' In just the last month, two other Colts have been arrested. Backup linebacker Josh McNary was charged with rape and has been placed on the commissioner's exempt list pending the outcome of his case. Linebacker Andrew Jackson was also arrested for DUI last month and pleaded guilty later that day. D'Qwell Jackson played for the University of Maryland before being selected by the Cleveland Browns in the second round of the 2006 NFL draft. At work: Jackson, 31, is pictured after an interception against the New England Patriots last months. One of his interceptions led to the investigation into whether the other team had deflated their balls . Scene: He allegedly punched the man on this Washington D.C. street. He lives in the city in the off-season . He played for the team through the 2013 season and was signed by the Colts - in a four-year, $22 million contract - as a free agent in March 2014. Most recently, he intercepted a Tom Brady pass in the AFC Championship Game, which led to the NFL's probe into whether the Patriots' balls had been under-inflated, in what became known as 'deflategate'. Newsday reported that the investigation was sparked when Jackson gave the ball to a member of the Colts' equipment staff, who noticed it was not fully inflated.","D'Qwell Jackson, 31, 'got angry when the man told him he needed the space momentarily and punched him in the face and the back of the head'

"A mother-of-three was beaten by ex-boyfriend with a rubber mallet, tied to a bed with security cables and told his friends would be coming round 'to have fun with her' because she spoke to other men. Violent Darren Stenhouse lashed out at Claire Harrison, 31, during a visit to her home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to collect his belongings after their split.

Miss Harrison said she blacked out as Stenhouse attacked her with the rubber mallet. When she came round he tied her up with security cables . Speaking publicly for the first time since Stenhouse, then 38, of no fixed address, was jailed for in August 2013, she said: 'I remember shielding my face and seeing Darren was holding a rubber mallet. 'He hit me once, then another eight times including five times to the head. 'I dropped to the blood-splattered floor and blacked out. 'When I came round, Darren was holding plastic padlocks and chains. 'He said he'd bought them earlier that day to use on me. 'He tied my arms and legs with metal security cables. Miss Harrison said she had tried to shield her face as Stenhouse attacked her . Miss Harrison tried to tell Stenhouse she loved him to 'get him on side' and make him stop . Stenhouse had told Miss Harrison (pictured during their relationship) that she had betrayed him by speaking to other men . 'He told me his friends were coming round, ""to have fun with me"". I was petrified. 'There were tears running down my face. I begged him to stop.' She told how she knew she had to 'get him on side'. 'I told him I loved him and we could make the relationship work,' she revealed. 'But he just shouted at me. 'He said, ""If I stop this, I'll be arrested"". 'He then said, ""This is going to end with you in a box"". 'He said he had duct tape and knives to cut me up until I was unrecognisable. 'He said he planned to hurt me in front of my kids, to torment them.' The mother-of-three's children Iisha, now 13, Kenzie, now seven and Morgan, now five, were at nursery and school when the attack took place .

He was jailed for eight-and-a-half years at Reading Crown Court after admitting grievous bodily harm and false imprisonment . Mrs Selleck's children, Iisha, now 13, Kenzie, now seven and Morgan, now five, were at nursery and school. She continued: 'When I asked why he was doing this, he said I'd betrayed him by speaking to other men. 'I remember lying on the kitchen floor, aching. 'I wanted to close my eyes and give up but I couldn't stop thinking about my poor kids. Miss Harrison was able to escape by barricading herself in her daughter's bedroom , and calling 999 . 'So I forced myself to stay awake, and planned my escape.' Stenhouse had not realised that she had her mobile phone in her pocket, and Mrs Selleck realised could help her escape. 'I decided I would lock myself in the bathroom and call the police,' she said. 'I asked Darren if I could use the toilet so he untied me and guided me there. Then I remembered there was no reception so I asked to lie down. 'Darren steered me toward Iisha's room, but I knew there was a table in mine that I could use to barricade the door. 'So I said I didn't want to get blood on her sheets. Darren took me to my room, then asked where my phone was. 'I couldn't believe he hadn't searched me. I lied and said it was in Iisha's room. 'As he disappeared, I realised he must think I was too hurt to run away. 'But I found the strength to get up to block the door and then I called the police.' She said she yelled, ""Come now or I am going to die,"" down the phone. 'Darren tried to break in,' she said. 'But as the police arrived he ran away. 'They searched the area for him.' She was taken to Stoke Mandeville Hospital and Stenhouse was found nearby and arrested. 'Blood was pouring from my head,' she said. 'The next day I was allowed home. The children were terrified of my swollen face, but eventually they let me hug them.' Afterwards she found support in her old work colleague Mr Selleck. 'Damien was handsome and kind,' she said. 'He acted nothing like Darren. 'In July he proposed.' She described how Stenhouse had been violent before the hammer attack – but she had always taken him back.

Mr Selleck with his wife's three children. She says her new love has made her realise that men should never be violent towards their partners . 'When we met in a nightclub in Aylesbury in 2009 he was loving and gentle,' she said. 'We spent every minute together and he got on with my children. 'But a few weeks later, while down the pub, he told me to get out. 'But he came outside to say sorry, and I thought he'd just had too many drinks. 'But a few months later I realised Darren snapped whenever he drank. I asked if he had a problem but he said no. 'He apologised for hurting me and I believed him. 'But he carried on calling me names and I always walked around on egg shells with him. He hit me when my kids went to bed too. 'I should have left, but Darren never hurt them and I loved him, despite him making me feel worthless. He said no-one else would ever love me. 'In March 2011, Darren smashed a cricket ball against the side of my head.' On this occasion Stenhouse appeared at Aylesbury Magistrates' Court where he admitted a count of common assault and was jailed for 22 weeks. The moment Mr Selleck asked Miss Harrison to marry him last July . After he was released she took him back. 'I hoped it would be a new start but then he began being verbally abusive,' she said. 'Being called a fat ugly whore didn't leave a mark like a bruise, but it hurt just as much. 'I left in January 2013.' Now she wants other women to leave violent partners. 'People need to pack their bags and leave,' she said. 'Damien made me realise that you should never let your partner be violent. 'I realise Darren manipulated me. 'He made me feel like I didn't have a future without him. 'I've told Iisha not to stand for any man's abuse. 'I don't want her ever to suffer like I did. 'I feel lucky to be alive. 'Had Darren found my phone, I wouldn't have been able to escape and he could have eventually killed me. 'I urge victims of domestic abuse to tell someone. 'Don't live in silence and fear like me.

"Heather Mack, 19, appeared emotional as she cradled her growing baby bump ahead of the start of her trial . A heavily-pregnant American teenage has told how she misses her mother, as  the suitcase the socialite's body was found stuffed inside was pictured for the first time. Heather Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack and then stuffing her body inside the piece of luggage. The strain showed on the 19-year-old's face as she followed the opening of her trial on the resort island of Bali through an Indonesian interpreter. The grey-coloured suitcase and some blood-stained sheets were presented as evidence on the opening day of the case. Ahead of the hearing Mack revealed that she misses her socialite mother  'everyday' and loved her 'with all my heart.' Mack said she was petrified ahead of her trial, but that her fears were ‘more for my daughter than me,’ according to the Chicago Tribune. If the young lovers are found guilty they will face a firing squad. 'I loved my mom with all my heart and miss her every day,’ the newspaper reported Mack as saying. She reportedly added that ‘If I allow myself to grieve whatsoever I’m in a complete state of depression. ‘The smile (seen in photos of her arriving at court) is actually a disguise I wear to survive here.’ But she said she was receiving help from ‘good Samaritans who helped to get her food and vitamins and her baby, Stella, named after Schaefer’s great-grandmother, was healthy. Referring to the baby, she told the paper: ‘She’s healthy and it is completely safe here and (a) completely fair country.’ Mack revealed that she believes her lawyer would prove her innocence and asked ‘that the public reserve judgment on my case until the judges passes his verdict.’ Earlier this week three judges rejected a last-ditch attempt by the Chicago couple's defence teams to have the case thrown out. The court was shown the suitcase that Sheila von Wiese-Mack's body was found stuffed inside, along with a set of blood stained sheets . Heather Mack, second right, listens intently to an Indonesian translator as the case against her begins at Denpasar District Court, Bali . They had  claimed that there were 'inaccuracies' on the indictment and it should be annulled at the hearing in Denpasar. Witnesses are now due to start giving evidence in the case against Mack. Schaefer will be tried separately with the same judges and prosecuting teams at the Denpasar District Court. Dressed in matching  white shirts and orange prison waistcoats, Mack and Schaefer were handcuffed to each other as they arrived at the District Court. Miss Mack's bulging baby bump was clearly visible. The pair were sent to the island's notorious Kerobokan Prison in December ahead of their trials. They were arrested in August following the gruesome discovery of the badly beaten body of Mack's 62-year-old mother stuffed inside a suitcase that had been loaded into a taxi outside the luxury St Regis Hotel in Nusa Dua. Heavily pregnant Heather Mack, pictured with Tommy Schaefer, arriving at court ahead of her trial. Heather Mack, left, and co-accused Tommy Schaefer, right, boarding the  prison van to take them to court . Tommy Schaefer being led from Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar, Bali, in handcuffs for the first day of his girlfriends murder trial . They were charged with premeditated murder, which carries the death penalty. Prosecutors have alleged that the couple sent text messages about their initial plan to disguise a murder as suicide on the beach. In their indictment, prosecutors alleged that the couple plotted the murder because von Wiese-Mack did not approve of their relationship and that Mack had once suggested that Schaefer hire someone to kill her mother for $50,000. They further alleged that an argument over the hotel bill made Mack's mother angry and she scolded Schaefer, using a racial slur, and Schaefer then battered her with a fruit bowl handle. Mack, who is seven months' pregnant, helped stuff her mother's body in the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it, according to the indictment. They then hired a taxi and placed the suitcase in the trunk and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it was alleged. The pair are accused of killing Sheila von Wiese-Mack, pictured, and stuffing her body in a suitcase . US judge, Neil Cohen, sitting in the Cook County Court, said Miss Mack should be allowed to have a total of $150,000 from a trust fund set up by her murdered mother to pay for her defence. But Miss Mack told the Chicago Tribune that despite the judge’s order, her defence attorney, Mr Aly Soendardi, had received only a first payment of $50,000. The judge had, in fact, ordered that only $50,000 should be made as a down-payment until Miss Mack’s lawyer provided billing statements explaining the work being done. However, Miss Mack has accused three US attorneys for the hold-up in the remainder of the money and said she was now planning to have them fired from the American side of her fight against the premeditated murder charge which carries a maximum sentence of death. Behind bars: Mack and Schaefer, pictured earlier this week, face a maximum penalty of death by firing squad if found guilty.","Heather Mack, 19, speaks for first time about love for her dead mother .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called for better online information for patients . The Health Secretary has pledged to reduce pressure on doctors and nurses by getting people to diagnose themselves at home using their computers. Jeremy Hunt blamed the surge in patients going to A&E departments on the rise of a ‘here and now society’ created by 24/7 supermarkets and online banking, which means people want ailments treated immediately. He revealed plans for people to get an instant diagnosis for illnesses from a computer without the help of a doctor. But the online system could actually lead to increased pressure on hospitals if it replicates the round-the-clock 111 helpline, which has been blamed for wrongly sending people to seek urgent help. The current telephone helpline is manned by staff with six weeks' training who read off a series of questions from a computer screen that generates medical advice based on their answers. Flaws in the system mean the advice tends to be cautious and staff are often told to send patients to A&E or summon an ambulance for trivial complaints. Mr Hunt tonight said that expected people to be diagnosed online using algorithms without contacting a doctor or nurse within a couple of years. He told LBC that the long-term solution to problems at A&E was ‘to make it easier for people to get medical advice fast because that’s what they expect in our 24/7 society’. ‘I actually think improving 111 is a very big part of that and I have to say there’s one thing that I think is really missing from 111 now that I’d like to see happen is an online version of it so you could actually go on to a website and not have to go through those questions with someone in a call centre but actually answer them online,’ he said. ‘For example, I remember when one of my children had a rash, I think you would have been better able to get a very good diagnosis very quickly if you had a computer screen that said, “which of these rashes does your child’s rash most look like?” and that’s something that is very difficult to do if you are talking to someone on the phone. ‘We have got plans to do it, we definitely want in the next couple of years to have an online version of 11’ ‘In the end if we are going to crack this A&E issue, we have to find ways of helping people get medical advice that are easier than simply turning up at your local A&E.’ Mr Hunt said the system would be mostly run without the need for a doctor or nurse on the other end. He said: ‘If you look at the way online banking has worked, we are now able to bank 24/7. ‘The majority of the British population now do online banking and we can do that at 2 o’clock in the morning because we don’t actually interact with any human beings, we’re just using the computer programmes the banks have set up on their websites. ‘The more pressure we can take off the human beings who are manning the 111 service, whether it is the call centre handlers or the doctors or nurses, the more information we can provide to people electronically, the less pressure there will be on the health service. ‘I think what will happen, the algorithms would get you to a certain point where if it hadn’t solved the problem they’d say you need to speak to a doctor or nurse or whatever so it would be a combined approach.’ NHS hospitals are struggling to cope with a surge in people going to A&E, but the Government has insisted there is no 'crisis' Mr Hunt denied that there was a ‘crisis’ in the health service. He said: ‘I don’t use the word crisis because I think crisis is a situation where you don’t have a solution and we have very good plans in place.’ He said one of the reasons for extra pressure had been because the health service had not been good at predicting change in ‘consumer expectations’. He said: ‘Younger people now, all of us, are part of a here and now society where when we have a problem with our healthcare, we want it sorted out in hours, we don’t want to wait even a day to get it sorted out. ‘We can shop 24/7, we can bank 24/7, and the NHS has to change to respond to that. ‘Essentially at the moment A&E is the quickest way to be seen by a doctor and we need to give people alternatives online to get that advice more quickly.’ Last year, Mr Hunt admitted taking his children to A&E because he did not want to wait for a GP appointment. Speaking in the Commons, he said: ‘I took my own children to an A&E department at the weekend precisely because I did not want to wait until later on to take them to see a GP.’ The NHS 111 helpline has been dogged by problems since it was launched in spring 2013. Whistleblowers have claimed the computer system that generates advice is so flawed it frequently prompts staff to summon ambulances for drunks or broken finger nails. Some patients are thought to have waited as long as eight hours to speak to a nurse. The NHS website already includes an online symptom checker, although the new version is expected to be more advanced and more similar to the system used by the 111 helpline call handlers. A Labour spokesman said: ‘This is yet more evidence that ministers have no plan to deal with the Tory A&E crisis. We always warned David Cameron that scrapping the reliable NHS Direct service - replacing nurses with call handlers - would pile pressure on England's A&Es. ‘Even now, ministers are complacent and putting patient safety at risk. They should adopt Labour's plan to help A&Es, including more nurses handling 111 calls to give patients reassuring advice. ‎Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: 'The internet can be a great source of information but while progress has been made helping older people get online not there are still almost 5 million aged 65 and over have never used the internet. 'If older people are feeling really unwell they need to be able to seek and receive help from a a professional.'","Health Secretary wants to improve online information for families .

"Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, (pictured) referred the case on the basis that the suspended sentence was unduly lenient . Appeal court judges have allowed a rapist who attacked a lesbian after a Halloween party to walk free because they do not want to interfere with his suspended sentence . The 28 year old from Portsmouth preyed on his victim after watching 'A Clockwork Orange' - even though he knew she had no interest in men. The woman was left deeply traumatised by the attack, but Appeal Court judges have today refused to jail the attacker, describing his case as 'exceptional'. The Attorney General, Jeremy Wright QC, had referred the case  on the basis that the suspended two year prison sentence imposed at Portsmouth Crown Court in October was unduly lenient. But today, while a panel of three judges headed by Lord Justice Pitchford agreed with that view, they said they did not consider it to be in the public interest that it should be changed. They heard that the man, who has Tourette's syndrome, obsessive compulsive disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, had reported the rape to police himself - and if he had not, it would never have come to light. The man committed the offence after a Halloween party when a friend who he knew had no sexual interest in men, invited him to share her bed- which they had done before - purely to sleep. The court heard neither of them anticipated or intended sexual activity but during the night the man began touching her. The 'obsessive part' of his personality took over and, despite her struggles, he had sex with the woman. When he came to his senses and stopped he apologised profusely, 'punched himself in remorse' and left, while the woman, who made it clear their friendship was ruined, decided she did not want to report the matter to the police. Two years later, distressed and still feeling guilty, he went to the police, saying he wanted to confess to a sexual assault and that he thought he needed help. The man was handed a suspended two year prison sentence at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) in October . The man pleaded guilty to the rape at Portsmouth Crown Court and was handed a suspended two-year jail term in October last year. Lawyers representing the attorney general told the Appeal Court the sentence was far too soft. Lord Justice Pitchford agreed a suspended sentence was 'unduly lenient' - but said it would be wrong to lock him up now. He said the man suffered from a litany of mental health problems and both he and his victim were 'vulnerable'. The judge, sitting with Mrs Justice Swift and Judge Paul Batty QC, ruled it was 'not in the public interest' to put him behind bars. What he had done 'caused him distress and an enduring sense of guilt', said the judge. Jocelyn Ledward, for the Attorney General, argued that the man should have been jailed. But Lord Justice Pitchford described it as 'an exceptionally sensitive and difficult' case. He said for all his remorse, there was no doubt that he had done 'a grave wrong' with serious consequences for his victim. Lord Justice Pitchford (pictured) agreed a suspended sentence was 'unduly lenient' - but said it would be wrong to lock up the man now . Lord Pitchford said that the man had made a fully committed start to his suspended sentence order and had proved himself highly and genuinely motivated to make progress. He said a rupture of current arrangements could only make more certain serious deterioration in his condition, and put at risk a successful outcome. He said: 'What sets this case apart is the distress the offender himself suffers from unwelcome thoughts, his feelings of guilt and fear of catastrophe, and his almost inevitable mental deterioration if required to serve a sentence of imprisonment.' 'There is no statutory standard of exceptionality that must be reached before a court suspends a sentence of imprisonment. 'It is a matter for the court's judgment, usually determined by weighing up the seriousness of the offence, the offender's antecedents and his personal circumstances. 'However, for an offence as serious as rape, a suspended sentence order is, as the recorder acknowledged, almost unheard of.' He concluded that the man was now responding well to professional help with his mental health problems. That was the best means of reducing his risk to the public and jailing him, the judge concluded, would not be in the public interest.","Judges have let a 28 year old man walk free despite his rape conviction .

"An internal employee memo from McDonald's was leaked Monday, which says not to plug the fact that the fast food giant's extra value meal choices include a side salad. The memo was obtained from an East Hanover, New Jersey restaurant and published by CNBC. It says 'Do not suggest side salad as an option, customer should request it when they order.' CNBC noted that the other extra value meal side choice is getting medium fries. Internal memo: The memo says McDonald's employees should not plug the fact that the fast food giant's extra value meal choices include a side salad . Lisa McComb, a representative for McDonald's, said to CNBC 'The chart is simply a quick reference guide that is part of a broader restaurant training tool to assist crew in efficiently taking customers' orders.' She continued 'Customers are made aware of the choice of side via the menu boards so the intent of the signage is to remind crew it's not necessary to recite it as an option so they can focus on accurately and efficiently ringing up the order.' McDonald's did not immediately respond to a Daily Mail Online request for comment. CNBC noted that clementines are now a side option for children's meals. The website reported that 'Outgoing CEO Don Thompson told investors in mid-2013 that salads have ranged from about 2 to 3 percent of sales since the chain introduced them.' Further south, McDonald's subsidiary in Mexico is apologizing for a Facebook post that was seen as trashing tamales, Mexico's corn-dough treat. A statement posted Tuesday on the McDonald's Mexico website said: 'It was never the intention of McDonald's Mexico to disrespect traditions or traditional Mexican foods like tamales.' The original tamale post came on Monday's Candelaria day holiday, when tamales are traditionally eaten. Tamales are usually wrapped in corn husks or banana leaves. The post said roughly, 'tamales are a thing of the past. The McBurrito also comes wrapped.' McDonald's wrote 'we apologize to those who might have been offended by the publication, which has been withdrawn from our social media.' Note: After this story was originally published, McComb later told Daily Mail Online in an email exchange 'The reporting and headline on this have been very misleading and inaccurate. There was no internal memo. The initial reporting was based on one restaurant training component. Viewed alone, the chart was not in full context. The chart was simply a quick reference guide that is part of a broader restaurant training tool to assist crew in efficiently taking customers’ orders. 'Customers are made aware of the choice of their side options via the menu boards so the intent of the signage is to remind crew it’s not necessary to recite any option, rather allow the customer to select their own choice, so the crew can focus on accurately and efficiently ringing up the order. 'No particular side (e.g. fries nor side salad) would be suggested specifically; rather, the customer would be made aware of choices via menu board and would make the choice from that.'

"A  lucky Labrador was saved from a frozen Michigan lake after falling through the ice just meters away from a Coast Guard crew having their morning meeting. The team briefing at Frankfort Coast Guard station was interrupted on Tuesday when one of the crew spotted the dog plunge through the ice into the freezing waters of Betsie Lake in Michigan. Donning their cold water suits, the Coast Guard rushed to the lake where Tim Putnam, boatswain mate third class, swam 200 feet through loose ice into the channel where Betsie Lake met Lake Michigan to save the animal. Scroll down for video . The Coast Guard crew were at a briefing in Frankfort Coast Guard station on Tuesday when one of the team spotted the dog plunge through the ice . 'I had to push a lot of the ice out of the way, it was pretty exhausting,' Putnam told NBC News. As he got closer, he said he could see it shivering but the dog began to try and swim towards its rescuers. 'It was almost like he knew it was his last chance. Luckily we got him out in time, it didn't look like he had too much left in him.' Putnam was able to reach the Lab and with the help of his crew, managed to haul her out of the water and bring her into the warm in under half an hour.

'Our crews stand ready to answer the call for help, even if it means crawling through 200 feet of slurpee-like ice,' the Coast Guard wrote in a Facebook post. 'Station Frankfort's ice rescue team saved this dog from the water because a life is a life and they wanted to make sure that they were the ones taking the risk of going in instead of an unprepared bystander.' The dog, nicknamed Betsie by her rescuers, was sent to recover at the Animal Welfare League of Benzie County, in Beulah, Michigan where she was found to be in good health despite the frozen ordeal.

"A new BBC documentary has revealed the daily front line battle between  pro-choice and anti-abortion campaigners in Northern Ireland. Separate laws to the rest of the UK mean that abortion there is illegal unless a woman’s life is in danger, even when the baby has no chance of survival. In the Republic of Ireland, the law is similar, but there is the added rule that an unborn foetus has the same rights as the pregnant woman. A new TV show reveals the battle women face to have an abortion in Northern Ireland and the Republic Of Ireland, including Tara, pictured, from Cork, who had to spend £1,000 to travel to London to undergo a termination . The law means 5,000 women from Ireland travel to England every year to undergo a termination. Despite the law already working in their favour, pro-life campaigners like Youth Defence frequently organises rallies through busy town and city centres, brandishing placards that are plastered in pictures of unborn foetuses. Not content with the rules already in place, these groups are trying to change the minds of pregnant women who may be considering travelling the hundreds of miles to a place like London, where a termination will be legal. But there is a growing movement of opposition in the country – of young men and women who want to change the laws on abortion. The BBC documentary, called Abortion: Ireland's Guilty Secret? follows four women as they show how the current law in the country has affected them. In the show, the presenter meets 16-year-old Gemma from Belfast, who is an active member of the pro-life group Youth Defence. Gemma, 16, from Belfast is a pro-lifer who campaigns against abortions every week in the city centre . Every weekend, Gemma and her friend Aiden erect a stall in Belfast city centre that host a range of pictures and lie-size models of unborn foetuses. Gemma’s fervour comes from her belief that she is representing the voice-less – the babies that can’t speak up for themselves. For her, there are no exceptions, including if a woman has been raped. She tells the cameras: ‘No, because one child is never any more important than another. 'I think that not killing a human life is far more important than for a woman to choose if she wants to have a baby or not.' In the rest of the UK, abortions up to 27 weeks were legalised for women in 1967 because of growing concerns about the highly dangerous backstreet terminations that were taking place. In England, Scotland and Wales, women can get a termination on the NHS if they decide that they are unable to cope with a child. But in Ireland, women can face up to 10 years in prison for undergoing a termination. This law means thousands of women every year are forced to pay for flights to England and to pay for their termination. Pro-Life Campaigners gather in Merrion Square, Dublin, as Ireland prepares to legislate and introduce regulations to allow abortion if there is a real and substantial risk to a woman's life, including the threat of suicide.  In January 2013 . The TV show visits the home of a young woman in Cork, who has fallen pregnant with her live-in boyfriend’s baby, despite being on the contraceptive pill. Tara has invited the cameras to follow her on her journey to Ealing in west London to undergo her termination because she wants to show how difficult the laws in Ireland make it for young women like her. She says: ‘Someone needs to tell their story - there are women having to go over on a daily basis to England for an abortion, yet nobody is talking about it, all the same. ‘The stigma that's attached to it, the fact that you have to actually leave the country for it. 'I'm just not ready to have a child, we're not ready. 'I think that I can offer so much more to a child ten years down the line than now, that's what I want for me and that's what I want for my future kids. ‘I'm sure there are people out there who will think that I am the devil for doing this but I know it's the only option that seems right to me right now.' Tara and her boyfriend then spend £1,000 on flights, accommodation and medical aid on a 24-hour trip to London to undergo the termination. Despite putting on a brave face, Tara is visibly shaken when she leaves the centre where the abortion took place. A pro-life campaigner protesting outside the Appeal Court in Belfast, where the Family Planning Association claimed tight abortion restrictions in Northern Ireland were exposing pregnant women to an increased risk of death . Tara says: ‘I feel really but I also feel guilty for feeling relieved at the same time. It's surreal. 'I’d love to be at home just cuddling my dog now, in my own bed. It has been a long day and it has been tough. 'I feel really angry that they're ignoring women (at home in Ireland) at the moment and ignoring the fact that they should have this choice. 'This could have been so simple, it could have happened two weeks ago when I found out. 'They shouldn't have control over my uterus - I deserve that choice and it was taken away from me by my government. 'You deserve to be treated as a human and not as a criminal.’ Despite the very strict laws in the country, some women are fighting back. The programme meets a pro-choice campaigner who is actively promoting abortion in Northern Ireland. Suzanne, 25, from Belfast recently graduated from university and is training to become an adult education teacher. She had an abortion two years ago by purchasing pills over the internet that started a miscarriage. She is now putting up stickers in her local neighbourhood directing other women to the site, so that they can also go through with a termination if they can’t afford the costs involved in travelling to the UK. She said: ' I have a British passport but it is completely different to a British passport of someone in London, because I cannot have an abortion in an NHS hospital. ‘I have to travel. ‘The only way that things will progress here is to show that the law is completely unworkable.'

"A police officer is facing a disciplinary hearing after he allegedly used a police helicopter's thermal camera to record people having sex at dogging sites. Police Constable Adrian Pogmore, 48, is suspected of watching people at dogging sites and recording a couple having sex in a country lane while on patrol in the South Yorkshire Police helicopter. The father-of-two, based in Sheffield, has now been suspended and is facing an internal police hearing later this month after his wife reported him following the breakup of their marriage, it was reported. Police Constable Adrian Pogmore has been suspended pending a police inquiry after it was alleged he used a police helicopter's thermal camera to watch people having sex at dogging sites. File image used . A source told The Sun: 'He's accused of looking at dogging sites while the chopper was meant to be on patrol. It is also claimed he took footage of a couple having sex down a country lane.' South Yorkshire Police confirmed a police officer had been suspended following an allegation of 'unauthorised use of force visual recording equipment'. The misuse of the thermal camera is alleged to have occurred in 2008 while the helicopter was deployed for legitimate policing purposes. However, PC Pogmore was only suspended on December 5 last year after he split from his wife Lesley, the paper reported. A police spokesman said: 'The officer was interviewed around an alleged breach of standards of professional behaviour in relation to discreditable conduct. A search was carried out at the officer's address, with his consent, and no disc has been recovered. 'A second South Yorkshire officer inside the helicopter at the time of the alleged incident was also subject to a Professional Standards investigation. 'This pilot is employed by the National Police Air Service (NPAS) and his involvement has been investigated and no misconduct was identified. This report will be referred to NPAS for their consideration.' The thermal camera attached to the South Yorkshire Police helicopter records video which is then replayed on television screens inside the aircraft . When contacted by MailOnline, PC Pogmore declined to comment. The thermal camera used on the South Yorkshire Police helicopter is a Wescam MX15, which police boast as being 'equally effective day or night'. It contains two daylight cameras, as well as the thermal imaging camera that records video which is then displayed on television screens inside the aircraft. The South Yorkshire Police website states: 'The camera system, while the most expensive part of the aircraft, is among the best in world. It is used to search open areas, both rural and urban, not only to trace offenders but to locate missing persons resulting in numerous lives being saved.'

"NBA superstar Kevin Durant called a former ESPN writer who criticized his club for extending a teammate's contract a 'dumbass' on Twitter. The Oklahoma City Thunder signed forward Nick Collison to a two-year extension yesterday and basketball writer Chris Palmer ripped into the team after Durant, 26, offered up his congratulations. Durant, the reigning NBA MVP, dismissed Palmer's comment as if he was swatting away an opponent's shot on the court. Scroll down for video . Kevin Durant (left) stuck up for teammate Nick Collison (right) on Twitter after former NBA reporter Chris Palmer criticized the Oklahoma City Thunder for giving him a contract extension . Durant, the reigning NBA MVP, called basketball writer Chris Palmer (right) a 'dumbass' yesterday . Collison, 34, is averaging 3.8 points, 3.4 rebounds and 1.2 assists in 41 games for Oklahoma City this season. His new deal is for two years and $7.5million, ESPN reported. He said: 'We've been talking about it for a while. 'It's something I'm really happy about. 'I felt like this is where I wanted to be. This is my team.' Below is the exchange between Palmer and Durant about Collison's contract: . Durant and Collison's team, the OKC Thunder, currently have a .500 record at 24-24 and are trailing the Phoenix Suns (28-22) for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference . Palmer's last piece for ESPN was in June 2013 according to the network's website. He parted ways with ESPN after having 'an amazing experience'  at the company for 15 years, Inside Hoops reported. He said: 'I'm grateful for the opportunity they gave me out of college and thankful to have learned so much from so many talented people over the years. 'I've got so many great memories at ESPN and some terrific friends there but I'm really excited to start a new chapter.' Palmer has done some work for SlamOnline since leaving ESPN, but also got some mentions on social media after sending out this tweet unintentionally. (He claimed his account was hacked.) Palmer got his fair share of social media mentions after this tweet was sent out from his account in November . This is not the first time that Palmer and Durant have beefed on social media. In July of 2013, Durant implied Palmer took the drug molly, a form of ecstasy, after the hoops writer listed the former No. 2 overall pick as the 15th smartest NBA player. It likely didn't help that Palmer listed Metta World Peace, aka Ron Artest, ahead of Durant. Durant is averaging 25.1 points, 6.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists this season while shooting better than 50 per cent from the field. The Thunder currently have a .500 record at 24-24.

"This the final photograph of poisoned spy Alexander Litvinenko, taken as he was dying in hospital shortly before he lost consciousness for the last time. The public inquiry into his death heard today that Mr Litvinenko agreed to have pictures taken during his final days, so that the world could see how 'he was poisoned by the Kremlin'. His friend Alex Goldfarb told the hearing that the image, which shows him gaunt and obviously gravely ill, was the last ever taken before he died from radiation poisoning at University College Hospital. The inquiry was also told Mr Litvinenko had a 'feeling' that two Russian men were planning to murder him during the meeting in which he drank tea laced with plutonium. Scroll down for video . Harrowing: This image, the last photograph ever taken of Alexander Litvinenko, was shown to the inquiry into his death today . Hospital: Mr Litvinenko had visibly deteriorated compared to this picture taken just a few days earlier . In an interview with police while he lay on his deathbed, the spy said that Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun 'wanted to kill me'. He met the two men at the Millennium Hotel in central London on November 1, 2006, and drank a few sips of tea which later turned out to be poisoned, the hearing was told. Brent Hyatt, a now-retired Metropolitan Police officer, told the long-awaited public inquiry today that he interviewed Mr Litvinenko, 43, over three days in University College Hospital, where he died three weeks after the hotel meeting. Mr Litvinenko said he drank tea from a silver teapot in the presence of Lugovoi, without Kovtun, but it was 'nearly cold' and he did not like the taste so only took three or four sips. Lugovoi then left the hotel with his family to watch a football match between Arsenal and CSKA Moscow match at the Emirates stadium in north London. Suspects: Dmitri Kovtun, left, and Andrei Lugovoi, right, have been accused of murdering the Russian spy . Fatal: Mr Litvinenko drank polonium-laced tea during a meeting at the Millennium Hotel, pictured . Evidence: Former police officer Brent Hyatt, pictured, interviewed Mr Litvinenko three times while the former Russian spy was dying in hospital . 'When I left the hotel I was thinking there is something strange,' Mr Litvinenko told police. 'I had been feeling all the time I knew that they wanted to kill me.' The Russian dissident, who was apparently working for MI6 after fleeing his home country, later described how he rapidly fell ill and worked out that he was a victim of poisoning. 'The vomiting didn't stop and I started having foam out my mouth and also bits of stomach with blood started coming out,' he told police. 'And I realised I had been poisoned.' Mr Litvinenko was also asked about a meeting he had with an unidentified man at Waterstones Piccadilly branch on October 31 - the day before the suspected poisoning. It is now understood that man was 'Martin', an MI6 officer to whom Mr Litvinenko reported. The Russian dissident, who fled to the UK in 2000 and claimed asylum before becoming a British citizen, drank hot chocolate and ate three pastries, while the man drank a coffee, the inquiry heard. Mr Hyatt said that Mr Litvinenko's health had 'very clearly' deteriorated during the three days of police interviews. The inquiry also heard that Boris Berezovsky cut the amount of money he was paying to support the Litvinenko family after hearing that the spy was working for MI6. Family: Mr Litvinenko's son Anatoly and widow Marina outside the Royal Courts of Justice . Polonium is an ultra-rare radioactive element which was discovered by Pierre and Marie Curie in 1898, and named after Marie's home country of Poland, which was not then an independent state. In the natural world it occurs as a part of uranium ore, and must be extracted through a laborious process in which many tonnes of ore may be needed to produce just a few milligrammes of polonium. Even a tiny amount costs tens of millions of pounds to make - around the world, no more than 100g of polonium is produced each year. The radiation emitted by polonium is in the form of alpha particles, meaning that handling the substance poses little danger because the particles cannot pass through human skin. However, once polonium is ingested it spreads throughout the body causing acute radiation syndrome, which leads to severe illness and eventually death. Alexander Litvinenko is the only person ever known to have been poisoned with polonium - he ingested the element's most common isotope, polonium-210, dissolved into a pot of tea. Mr Goldfarb, a dissident who was close to both Mr Litvinenko and the billionaire tycoon he was once ordered to assassinate, said that Mr Berezovsky had paid $130,000 (£85,000) to bring the Litvinenkos to the UK. He continued to fund Mr Litvinenko once he had settled in London, but halved the money he gave his friend when the MI6 connection became apparent, Mr Goldfarb said. He added that MI6 were 'not happy' about Mr Litvinenko's friendship with Mr Berezovsky, who was found dead at his Berkshire mansion two years ago in an apparent suicide. Mr Goldfarb, a molecular biologist who became a political activist, claimed that he had been 'barred from entering the UK' after helping to expedite Mr Litvinenko's flight from Russia. Yesterday Mr Litvinenko's widow Marina told the inquiry, which opened last week eight years after his death, that the last words she ever heard him say were 'I love you so much'. She said that during Mr Litvinenko's illness his hair was so thin that when she stroked his head clumps were coming off in her hand. The couple's son Anatoly, 20, also gave evidence, saying that he never believed his father would die despite his rapid illness. Lugovoi and Kovtun have both refused to give evidence to the inquiry at the Royal Courts of Justice, insisting they had no involvement in Mr Litvinenko's death. The inquiry has previously been told that the spy was one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, and had allegedly been told that the Russian government was planning to murder him. The hearing continues.","Alexander Litvinenko drank tea laced with polonium while meeting Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitri Kovtun at a London hotel .

"Nick Clegg wants new laws to protect journalists' sources . Nick Clegg has demanded new laws to ban police from accessing journalists' phone records to identify their sources without a judge's warrant. The Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May urging her to introduce the new protections before the end of the month. It comes after an official government report found there were not 'adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources'. Sir Anthony May, the Interception of Communications Commissioner, said the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act – Ripa – left journalists unprotected. His report said: 'It is recommended that judicial authorisation is obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information.' A review of the use of the Ripa surveillance powers was launched in October after alarm was expressed about incidents such as Scotland Yard accessing the phone records of Sun reporter Tom Newton Dunn to find who had leaked information on the Plebgate row. The commissioner found that over a three-year period 19 police forces had sought communications data in relation to 34 investigations into illicit dealings between public officials and journalists. Some 608 applications for such data were authorised, by a ranking officer. But the report stressed that was just 0.1% of the total applications authorised by police under the legislation. It also concluded that police had not used Ripa to circumvent other legislation and forces were not 'randomly trawling communications data relating to journalists in order to identify their sources'. 'Generally speaking, the police forces did not give the question of necessity, proportionality and collateral intrusion sufficient consideration,' the report said. 'They focused on privacy considerations (Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights) and did not give due consideration to freedom of speech (Article 10). 'The current Home Office Code of Practice (and the recently revised draft Code said to provide protection for sensitive professions) do not provide adequate safeguards to protect journalistic sources or prevent unnecessary or disproportionate intrusions.' The Prime Minister's official spokesman said David Cameron accepted the commissioner's recommendation. 'He very much welcomes the report. He believes that the report makes the case well for the judicial oversight it recommends in cases of data comms applications that are relevant to journalistic sources and that is why the Government is accepting that recommendation,' the spokesman said. The Home Secretary Theresa May is under pressure to introduce new laws forcing the police to get a warrant before accessing journalists' phone records . In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, Liberal Democrat Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg called for legislation to be brought forward later this month. 'As you know, I have consistently raised my concerns about the protection of journalists' sources in relation to acquisition of communications data under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act,' Mr Clegg wrote. 'The report published today by the Interception of Communications Commissioner recommends that 'judicial authorisation must be obtained in cases where communications data is sought to determine the source of journalistic information'. 'We have an opportunity to act on this recommendation at report stage of the Serious Crime Bill in the Commons on February 23. I hope that you will look urgently at drafting Government amendments to that effect.'","Deputy Prime Minister has written to the Home Secretary Theresa May .

"An ancient gospel has been discovered in the pages of a diminutive book dating back to the 6th century. The text, dubbed the ‘Gospel of the Lots of Mary’ is written in Coptic and contains oracles that would have been used to provide support and reassurance to people seeking help for problems. It is not a gospel in the traditional sense, because it doesn’t predominantly teach about Christ, and its translator suggests that the discovery could rewrite the ancient definition and purpose of gospels. The text (pictured), dubbed the ‘Gospel of the Lots of Mary’ is written in Coptic and contains oracles that would have been used to provide support and reassurance to people seeking help for problems. It is not a gospel in the traditional sense, because it doesn’t teach about Christ, said its translator . The ancient book was given to Harvard University's Sackler Museum in 1984 by Beatrice Kelekian, in memory of her husband Charles Dikran Kelekian. Her father-in-law Dikran Kelekian’s was said to be ‘an influential trader of Coptic antiquaries’, but the origin of the book is unknown. The text was studied by Professor Anne Marie Luijendijk from Princeton University. She told LiveScience that when she deciphered the first line, which referenced a ‘gospel’, she expected to read about Jesus and his life. Coptic was a language spoken in Egypt from the 2nd century until around the 17th. It derived from a mixture of Greek and seven Demotic signs and is said to have originated in the upper parts of Egypt. The language is also closely linked to Heiroglyphic scripts. The Gospel of the Lots of Mary was given to Harvard University's Sackler Museum in 1984 by Beatrice Kelekian, in memory of her husband, Charles Dikran Kelekian. Her father-in-law Dikran Kelekian’s was said to be ‘an influential trader of Coptic antiquaries’, but the origin of the book is unknown. The 160-page codex contains a series of 37 short passages and measures just 3 inches (75mm) tall and 2.7 inches (68.7mm) wide. A person seeking an answer to a particular query or concern would have opened the book on a random page to read a statement designed to serve as an answer. Instead, she found what is described in her book ‘Forbidden Oracles? The Gospel of the Lots of Mary’ as a ‘5th or 6th century Coptic book of oracular answers.’ The 160-page codex contains a series of 37 short passages written over two facing parchment leaves. It measures just 3 inches (7.5cm) tall and 2.7 inches (6.9cm) wide - about the size of a woman’s palm. A person seeking an answer to a particular query or concern would have opened the book on a random page to read a statement designed to serve as an answer, similar to a modern Magic 8 ball. The full translation of the book’s opening reads: ‘The Gospel of the lots of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, she to whom Gabriel the archangel brought the good news. ‘He who will go forward (or: will seek) with his whole heart will obtain what he seeks. 'Only do not be of two minds’. One oracle reads: ‘Stop being of two minds, o human, whether this thing will happen or not. Yes, it will happen! 'Be brave and do not be of two minds. Because it will remain with you a long time and you will receive joy and happiness.’ The full translation of the book’s opening reads: ‘The Gospel of the lots of Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus Christ, she to whom Gabriel the archangel brought the good news.‘He who will go forward (or: will seek) with his whole heart will obtain what he seeks.'Only do not be of two minds’. Mary and Jesus are illustrated . While another says: ‘You know, o human, that you did your utmost again. You did not gain anything but loss, dispute, and war. ‘But if you are patient a little, the matter will prosper through the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Today, the official definition of the word ‘gospel’ is the ‘teaching or revelation of Christ,’ but it actually originates from the meaning of the Greek word ‘evangelion’ meaning ‘good news’. The ancient book was given to Harvard University's Sackler Museum in 1984. The 160-page codex contains a series of 37 short passages (example pictured) written over two facing parchment leaves. It measures just 3 inches (75mm) tall and 2.7 inches (68.7mm) wide - about the size of a woman’s palm . Professor Luijendijk said that people would have used the book to seek ‘good news’ about their future and ‘the fact that this is not a gospel in the traditional sense gives ample reason to inquire about the reception and use of the term 'gospel' in Late Antiquity.’ Coptic derived from a mixture of Greek script and seven Demotic signs in the upper parts of Egypt . The book is Christian in nature, and draws on Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Matthew, Luke, and James. But, in her book, Professor Luijendijlk said it does not contain traditional Christian teachings, and there are few, or no, mentions of the kingdom of God or Heaven, miracles, the church, or eternal life. If it was used by divinators, Professor Luijendijlk said this may explain the book's small size, to make it possible to be concealed in a pocket or sleeve. This was because such books may have been frowned upon by religious leaders. Last month, a collection of spells and invocations, dating back 1,300 years, were deciphered for the first time from an ancient handbook. Also written in Coptic, the codex contains a mixture of references from Orthodox Christianity and Sethianism.

"These are the latest pictures of Jordan Matson, just one of dozens of U.S. and other foreign fighters who have traveled to Syria to fight alongside Kurdish militias against the Islamic State. The 28-year-old food packaging worker from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, is a former U.S. Army soldier who never served overseas. But he has been fighting with the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) since last September. After starting his adventure in Syria, the committed Christian is now in Iraq, where he fights against the jihadis of Islamic State wearing a tactical vest scribbled with the words 'Christ is Lord'. Scroll down for video . International brigades: Jordan Matson, 28, right, a former U.S. Army soldier from Sturtevant, Wisconsin, takes a break with other fighters from the main Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units, or YPG, in Sinjar, Iraq . Giving back: Matson and dozens of other Westerners now fight with the Kurds, spurred on by social media campaigners and a sense of duty many feel to Iraq, the target of a decade-long U.S.-led military campaign . Online recruitment: Mr Matson and three other Americans and an Australian national who spoke to the AP all said they arranged joining Kurdish forces through the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page . 'I'm not going back until the fight is finished and ISIS is crippled,' Mr Matson told the Associated Press. 'I decided that if my government wasn't going to do anything to help this country, especially Kurdish people who stood by us for 10 years and helped us out while we were in this country, then I was going to do something.' Mr Matson and dozens of other Westerners now fight with the Kurds, spurred on by Kurdish social media campaigners and a sense of duty many feel after Iraq, the target of a decade-long U.S.-led military campaign, collapsed under an Islamic State group offensive within days last summer. And while U.S. and its coalition allies bomb the extremists from the air, Kurds say they hope more Westerners will join them on the ground to fight. Not all fun and games: This picture from the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page shows Richard, who's said to be a Dutch fighter, lying in a clinic after he was injured during violent clashes against IS terrorists in Shingal . More American volunteers: These two men are pictured on the Lions Of Rojava Facebook page and identified as Brandon, left, and Kennedy, right, two more volunteers from the U.S. who have come to fight with the YPG . 'I'm not going back until the fight is finished': An earlier picture of Mr Matson taken from Facebook . Foreigners joining other people's wars is nothing new, from the French Foreign Legion to the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War. The Kurds, however, turned to the Internet to find its warriors, creating a Facebook page called The Lions Of Rojava with the stated mission of sending 'terrorists to hell and save humanity.' The page also frequently features portraits of smiling, beautiful and heavily armed Kurdish female commanders and fighters. Mr Matson and three other Americans and an Australian national who spoke to the AP all said they arranged joining Kurdish forces through the Facebook page, run by the People's Protection Units, or YPG, the main Syrian Kurdish militia fighting in northern Syria and Iraq. They crossed from Turkey into Syria, now in its fourth year of civil war, before later joining a Kurdish offensive sweeping into Iraq to challenge the Islamic State group. They now are based in Sinjar, where stone homes painted green, pink and yellow have been damaged in fighting, surrounded by sandbags and piles of rubble. Foreigners like Mr Matson seem drawn to helping Kurds, Yazidis and other minority ethnic groups caught up in the battle and facing possible destruction at the hand of extremists willing to massacre hundreds in propaganda videos. 'How many people were sold into slavery or killed just for being part of a different ethnic group or religion?' he said. 'That's something I am willing to die to defend.' However, the other Westerners who talked to the AP spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing the reaction of their families, who didn't know where they were, or possible legal troubles if they make it back home. They know how to party: Fighters from the Kurdish YPG and YPJ militias dance in celebration after defeating Islamic State fighters in Kobani, the town in northern Syria which has been a battleground for months . So far, the U.S. hasn't banned Americans from fighting with militias against the Islamic State group, though it considers the Turkey-based Kurdish Workers' Party, commonly known as the PKK, a terrorist organization. The PKK has been fighting alongside the YPG in Sinjar and in the Syrian town of Kobani. Under Australian law, it is illegal to fight with any force outside of its national army. Australia also is one of the first countries to criminalise travel to Syria's al-Raqqa province, the de facto capital of the Islamic State group. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad had no immediate comment to an AP query about Americans fighting with the Kurds. Devastated: Kurdish fighters walk in a street reduced to rubble during the five-month battle for Kobani . Shattered: Almost all parts of the town are in ruins following the fierce fighting that has taken place there . Mr Matson and other foreigners fighting with the YPG last month travelled from Syria into Sinjar, the area which saw thousands of Yazidis flee into the surrounding mountains last year during the Islamic State group's offensive. It's unclear how many foreigners total are fighting with the YPG and other Kurdish forces, though both foreigners and Kurds say there are 'dozens.' There's a clear comradery among foreign fighters in Sinjar, most traveling in pairs around the town. A number of YPG fighters, many of them as young as 17, joke and tease their new foreign friends, speaking to them in the local Kurdish dialect. One fighter, 21-year-old Khalil Oysal from Syria, spends much of his time with the foreigners since he can speak English. 'We learn from them and they learn from us,' said MR Oysal, who American and Australian fighters have nicknamed 'Bucky'. 'They speak with us and they like to joke. They share with us many things.' The human cost of victory: A visitor walks at a cemetery for Kurdish YPG and YPJ fighters killed during the battle for Kobani, at the border town of Suruc, in Turkey's southeastern Sanliurfa province . Western fighters in Sinjar say there is a major drive to recruit as many foreigners as possible, especially those with military training as many of young Kurdish fighters have little or no experience. The young fighters often pick up weapons and ammunition from dead Islamic State group militants. They also have no body armor. Fighting remains dangerous for the Westerners as well. Two of the foreign fighters said they had just returned from visiting an American fighter badly wounded in battle. They said another foreign fighter, a Dutch national, was severely wounded in battle in Syria last week. 'You need to know what you're getting in to,' Mr Matson said. 'A lot of times you're going out, you're in a mud hut. ... You have bullets and a blanket, and sometimes you just have bread, but you need to hold the line.'","Jordan Matson, 28, has been fighting with the YPG since September .

"A woman has endured painful laser surgery to be rid of a giant tattoo she had emblazoned across her stomach. Cher, 31, from Glasgow, had a skull and angel wings etched onto her skin in her twenties when she was struggling to fit in with the gay community. 'Growing up I was really girly, I would buy dresses and skirts. I knew I was gay and I thought I had to change to fit in,' she explains on Channel 4 show Bodyshockers. 'I felt like a lost girl in a gay bar with long hair, heels and a dress. Everyone else had short hair, piercings and tattoos.' Cher shows off the skull and wings tattoo she regrets having done in her twenties . The 31-year-old admits the tattoo looks like something a biker mad Hell's Angels fan would have . The financial adviser chose the 'manly' skull surrounded by wings in her bid to look more butch. But ten years later, she says the gay community has moved on and she no longer feels she has to conform to a stereotypical image. She said: 'When I came out I tried to fit in to the gay community by getting my hair cut short and getting piercings and tattoos. 'Now I'm more girly again, it doesn't suit me. I'm back to being comfortable in myself. The tattoo is embarrassing, it's massive. Every time I see it gets me down.

Cher said: 'I can't stand it, I hate it, I wish I never got it.' She was given the chance to turn back the clock by having laser removal surgery as the Bodyshockers cameras rolled. Cher is seen struggling to deal with the pain and admits: 'This is worse than getting a tattoo, it's agony. It feels like someone has a frying pan on my stomach and is frying sausages.' It will take six sessions for the tattoo to be completely removed but Cher's chance of success are enhanced by the fact her only has black lines. Tattoos with colours are more difficult to remove with laser surgery. Cher said she definitely won't be getting any more tattoos in the future and she hopes other young people will take heed from her story and think before they ink.

"These are the pictures that show the shocking reality of domestic violence in Australia. Mother-of-two Sarah Kelly, 34, was brutally bashed by her partner of 11 years in front of her five-year-old son at Hillarys Boat Harbour north of Perth on August 3, 2013. It was meant to be a sunny family boat trip to Rottnest Island but instead it ended in disaster - with a family destroyed and Ms Kelly hospitalised for ten days. With a single closed-fist punch following an argument, Ms Kelly's then-partner Alan James Williams, 42, ruptured her right eye, fractured her cheekbone and jaw and broke a bone in her nose. Mr Williams was last Thursday sentenced to 18 months jail (eligible for parole after nine months) after the District Court of Western Australia convicted him of endangering her life, health and safety. But a year-and-a-half since the attack, Ms Kelly told Daily Mail Australia she is reminded of the incident whenever she looks in the mirror. Scroll down for video . Graphic assault: Ms Kelly was hospitalised for ten days following the brutal attack in August 2013 . Before the attack and after: Mum-of-two Sarah Kelly was brutally assaulted on August 3, 2013, causing her right her to rupture. It was saved in an operation but is now considered 'dead' Ms Kelly with her two children: She often wears sunglasses to prevent questions about the injury to her eye . Fake eye: Ms Kelly does not like the acrylic eye she sometimes wears over the top of her eye . Ms Kelly said the attack resulted in her being subjected to a lengthy court process, extensive hospital time and counselling for herself and her son . Aftermath: Sarah Kelly's former partner was last week sentenced to an eighteen month sentence with nine months non-parole . The office worker's eye was permanently damaged by the attack - described as 'deformed' in court and 'dead' by doctors. She briefly wore a fake acrylic eye over the top of it but does not wear it any more as it is painful. Ms Kelly is telling her story because she wants to show the permanent damage that many victims of domestic violence are left with and the need for greater support for victims. 'When people ask you, ""what's wrong with your eye? Have you got an infection?"" That painful memory comes back,' she said. 'I can't turn around and say, ""I was in a car accident"" - (those victims) don't like how they look, but it's not as bad saying ""someone bashed me"". 'I wish it never happened but everyday I have to look at it.' 'I have a lot less confidence now being out in public because I don't want people to stare at my face. 'For the first year afterwards I didn't even want to leave my house.' On top of her permanent injury and the unavoidable reminders, Ms Kelly said the attack resulted in her being subjected to a lengthy court process, extensive hospital time, 'millions of eye appointments', counselling for herself and her son - all while the family moved house. 'I lived in stress, hell. I was in and out of hospital, and then sitting around waiting for that decision - your life's just hanging (in the balance).' The attack, which the court heard happened in front of several witnesses, came after what she said was years of 'controlling' behaviour from her partner who she had been planning to leave in the weeks leading up to the assault. Her partner checked her internet history and found she had been looking at rental properties, she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'd gone home and looked at rentals (in July 2013) and he found my internet search history and went off at me. Her partner checked her internet history and found she had been looking at rental properties . Before and after: Ms Kelly used to wears her hair over her right eye (pictured right) to prevent people from asking questions about the damage done . Hillarys Boat Harbour, north of Perth, where the incident occurred . 'By 2013 I felt really trapped. I just didn't know what to do.' Ms Kelly used to hide her eye under her hair and sometimes shields it under her sunglasses to prevent questions about it. With help, she is beginning to feel better. 'I'm starting to get better. I'm not covering my face. I still don't like making eye contact with people. I feel stronger now.' Ms Kelly's 'dead eye' may need to be removed . Ms Kelly is now on the front foot regarding domestic violence, saying its victims are 'left to wear scars' She said there are charities in the United Kingdom and the United States - such as an American organisation called Face Forward - which help domestic violence victims restore their appearance, but nothing comparable in Australia. 'There's a lot of people with permanent injuries through domestic violence who are left to wear those scars,' Ms Kelly said. 'It's a reminder of something you don't want to be reminded of'. According to the White Ribbon Foundation, one in three Australian women experience physical or sexual violence from someone known to them. Instead, the Abbott Government has been criticised for reportedly cutting funds to as many as 50 community services agencies which provide support to victims of domestic and family violence. Domestic violence has, however, been placed on the agenda at the Council of Australian Governments (COAG). And the issue is gaining a bigger spotlight after family violence survivor Rosie Batty - whose son Luke was murdered by her husband at a cricket ground - was named the Australian of the Year last month. Ms Kelly, who said she had been frightened of leaving her partner, said: 'If there's not enough help out there, it's less likely a person is going to go to one of those places (a refuge) for help.' Ms Kelly said there was a misconception that many victims of domestic violence are from a lower socio-economic background or that substance abuse involved, but neither of that applied to her. She said that if someone is aware of domestic violence happening they should report it to the police, just as they would report an attack they witnessed in public. 'Domestic violence isn't something that just happens to ""those people"",' Ms Kelly said. 'It cuts across all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations and socio-economic classes. 'The only good thing I can say out of this now is that I've got my children out of that house. 'They're not going to witness any more of that violence.' Long way to go: Prime Minister Tony Abbott awards Rosie Batty the title of Australian of the Year .

"If you are one of the millions of people who hate popping pills, then you're not alone. One in three of us would prefer to risk an earlier death  than take a daily pill to prevent heart disease, a study has revealed. And one in five of those polled would be willing to pay at least $1,000 (£657) to avoid taking a pill every day for the rest of their lives, the US researchers found. The new U.S. study reinforces that many of us do not like taking daily medication, the researchers say. A fifth of patients say they would be willing to pay $1,000 (£657) not to take drugs every day . The study 'reinforces the idea that many people do not like taking pills, for whatever reason,' said Dr Robert Hutchins of the University of California, San Francisco. He added: 'And it reiterates we should be having discussions with patients about what their priorities are. '[The question is]...if they value the extended life they might get from taking a pill more than the effect on their quality of life for having to take that pill every day for the rest of their life.' Dr Hutchins and his colleagues designed the survey to find out, hypothetically, how much time at the end of their lives people would be willing to give up just to avoid taking preventive medications every day. They also asked how much people would pay to avoid having to take pills, and how much of a risk of death they'd accept to avoid taking drugs to prevent heart disease. The pills would be free, and participants were told to ignore potential side effects. A thousand people – mostly women and with an average age of 50 – completed the online survey, the researchers reported in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes. In 'real life,' four out of five were taking daily medication, with 54 percent taking at least three pills a day. In 'real life,' four out of five were taking daily medication, with 54 percent taking at least three pills a day. Overall, about 70 per cent said they wouldn't trade any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a pill every day. But more than 8 per cent were willing to trade up to two years of life to avoid taking pills every day. And roughly 21 per cent would trade between one week and a year. About 13 per cent would accept a small risk of death to avoid taking a pill every day, and 9 percent would risk a 10 per cent chance. About 62 per cent weren't willing to gamble any risk of immediate death. On average, respondents said they'd pay $1,445 (£950) to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives. However 41 per cent said they wouldn't pay any amount. Overall, about 70 per cent said they wouldn't trade any weeks of their lives to avoid taking a pill every day. But more than 8 per cent were willing to trade up to two years of life to avoid taking pills every day. And roughly 21 per cent would trade between one week and a year. On average, respondents said they'd pay $1,445 to avoid taking a pill each day for the rest of their lives - but 41 per cent said they wouldn't pay any amount. Dr Hutchins believes the findings are useful to researchers who are developing new ways to administer medicines. 'What if we can deliver medication like aspirin and statins without someone having to take a pill? 'It would almost certainly increase compliance while also improving that person's quality of life by removing the hassle of having to take a pill daily,' he told Reuters Health. However other medical experts warned these study participants might not accurately reflect the general population. Despite this, it is impressive that such a large number of people would be willing to take medication every day, said Dr Mario Garcia, of the Montefiore-Einstein Center for Heart and Vascular Care in New York. 'There were almost 70 per cent of people who would take a pill a day even to live one week longer, and that's remarkable,' he said. But on the other hand, he added, people often don't like to pay for medications. 'Clearly people will be compliant if they don't have any side effects,' he said. 'On the other hand, they probably wouldn't be willing to pay out-of-pocket too much.' The findings are useful to researchers who are developing new ways to administer medicines.

"ISIS militants are . selling abducted Iraqi children at markets as sex slaves, using them as suicide bombers and killing others by crucifixion or burying them alive, a watchdog has said. The children, who are often from the Yazidi sect or Christian communities, but also Shi'ites and Sunnis, are being tortured and murdered, the U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child said. A report released on Wednesday revealed a host of horrifying outcomes for the children kidnapped by the Islamic militants, including boys under-18 being used as bomb makers, informants or human shields to protect facilities against U.S.-led airstrikes. Scroll down for video . Children, who are often from the Yazidi sect or Christian communities, but also Shi'ites and Sunnis, are being sold into sex slavery, turned into suicide bombers or murdered after being kidnapped by ISIS. Pictured: Yazidi refugee children . The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child - which produced the report into the children's fates - is calling on the Iraqi government to help rescue those captured by the Islamic militants. Pictured: Yazidi children after they fled from ISIS . Girls are being sold as sex slaves, while children - often with learning difficulties - are being used as suicide bombers. Others are simply being murdered, the report says. 'We are really deeply concerned at torture and murder of . those children, especially those belonging to minorities, but . not only from minorities,' committee expert Renate Winter said. 'The scope of the problem is huge.' The U.N. body, which reviewed Iraq's record for the first time since 1998, denounced 'the systematic killing of children belonging to religious and ethnic minorities by the so-called ISIL [ISIS]'. This included 'several cases of mass executions of boys, as well as reports of beheadings, crucifixions of children and burying children alive'. ISIS - which controls land in Syria and Iraq - has committed 'systematic sexual violence', including 'the abduction and sexual enslavement of children', it said. Winter revealed: 'Children of minorities have been captured in many places...sold in the market place with tags, price tags on them, they have been sold as slaves.' Winter also said a number of the children were being used as suicide bombers by ISIS fighters.

There is also evidence ISIS is turning its own children into mini-jihadists: this video purported to show a young boy executing two so-called Russian spies . 'We have had reports of children, especially children who . are mentally challenged, who have been used as suicide bombers, . most probably without them even understanding,' she said. 'There was a video placed (online) that showed children . at a very young age, approximately eight years of age and . younger, to be trained already to become child soldiers.' The report also notes a large number of children have been killed or badly wounded . during air strikes or shelling by Iraqi security forces, while . others had died of 'dehydration, starvation and heat'. The 18 independent experts who worked on the report have now called . on Iraqi authorities to take all necessary measures to 'rescue . children' under the control of Islamic State and to prosecute . perpetrators of crimes. 'There is a duty of a state to protect all its children. The . point is just how are they going to do that in such a . situation,' Winter said.","U.N.

"Attacks against British Jews have reached a record high fuelled by an explosion of violence in the Middle East. Hate crimes of anti-Semitism doubled to exceed 1,000 in a single year for the first time last year, according to new figures. The bloody conflict in Gaza and Israel is the single biggest contributor to the sure, the Community Security Trust (CST) said. Scroll down for video . There were a total of 1,168 attacks in the UK last year - ranging from graffiti to violent assaults - more than double 2013's figure. Pictured: An Orthodox Jewish man walks through Stamford Hill, north London . Officials at the group, which monitors anti-Semitism and provides security for the Jewish community, recorded 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in 2014. This was more than double the 535 incidents recorded in 2013 and the highest annual total ever recorded. The incidents ranged from violent attacks in the street to vile graffiti and criminal damage against synagogues and homes. In one of the most serious attacks a victim was called a ‘Jewish c***’ and then hit with a glass and a baseball bat in London. In Manchester, a man was knocked off his bike and kicked while on the ground by a group of youths who called him a ‘Jew’. A Jewish girl had deodorant sprayed in her face by a 12-year-old fellow pupil who said to her ‘gas the Jews’ at a school in Edinburgh. And in London two men ran into a kosher restaurant where they intimidated diners before making a Nazi salute and shouting: ‘Heil, Adolf Hitler.’ The Community Safety Trust, which has recorded every anti-Semitic incident in the UK since 1984, blames rising tension in the Middle East. Pictured: Palestinians protest against Israeli President Reuven Rivlin to the small Jewish settler community living in Beit Hadassah, Hebron . The CST has logged anti-Semitic incidents in the UK since 1984, and the previous highest annual total came in 2009 when 931 anti-Semitic incidents were recorded. Experts believe the conflict in Israel and Gaza, which took place in July and August, was the single biggest factor behind the increase. They are braced for a similar spike this year after the attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris which left four people dead. Jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly, who had earlier killed a police woman, struck after two accomplices massacred staff at the offices of Charlie Hebdo. Tensions are escalating across Europe, with three soldiers stabbed on Tuesday while protecting a Jewish centre in Nice, leading to fear the UK figure may rise once more. Pictured: Police collect evidence in Nice . Officials said the attacks, which sent shockwaves around the world, led to an ‘unprecedented’ number of calls from worried Jews. The CST received reports of anti-Semitic incidents from 89 different locations around the UK, including 81 attacks. There were the same number of incidents of damage and desecration of Jewish property, 884 incidents of abusive behaviour and 92 direct anti-Semitic threats. The group also recorded 233 anti-Semitic threats and comments made on social media, including Twitter and Facebook. Last month Scotland Yard Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said there is ‘heightened concern’ about the risk to Jewish people since the attacks. The figures have been released 10 days after the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp which gassed more than a million Jews during the Second World War. Pictured: Holocaust survivor Mordechai Ronen is overcome by emotions standing next to the President of the World Jewish Congress Ronald Lauder, right . Home Secretary Theresa May described the latest figures as ‘deeply concerning’, adding: ‘Britain without its Jews would not be Britain.’ ‘I am absolutely clear that everyone in this country, including members of Britain’s Jewish community, should be able to live their lives free from racial and religious hatred and harassment. No one should live in fear because of their beliefs or who they are.’ Greater Manchester Police Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, who has national responsibility for policing anti-Semitic crimes, called on people who suffer such crimes to always contact police. He said: ‘The recent events in Paris are a reminder to all of us here in the UK that if we tolerate people being targeted because of their race, religion or even how they look the consequences are catastrophic.’ David Delew, who leads the CST, said the figures show ‘just how easily anti-Semitic attitudes can erupt into race hate abuse, threats and attacks’. He said: ‘Thankfully most of the incidents were not violent but they were still shocking and upsetting for those who suffered them, and for the wider Jewish community.’","There were a total of 1,168 anti-Semitic incidents in the UK during 2014 .

Ali, 42, told police Alvarez had bitten him on the genitals and had attacked her in a bid to get her teeth off his penis. He is also facing drug charges after reportedly being found in possession of marijuana. The teenager was found inside Antonio's Pension House, a hotel in Dipolog City, in a room that Ali had been renting since January 28. A judge told Ali during the sentencing 'your assault was so extreme even experienced criminals were sickened by the conduct'.

"The 73-year-old brother of Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid has been arrested after allegedly driving drunk and fighting with police officers. Larry Reid was arrested after being found in a parked Lexus SUV in the dirt median of a state highway in southern Nevada, the state his brother represents. He faces misdemeanor charges of driving under the influence, battery on an officer and possession of a firearm while  under the influence of alcohol. He was also cited for not wearing a seat belt. Larry Reid, 73, was arrested after being found in a parked SUV on the median of a highway in southern Nevada. He faces misdemeanor charges of DUI, battery on an officer and possessing a gun while under the influence . He was released after spending the night in Clark Country Jail. Reid and his car were on a stretch of U.S. 95 inside the Boulder City limits, about 25 miles southeast of Las Vegas. Nevada Highway Patrol Trooper Loy Hixson said the car, which the trooper on the scene originally believed to be broken down, but on closer inspection found Reid inside. The details of  Reid's arrest were not immediately available - including why he was charged with battering an officer and how he sustained injuries to his face. A spokeswoman for Senator Reid confirmed Larry Reid is Harry Reid's brother, but wouldn't comment about the arrest saying it was a private matter. A criminal complaint had not been filed as of Wednesday afternoon and no court date had been set. Senator Reid is still sporting a painful wound to his eye after a bizarre New Year's Day exercise accident.

"Ferguson police are testing a new non lethal attatchemt for handguns. It allows them to fire alloys 'ping pong balls' - which can bring a person down but not kill them. This week, five instructors for the Missouri city's police department are training to use the device, called the Alternative. Scroll down for video . The orange device attaches to the top of a normal handgun and fires a bullet into the Ping-Pong-ball-sized projectile in front of the muzzle. The $45 Orange device that attaches to the top of a normal handgun. The product itself only weighs about 2 ounces and sits in a small pouch on their duty belt. The bullet embeds itself inside the projectile without a chance of escaping . It mounts to the top of an officer's weapon within a second when the officer feels it's an appropriate lethal force situation . It extends alloy Ping-Pong-ball-sized projectile in front of the muzzle . Bullet embeds itself inside the projectile, firing it. The Ferguson Police Department, which reportedly intends to distribute the Alternative to all of its officers following training, found itself at the center of national debates over policing and race relations after then-Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown last August. 'The alternative was developed as a blunt force impact device to fill the void in lethal force situations, which until now could only be addressed with a firearm,' Alternative Ballistics, the firm which designed the weapon, said. 'Concerned with the number of deaths of officers and citizens resulting when confrontations occur, where a new lethal force option would have been preferred but not readily available, we developed the Alternative. Christian Ellis, founder and CEO of Alternative Ballistics, told the Washington Post Ferguson police reached out to him after the city's assistant police chief, Al Eickhoff, took to Google and searched under the words 'less lethal.' 'It gives another option,' Eickhoff said of the device, which he later tested for himself, the Post said. 'I really liked it. . . . You are always looking to save a life, not take a life.' However, when the Post asked Eickhoffis the $45 addon could have saved Michael Brown, he said: . 'You could still shoot him with this round,' the assistant police chief said, 'and he could still get up and come at you.' Ellis, the chief executive of Alternative Ballistics, said he started the firm to avoid needless citizen deaths. The rough concept was developed several years ago by a retired sheriff's officer from whom Ellis said he bought the patent. 'Ask a police officer what are the options when lethal force is justified, and he'll say, 'I have my gun and my bullets,' ' said Ellis, 32, who recently began marketing the Alternative in the United States and abroad as an 'an air bag for a bullet.' It mounts to the top of an officer's weapon within a second when the officer feels it's an appropriate lethal force situation . 'This technology represents a critical 'missing link' between lethal force and less-lethal force,' the firm claims. 'By utilizing our bullet capture technology in appropriate situations police are likely to prevent loss of life to the public at large in a way that was – until now – not possible. The Alternative is a small orange device that attaches to the top of a normal handgun and extends a Ping-Pong-ball-sized projectile in front of the muzzle. However, critics have pointed out the Alternative resembles a clown's nose. 'The Bozo Bullet,' one critic called it. The Alternative is a small orange device that attaches to the top of a normal handgun and extends a Ping-Pong-ball-sized projectile in front of the muzzle. After traveling through the barrel, the bullet embeds itself inside the alloy projectile, and the docking unit immediately detaches from the weapon. 'Once the gun is fired, the bullet embeds itself inside the projectile without a chance of escaping, simultaneously transferring the bullet's energy as it propels it toward the target. 'Once the bullet is fired from the gun into the projectile, they permanently become one unit.' This process decreases the bullet's velocity and dampens its impact. The bullet, then, should not pierce a human's skin and cause the type of internal damage that would kill the person. However, it retains enough blunt force to knock someone over and deliver severe, debilitating pain, and travels up to 250 feet per second (when propelled by a 9mm slug) and sends 'a shock wave of pain through the suspect' when it hits, Ellis said.","$45 orange device  attaches to the top of a normal handgun .

"Given the typical undergraduate's love of lie-ins, some might say they get enough sleep already. But one university is clearly worried its students could do with a little more rest, to the point where it has introduced a designated nap room. The 'Nap Nook' is based on a sleepy room opened at James Madison University at Harrisonburg, Virginia, in the USA. Sleepy students can book a 40 minute nap in the designated room (pictured) at the University of East Anglia . Students will be well catered for with comfy bags and chairs, white noise to block out the busy campus and blackout curtains. Eye masks and anti-microbial pillows are also supplied in the room, which is open from noon until 6pm every day. Students can simply turn up or reserve a slot in advance for 40 minutes of sleep – monitored by CCTV to make sure they abide by the rules. Liam McCafferty, postgraduate students officer, said students live in a world of high expectations and volunteering, private study and nights out take their toll. He said students often live in noisy houses with their friends, with loud corridors, facing busy roads. And sleep is one thing that can be easily changed. Liam, 23, of Norwich, said: 'Sleep is one of the biggest factors in a person's life and one of the easiest things to change. 'The nap room will give students a chance to see the benefits. 'We hope the room will help, anything that encourages students to think positively about the benefits of sleep is a good thing. 'Students in particular are prone to bad sleeping habits.' The room is open from noon until 6pm each day - but students will be closely monitored to ensure they don't break the rules (picture posed by a model) Independent sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley said the 'Nap Nook' was a good idea for hard-working students who had toiled in the library the previous night. But he warned students should value the importance of sleep and not use the room as an excuse to have a few extra drinks on a night out. Dr Stanley said: 'From a simple point of view it's a good idea. Drinking energy drinks such as Red Bull is only a temporary boost. 'A short nap can boost your performance by 20 to 25 per cent. 'It would be much better for the university to educate their students about the importance of their sleep. 'If the students are needing the nap room because they are working hard then I am 100 per cent for that.'","Students can book a 40 minute snooze in the specially designated room .

"Panic was growing in Labour ranks last night as a poll suggested the party will face an electoral wipeout at the hands of the Scottish nationalists. Calls were growing for Labour’s Scottish MPs – including its election chief Douglas Alexander – to abandon Westminster and head north to try to save their seats. Long-awaited polling of key Scottish constituencies yesterday confirmed Labour’s worst fears, suggesting the SNP is on course for landslide victories May. Calls are growing for Labour's Scottish MPs, including its election chief Douglas Alexander, pictured, to head north to try and save their seats . Some of the biggest names in Scottish politics face losing their seats, undermining Ed Miliband’s hopes of a Commons majority. Mr Alexander, the Shadow Foreign Secretary and Margaret Curran, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, are among those heading for defeat. In all, Lord Ashcroft’s polling suggested an average swing from Labour to the SNP of 25 per cent – a shift not seen in modern political history. That would mean the SNP snatching 35 of the 41 seats Labour won in 2010, leaving them humiliated in a traditional heartland. It also means the SNP is likely to hold the balance of power in a hung Parliament. Polls show that Margaret Curran, left, the Shadow Scottish Secretary, and Anas Sarwar, right are headed for defeat . Other likely casualties include Labour’s former deputy leader in Scotland, Anas Sarwar, whose majority in Glasgow Central is currently more than 10,000. Labour rising stars Gemma Doyle and Pamela Nash both face losing in West Dunbartonshire and Airdrie and Shotts. The findings are equally grim for the Liberal Democrats – with a pitiful 12 per cent of voters who backed the party in 2010 saying they will do so again. In Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander faces disaster, with a 25.5 per cent swing against him predicted. Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy cancelled a planned photocall in the wake of the poll results. Scottish Labour Leader Jim Murphy insisted the main beneficiaries of an SNP surge are the Conservatives, who will be more likely to secure power at Westminster . He insisted the main beneficiaries of an SNP surge are the Conservatives, who will be more likely to secure power at Westminster. He said: ‘These polls show that Scottish Labour is well behind and has a big gap to close. ‘But in the end the only people who will benefit from these polls are David Cameron and the Tories. ‘It is a simple fact that the single biggest party gets to form the next government. ‘The more seats the SNP get from Labour, the more likely it is the Tories will be the biggest party and David Cameron will get into government through the back door.’ Labour strategists are desperately hoping that talking up the prospect of another Tory-led government will persuade some of their former voters to come home. They also believe that some of the 400,000 voters who backed the Conservatives in 2010 might be prepared to vote tactically to stop the SNP. However, Lord Ashcroft’s polling indicated that the SNP’s pitch to voters since losing last year’s independence referendum – vote SNP to ensure a strong Scottish presence at Westminster – is resonating. ‘The single most popular general election outcome in these seats was a coalition involving Labour and the SNP – a result favoured by 39 per cent of voters overall, including 62 per cent of SNP supporters and 79 per cent of Labour-SNP switchers,’ said Lord Ashcroft. ‘Huge swings to the SNP in national polls suggest that even some MPs who must have thought they had a job for life are threatened. ‘If a swing to the SNP… were to be repeated across the board next May it would endanger 35 of Labour’s 41 seats in Scotland.’ SNP general election campaign director Angus Robertson said: ‘These polls include some of Labour’s safest seats in the whole of the UK as well as Scotland, and they are clearly excellent for the SNP - but we are taking absolutely nothing for granted, and will work hard for every vote and seat in May. ‘These seat-by-seat polls also underline the extent to which Labour are paying a huge price for their toxic referendum alliance with the Tories - which to all intents and purposes has continued. ‘People can only make Scotland’s priorities Westminster’s priorities by voting SNP in May.’ Some shadow ministers are understood to be pressuring Labour leader Ed Miliband to publicly rule out any post-election deal with the SNP, led by Nicola Sturgeon, pictured . The research was conducted in January among 16,000 voters in 16 Scottish constituencies – 14 currently held by Labour, mostly in areas with a strong support for independence, and two held by the LibDems. Swings to the SNP in Labour-held seats ranged from 21 per cent in Airdrie and Shotts to 27 per cent in Motherwell and Wishaw and Dundee West. In Labour-held seats, just 60 per cent of Scots who backed the party in 2010 voters said they would do so again in May. Some shadow ministers are understood to be pressuring Mr Miliband to publicly rule out doing any post-election deal with the SNP to reinforce the argument that voting for the Nationalists will increase the likelihood of a Tory Government. Others back calls led by Mr Murphy for the party’s Scottish MPs to ‘forget’ Westminster and return to their seats to spend as much time as possible campaigning before the general election.","Poll shows Labour face electoral wipeout at hands of Scottish nationalists .

"A three-time convicted robber who helped engineer the biggest prison break in Texas history was executed on Wednesday evening for killing a suburban Dallas police officer while the notorious gang was on the run. Donald Newbury, 52, became the third member of the group known as the 'Texas 7' executed for the fatal shooting of 29-year-old Aubrey Hawkins, an Irving officer who interrupted the fugitives' robbery of a sporting goods store on Christmas Eve in 2000. The slaying occurred 11 days after the convicts escaped. The gang was captured a month later in Colorado. Scroll down for video . Donald Newbury, 52, became the third member of the group known as the 'Texas 7' executed for the fatal shooting of 29-year-old Aubrey Hawkins, an Irving officer on Christmas Eve in 2000 . Asked to make a final statement, he mumbled: 'I would. That each new indignity defeats only the body. Pampering the spirit with obscure merit. I love you all. That's it.' As the lethal dose of pentobarbital took effect, he closed his eyes, then took a deep breath and began snoring. After about a dozen snores, each a bit quieter, he stopped all movement. He was pronounced dead 11 minutes later, at 6:25 p.m. About two dozen police officers stood at attention outside the Huntsville prison. Several supporters of the slain officer were on motorcycles outside, and as Newbury was taking his final breaths, the roar of them revving their engines could be heard inside the death chamber. 'This isn't about Donald Newbury. This is about justice for Officer Aubrey Hawkins,' Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd said after the execution. 'And what you see from the Irving Police Department is to carry this through to the very end. 'This is just one episode in that chapter. ... That's our commitment to Officer Hawkins.' The punishment was carried out after Newbury lost a last-day appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Officer Aubrey Hawkins was shot 11 times, his bullet-ridden body was then pulled from his squad car and run over with a stolen SUV . His attorneys had argued previous lawyers were deficient and courts did not provide adequate money for a defense expert to illustrate how Newbury's abusive childhood influenced his violent behavior. Evidence showed the gang led by George Rivas, who had been sentenced to 17 life prison terms, overpowered workers on Dec. 13, 2000, at the Connally Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, about 60 miles south of San Antonio. They broke into a prison armory, stole weapons and drove off in a prison truck. Two days later, Rivas and Newbury held up a suburban Houston RadioShack store, taking electronics including police radio scanners. 'Rivas was the leader and would do the talking, and Newbury was one of the guys standing with the gun and threatening everybody,' said Toby Shook, the former Dallas County assistant district attorney who prosecuted both. 'Rivas was using him as his muscle.' The Texas 7 consisted of top row L-R Joseph C. Garcia, Randy Ethan Halprin, Larry Jame Harper and Patrick Henry Murphy, Jr. Bottom row, L-R; Donald Keith Newbury, George Rivas and Michael Anthony Rodriguez . Eleven days after the breakout, Hawkins drove to the sporting goods store to check out a report of suspicious activity. He was shot 11 times, his bullet-ridden body pulled from his squad car and then run over with a stolen SUV. The fugitives fled with $70,000, 44 firearms and ammunition, plus jewelry and wallets from store employees who were closing up for the evening. The gang was apprehended a month later. One of them, Larry Harper, killed himself rather than surrender. When arrested, Newbury had 12 loaded firearms in the Colorado Springs Holiday Inn room he shared with fellow fugitive Joseph Garcia. Rivas was put to death three years ago at age 41. George Rodriguez ordered his appeals dropped and was executed in 2008 at age 45.

"The US-led coalition against Islamic State was under increased pressure last night as the King of Jordan pledged to avenge the brutal murder of one of his pilots. King Abdullah, a strong ally of Washington and London, had personally taken the decision to take part in controversial air strikes in neighbouring Syria that led to First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burned to death. But some Jordanians say they have already paid too high a price to support America’s military operations in the region and have questioned the king’s approach and their role in the coalition. Scroll down for videos . Horrific: Moaz al-Kasasbeh, in a still from the ISIS video, as the flames reach him in a locked cage . Intelligence officials believe the sickening situation has been manipulated by ISIS to put pressure on Jordan and foster opposition to its role in the coalition . It is estimated that some 1,500 Jordanians are already fighting with jihadi groups such as ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and there is concern that long-term participation in the coalition will fuel extremism. Significantly, it emerged yesterday that the United Arab Emirates, one of four Arab nations in the anti-ISIS coalition, had already stopped air strikes and would not resume them until improvements were made to contingency plans to rescue downed pilots. The king promised a ‘relentless’ operation against ISIS in a defiant speech last night in response to the murder of its pilot, whose F-16 fighter crashed in December over the jihadi Syrian headquarters in Raqqa. Speaking on state television, he said: ‘We are waging this war to protect our faith, our values and human principles, and our war for their sake will be relentless and will hit them in their own ground.’ The pilot’s father, Safi al-Kasasbeh, who had previously raised questions about Jordan’s role in the coalition, called for his son to be avenged. ‘I demand the IS organisation be annihilated,’ he said, as the shock and strain of the sheer barbarity of the murder took its toll on the airman’s mother, Issaf, who collapsed and was rushed to hospital after being told details of the death. Mr al-Kasasbeh added: ‘This murderous organisation, made up of militants from all the world countries, is acting in barbaric ways, violating all the international laws, codes of ethics, and prisoners’ conventions. That is why I strongly demand the government to swiftly take revenge for the blood of Moaz and the dignity of our country.’ King Abdullah (pictured with U.S President Barack Obama) had personally taken the decision to take part in controversial air strikes in Syria that led to First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh being burned to death . Sickening: A boy enjoys the video . Islamic State yesterday issued a video showing crowds celebrating the pilot’s murder as they watched it on giant screens set-up across Raqqa. The four-minute video, entitled Muslims’ Joy at Burning of Jordanian Pilot, showed men and children gathering to watch footage of Moaz al-Kasasbeh. As the airman goes up in flames, the crowd can be heard cheering and shouting religious slogans, before they praise the manner of the murder and ISIS. The video is filmed in a documentary style, and among those featured is a young boy who smiles and talks passionately about the killing, as well as other barbaric acts. Fox News has been criticised for featuring the unedited video of al-Kasasbeh’s death on its website. The American news channel, which had not posted the murders of other hostages, was the only media organisation in the US to offer the video in full. Malcolm Nance, an expert on radical extremism, told the Guardian: ‘The whole value of terror is using the media to spread terror. [Fox News] are literally – literally – working for Al Qaeda and ISIS’s media arm.’ Jordan’s response began at dawn yesterday when it executed failed Iraqi female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi, who had been on death row since 2005, and another Al Qaeda-linked terrorist, Ziad al-Karbouly. Four more jihadis are expected to be executed in the coming days. Unprecedented outrage and condemnation swept across the Middle East yesterday at the new levels of depravity reached by ISIS. Even Al Qaeda criticised the manner of al-Kasasbeh’s death, saying it provided ‘conclusive proof of ISIS’s deviance’. Islamic State may have decided to burn First Lieutenant Moaz al-Kasasbeh alive after seeing the idea on Twitter. Fanatics had taken it upon themselves to put forward ideas for methods of execution, writing in Arabic that they were suggesting ways ‘to kill the Jordanian pilot pig’. The discussions began just two days after the 26-year-old was captured in December. The messages were then shared thousands of times by the jihadi group’s web-savvy activists. Some suggested burning al-Kasasbeh alive and running him over with a bulldozer; in the gruesome video of his execution published by IS, the pilot is indeed set on fire in a cage, which is then flattened by a bulldozer. The Twitter campaign appears to have been a reaction to others writing messages with the hashtag ‘#WeAreAllMoaz’, in which well-wishers – including Jordan’s Queen Rania and Crown Prince Hussein – praised the pilot. The timing of the execution suggestions lends support to the theory that al-Kasasbeh was actually killed at the beginning of January. Experts say ISIS’s gruesome video of the murder would have taken some time to edit before its release. However, intelligence officials believe the situation has been manipulated by ISIS to put pressure on Jordan and foster opposition to its role in the coalition. The fact that Jordan had agreed to exchange 26-year-old al-Kasasbeh for al-Rishawi was seen as driving a potential wedge in the coalition because of US opposition to doing deals with terrorists. Security has also been stepped up throughout Jordan as fears of further attacks and suicide bombings grew after IS identified other Jordanian pilots and their family homes on the murder video of al-Kasasbeh, urging its supporters to attack them. A recently retired intelligence officer warned: ‘While the government is trying to create the impression that it is working for Jordan’s interests, people don’t believe it.’ King Abdullah was yesterday greeted by a crowd of several thousand people at Jordan’s main airport as he returned from the United States, with many holding up pictures of the monarch, the pilot and their country’s flag in a show of support. In his televised speech he urged his countrymen to unite. ‘It’s the duty of all of us to stand united and show the real values of Jordanians in the face of these hardships,’ he said. Military planners admit that while the UAE, Jordan, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have all flown missions against ISIS in Syria, they are seen as primarily symbolic amid criticism in the region that it is an American war that does little to force out Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad. Mamdouh al-Ameri, a spokesman for the Jordanian armed forces, yesterday described al-Kasasbeh as a ‘martyr’ and said their ‘revenge will be as huge as the loss of the Jordanians’. Intelligence officials believe they have identified the location in Raqqa, near the Euphrates River, where the pilot, locked inside a cage, was doused in petrol before being set alight.","King Abdullah took decision to join the air strikes which led to pilot's death .

"Education Secretary Nicky Morgan who is said to have secured funding for 54 new free new schools to be announced this month . More than 50 new free schools are expected to be announced this month, paving the way for an unprecedented number of approvals over the coming year. Nicky Morgan is said to have secured funding for 54 new schools despite resistance from the Liberal Democrats and some civil servants. For the Education Secretary, who has been dubbed ‘Ms U-turn’, it would be seen as a commitment to continue the reforms of her predecessor, Michael Gove. Last night, there was speculation up to 150 new free schools could open this year if the Conservatives win in May. Together with the 4,400 academies that have already opted out of local government control, this would represent a significant shift away from traditional state education. Free schools were introduced in 2010 to allow parents and community groups to set up their own schools. They are independent from local authorities but must still undergo Ofsted inspections. The first 24 free schools opened in autumn 2011, with further approvals bringing the total to 331, catering for 175,000 children. Although funding is understood to have been approved by the Treasury for 54 new schools, fewer may appear on the final list. According to the Spectator magazine, schools are not only being allocated to areas with a shortage of places but also on the basis of demand from parents. Free school approvals are announced in waves three times a year. It would mean Mrs Morgan is staying true to the underlying the original notion that parents, not bureaucrats, should decide where schools open. She said in a recent interview: ‘I think when people set up free schools they do it because they are unhappy with the provision in areas, where there’s a need for more places.’ The opening of a new free schools would be seen as a commitment to continue the reforms of her predecessor, Michael Gove, pictured . Mr Gove’s reforms, which aimed to give more power to parents, have been resisted by teachers’ unions who feared it would impact on their members’ conditions. The Liberal Democrats this week issued a 13-page dossier called the ‘Gove Files’, describing how they resisted free schools and other reforms. Since taking over as Education Secretary, Mrs Morgan earned the nick-name ‘Mrs U-Turn’ after taking differing views to her predecessor on grammar schools and pupils punishment. A Department for Education spokesperson said: ‘The next wave of free schools will be announced in due course.’","Nicky Morgan is said to have secured funding for 54 new free schools .

"Dido Harding, chief executive of Talk Talk, pictured, has warned allowing Brussels to clear a £10billion take over of O2 by rival Three could lead to higher bills for mobile phone users . British families face a hike in their phone and internet bills if Brussels bureaucrats wave through a controversial £10billion takeover bid for O2 by rival Three, the boss of one of the UK’s largest mobile firms has warned. A proposed mega-merger between Hong Kong-owned Three and England Rugby sponsors O2 will be ruled on by the European Commission later this year. But TalkTalk chief executive Dido Harding said allowing Brussels to clear the deal would be ‘really dangerous’. She today called for the deal to be scrutinised in the UK amid growing fears it will be lead to rocketing prices for consumers. ‘People are right to be suspicious that the merging of the companies risks prices going up,’ she said in an interview with the Daily Mail. Currently there are four mobile phone companies that own their own network in the UK – Vodafone, O2, EE and Three. All of the other operators, such as TalkTalk or Virgin Mobile, rent their space on the airwaves of other companies. But a merger between O2 and Three would see the number of companies operating a network drop from four to three. Mrs Harding said: ‘In Austria, where four mobile operators went into three, prices went up. People are right to be suspicious about too much consolidation.’ It is not the only takeover currently in the offing. BT is in talks to buy mobile group EE for £12.5billion. That deal will be assessed by regulators in the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority because both companies are registered in Britain. But under EU rules, the deal between O2 and Three must be looked at by Brussels even though ‘there are no European consumers affected by this deal at all,’ according to Harding. The TalkTalk boss said it was ‘really dangerous’ for European regulators to clear the takeover. She added: ‘There’s a risk that you end up with two different authorities looking at the same thing, and I think that’s really dangerous. ‘You can’t have them looked at separately, otherwise you will wake up in ten years’ time, and we won’t have choice and prices really will have gone up, and not by a bit, that they will have gone up very fundamentally.’ O2 is owned by Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica. Three is owned by Hutchison Whampoa, a conglomerate owned by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-Shing, who already owns a large number of UK assets including Felixstowe port and London’s electricity network.","Bills may go up if £10billion take-over bid by rival Three is waved through .

"Members of the Saudi royal family 'knowingly and directly' aided al Qaeda in the run up to the attacks on September 11, lawyers for families of victims of the attack claim in a lawsuit. A brief filed Tuesday refers to sworn statements by Zacarias Moussaoui, often called the 20th hijacker, claiming he met members of the royal family and tracked financial contributions to the extremist group. CNN reports that Moussaoui says bin Laden made him responsible for tracking donations to al Qaeda on a database in the late 1990s. Claim: Sworn statements from Zacarias Moussaoui, often referred to as the 20th hijacker, stated members of the Saudi royal family contributed financially to al Qaeda's attack . Among those he claims to have recorded on the Toshiba computer he used were several members of the Saudi royal family, including former ambassador to the United States Prince Turki al Faisal. Saudi Arabia's embassy in Washington released a statement Wednesday calling Moussaoui's claims as those of a 'deranged criminal' and having no evidence to support them. 'The September 11 attack has been the most intensely investigated crime in history and the findings show no involvement by the Saudi government or Saudi officials,' the statement also said. While there has been some suspicion that the Saudis played a role in the attacks, the report from the 9/11 Commission in 2004 found no evidence of government involvement. The court brief was filed against a motion to dismiss a civil lawsuit brought forward by families of the victims of the September 11 attacks against Saudi Arabia for its alleged role. The statements from Moussaoui, a French national who was sentenced to life in prison in 2006 for a terrorism conspiracy charge, described him participating in the planning stages of the attacks. Accused: Moussaoui claimed he met with Prince Turki al Faisal, who introduced him to other members of the royal family . 'Deranged' allegations: The Saudi embassy vigorously denied the allegations that royal family members, such as Prince Bandar bin Sultan, were involved . 'Shaykh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money ... who is to be listened to or who contribute to - to the jihad,' claimed Moussaoui, who was reportedly chosen due to his education and English speaking ability. He also said that he met on multiple occasions with members of the royal family in Saudi Arabia, passing letters to and from bin Laden. Moussaoui claimed he was taken on private jets and limousines, stayed in hotels and palaces and received expenses for travel from the Saudi embassy in Islamabad. In addition to claiming he tracked donations from Prince Turki al Faisal, Moussaoui says the prince introduced him to other members of the family, including former ambassador  Prince Bandar bin Sultan. The brief filed in court also included statements from former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman and former senators Bob Graham and Bob Kerrey of the 9/11 Commission that more scrutiny of Saudi ties was needed. 'I am convinced that there was a direct line between at least some of the terrorists who carried out the September 11th attacks and the government of Saudi Arabia,' Graham wrote. Yet Moussaoui is far from a reliable witness, giving erratic and conflicting statements during and after his trial. Even bin Laden contradicted Moussaoui's claims that he was going to participate in the attacks, releasing audio after Moussaoui's conviction that denied the French national had a role. 'I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers,' bin Laden says in the recording, 'and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission.'","A brief filed in court cites sworn statements from Zacarias Moussaoui that he tracked donations from members of the royal family .

"Disgraced ex-Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette - who wrote a first hand account of the mission to kill Osama bin Laden - allegedly 'recruited' other fellow SEALs to provide classified information to the makers of popular video game 'Medal of Honor: Warfighter'. Senior Navy officials confirmed today that seven members of the secretive SEAL Team Six, of which Bissonnette was a member, have been disciplined for providing classified information to Electronic Arts. Spending two days as paid consultants for the game-makers, the SEALS were punished for the latest embarrassing leak involving the elite special forces unit  with letters of reprimand and forfeited their pay for two months but will not face jail time. Four other SEALs, all based on the West Coast, are also under investigation for similar alleged violations, one other official said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Privileged information: Some Navy SEALs are in trouble for showing the creators classified documents . Seven members of the secretive Navy SEALs (pictured left) including one involved in the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, have been punished for disclosing classified information to a video game maker (right) According to CBS News, it was the investigation the military launched into Bissonnette's book - published under the pseudonym Mark Owen - that led the authorities to discover that he had allegedly 'recruited' the 11 Navy SEALS into the video game deal. 'As they were looking into his book deal, the money, whether he violated the non-disclosure agreements he signed ... what they ended up learning is that 11 Navy SEALs had been brought in allegedly by Owen into this deal with a video company for the production of Medal of Honor: Warfighter, a Navy SEALs-based video game,' said CBS Senior Correspondent and former assistant director of National Intelligence John Miller. This issue raised the same concerns as Bissonnette's book. 'There was no notification of their commanding officer, no waivers signed...none of the boxes had been checked.' One serious point for U.S. Defense chief's is the possibility that classified information - known as 'Tactics, Techniques and Procedures' or TTPS - can be picked up by Somalia pirates or indeed terrorists just by playing what should be a simple video game. 'What do the warfighters do, what tricks do they use, how do they work?' said Miller. 'I guess if you stretch it there you could say that if you played that video game enough based on real Navy SEALs knowledge, you could learn to counter some of those TTPs.' The worry for Pentagon chiefs is if the 11 SEALs in total divulged information on equipment and tactics that could be used against the elite fighting force . The popular video game boasts that was 'written by actual U.S. Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas.' In fact, according to Miller, the good publicity that came from the succesful bin Laden raid is now backfiring on the elite and secretive unit. 'The special operations community looks on this as too much of a good thing,' said Miller. 'They have run into the Facebook generation - they are used to living out loud, used to talking as individuals. they are used to it being all about me and that's a conflict.' Each of the seven received a punitive letter of reprimand- which generally prevents individuals from being promoted- and a partial forfeiture of pay for two months. The deputy commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Garry Bonelli, issued a statement acknowledging that nonjudicial punishments had been handed out for misconduct, but he did not offer any details. 'We do not tolerate deviations from the policies that govern who we are and what we do as sailors in the United States Navy,' Bonelli said. He alluded to the importance of honoring nondisclosure agreements that SEALs sign. He said the punishments this week 'send a clear message throughout our force that we are and will be held to a high standard of accountability.' Navy SEALs (pictured) have entered into the public consciousness since the legendary Team Six conducted their successful raid on Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in May of 2011 . Secrets: One of the scenarios in the game is based on a real battle with Somali pirates . The two main complaints against the SEALs were that they did not seek the permission of their command to take part in the video game project and that they showed the video designers some of their specially designed combat equipment unique to their unit, said a senior military official. The official was briefed about the case but was not authorized to speak publicly about it. In the actual game promotional materials Electronic Arts claimed that it was 'written by actual U.S. Tier 1 Operators while deployed overseas.' It adds that give 'players a view into globally recognised threats...letting them experience the action as it might have unfolded.' Tier 1 Operator is a military term for units involved in the most sensitive and classified operations. While Pentagon officials refused to discuss the exact nature of the information the SEALs allegedly gave away, the leak is just the latest in a series since the May 2nd 2011 bin Laden raid. Last year the White House itself was involved when the administration was accused of improperly disclosing details of the mission to the New York Times for political gain. Worrying: Several Navy SEALs have been pulled off active duty to deal with the fallout from the controversial book about the killing of Osama bin Laden . And then infamously, this fall, Pentagon officials began an investigation after the publication of 'No Easy Day' which is a first person account of the bin Laden raid by former SEAL Team Six member, Matt Bissonnette. Matt Bissonnette, who participated in . the raid in Abbottabad, Pakistan, but later retired from the SEALs, published his book under the pseudonym Mark Owen, but he landed . in hot water with the Pentagon even before it was published in . September. The Pentagon . accused him of disclosing classified information in violation of the . nondisclosure agreements he had signed as a SEAL. He disputes the . charge.

The SEAL mission to capture or kill Laden, while stunningly successful, encountered a number of unexpected obstacles, including the loss of a stealthy helicopter that was partially blown up by the SEALs after making a hard landing inside bin Laden's compound. The head of Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Sean Pybus, responded to the Bissonnette book by telling his force that 'hawking details about a mission' and selling other information about SEAL training and operations puts the force and their families at risk. SEALs, both active duty and retired, possess highly sensitive information about tactics and techniques that are central to the success of their secret and often dangerous missions overseas. That is why they are obliged to sign nondisclosure agreements when they enter service and when they leave, and it is why the Pentagon seeks to enforce such written agreements. The punishments were first reported by CBS News.

"Entrepreneurial Maccas fans have jumped on the frenzy over Big Mac Special Sauce being bottled and started flogging portion sized tubs of the condiment online.

"Freed Australian journalist Peter Greste will not be giving up his job as a foreign correspondent, despite a warning from his mother Lois that 'we are not going through this again'. Mr Greste was speaking at his first open media conference in Brisbane on Thursday after being freed from an Egyptian jail and deported from the country earlier this week. 'I don't want to give this up, my job up. I'm a correspondent, it's what I do,' he said. 'How I do it, whether I actually do go ahead with it I don't know.' His mother Lois said she had always believed her children should follow their passion. 'At the same time ... he has got to know that we are not going to go through this again.' Scroll down for video . Peter Greste told the media throng that it was 'incredible to here, I have dreamt about this so many times'. 'We are not going to go through this again' warned Peter Greste's mother Lois, as he vowed to return to work as a journalist despite his 400-day ordeal . Mr Greste spent much of his time in jail meditating, starting a masters degree in international relations with Queensland's Griffith University - doing his essays with pencil and paper - and working out with his cell mates . Mr Greste revealed he spent much of his time in jail meditating, starting a masters degree in international relations with Queensland's Griffith University - doing his essays with pencil and paper - and working out with his cell mates . 'I'm probably in better physical condition that I have been for the past 20 years or so,' he admitted. He described their ordeal as being similar to a 'near death experience' and vowed to do all he could to secure aid the release of his colleagues. 'We're going to all that we can to support that,' Mr Greste said. 'These guys are like brothers ... there's a lot that we share.' Mr Greste said he and his colleagues weren't abused while in jail. 'We were treated with respect and dignity as much as can be expected under the circumstances,' he added. The tears of joy flowed freely in Brisbane. Australian journalist Peter Greste and his parents are pictured at the news conference on Thursday. Mr Greste returned to Australia in the early hours of this morning after spending 400 days in a Cairo prison after he was arrested in December 2013 and charged with defaming Egypt and having links with the blacklisted Muslim Brotherhood . Peter Greste faces the Australian media in Brisbane, telling his peers he will return to work as a journalist . The 49-year-old Al Jazeera journalist landed at Brisbane Airport at 12.45am and, with a huge grin, stepped off the plane into the arms of his ecstatic family. He told the media throng that it was 'incredible to here, I have dreamt about this so many times'. Mr Greste paid tribute to his family's unwavering support and said their dignified campaign was the main reason behind his release. 'We were never really sure when it was going to end or how it was going to end.' However, his release was bitter-sweet. Mr Greste continues to advocate for the release of his colleagues Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian national Baher Mohamed. The three men were sentenced to 10 years in jail in 2013, after being accused of helping the Muslim Brotherhood, an outlawed terrorist organisation, due to coverage of the violent crackdown on Islamist protests following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi. Mr Greste insisted he would continue in his chosen profession: 'Far more doors opening up that I have had the chance to look through. I am a correspondent, it's what I do.' He said his colleagues were 'like brothers' and 'I trust they will follow in due course and when they (get out) we will party very hard'. 'Are you guys waiting for someone important?' Greste joked as he address media. 'I cant tell you how ecstatic I am to be here, this is a moment I've rehearsed over and over. Well, I've rehearsed it about 400 times over the last 400 days' Greste was quick to acknowledge his former inmates who remain behind bars, including fellow Al Jazeera staff: 'I will say this a million times, this is tempered with worry for my colleagues and all the other guys imprisoned beside me' He urged Australians to not forget the plight of those fighting for freedom in Egypt. 'This has generated a lot of goodwill in Australia. Egypt has a chance to show justice doesn't depend on nationality' An excited contingent of about 100 loved ones and supporters were waiting for Greste at the airport terminal, filled with relief after a long campaign to bring the reporter home. 'Are you guys waiting for someone important?' Greste joked as he addressed media. 'I can't tell you how ecstatic I am to be here, this is a moment I've rehearsed over and over.

"The leather goods and luxury stationer Smythson has employed Samantha Cameron as a part-time creative consultant since 2010 on a £100,000 salary . The Prime Minister was yesterday left embarrassed after facing questions about the fact the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife is based in a tax haven. It comes after it emerged that Smythson is owned through a holding company in Luxembourg and linked to a secretive trust in Guernsey, another tax haven. The leather goods and luxury stationer, which has a store on New Bond Street that sells £2,000 python-skin handbags, has employed Samantha Cameron as a part-time creative consultant since 2010 on a salary thought to be up to £100,000 a year. At Prime Minister’s Questions, Tom Blenkinsop, Labour MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, asked: ‘Does the Prime Minister know of anyone who owns or works for a UK-registered company that uses a Luxembourg-based holding company in order to avoid paying their fair share of tax in the UK?’ Mr Cameron ignored the implied reference to his wife, saying: ‘We inherited a situation where company after company was leaving our shores. 'Because we have now got competitive tax rates and a business friendly government, more and more businesses are coming here.’ Smythson’s tax arrangements are a major embarrassment for Mr Cameron. Recently he warned that businesses setting up ‘ever-more complex tax arrangements abroad’ should ‘wake up and smell the coffee’ – a jibe aimed at Starbucks, which has paid only small sums of tax in the UK. Smythson is owned and run by secretive Egypt-born Frenchman Jacques Bahbout, who bought the label for £18 million in 2009 through his Italian handbag manufacturer Tivoli Group. Since Bahbout bought the business, the holding company Holdsmyth has paid around £1.06 million in corporation tax. But over the same period, £1 million in dividends paid out may have benefited from the tax status of Guernsey and Luxembourg. Controversy over its tax affairs has been more intense because the company has previously borrowed £2 million under the National Loan Guarantee Scheme, a taxpayer-backed initiative for banks to provide small firms with cheap finance, and it currently has a £5 million credit facility which is classed as ‘state aid’. There is no suggestion that Smythson has done anything illegal. It has declined to comment on its tax status. The firm’s annual accounts filed at Companies House show Holdsmyth is owned by ‘a company incorporated in Luxembourg’ and is ultimately controlled by ‘Ogier Trustee (Jersey) Ltd as trustees of the Barracuda Trust, a trust settled in Guernsey’. Mrs Cameron was creative director of Smythson before taking on the consultancy role. Prime Minister David Cameron was left embarrassed during PMQs after facing questions about the fact the upmarket leather goods firm employing his wife, Smythson, is based in a tax haven .","David Cameron left embarrassed after facing questions about Smythson .

"A British doctor who travelled to Syria to treat wounded children has been murdered by the  country’s security forces just four days before he was due to be released from prison, the Government indicated yesterday. Syrian officials, who have been accused of beating and torturing Dr Abbas Khan during more than a year of captivity, claimed the 32-year-old ‘committed suicide’ by hanging himself with his own pyjamas in the state interrogation centre in Damascus. But Foreign Office minister Hugh Robertson said that the death of the London-born orthopaedic surgeon was ‘at best extremely suspicious’ and it appeared the father-of-two had ‘in effect been murdered’ by the Syrian regime. Last night Mr Robertson said the Government was seeking ‘urgent clarification’ of the circumstances of the death. Humanitarian: Dr Abbas Khan, pictured with his six-year-old son Abdullah, travelled to travelled to Syria to treat wounded children only to die just four days before he was due to be released from prison . The surgeon’s sister, Sara, insisted: ‘He did not commit suicide.’ His relatives described him as a ‘brave’ humanitarian who had been killed by members of President Bashar al-Assad’s  ‘barbaric’ regime. His brother Dr Afroze Khan, 34, said: ‘We are devastated. We had assurances from the Syrian government that he was going to be released by the end of the week, but obviously they have changed their minds. They contacted her and told her he was dead. It is just barbaric, it is medieval.’ Dr Khan travelled to the rebel-held part of the frontline city of Aleppo in November last year to treat civilians at a field hospital, but he was arrested within 48 hours for crossing the border from Turkey without a visa. Loss of life: Dr Abbas Khan, 32, pictured with his son Abdullah, had spent more than a year in jail . During the next eight months the surgeon, from Streatham, South London, claimed he was put in an underground cell in total darkness, tortured and forced to hurt other prisoners. His mother Fatima, 57, from Mitcham, South London, tracked him down to the notorious Far’ Falastin detention centre after travelling alone to Damascus in July, and found her son weighing about five stone and hardly able to walk. She was told he had been accused of treating dying civilians, which has been classed as an act of terrorism. Dr Khan was married with a six year-old son Abdullah and seven year-old daughter Rurayya. A hand and nerve trauma specialist, he was on a six-month sabbatical from Epsom and St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust in South London when he left for Aleppo. In harrowing handwritten letters passed to Foreign Secretary William Hague by his mother, Dr Khan wrote: ‘I have been violently forced to beat other prisoners, kept in squalid conditions, denied access to toilets or medical treatment.’ Taken: Abbas's mother Fatima, pictured with Dr Khan, right, and his brother Afroze, left, in London in 1996, travelled to Syria to find her son, but never saw him freed . Last night Sara Khan, 23, said: ‘My brother wrote two letters to Mr Hague asking him for help. He snuck them out through the prison bars when my mother visited him. ‘He didn’t reply, and he is yet to speak to us about it. He should be ashamed, he should be embarrassed.’ President Assad is said to have personally ordered the release of Dr Khan and observers said the death was an indication of how he has lost control of some aspects of the security forces. More than 1,000 people are believed to have died in the custody of the Syrian security forces since the start of the civil war in March 2011, according to Amnesty. Mr Robertson said: ‘We can’t at the moment be absolutely certain about the circumstances in which Dr Khan met his death, but what is clear is that he met his death while he was in prison in circumstances that are at best extremely suspicious. ‘There is no excuse whatsoever for the treatment that he has suffered by the Syrian authorities who have in effect murdered a British national who was in their country to help people who were injured during their civil war.’","Dr Abbas Khan, from South London, had travelled to Aleppo to volunteer .

"During his summing-up, the judge asked the jury trying Dhanuson Dharmasena, the first British doctor to stand trial for allegedly carrying out female genital mutilation, to consider whether he was simply a scapegoat. By their decision to acquit him, we are entitled to believe that the answer to that question was an emphatic ‘yes’. Indeed, few people – outside the Crown Prosecution Service – who have followed this disturbing case could have been left in much doubt that Dr Dharmasena was the real victim. Scroll down for video . Rite of passage: A girl from the Pakot tribe in Kenya is wrapped in animal skins as she walks to a place of rest after undergoing a ritual circumcision ceremony . The brief facts which put him in the dock are as follows. Back in 2012, Dr Dharmasena was a junior registrar in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Whittington Hospital in north London. One of his patients was a young pregnant woman identified only as AB. AB had indeed been subjected to female circumcision in her native Somalia. To make it possible for the baby to be delivered, Dr Dharmasena had to cut through the stitches made during the barbaric procedure. Afterward, he replaced them to stop the woman, who now lives in Britain, bleeding. However the prosecution claimed she was stitched in such a way that her urethra was obstructed and the ‘vagina entrance’ narrowed. This, they claimed, amounted to FGM. The defence disputed this account. Tellingly, you might think, the notes relating to an examination by an FGM specialist mysteriously went missing. Would it be too cynical to suggest that if those notes had been as potentially incriminating as the prosecution maintained, they would not have disappeared? Either way, many might think that equating what Dr Dharmasena did with the almost medieval savagery involved in female genital mutilation beggars belief. Few people who have followed this disturbing case could have been left in much doubt that Dr Dharmasena (pictured) was the real victim . Nevertheless, those few stitches cost Dr Dharmasena his career and his reputation. He was suspended by the General Medical Council in March following an internal investigation lasting nearly two years. He is still facing the ordeal of a GMC hearing and possible disciplinary action. Dr Dharmasena and his wife, also a doctor, from Ilford, Essex, who were married in 2010, delayed moving home and starting a family of their own because of the cloud of suspicion hanging over him. He has also received death threats. Only when the trial got under way did the shortcomings of the evidence against him become scandalously apparent. The woman herself, now 27, did not make an official complaint against Dr Dharmasena. It was a midwife who was present during surgery who reported him. Nor did the patient give a statement to the police. ‘AB has no complaints against the doctor,’ his barrister Zoe Johnson, reminded the court in her final address to the jury. ‘Do you remember, when giving evidence, she said “he delivered my first baby” with a smile on her face.’ Moreover, Dr Dharmasena was not a Muslim. He is a Sri Lankan Hindu who came to this country when he was a boy. FGM is not practised in Hindu culture. ‘I regard it as an abhorrent practice,’ he told the court. He completed his medical training in 2005. He underwent two years further training before training at the Royal Free in London, arriving at the Whittington in 2012. So why did this case ever come before a jury? Might the real reason have more to do with politics, both inside and outside medicine, than justice, as the judge alluded to in his summing-up. The CPS has been under increasing pressure from campaigners to secure an FGM conviction. The number of women and teenage girls in England and Wales who are victims has increased three-fold to 170,000 over the past decade due to the influx of migrants from countries where the practice is widespread. Only when the trial got under way (pictured) did the shortcomings of the evidence against Dr Dharmasena become scandalously apparent . In the majority of these cases FGM is thought to have taken place abroad, not in Britain, which makes the decision to charge Dr Dharmasena all the more controversial. Indeed, the announcement to charge him, in a blaze of publicity, came just days before Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, appeared before the Commons home affairs committee to explain why there had been no FGM prosecutions in the UK. When committee chairman Keith Vaz expressed his surprise that this prosecution had suddenly occurred almost 30 years after FGM was outlawed, Miss Saunders replied: ‘The fact is we’ve had the evidence that’s been supplied to us that’s enabled us to bring a prosecution, it’s as simple as that.’ Not everyone agreed, then or now. Leading gynaecologist Dr Katrina Erskine accused the CPS of putting politics before the welfare of women. She said she and other obstetricians were ‘up in arms over the decision to prosecute this case, which involved a woman who had already suffered FGM and warned it would distract from the real problem’. 'Scapegoat': Bosses at Whittington Hospital (pictured) were accused of exploiting Dr Dharmasena in order to cover up systemic failings . Indeed, the court heard that the woman at the centre of this story should have been identified as a victim of FGM by medics before she gave birth. This would have meant she was put on a special care ‘pathway’ with midwives who are experienced in dealing with such cases. But this opportunity was missed when she arrived at hospital in labour in November 2012. ‘If AB had followed the FGM pathway he [Dr Dharmasena] would never have been in the situation he found himself,’ his barrister told the court. Dr Dharmasena had ‘absolutely no training’ in this field during his undergraduate studies. Even so, AB had suffered no problems since Dr Dharmasena had treated her and had gone on to have a second child and is now expecting a third. There were other systemic failures at the hospital. No official interpreter was present during AB’s birth – a position Dr Dharmasena should not have been placed in. And, as we have already said, crucial notes reinforcing the prosecution case went missing. ‘These are serious systemic failings, none of which are Dr Dharmasena’s fault,’ his barrister claimed. He had, she said, been ‘hung out to dry.’ Did ‘systemic failings’ within the hospital and mounting pressure to secure an FGM conviction conspire against Dr Dharmasena? It’s is hard to avoid that conclusion. In January last year, a report by a left-wing campaigning journalist Julie Bindel, called An Unpublished Crime, said of 3,032 FGM cases treated by hospitals in the past three years, only 3 per cent were referred to the police and 11 per cent to local authorities. ‘Professionals working in this field,’ the report concluded, ‘believed that a few high-profile criminal actions could act as a deterrent and demonstrate that the state is taking this form of violence against women as seriously as other forms. Nothing would boost the campaign against FGM more powerfully than some convictions. That would send out a message loud and clear that the state is taking the problem seriously.’ The Dharmasena case has had precisely the opposite effect – and almost ruined a good man and widely respected doctor in the process.","Dhanuson Dharmasena, 32, was first British doctor to face trial for FGM .

"A surfer sold his last board to buy a top-of-the-range laptop on eBay  - but was sent a black-and-white photo of one instead. Paul Barrington, 38, thought he had bagged a bargain when he bought the £1,500 Apple MacBook for £300 to set up a wedding DJ business. But all that arrived at his seaside home in Ilfracombe, Devon, a few days later was a 'light as a feather' cardboard box with the printout inside. Cheated: Surfer Paul Barrington, 38, sold his last board to buy an Apple MacBook for £300 from eBay - but all that arrived was a 'light as a feather' cardboard box with a printed black-and-white photo of one inside . Former life: Paul Barrington surfing, a hobby he had to give up after being diagnosed with a lung condition . Mr Barrington was forced to give up surfing - his passion since the age of ten - and his job in childcare after developing the lung condition bullous emphysema, which causes shortness of breath. He hoped to forge a new business as a DJ at wedding receptions, using the computer to arrange his playlists and run his accounts during regular trips to hospital. With the money from his last surfboard, he ordered the MacBook from eBay - but all he received was a small square box. 'I sold my pride and joy for a piece of paper,' he said. 'It's the first time I haven't had a surfboard since I was ten years old, but I need a laptop so I checked the listing and the seller's rating. Pale imitation: The black-and-white photo on an A4 sheet of paper which Mr Barrington bought for £300 . 'He'd been a member for a few years, so there was nothing to be suspicious about. 'I was excited about winning the auction and just thought, ""I've got a laptop so I can start the business"". 'The package was as light as a feather. Why bother sending a picture in a box? It doesn't make any sense. I almost had to laugh. 'The worst thing is, I'm trying to set up a business and this is a massive delay.' eBay insisted similar frauds were rare - but Mr Barrington was not the first victim to receive a piece of paper. A father who bought a 'bargain' XBox One on eBay was shocked to receive a grainy printed photo of one instead. Peter Clatworthy, 19, has the same shock after he spent a year saving up to buy a limited edition XBox One for his son McKenzie's fourth Christmas. The student from Bilborough, Nottinghamshire, was duped in December 2013 by an advert which said 'XBox One Fifa Day One Edition, Photo Brand New UK 2012' - referring only to a sheet of A4 paper. He paid £450 and the auction site seller even wrote 'thank you for your purchase' on the back. But Mr Barrington insisted that unlike in other cases, the auction site listing contained no small print that indicated he may only be buying a picture. Victim: Peter Clatworthy, then 19, also received a piece of paper after buying an XBox one for £450 . An eBay spokesman said: 'I can confirm that this type of incident is very rare and is also covered by eBay Money Back Guarantee. 'We were very sorry to hear about Mr Barrington’s unusual experience.

"As crowd-funding continues to grow in popularity, young people across the world are now using it to fund missionary trips to Australia to answer 'God's calling'. Asking for amounts up to $15,000, these Christians are travelling Down Under on evangelical missions and are requesting people  pledge money on their GoFundMe pages to help them 'spread their message. This comes just a week after a 20-year-old tried to raise money to throw her milestone 21st birthday, but her plight was met with fierce backlash on social media with people suggesting there were much more worth causes. And while charities themselves are embracing crowd-funding as a new way to fundraise, organisations are warning people to be careful where they put their money. Scroll down for video . Increasing numbers of people are using crowd-funding site GoFundMe to raise money so they can embark on evangelical missions . Asking for amounts of up to $15,000 these women say they have been 'called by God' and it's their mission to spread his word . Among a number of GoFundMe pages discovered by Daily Mail Australia, almost half of the owners have aspirations to attend the Hillsong Church in Sydney, where the widely-known establishment was founded. 'Sydney, Australia is home to the world-wide known Hillsong Church. Within the campus of such a powerful movement stands a highly recognized college,' one woman, Illiana Nunez wrote on her fundraising page. 'Hillsong International Leadership College will be my new home come July of this year ... Every dollar counts, and each one will be a blessing. So pray for me, if you will, and see if God may tug on your heart to be a part of this with me,' she also wrote on her page. From Clermont, Florida, the woman raised $3225 of her $5000 target. Many users write on their pages they want to embark on evangelical missions or study at bible colleges . Illiana Nuñez  raised $3225 of her $5000 before she travelled to Australia . But charity organisations have reminded people to take note of where their money is going . Another woman with an ambition to travel to the Hillsong College is Remington Mealey, who has asked for $10,000 to help cover the cost of living in Australia with the church for a year. 'I want to not only be able to learn how to study Gods word, how to apply it to my life but also learn how to lead others in living an encouraging and impactful life based on the word of God. 'Out of all the bible colleges, my heart pounds for Australia,' Remington wrote. She asked for $10,000 to towards the trip, with $3178 of that already donated. However Hillsong told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment on specific cases and do not dictate the way students choose to raise money to attend their college. 'Students come from around the world to attend Hillsong International Leadership College,' Hillsong said in a statement. 'We do not provide advice to students on how to fund their education and have never suggested that students use external websites.' Others who had created fundraising pages online it was their calling to travel to Australia and spread the word of God, saying they had been chosen for evangelical missions. 'I never thought I would be heading into Ministry. It was unfathomable to me that God would want to use me until he made me realize that he IS preparing me ...God, now, is leaving it up to me to choose whether or not I want to take his tutelage or not,' Rayanna Tomlinson posted.

'God has inspired me to reach out and help others and this has been a dream of mine for a very long time, anything helps', Megan Machen wrote on her page. While some of the pages date back a little way, it shows what seems to be an increasing trend where people can ask for funds to support any endeavor they may choose - and people will donate money. Just last month 20-year-old Sydney woman Celestina Ramljak launched a crowd-funding project to keep her dreams of having a 21st birthday party alive. After getting a rude shock when she put a deposit down at a venue, she launched the campaign when she realised she couldn't afford to fund it. But the young woman faced serious backlash on social media as a result of the campaign. Crowd-funding sites like GoFundMe, Indiegogo, Pozible and Kickstarter are just some of many that allow people to raise money in a new way. Despite the pages outlining what each person intends to put the profits towards, there is little more information available after the fact when it comes to using the funds. Ultimately, crowd-funding pages like GoFundMe rely on the honesty and trust of strangers willing to pledge money to unknown people and causes. Despite the pages outlining that each woman will be taking part in mission programs, studies and services, there is little more information available about the individual's intentions when it comes to using the funds . Fundraising Institute Australia's CEO, Rob Edwards said while crowd-funding provided unique opportunities for money to be raised, he asked people to consider where their money was going. 'As with any fundraising channel, we encourage people to think carefully about their donation and where they feel it will have the most impact, Mr Edwards told Daily Mail Australia. 'Do your research - look for information about the crowd-funding organisation's mission, programs and goals. Do these match your donation preferences? Review what the crowd funding organisation has done (its output), what has it achieved (its outcomes) and what difference has it made (its impact),' he advised. Mr Edwards also urged people not to be deterred and reminded them of the good they're doing by donating to causes. 'Charities rely on the trust of the Australian community to be able to operate and would cease to exist without it, so you can feel confident your donation is going to do good.' he said.","People are using crowd-funding sites to raise money for missions .

"Millions of us know the feeling: we check into Facebook to see what our friends are doing, only to feel a pang of envy at someone's great new job, another person's happy relationship or our former classmate's big new house. But this seemingly harmless habit doesn't just make us grumpy at that moment: it could be damaging our health. Researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia have found that the social network can lead to depression, especially amongst those who use Facebook to size other people's lives up against their own. Scroll down for video . Researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia found those who use Facebook to compare themselves against the accomplishments of others can end up feeling depressed . Their study of 700 students found that the website can be 'a very positive resource' if it is used as a way of chatting to friends, but that it can become seriously troubling if used in 'surveillance' mode. 'If it is used as a way to size up one's own accomplishments against others, it can have a negative effect,' said Professor Margaret Duffy, one of the professors who co-authored the research. 'If Facebook is used to see how well an acquaintance is doing financially or how happy an old friend is in his relationship - things that cause envy among users - use of the site can lead to feelings of depression. But report co-author Professor Margaret Duffy (pictured) says people can gird themselves against depression by realising people on social networks show their lives through a rose-tinted gloss . 'It is important for Facebook users to be aware of these risks so they can avoid this kind of behaviour when using Facebook.' Facebook members were particularly stressed when their friends posted pictures of luxurious holidays, or used the social network to boast about new houses or expensive cars, the study found. However, Professor Duffy said  Facebook users could help gird themselves against depression by remembering that many of their 'friends' on the social network are putting a rose-tinted gloss over their lives when they post there. 'Users should be self-aware that positive self-presentation is an important motivation in using social media, so it is to be expected that many users would only post positive things about themselves. This self-awareness, hopefully, can lessen feelings of envy,' she said. She also noted that the social network could be a 'fun and healthy activity' that has a 'positive effect' on users' well-being if they use it to stay connected with family and old friends. Last year, Facebook faced a storm of protests after the website conducted a secret experiment, filtering out positive content from some people's so-called news feeds – the constant flow of links, videos, pictures and comments by friends. People who saw less positive content were more likely to post negative content themselves, suggesting that they were unhappy, the study found. The research was conducted by the University of Cornell and the University of California, but was overshadowed by a storm of controversy after people objected to having their newsfeeds manipulated.","Study of 700 people finds the social network can lead to depression .

"A new study has examined Americans' stress levels and the causes behind them - with money taking the top spot. The results were published in 'Stress in America: Paying with Our Health' by the American Psychological Association (APA) and released on Wednesday. To gather information, Harris Poll spoke with 3,068 American adults in August 2014. Americans' were most stressed by money, followed by work, family duties, and health issues, according to the data. The report said that the average stress level is lower than what was reported in first 'Stress in America' study published in 2007 - and now stands at 4.9 out of a possible 10 points. Issues: A new study has found that money is main cause of stress for Americans (file photo) Concerns: Work, family, and health issues trailed money as the issues that most stress out Americans . Gap: Lower-income households had a stress level of 5.2 - while higher-income households had a lower stress level at 4.2. Ten was the highest possible level in the study . According to the study, 'But it seems that parents, younger generations and those living in lower-income households (making less than $50,000 per year) have a different experience — they report higher levels of stress than Americans overall, especially when it comes to money, and those who have particularly high stress about money are more likely to say they engage in unhealthy behaviors to manage their stress. 'Women, who consistently report high levels of overall stress and unhealthy behaviors to manage stress, also report high levels of stress about money. What’s more, the gap between the percentage of those who appear to be doing well when it comes to managing their stress and the percentage of those who are not is growing.' The study found 72 percent of adults said money stressed them out sometimes, and that 26 percent of adults said they were stressed most or all the time due to money. What's more, 'Nearly 1 in 5 Americans say that they have either considered skipping or skipped going to the doctor in the past year when they needed health care because of financial concerns,' the report said. Needing a break: Millenials had the highest generational stress level, followed closely by Gen Xers . Gender gap: Women also said they felt more stress than men in the study . Habits: Pollsters found that parents had a higher chance of reporting they certain behaviors exhibiting than childless individuals . Wiped out: Millenials feeling a greater amount of financial stress were much more likely than peers with low money stress to browse online . 36 percent of lower-income household adults said money stressed them most or all the time - while just 18 percent of higher-income household adults did so, the study found. Out of 10 points possible, parents, millenials and Gen Xers also reported high levels of overall stress, with levels of 5.7, 5.5 and 5.4, respectively. When it came to money, parents had a 5.8 stress level, millenials had 5.4, and Gen Xers had 5.5. Non-parents, however, had a 4.4 stress level for money. Overall Americans had a 4.7 money stress level. Breaking down money stress by gender, woman had a 5.0 level and men had 4.3. 30 percent of women said money stresses them out all or most the time. 21 percent of men said the same. The report also discussed the role of finding emotional support for talking about money. It stated 'One in five Americans (21 percent) say they have no one to rely on for emotional support. A similar percentage of Americans (18 percent) say money is a taboo subject in their family and more than one-third (36 percent) say that talking about money makes them uncomfortable.' For the report's full findings, you can visit the APA's website. Choices: Women with higher financial stress also had higher participation rates in certain leisure activities . Decisions: Low-income Americans who said they felt extreme financial stress also had high participation in leisure activities as a way of coping .

"Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Letroy Guion was arrested with more than a half-pound of marijuana, a handgun and $190,000 in cash Tuesday night, police say. The 27-year-old defensive lineman is facing felony marijuana possession and  possession of a firearm charges after being stopped in his hometown of Starke, Florida, with two gallon bags of weed. The Green Bay Press Gazette reports that around 11 p.m., an officer pulled Guion over after noticing him unable to maintain a single lane. Flush: Cops say they smelled a 'strong odor' of marijuana from Guion's truck, where they also found more than a half-pound of marijuana and nearly $200,000 in cash . When the officer approached the 2015 Dodge Ram pickup, he states he smelled a 'strong odor' of marijuana. Guion was already partially hanging out of the truck window and reportedly asked the officer if he knew who he was, according to the police report. The lineman let officers know he was in possession of a firearm, a 9mm semi-automatic that was registered to his name, police say. When officers kept searching the car, Guion became 'extremely uncooperative and hostile,' the report says, and 'kept coming near the truck several times saying, ""Hey, man, my money is in there.""' After Guion 'rushed' to the passenger door and tried to remove a black backpack from the seat, officers handcuffed him, the report states. Inside the backpack, officers found two gallon-sized plastic bags filled with marijuana that weighed 357 grams in total along with $190,028.81, according to the police report. Haul: Police seized the cash, which they say was in the backpack with the two gallon bags of marijuana, along with a semi-automatic firearm . Long-term: Guion had just finished his first season with the Packers after five years with the Minnesota Vikings, and though he began contract talks about a deal in Green Bay, these have likely been suspended . The money was seized as well, since it was in the backpack along with the marijuana, the report says. Florida state law declares that possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. It is also a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to carry a concealed firearm without a license. Guion just finished his first season with the Packers, where he had 32 tackles and 3.5 sacks after spending five seasons with the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers were reportedly in talks with Guion about the possibility of inking a long-term deal with the defensive lineman, which are likely now suspended, ESPN reports.

"She's the other gorgeous daughter of My Kitchen Rules' Texan cowboy Robert Murphy and 21-year-old Mareesha is studying to follow in her Dad's footsteps as a visual artist. She is just two years younger than sister Lynzey, who triumphed in the kitchen with their Dad on the Wednesday night cook-off at the Murphy family's Blue mountains home at Hazelbrook, west of Sydney. But Mareesha Murphy has the same glossy long brown locks and stunning looks as her sister, as well as the drive and determination to succeed in her chosen field. Scroll down for video . The other daughter: Mareesha Murphy, 21 (pictured) is the other gorgeous daughter of My Kitchen Rules' Texas cowboy Robert Murphy. Two years younger than sister Lynzey, who with dad Robert scored a '10' for their Texan inspired entree on MKR, Mareesha is studying art . Blessed: MKR Chef and former Texan horse wrangler Robert Murphy (pictured, centre) says he he's 'blessed' by a wife, Desley and by his 'great kids', from left, fellow MKR chef  Lynzey, 23, Louis, 19, Matt, 23, and Mareesha, 21 . Determined: Mareesha Murphy (pictured) is also a pretty good cook, but while her dad and sister Lynzey compete on My Kitchen Rules, she is working as a tourist guide and studying to became a visual arts teacher . She is studying visual arts, just like father Robert, who behind the laconic cowboy image portrayed on MKR is actually the holder of four university degrees. Both Murphy girls, who have two brothers, Lynzey's twin, schoolteacher Mathew and 19-year-old aspiring police officer Louis, have inherited their looks from their mother Desley. Robert Murphy met his wife, a brunette beauty in her early 50s who hails from Toongabbie in western Sydney, while she was backpacking in Canada almost 30 years ago. She has so far requested to stay out of the media hype for MKR. Artistic: Mareesha Murphy is studying visual arts and may become a teacher just like Robert, who taught for more than two decades at the Bethel Christian School in Mount Druitt in Sydney's western suburbs . Show time: Robert Murphy, 61, and his daughter Lynzey, 23,  in their home kitchen during the filming of the MKR episode. The pair cooked a winning Texan-themed meal of quail, peppered beef, corn on the cob and bourbon-flavoured bread pudding . Cooking for friends: At home Robert Murphy (pictured in his Blue Mountains kitchen) likes to slow cook meals such as rib eye steaks, which he says is impossible to do under the time pressure of  My Kitchen Rules . Iconic spot: Mareesha Murphy works at the scenic railway in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, where tourists flock to take the steepest rail rise in the world or travel in the cable car (pictured) across the famous bushland . Lone Star welcome: Robert Murphy outside the front door of his Blue Mountains home, west of Sydney, where he and wife, both school teachers, raised four children including Robert's MKR team chef, daughter Lynzey . Desley Murphy is a primary school teacher who teaches at a school not far from Hazelbrook. The couple were married in 1990 and Desley gave birth to twins Lynzey and Mathew in Texas. The family returned home to Australia, where Mareesha and Louis were born, although all four children have dual US and Australian citizenship. Robert is an accomplished artist and his paintings adorn the walls of the Hazelbrook house, among the more obvious items which relate to his career as a cowboy and outdoorsman working with his late father, Glyn Ed Murphy, a well known Texan horseman and former US Army Air Corps officer in WWII. Like father: Robert Murphy (pictured with his father, Glyn Ed Murphy) grew up in Breckenridge, Texas where father and son worked as cowboys, hunting guides and horse trainers. Murphy Snr, a former US Army Air Corps officer, was known in Texas as a man who could train any horse for any thing . Cracking the whip: He no longer rides the Texan ranges roping cattle for a living, but Robert Murphy still practises at his family home (pictured) west of Sydney . The fitness and athleticism that went with Robert's jobs as a hunting and fishing guide and rounding up and training horses has been passed down to his children, and in particular his daughters. MKR contestant Lynzey, 23, is a personal trainer and fitness addict when she is not creating dishes in the kitchen. She is formerly a state championship netball player and all round good athlete. Younger sister Mareesha is no slouch, her father revealed, having also played on the school netball team and competed in the high jump as a teenager. Now Mareesha, who has worked in a western Sydney cafe to fund her studies and now works as a guide at the Blue mountains Scenic Railway, is studying to become a visual arts teacher. She lives at the family home in a tranquil street in the Blue Mountains, surrounded by bushland. But like her father, she also has skills in the kitchen. 'Lynzey loves cooking, but Mareesah is really good. Louis is pretty good and Matt, well he can make a steak and he can probably cook an egg.' Robert, a regular at his nearby Baptist church, says God has blessed him with 'great kids, a great wife, great family and a great country (Australia)'.","MKR's Texan Robert Murphy has a second gorgeous daughter, Mareesha .

"The Billion Dollar Fight – no, not a movie, the actual promotion – will come closer to reality if Manny Pacquiao wins in Macau on Saturday night. Say it slowly: One. Billion. Dollars. That is the mind-blowing value now being placed upon the boxing match the world has long been desperate to see. Pacquiao versus Floyd Mayweather can become the single richest event in sporting history and the enormity of the prize will surely be enough to break down the barriers which have prevented it from taking place thus far. Manny Pacquiao fights American Chris Algieri in Macau on Saturday night . This bonanza is being made possible by the prospect of the first pay-per-view fight broadcast in China. Promoter Bob Arum is predicting a subscription television audience in the People’s Republic in excess of 100 million. That would generate double the $300million which is being projected as the US pay-TV value of the Fight of the Century. Yet the key to unlocking this treasure chest is not in the hands of the PacMan or the man who calls himself Money. Arum is priming this enormous market by taking Pacquiao to Macau – the Portuguese version of Hong Kong - to headline promotions which also showcase Chinese boxing hero Zou Shiming. Pacquiao could be set for a mega-fight with Floyd Mayweather if he comes through the fight with Algieri . Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum also promotes Chinese star Zou Shiming (left) This 33-year-old has acquired iconic celebrity status in China by winning Olympic gold at home in Beijing in 2008 and retaining his title at London 2012. After starting his professional career with five straight wins Shiming is closing in on a challenge for the world flyweight title, for which his Saturday bout at the Cotai Arena is being billed as a final eliminator. Arum says: ‘Shiming is the driving force for taking pay-per-view into China. They idolise him and hundreds of millions have been watching him on regular television. Combine his appeal with Pacquiao-Mayweather and we are looking at numbers undreamed of before.’ Arum knows he will have to modify pay-per-view charges for the Chinese mainland. ‘We’re looking at $5 a buy,’ he says. Mayweather poses with bundles of cash (right) - but could be set to earn even more if he fights Pacquiao . Cheap, compared with the near $100 which will be the price in America. But multiply five dollars by one-tenth of the Chinese population of 1.36 billion and the figures amount to a phenomenal $650m. A one per cent figure is the rule of thumb for the US (population 319 million) on Showtime or HBO – or both sharing as they did for Mike Tyson vs Lennox Lewis. At $95 a buy - and a pay-TV record there in excess of three million viewers – and you exceed the $300m target. Then comes the site fee from the host arena. Macau is now the Las Vegas of the East, with all the major casinos on the Strip now operating  and the high rollers from China helping push revenue above Nevada levels. The Venetian Macao is hosting its second PacMan fight so expect a bidding war between the two giant gaming destinations, with the MGM Grand Garden – Mayweather’s preferred home-town venue - pitching for Vegas. The Venetian Macao in China is hosting Pacquiao's fight with Algieri and would be keen on the Mayweather fight as well - should it ever materialise . Mayweather likes fighting at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas and they could also bid for the mega-fight . TV rights for the rest of the world – including subscription sales in Britain – plus closed circuit cinema, the live gate and sponsorship, advertising and merchandising make up the rest of the billion dollar spectacular. Arum has been building this project since being approached to promote in Macau. He says: ‘The massive enthusiasm for Shiming played into our long-term plan for boxing in mainland China.’ Broadcasts of a weekly boxing magazine show on Chinese TV and first promotions in Shanghai have helped pave the way. Support for boxing there – where once it was banned – is reported to be forthcoming from the man now considered by many to be the most powerful Chinese leader since Chairman Mao, president Xi Jinping. A fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao would be one of the most anticipated in boxing history . Not that it is essential for the record-breaking event to take place out here. Pacquiao will enter the ring for his world title defence against New York’s Chris Algieri at midday on Sunday, Macau time, . That will be 11pm Saturday night in New York, 8pm in Los Angeles. ‘That would be the same time if took place in Vegas,’ says Arum. ‘So it works perfectly wherever it happens. In China they like getting up on the morning and switching on as they are having breakfast.’ Pacquiao is happy either way. The Philippines congressman says: ‘I love fighting in Vegas but when I box in Macau it feels like a home game. This is only a 90-minute flight from Manila and we’re expecting at least 5,000 of my fans who can’t always afford the cost of travelling all the way to America. 'And the love of boxing among hundreds of millions of Chinese is exciting for the sport. Boxing owes a great debt to Shiming for opening up his homeland.’ Pacquiao beat Timothy Bradley on points in his last fight, which was held in Las Vegas . Mayweather beat Marcos Maidana in their re-match in Las Vegas earlier this year . The PacMan has also boxed twice in front of 50,000-plus crowds in the high-tech Dallas Cowboys stadium in Texas, which is like to be another bidder for the Mayweather fight. Both men are expected to be in action twice next year, in May and September. This weekend Pacquiao finds himself fighting for a billion more reasons than his WBO welterweight title. His purse here is believed to be a minimum of $25m. He and Mayweather would be looking to split at least $250m from The Billion Dollar Fight. Since he has already acceded to Mayweather’s several demands – including a 60 per cent majority of their earnings – he would thus bank not less than $100m, with Floyd Jnr getting a minimum $150m. The PacMan is a heavy favourite to beat Algieri. Assuming he does, the reluctant Mayweather can expect to receive an offer which no man who goes by the name Money can conceivably refuse.

"A teen girl was sentenced to four years in prison on Wednesday for maiming a classmate with hot oil in a fight sparked by a social media feud. Myzell Armstrong, now 19, cried and pleaded for mercy in Cobb County, Georgia court but the judge ultimately decided on prison time and 20 years of probation due to the premeditated nature of the cruel attack. The fight, which happened exactly two years ago on Wednesday, was started in a row over comments exchanged between two groups of girls on Instagram who then decide to meet up in person to settle the dispute. Scroll down for video . Prison bound: Myzell Armstrong, 19, was sentenced to four years in prison and 20 years of probation in court on Wednesday after she was convicted of throwing hot oil in a fight two years ago . Armstrong and her two cohorts allegedly decided to bring hot oil to fight, and boiled a pot of the substance before meeting the other trio in a parking lot of a Smyrna apartment complex. Armstrong held open the enemy's car door while her friend, Zawadi Clark, threw the hot oil - maiming one girl so bad that she needed to get skin grafs for the second-degree burns that will leave her with a lifetime of scars. 'I couldn't scream I was just in shock like I didn't believe it was happening,' victim Ashley Hardy told WSBTV. Social media row: Armstrong and two friends met a trio of other girls in a row started on social media. She held open the door of their enemies' car while friend Zawadi Clark (right) threw the oil - injuring Ashley Hardy (left) Maimed: Hardy suffered second-degree burns in the accident and needed skin grafts to heal the wound, which will leave a lifetime of scars . Mercy: Armstrong's mother Loraine also cried in court on Wednesday, as she begged the judge for a lighter sentence for her 'gullible' daughter . But Armstong and her mother tried to convince a judge that she was sorry for the attack during the sentencing hearing, blaming her friends for leading her down the wrong track. 'Again I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,' Armstrong said. 'I just want to say forgive me forgive me for being friends with girls I thought were my friends.' Her mother, Loraine Armstrong, said her 'gullible' daughter had been taken advantage of by the two other girls involved in the oil attack. Armstrong was the only one of the three girls to go to trial. Clark, the girl who actually tossed the oil, struck a plea deal for a lesser sentence. However, the judge did not buy Armstrong's show of emotion and remarked that the sentencing hearing was the only time he had seen her show remorse for her crime. Explaining his decision, the judge said that he felt prison time was appropriate punishment for the crime, since it wasn't committed in a frenzy. The three girls thought up the idea to use oil, and had to wait for the liquid to boil before bringing it out and following through with the attack. 'That's universally though of being the most horrific kind of injuries you can inflict on somebody,' the judge said.","Myzell Armstrong, now 19, found guilty on all counts in fight that happened two years ago on Wednesday .

"A French comedian who joked about the Charlie Hebdo massacres told a court yesterday he 'condemned the attacks without reservation'. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, 48, was in the dock at the Palais de Justice in central Paris charged with inciting terrorism, as prosecutors called for a fine equivalent to £22,000. But the controversial entertainer denied any wrongdoing and said the case exposed the hypocrisy of a country which 'pretends' to be a bastion of free speech. Comedian: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala appeared to sympathise with terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four people at a kosher supermarket in Paris last month and also murdered a policewoman . Staff working for the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo were targeted for publishing insulting cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and for insulting Muslims generally. 'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) has since become the French government-backed rallying cry for those who support the magazine, but Dieudonne says this displays double-standards. In a Facebook post last month, he appeared to sympathise with terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four  people at a kosher supermarket in Paris and also murdered a policewoman. Dieudonne, who has convictions for anti-Semitism, said his humour was no different to Charlie Hebdo's. He wrote: 'Tonight, as far as I'm concerned, I feel like Charlie Coulibaly.' Defence: Dieudonne M'bala M'bala's barrister Sanjay Mirabeau . The comedian told the court yesterday that he 'condemned the attacks without reservation and without any ambiguity'. His defence barrister, Sanjay Mirabeau said Dieudonne's arrest in January was disproportionate, yet it was followed by police questioning more than 70 others for similar alleged crimes. Mr Mirabeau said the case against his client should be thrown out 'because it is the job of humourists to make people laugh'. President Francois Hollande's government ordered a major clampdown on hate speech following the terrorist attacks, which left a total of 20 people dead, including Coulibaly and two other terrorists. Dieudonne drew international attention last year when football star Nicolas Anelka celebrated an English Premiership goal with a salute popularised by the comic which critics said was anti-Semitic. Called a 'quenelle', it has been described as a reverse Nazi salute, and was used by Anelka while he was playing for West Bromwich Albion. Al Qaeda in Yemen claimed responsibility for the Paris attacks, but intelligence officials believe the terror group provided inspiration, rather than any logistical or financial support. Since the attacks, France has deployed 10,000 troops and 120,000 security forces to protect sensitive sites, including synagogues, mosques and travel hubs. Judges today began deliberating on their verdict on the Dieudonne case and it will be handed down at a later date.

The Fugro Discovery is fiercely lashed by waves in the remote area of the southern Indian Ocean . The JACC has announced the vessels are unable to deploy or retrieve the AUV equipment under the severe conditions . 'The effects of tropical cyclone Eunice and ex-tropical cyclone Diamondra resulted in search vessels leaving the search area on 1 February,' JACC said in the operational search update. 'Under these conditions the vessels are unable to deploy or retrieve the towfish or AUV equipment due to the safety risks to the crew as well as the risk of damage to the equipment in the rough weather.' Waves of up to 12 meters were predicted in the search area.

"Bristling with a fearsome armoury of weapons, this is the latest scourge of Britain's enemies. The £26million Wildcat combat helicopter, unveiled today, will be deployed to crush Taliban fighters, pirates, drug-smugglers and terrorists. The state-of-the-art multi-role chopper - so powerful it can blow a submarine out of the water - will play a vital role in military operations for the Army and Royal Navy from 2014. The sophisticated aircraft's primary task will be to protect soldiers on the battlefield and the Royal Navy's fleet around the world. The £26m Wildcat combat helicopter, unveiled today, will be deployed to crush Taliban fighters, pirates, drug-smugglers and terrorists . The fuselage is protected with a composite material similar to that used for soldiers' body armour so it is difficult to pierce by enemies firing weapons from the ground . The new military hardware was displayed for the first time for Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (seen in the chopper) at the Farnborough International Air Show in Hampshire this morning . The craft has been designed to carry out a raft of other missions including cargo transport, casualty evacuation, troop carrying, surveillance, and search and rescue . But it is designed to carry out a raft of other missions including cargo transport, casualty evacuation, troop carrying, surveillance, and search and rescue. It was being displayed for the first time for Defence Secretary Philip Hammond at the Farnborough International Air Show this morning. He was joined at the display by the head of the Army General Sir Peter Wall and Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the First Sea Lord. Mr Hammond said: 'This new fleet of Wildcat helicopters will provide a fantastic capability for our Armed Forces - on land and at sea.' Cost: £25.8millionEngines: Two CTS800-4N turboshaft engines developed by Rolls-Royce and HoneywellPower: 1,800 bhp eachCrew: TwoPassengers: Up to sevenMaximum take-off weight: 13,228lbRange: 600milesSpeed: 181mph . He added: 'Wildcat represents a considerable advance over the current Lynx helicopters, bringing greatly improved performance and capability. 'The contract to provide training and support will keep them flying wherever they are needed. 'These helicopters will be a key part of the future equipment programme for the Armed Forces that will see £160billion spent over the next ten years. 'By balancing the budget, we can deliver the airframes and the millions of pounds of support they require.' Wildcat will replace the current trusted Lynx fleet, which has served the Fleet Air Arm loyally since the mid-70s. It has more powerful engines so it operates well in extreme 'high and hot' conditions such as in Afghanistan, where the air is thinner and dustier. The fuselage is protected with a composite material similar to that used for soldiers' body armour so it is difficult to pierce by enemies firing weapons from the ground. The Wildcat can carry forward-firing rockets, machine guns, door-mounted mounted machine guns, an air-to-surface system and can deploy torpedoes and depth charges. The twin-engine helicopter is also kitted out with state-of-the-art radar to search for enemy ships and vehicles, penetrating sonar to hunt for subs and electronic surveillance measures such as 360-degree infrared imaging cameras. Manned by two crew members and . carrying up to seven passengers, the helicopter is also able to fend off . missile attacks with a sophisticated self-defence suite.

The Wildcat can carry forward-firing rockets, machine guns, door-mounted mounted machine guns, an air-to-surface system and can deploy torpedoes and depth charges . The glass cockpit will allow the pilots to read information from computer screens rather than old dials and instruments. General Sir Peter Wall said: 'This is . an excellent helicopter, which is very important to the Army Air Corps. We will be seeking to get it fully operational as soon as possible.' The full £1.6billion order includes 62 . new helicopters: 34 Army Wildcat from 2014 and 28 Royal Navy Wildcat . from 2015, which will fly from the decks of frigates and destroyers. Sir Mark Stanhope said: 'Wildcat represents the latest generation of multi-role helicopter that has been specifically procured to operate from ships of the Royal Navy. 'With state-of-the-art sensors, equipment and weapons, it will be an outstanding asset that will maintain Royal Naval units at the cutting edge of worldwide maritime operations.' Mr Hammond also confirmed that the helicopter's Somerset-based manufacturer AgustaWestland will benefit from a £250million Wildcat support contract, sustaining 500 jobs. The name Wildcat recalls the name given to the Grumman F4F which was widely used during the Second World War. The aircraft ceased operational service in 1945 but some remain flying, including one in the collection of the Imperial War Museum Duxford.

"Millions of commuters faced chaotic scenes getting to work this morning - with more than half of London buses not running because of strike action. Passengers were hit with significant disruption and delays amid snowy conditions after a walkout by members of the Unite union over pay differences between the capital's 18 bus companies. Transport for London (TfL), which said about 47 per cent of routes were running, called the strike 'totally unnecessary' and pointed out that only 16 per cent of drivers voted for action. The vast majority of routes are affected in some way, with only around 40 across the capital running as normal, meaning that the Tube and train network in the capital had to cope with millions of extra journeys. Scroll down for video . Commuters faced chaotic scenes getting to work this morning due to a bus strike, pictured is the packed Victoria underground station . More than half of London buses have stopped running today, pictured are commuters queuing to get onto a bus outside Vauxhall bus station . Hundreds of passengers took to Twitter to express frustration at the strike's timing. Pictured are commuters cramming into Victoria station . Hundreds of passengers took to Twitter to express frustration at the timing of the strike as snow fell during the disrupted morning commute. Mike Weston, TfL's director of buses, said: 'I am very sorry that the leadership of Unite is intent on disrupting the journeys of London's 6.5 million daily bus passengers, especially given that only 16 per cent of bus drivers voted for strike action. 'Bus driver rates of pay have been negotiated and agreed between Unite and the bus companies individually under a long-standing and jointly agreed process. This has regularly resulted in pay rises above the rate of inflation. 'As in all professions, bus drivers have different levels of experience and it is only right that this can be reflected in pay. A 'levelling up' of pay to the highest rates would result in higher fares and cuts to bus services for passengers and fewer jobs for bus drivers. Thousands of passengers take to the underground during the bus strike which was causing major congestion at Victoria Station . Commuters queue outside Vauxhall bus station as millions of passengers in London faced disruption because of a strike by bus drivers . Passengers try to board a limited bus service at Victoria Station in London, as more than half of bus were not running due to strikes . 'Today's strike is likely to mean significant disruption to bus services and I urge customers to please check our website for the latest news. We are getting up-to-date information to customers as quickly as possible to ensure that they can continue to get around the city.' Unite is seeking a single pay and conditions agreement across all the capital's 18 bus companies, saying wage rates vary by up to £3 an hour. The union said the pay system was in 'chaos' and had to be changed as wages can vary from  £9.30 to £12.34 an hour depending on the company. Unite regional officer Wayne King said: 'TfL is being wildly optimistic with its claims of the number of buses running today. Once again we've seen solid support by bus workers determined to end the pay chaos on London's buses. 'Today's disruption is regrettable, but the blame lies squarely with London's 18 bus companies who have continued to refuse to talk collectively over the last two years. 'To suggest such talks would be illegal is misleading. Are they saying that collective arrangements covering the construction industry or the police are illegal? 'All we are asking for is a collective forum to discuss how we can end pay disparities over a sensible timeframe. 'The bus companies need to stop hiding behind the coat tails of TfL and start talking collectively about how we end pay inequality and achieve a fair deal for the men and women who keep London on the move seven days a week, 24 hours a day.' Picket lines were mounted outside bus depots across the capital and there are further strikes planned for later in the mont . This comes after a bus strike on January 13 over the alleged 'continued refusal by London's 18 bus operators' to enter into talks about workers' pay, terms and conditions which saw two-thirds of buses in London not running. Bus company Tower Transit said the union wanted them to 'act as a cartel', which they legally could not. TfL warned there would be disruption to bus services across London and to night bus services operating into Friday morning. David Grunwald tweeted saying: 'Blizzard outside. Bus strike. Commute-tastic.' Tracy Ismail said: 'Bus strike and now it's snowing, could it get any worse?' DJ Lauren Laverne said: 'Totally forgot about the Bus Strike. Was standing in the snow at the bus stop like Michael Gambon in Fortitude, except an idiot.' Jess Green, 27, a travel consultant, from Brixton, who was travelling to London Bridge, told the Evening Standard: 'I've been waiting for 20 minutes to get a bus in the cold and it's trying to snow. It's going to make me half an hour late so feeling pretty miserable at the moment.'

Commuters walk past empty bus lanes at Victoria Station in London. TfL warned there would be disruption to bus services across London and to night bus services operating into Friday morning . Andrew Cullum, 55, a lawyer, from Brixton, who was on his way to Monument, said: 'I'm absolutely frozen. I'll have to take the Tube - God help me - which I loathe. 'I am not impressed at all by their reasons for striking. When people join a job they know what they're getting into and the pay rates, so I don't have too much sympathy for them really I'm afraid.' The bus strike caused havoc on the roads this morning with 2,510 separate congestion hotspots recorded at 8.45. Across the Greater London area there were 1,511 miles of tailbacks according to TomTom Traffic. Traffic delays this morning were even worse than during the previous bus strike on 13 January with the worst congestion on the A124 from Barking and Dagenham towards Newham. Paul Gillespie from the London Bus Drivers' Association  explained the issues facing drivers on  BBC Radio London, saying: 'The problem is that you can have 20 years' experience and have to move to another garage, for personal reasons or whatever, and have to go onto a starter rate. That's our biggest bugbear. 'That's just wrong because you are all out there doing the same job.' He said all drivers used to do a six-month probation period and then move on to the top rate of pay after a year. 'But most companies now operate a five-year starter rate and one company is looking at introducing a 10-year starter rate which is pretty draconian,' he said. 6 10 13 14 15 18 27 28 29 33 36 51 53 54 55 56 57 59 60 62 63 64 65 67 6872 79 83 92 94 95 96 99 . 101 103 114 122 124 129 131 135 144 145 146 148 149 153 155 164 165 166 169 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 183 184 187 191 192 193 194 195 197 199 . 200 202 205 212 213 215 219 221 224 226 227 228 229 231 242 243 245 246 247 251 252 256 259 260 267 272 273 275 279 283 286 287 291 292 294 296 . 312 314 317 318 321 323 324 327 328 329 341 345 347 349 353 354 355 356 357 359 365 366 371 372 376 377 380 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 391 396 398 399 . 401 412 415 417 419 423 424 427 430 432 434 440 444 462 466 468 469 481 485 488 491 496 498 541 . 603 .

"A correspondent for CNN was detained by Turkish police while he reported on tensions during demonstrations marking the first anniversary of mass protests in Istanbul live on air. Ivan Watson was explaining that police had closed off the center of the city to prevent demonstrators laying flowers at the site of last year's protests when he was accosted by plain-clothes police officers. Audiences watching CNN International on Saturday morning saw Turkish law enforcement demand to see Watson's papers, and those of his crew. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Live on air: Riot police detain Ivan Watson, CNN Turkey correspondent, in Taksim Square during his live reporting in Istanbul, Turkey, Saturday, May 31, 2014 . Brutality: Watson was kneed in the back by an officer and detained for half an hour until his passport was produced . 'Are you a journalist?' they demand. As the men pull at Watson's sleeves and surround him, he says, 'I think... I think I'm getting arrested.' The veteran reporter told anchor Errol Barnett, 'Errol, we're being detained right now.' Watson shows the police his press card that gives him permission to work in Turkey, but they are not satisfied. 'Which channel? Where is your passport?' they say. The footage ends there, but according to CNN, Watson was grabbed and kneed in the back by an officer, while another broke the microphone off the CNN camera while trying to take it from the cameraman. Watson and his team were escorted away by police and detained until Watson's passport was retrieved from the CNN bureau nearby. Correspondent: Watson has reported from Turkey for 12 years and never had any problems with his press card, he says . Questioning: A Turkish plainclothes cop began questioning Watson as he reported live on air . He was eventually released after about half an hour. Watson told CNN that in his 12 years reporting from the country he's never had a problem with his press card, and that the demand to see his passport was unusual. In late May and June last year, hundreds of thousands of Turks took to the streets denouncing Erdogan's increasingly autocratic leadership and demanding more democratic freedoms. The protests were sparked by opposition to government plans to uproot trees at Taksim Square's Gezi Park and build a shopping center. Rough: He was manhandled by police after reporting about the situation in Istanbul where the government is preventing people entering the city center to place flowers where protests occurred last year . Detained: Watson and his crew were all led away by police and detained until their passports were produced from the nearby CNN bureau . Fanned by outrage over the often brutal reaction by police, the demonstrations soon spread to other cities and developed into Turkey's biggest protests in decades. Thousands were wounded and at least 12 people have died in anti-government protests in the past year. On Saturday, Gezi park was closed off and riot police and plainclothes police were deployed in huge numbers. Police used tear gas and water cannon on Saturday to push back crowds of protesters who defied a warning by Turkey's prime minister and gathered in Istanbul and Ankara on the anniversary of last year's nationwide anti-government demonstrations. Riot police fired tear gas on hundreds of protesters on a main pedestrian street leading to Istanbul's main square, Taksim, following a stand-off with police. Clashes also erupted in the capital Ankara, where police used water cannons against a group of stone-throwing protesters. Dogan new agency video footage showed police, some in plain clothes, detaining several people in the two cities. Abdulbaki Boga, of the Human Rights Association, told The Associated Press at least 83 people were detained and 14 people were injured in Istanbul alone. Anniversary protests: Injured protesters lie on the ground as Turkish riot police officers fire tear gas to disperse demonstrators gathered on the central Istoklal avenue near Taksim square in Istanbul, on May 31, 2014 . Anti-government: Riot police chase protesters on May 31, 2014 in Istanbul, Turkey. Turkish police used tear gas in central Istanbul to disperse protesters seeking to mark the one-year anniversary of one the largest anti-government demonstration in decades . Government muscle: A government backed redevelopment plan for Gezi Park in Istanbul sparked anger and morphed into nationwide anti-government protests in June 2013, leaving eight people dead and thousands other injured . Large numbers of police blocked access to Taksim, and news reports earlier said authorities planned to deploy some 25,000 police officers and up to 50 anti-riot water cannon vehicles around the city to thwart the demonstrations. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned activists to keep away from the square, saying authorities were under strict orders to prevent protests. 'I am calling on my people: don't fall for this trap. This is not an innocent environmental action,' Erdogan said. Despite the ban, hundreds of people tried to reach Taksim. In a speech in Istanbul earlier, Erdogan said: 'If you go there, our security forces are under strict orders, they will do whatever is necessary from A to Z. You won't be able to go to Gezi like the last time. You have to obey the laws. If you don't, the state will do whatever is necessary.' Turkey's association of journalists condemned Watson's detention and called the police action 'shameful.' He told CNN that officers later apologized for the officer who had kneed him in the back. A report this week by the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights said that more than 5,600 demonstrators were being prosecuted for involvement in the protests while no one responsible for the violence against protesters had been sentenced. The Turkish authorities 'are actively engaging in a witch hunt against those who participated in the protests or spoke out,' said the federation's president, Karim Lahidji.","CNN correspondent Ivan Watson was detained by Turkish police in Istanbul Saturday .

"An Australian woman who will face court for supporting terrorism is married to a militant already fighting in the Syrian civil war, it has been claimed. Fatima Elomar, 29, was arrested as she tried to board a plane with her four children at Sydney Airport on May 3. Although her lawyer insists she was heading overseas for a family reunion, police allegedly seized a sum of cash and military fatigues from her. Mohamed Elomar's (pictured) wife Fatima Elomar will face Downing Centre Local Court on June 2 after being charged for supporting incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities . The 29-year-old was taken to Mascot Police Station where she was charged under the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 1978 with supporting incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities, reported the ABC. She is due to appear before Downing Centre Local Court on June 2. Authorities confirmed to the ABC that Fatima is married to Mohamed Elomar, who is understood to have left Sydney for Syria in November and is now fighting for the terror group ISIS - the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. He is believed to use the alias Abuhafs al Australi. A Facebook page under that name has pictures of his children as well as a photo of him posing in military clothing and holding a weapon. Authorities believe Mohamed left Sydney in November last year to fight in the Syrian civil war . Mohamed is believed to be fighting in the Syrian civil war as a member of jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant or ISIS . Mohamed Elomar's uncle, also named Mohamed, was reportedly jailed for plotting to blow up a Sydney army base and his brother Ahmed is due to be sentenced for his role in the 2012 Hyde Park riot. Al Australi openly declares his loyalty to ISIS - a terrorist group so extreme that it has been rejected even by Al-Qaeda, according to the Washington Post - on the page. 'Whosoever dies without participating in an expedition (jihad) nor having the intention to do so, dies on a branch of hypocrisy,' he wrote. Mrs Elomar was arrested by detectives from the New South Wales Joint Counter Terrorism Team arrested the woman at Sydney Airport shortly before she was due to board the international flight. She was granted conditional bail to appear in court on June 2 after police executed search warrants on properties in Sydney and Brisbane. Elomar posted pictures of his children on a Facebook page, under the alias Abuhafs al Australi . The Australian man has four children - the youngest being a month old . Mohamed Elomar used the Abuhafs Al Australi Facebook page earlier this month to make a death threat against a Sydney man who is a critic of ISIS. Zaky Mallah, a Muslim and outspoken critic of  both sides in the Syrian conflict, told the Mailonline Elomar had threatened violence against him. 'Wait till I send some1 to ur house,' the Facebook post said. 'I'll make sure you pay for what u say. 'Dnt worry I know all about u were u live ur not hard to find its just a matter of time.. I'll get some1 to put u away for good. Put ur teeth in ur throat u munafiq dog.' Death threat: Mohamed Elomar in the guise of his Facebook persona Abuhafs Al Australia made athreat against Sydney man Zaky Mallah, who is a critic of ISIS,which Elomar is said to belong to . As many as 200 Australians, and hundreds of other foreign nationals including UK passport holders,  are believed to have travelled to Syria during the country's civil war to fight with rebel forces engaged in civil warfare with the the army of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Last year, Australian couple Amira Karroum and her husband Yousef Ali, from Granville in western Sydney, died in a mortar attack near the city of Aleppo. Ms Karroum, who attended a private Christian girls' school on the Gold Coast and graduated from university in graphic design, became radicalised after meeting Mr Ali, an American. She wrote of dying and going to heaven to meet Allah on her Facebook page, and listed her occupation as 'Slave of Allah'. Her title photo had a picture of a garden with the saying, 'Jannah [heaven] is the motive'. She and Mr Ali died when government forces attacked rebel insurgents, killing dozens of people. More than 160,000 people have been killed in Syria's bloody civil war, according to an earlier report . The claim was made by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which says it is the true death toll for the three-year conflict. The group said it has documented 162,402 deaths since the uprising against President Bashar Assad's government began in March 2011. Photos of Mohamed Elomar, on this Facebook page, showed him in military clothing, holding a weapon and others of him with his four children . Abuhafs al Australi openly declared his loyalty to ISIS - one of the most brutal militant groups known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria .

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused. A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens. At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier. The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots. As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover. Back to work: Heroic Kevin Vickers was pictured at work on Thursday just hours after he shot dead Zehaf-Bibeau and stopped the terrorist in his tracks . Canadian hero: Vickers, 58, is pictured in a file photo wearing his ceremonial garb and carrying a scepter. As sergeant-at-arms, it his job to uphold the security of the House of Commons . Riveting video: Vickers led the way as officials chased down terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau on Wednesday after he murdered reservist Nathan Cirillo and entered the House of Commons building . Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms . And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise. 'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott. Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred. 'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN. Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career. 'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.' His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.' Heroic: He took down Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, pictured - his first ever exchange of gunfire in his career . Innocent victim: Natan Cirillo, 24, was the soldier shot dead in Wednesday's terror attack on the Canadian Parliament complex . 'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.' Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat. A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work. Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday. 'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.' On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke. Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians. Vickers received a standing ovation from MPs in the House of Commons on Thursday when he returned to the more usual duty of delivering the ceremonial mace to the chamber . Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks . He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg. 'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said. 'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.' Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting. Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did. On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course. 'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said. Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events. 'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said. Immigration chief Susan Bibeau - mother of terrorist Michael Zehaf-Bibeau . 'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time. 'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created. 'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in. I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer. We don’t wish to be part of any media circus, we don’t think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.' Tribute: Stephen Harper laid a floral tribute at the scene of the shooting alongside his wife Loreen on Thursday morning . Arrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across Ottawa . Chilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial. Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier. Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph. A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors. One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking. The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty. Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital. A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'. He added: 'It was pretty intense.'","The Parliament's head of security, sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers, 58, took down Michael Zehaf-Bibeau in a dramatic hail of gunfire .

"Jaeger is the ultimate high-end High Street brand — but hit trouble in 2012. Now, three years after facing bankruptcy, its booming again, with online sales up an incredible 78 per cent. Sandra Howard loves their clothes, but admits they’re too pricey to splurge on every time. So, could she get the classic Jaeger look for less? LAZY WEEKEND: JAEGER . Long-line cardigan, £175 . Silk blouse, £125 . Skinny jeans, £89 . Total spend: £389 . Orangey colours are my thing, and the zingy colour of this cardigan is just fantastic. It really brightens my complexion. I also love the way it covers my bottom! The material of the cardigan feels good quality, but is perhaps a little on the thin side. The shirt is soft and well-cut — although at this price, it should be. The jeans are a good colour and a great fit. 4/5 . LAZY WEEKEND: CHEAP CHIC . Cashmilon cardigan, £28, Marks & Spencer . Blouse, £29.99, Zara . Skinny jeans, £7.99, H&M . Total spend: £65.98 . This cardigan actually feels a bit thicker and softer than the Jaeger one, but I don’t like the way it’s longer at the back because it doesn’t hang so well. This blouse would be fine for a 14-year-old — but at the grand old age of 74, I don’t think I can get away with it. The material is frankly ropey, the collar is too prissy and the cheap, gold buttons don’t help matters, either. These jeans are fine, but they aren’t quite such a pretty colour or good fit as the Jaeger ones. Still, at £7.99 you can’t complain. 3/5 . OUT TO DINNER: JAEGER . Cashmere sweater, £199 Leather skirt, £450 . Total spend: £649 . I’m not a huge fan of the cut of this skirt. It makes it look like a kilt — which is not what you want from a leather skirt. The leather is butter-soft, and it certainly has a bit of va-va-voom. But the price! Cripes! This jumper is beautifully cut, a great colour and it has interesting sleeves, but it bags slightly around the under arms, which is not ideal. 3/5 . OUT TO DINNER: CHEAP CHIC . Jumper, £19.99, Zara . Leather pencil skirt, £85, Oasis . Total spend: £104.99 . This jumper feels a bit thin, and is not nearly as luxurious as the Jaeger one. But I like the way it hangs. It’s casual and sexy, which is a great mix. This skirt is two inches too long, but get it turned up and it’s a definite winner. 3/5 . SUITS YOU, MADAM: JAEGER . Wool jacket, £199 . Wool trousers, £150 . Crew neck jumper, £125 . Total spend: £474 . You can really tell the quality of this. The grey, wool-rich jacket fits like a glove and is beautifully lined, so it would be warm and cosy at this time of year. The cut of both the trousers and the jacket is perfect, the trousers sit comfortably on my waist and the jacket is shaped to enhance my figure — but, at this price, I would expect perfect tailoring. I also love the soft, blue knit underneath — the pale, spring colours flatter my complexion. 4/5 . SUITS YOU, MADAM: CHEAP CHIC . Wool mix jacket, £65, and wool mix trousers, £45, Next . Cashmilon jumper, £12.50, Marks & Spencer . Total spend: £122.50 . This two-piece suit is a great option for the price — it looks almost exactly like the Jaeger version, but it is more than £200 cheaper! It doesn’t feel as luxurious, because the lining is not as sleek, but to look at I couldn’t tell the difference. The jumper is also a real bargain — it is incredibly soft and I thought it was cashmere. I prefer the slightly brighter colour with this outfit, too. 5/5 . SUNDAY BEST: JAEGER . Grosgrain jacket, £175 . Cashmere breton sweater, £199 Leather pencil skirt, £350 . Total spend: £724 . I think Jaeger have made their classic mistake again with this jacket. It’s that little bit too staid. It’s too headmistressy for me and it’s two inches too long. The jumper is nice, though I think I could easily find something very similar cheaper elsewhere. The skirt is well-made, and would be a versatile item in your wardrobe. It could be dressed down with a loose jumper and knee-high boots, or worn with a silk shirt for a glamorous look. But, at this price, you need to be certain you would get a lot of wear out of it. 3/5 . SUNDAY BEST: CHEAP CHIC . Navy jacket, £36, Debenhams Breton jumper, £29.50, Marks & Spencer . Leather-look skirt, £30, River Island . Total spend: £95.50 . I much prefer this jacket, as it is a little shorter and looks more modern — at my age, it is important not to wear dated clothes. This skirt isn’t as comfortable as the Jaeger version, but it has a sexier cut and looks just as expensive. The jumper is also lovely and comfortable. I love this outfit — it could easily pass as real Jaeger, but for a fraction of the price. 5/5 . CITY SLICKER: JAEGER . Silk blouse, £125 . Cotton chinos, £99 . Total spend: £224 . This is a lovely, fun outfit that I’m looking forward to wearing in the spring. The blouse feels very silky and lightweight, perfect for travelling. The colour of the trousers is very unusual for Jaeger but I love them — it’s nice to try out something a little different, and they work well with the pale-pink shirt. I worry this outfit would look very creased if I wore it for a whole day, though. 2/5 . CITY SLICKER: CHEAP CHIC . Blouse, £35, and straight leg chinos, £25, Marks & Spencer . Total spend: £60 . This version is much more affordable — the blouse fits well and looks just as good as the Jaeger one. I would much rather buy this. The trousers also fit me better, and they are a more relaxed style. They would be more practical to wear during the daytime. The washed-out colour of these trousers is also a bit more wearable. 4/5 . DATE NIGHT: JAEGER . Shift dress, £199 . Silk print scarf, £99 . Total spend: £298 . I’m afraid the cap sleeves on this dress would be fine for a younger woman with beautifully toned arms — but are impossibly unflattering on an old lady like me. The colour is great, though, and it fits nicely. I can imagine my husband Michael absolutely loving this dress, as it’s simple and shows off my figure. I’m afraid the scarf is a teensy bit boring, though — the colours are too flat and it could really use a little extra oomph! 3/5 . DATE NIGHT: CHEAP CHIC . Shift dress, £25, bhs.co.uk . Printed scarf, £7.99, New Look . Total spend: £32.99 . This dress is a bit more slouchy and much more me. It’s not as flattering on the figure as the Jaeger dress, but it feels less air-hostessy and a bit more relaxed. Crucially, the sleeves come down to the elbow. The scarf is fine for the price. The colours are strong, and it makes for a more casual look. To make it more glamorous, I would team this dress with a knock-out piece of jewellery. If you did that, I don’t think anyone would guess you had bought it for just £25. 4/5 .","Jaeger hit trouble in 2012 but is booming again now .

"Congressman Aaron Schock, an Illinois Republican who decorated his office in a lavish style modeled after the TV show 'Downton Abbey,' may face an ethics investigation. A watchdog group has asked a congressional review panel to examine whether Schock broke House rules by accepting professional interior design work for free. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchdog group, requested an inquiry by the Office of Congressional Ethics, an outside panel that reviews ethics complaints against House members. Scroll down for video . Probe: Rep. Aaron Schock, seen standing in his 'Downton Abbey'-inspired congressional office, may soon face an ethics investigation . Search: A watchdog group has asked a congressional review panel to examine whether Schock broke House rules by accepting professional interior design work for free . Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan watchdog group, requested an inquiry by the Office of Congressional Ethics, over the office inspired by the popular PBS show . A spokesman for Schock declined to comment, as did the Office of Congressional Ethics and the House Ethics Committee. The Washington Post reported this week that interior decorator Annie Brahler donated her services as she decorated Schock's Washington office with a red carpet and walls accented with antique-looking frames and sconces reminiscent of 'Downton Abbey.' The popular PBS show depicts the lives of aristocratic family and their servants in 1920s England. 'Perhaps it's not totally surprising that the same congressman who spent campaign money on P90X workout DVDs wanted to create a more picturesque setting in which to be photographed, but the rules clearly require him to pay for those renovations himself,' said Anne Weismann, the watchdog group's interim executive director. House rules broadly prohibit members of Congress from accepting gifts or services valued at more than $50. The rules include numerous exemptions, including one that allows gifts from personal friends. Seen on the small screen: Lily James (left) as Lady Rose Aldridge, and Michelle Dockery (right) as Lady Mary Crawley are seen on the PBS costume drama . Bold look: While the decorations in Rep. Aaron Schock's office have drawn comparisons to 'Downton Abbey,' the politician has said he's never seen the show . History lesson: Hanging on the walls are portraits of major US political figures, including (from left to right) President Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, President Ulysses S. Grant, and President George Washington . The newspaper reported 'Brahler offered her services for free, according to Schock’s office, although he had to pay an untold sum for the objects.' Brahler, who owns an Illinois-based firm called Euro Trash, also decorated Shock's previous Washington office, the Post reported. Schock told ABC News Wednesday that he paid Brahler about $6,000 to decorate his office four years ago and will pay her again this year once he receives an invoice. He used a personal check last time and expects to do so again, Schock said. While the decorations have drawn comparisons to 'Downton Abbey,' Schock said he has never seen the show. 'My office last year, or four years ago was a dark navy,' Schock told the news outlet.  'And so obviously it wasn't of interest four years ago. So I think the fact that it's red makes people go, ""Wow, that's different."" I'm not upset about the red walls.' Schock, 33, is in his fourth term representing the Peoria and Springfield areas and cited a pop singer in brushing off the controversy over his office decor. 'I've never been an old crusty white guy,' he told ABC News. Schock said 'I'm different. I came to Congress at 27. When I go take a personal vacation I don’t sit on the beach, I go do active things. 'And so, I'm also not going to live in a cave. So when I post an Instagram photo with me and my friends, as Taylor Swift said, ""Haters gonna hate.""' Dismissal: Schock, 33, is in his fourth term representing the Peoria and Springfield areas and cited a pop singer in brushing off the controversy over his office decor (2014 file photo) Bona fide hit: 'Dowton Abbey' depicts the lives of aristocratic family and their servants in 1920s England . The congressman told ABC News of a potential plan 'Maybe we'll have a ""Downton Abbey"" watch party? At the end of the day, regardless of what color wall you choose your office, the most important thing in Congress is what you do for your constituents and what you do for your job.' The Ethics Committee has said it is continuing an investigation into allegations that Schock violated federal law and House rules by soliciting donations of more than $5,000 per donor to a super political action committee that backed an Illinois colleague in 2012. The Office of Congressional Ethics said in a 2013 report that there is reason to believe Schock violated House rules by soliciting campaign contributions for a committee that backed Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., in a 2012 House primary. The investigation remains open, the Ethics Committee said Wednesday. A spokesman for Schock in 2013 said the congressman had done nothing wrong.","An Illinois Congressman who decorated his office in a style modeled after the TV show 'Downton Abbey' may face an ethics investigation .

"Nicole Scherzinger and Lewis Hamilton have split for the fourth time and Nicole is reputedly heartbroken. But I still think it's Lewis who will hurt more. Don't believe the romance novels: women aren't the love slaves. Psychologists have discovered that, while men still fall in love less often than women, when they fall, they fall harder, quicker – and out of love slower. Scroll down for video . Nicole Scherzinger split with long term boyfriend Lewis Hamilton earlier this week . So while savvy, smart women like Nicole will do their grieving but then move forward, a lot of 'new age' men like Lewis end up stuck. Here's six reasons why: . Women have better coping strategies . A typical female reaction to a painful break-up is to hotfoot it to her best friend's house and spend the next three weeks (or three months) talking about her ex and her feelings to anyone that will listen. Women are more emotionally expressive and healthily in touch with their soft underbellies. By letting out our grief and sadness, we get the pain out of our systems and are able to move on quickly. Men, God love them, bottle things up. His reaction to a split with a treasured girlfriend is to mask the pain. Nicole appeared to be heartbroken as she emerged for the first time since the split yesterday but Tracey insists that her ex will be suffering the most . He'll either a) not think about it and throw himself into work in an attempt to reaffirm his own worth; or b) not think about it and start sleeping around for the same reasons; or c) not think about it, get drunk and stay out until 3 am, running himself into the ground. In other words, he'll do just about anything rather than confront the pain and deal with it. Sleeping around makes things worse . Ironically, the more he's seen about town with replacement bimbettes on his arm, the more he's probably hurting. It doesn't mean he doesn't care – in fact, quite the opposite. When people lose someone they love, they're overcome by feelings of worthlessness. Women cope by getting their act together, proving their worth that way. For some men, it's simply easier to sleep around: 'If I can pull the chicky-babes, I must be okay.' Tracey says that unlike Lewis, Nicole will probably find it easier to talk to her friends and get her feelings off her chest rather than bottle things up . This is also why men become self-abusive. They're feeling unloved and unworthy, so treat themselves accordingly, surviving on diets of beer and curry. What he really should be doing is quite the opposite - looking after himself more and replacing the love lost with another. His own. He can't talk to his friends the same way women do theirs . While female relationships are based on talking, especially about our feelings, men's relationships are based on doing: things like playing sport, joking around, having a beer. While some men do have substantial conversations with their friends, many don't. Talking about their pain or their problems just isn't acceptable: they feel stupid, weak and pathetic if they broach personal topics. As a result, men are more emotionally independent than women and are used to being self-reliant. Fabulous - until you hit a rough spot. The female support system is infinitely more helpful at a time like this. Tracey says that sleeping around after a break up  is a sign that he's struggling to cope . Even if his friends are concerned about him, they often wouldn't have a clue what to say to fix it. This is where his platonic girlfriends could well be his saving grace. It's okay to get advice from a female. 'They even seem to like doing that sort of stuff!', one male friend told me in astonishment. He didn't see it coming . Women see the writing on the wall when it's in tiny, tiny letters. Men often wouldn't notice if she wrote, 'You're about to be dumped,' on the bathroom mirror. With his shaving cream. It's the right-brain, left-brain thing. The left side of our brain is the 'thinking' part (logic and facts); the right side works with 'feelings' (emotion, intuition, expression). Usually men are more left-brain dominated and women right-brain. So he's not as in tune with the touchy-feely side that would warn him she was about to leave. Tracey says that women are the lucky ones after a split as their looks tend to improve . He loses more mutual friends . While women lean heavily on good friends after a break, men often do quite the opposite. They tend to drop 'couple' friends in favour of single males who'll go out and party with them. Sometimes he'll avoid good friends of his ex because it's too painful to hear how well she's faring without him. The end result: he's lonely and dwells on the past. Women look better after a split, men often look worse . Women tend to lose weight initially, then do a complete image overhaul when feeling human again as a 'starting over' gesture. Feeling great and looking fabulous, they're more confident and their social life blooms. Men tend to mope about depressed. Says Brendon, a friend of mine, 'My girlfriend transformed herself after I left. It was quite remarkable: she'd gone from a shy wallflower to this incredibly confident girl who everyone wanted at their party. 'No-one asked me anywhere – probably because when they did, I stood in a corner and felt sorry for myself or behaved like a total moron by getting too drunk.' He doesn't clear out the closet for next time . A crucial part of getting over someone is getting rid of – or at least putting away – remnants of the relationship. It's all part of letting go. If her old hairbrush is still in the bathroom, he may get stuck and never let go. If his next girlfriend finds herself walking into a shrine of his ex, she will not be happy. He might defend the pictures on the wall by saying she's a friend, but it's obvious to her that he's looking for a new relationship to mask the pain of the last one. Often, it's only when he's met someone new, someone he can trust, that he finally does deal with all the pain the break-up caused. He has to let go of the hurt at some point - and more often than not, it's the next girlfriend who cops it. There won't be a next girlfriend, if there's obvious evidence he's still mourning the first and the problem never gets solved!

"Jury selection is set to begin today in the capital murder trial for the former Marine accused of gunning down famed Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle. Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is accused of killing Kyle, 38, and Kyle's friend, father-of-one Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range near Chalk Mountain, Texas on February 2, 2013. Kyle, a married father-of-two, had been trying to help Routh deal with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder on the request of Routh's mother and had taken him to target practice when he was killed. Routh, who struggled with PTSD after serving as a small arms technician in Iraq before leaving the Marines in 2010, is pleading not guilty by reason of insanity. Scroll down for video . Accused: Eddie Ray Routh, 27, will go on trial next week for shooting dead Chris Kyle, 38, and his friend Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range in Texas in 2013. Jury selection begins for the trial on Thursday . Getting ready: A sheriff's deputy patrols outside the Donald R. Jones Justice Center with a sniffer dog, as jury selection gets underway for the trial of Eddie Ray Routh in Stephenville, Texas on Thursday . Opening statements are expected in the case next Wednesday. The upcoming trial has garnered attention after Kyle - who's recognized for having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history - was portrayed by actor Bradley Cooper in the Hollywood blockbuster 'American Sniper'. The film does not depict Kyle's death. Around 800 potential jurors have been summoned for possible selection but about 500 are expected to actually report to the court. From that number, the judge and attorneys will choose 12 jurors and two alternates. Four sessions will be held over two days to accommodate all of the potential jurors. Erath County District Clerk Wanda Pringle said she does not yet know if attorneys will choose to give potential jurors a questionnaire containing questions specifically related the Routh case. Final jury selection is set for Monday and Tuesday. Opening statements are expected Wednesday. The court has already issued an extensive list of rules related to media coverage and police have issued information on road closures when the trial starts. American Sniper: Kyle, who is widely recognized as having made the highest number of confirmed kills in American military history, had taken Routh to the firing range as he helped him cope with his PTSD . Torn apart: Kyle, pictured with his wife Taya, and Chad Littlefield, right, both died in the tragedy . 'American Sniper' is based on a memoir of the same name by Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq before retiring from the military in 2009. The Clint Eastwood-directed movie earned a massive $107 million during its debut weekend at the North American box office, which was a record for a January opening. 'The movie has become a cultural phenomenon,' Dan Fellman, head of domestic distribution at Warner Bros., said of the film's success. 'It tore apart the record book and not by a little. By an enormous amount.' It has been nominated for six Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Bradley Cooper. Last month, Routh's attorneys said the scope of the film - from the amount of people seeing it in cinemas to the press it is receiving and Oscar nominations - will affect the outcome of the jury. 'The film will be an issue,' Routh's attorney, J. Warren St. John, told People magazine. Concerns: Routh's attorneys have expressed concern at picking an impartial jury after the success of the film 'American Sniper', starring Bradley Cooper (pictured), which is based on Kyle's memoir . Arduous process: Around 800 potential jurors have been summoned to the center for possible selection . 'I think any case with significant publicity has an issue with picking a jury. I've had them in the past, and anything that has significant national attention makes it hard to pick a jury.' Jurors are picked on their impartiality, and the hope they know nothing about the case they about to hear and deliver a verdict. In 2013, a judge issued the gag order preventing attorneys and family members and others from talking to the media, predicting widespread media coverage. Routh's attorneys also lost a bid to have the trial moved out of Texas. 'Mr. Kyle is a hero in many people's eyes,' George Parnham, a Houston criminal defense attorney not associated with the case, told People. 'Due to the fact that this movie has gained intense public attention, it's doubtful that a fair jury can be selected anywhere.'","Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is accused of shooting dead Kyle, 38, and Kyle's friend Chad Littlefield, 35, at a shooting range in Texas in February 2013 .

"A grandmother and two parents face felony child abuse charges after police found two toddlers locked in metal dog kennels at a Gulfport, Mississippi home. Narcotics division officers discovered the children, aged one and two, while serving a search warrant on their father in an unrelated narcotics case at the house last month. The toddlers were locked in the cages at the home, according to police. Two toddlers, aged one and two, were found locked (above the kennels the children were in at the time) in metal dog cages at a Gulfport, Mississippi home . The father, Patrick Braddock (above), 35, was arrested at the time on charges related to the drugs investigation. He remains in custody at the Harrison County Jail on a $100,000 bond . The mother, Brittany Kay Braddock (left), 26, and the grandmother, Pamela Diane Davis (right), 60, were present during the initial search on the evening of January 28, but were not arrested until Tuesday. Each suspect has been charged with two counts of felony child abuse . No further details on the cages or whether the children showed other signs of abuse or neglect were released. While serving a search warrant for the father, Patrick Braddock, 35, on January 28, police arrested him at the time on charges related to the narcotics investigation. The mother, Brittany Kay Braddock, 26, and the grandmother, Pamela Diane Davis, 60, were present during the initial search warrant, but were not arrested until Tuesday for child abuse charges. Narcotics division officers discovered the children while serving a search warrant in an unrelated narcotics case at the house (the home on where the toddlers were found) Each of the suspects were charged with two counts of felony child abuse, and the Department of Human Services took custody of the toddlers. Brittany said the accusations by authorities are 'exaggerated', according to the Sun Herald. She said: 'I'm really stressed out right now. I just got out of jail. It got totally messed up by the police. The police made it look like I put them in there all the time and I trap them in there.' Adam Cooper from the Gulfport Police Department said their discovery is 'infuriating' and 'egregious, according to WKRG. He also said first and foremost the concern was for the children, and they they worked with the DHS to get the children taken out of the situation. Patrick remains in custody at the Harrison County Jail on a $100,000 bond. Pamela was released on Tuesday after posting a $20,000 bond and Brittany posted a bond of the same amount, and was released on Wednesday, according to WNEM. The state Department of Human Services is also investigating the incident. No further details on the cages or whether the children showed other signs of abuse or neglect were released (a tag found one of the kennels which said 'your dog's home for life')","Children, aged one and two, discovered by officers in Gulfport, Mississippi following home search warrant for unrelated narcotics case .

"Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have penned a desperate letter from death row, begging the Indonesian government to spare them. The Bali Nine ringleaders are running out of options to avoid the firing squad, which is being planned for the next two weeks. Their friend, Pastor Matius Arif, says the pair are 'very sad' their bid for a judicial review was rejected in the courts on Wednesday. He read an open letter - addressed to the Indonesian government and signed by both Australians - to reporters outside Kerobokan jail on Thursday, which argues they are more useful alive as they work to rehabilitate other prisoners. This comes after reports that the fate of the Bali Nine ringleaders may have been sealed by the results of a text message poll which found 52 per cent of Australians, in principle, support death sentences for overseas drug traffickers. A judicial review application submitted by Australian convicted drug traffickers Andrew Chan (right) and Myruan Sukumaran (left) has been rejected by Indonesia's courts . Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have apparently penned a desperate letter from death row, begging the Indonesian government to spare them . 'We beg for moratorium so we can have chance to serve Indonesia community (sic)' the letter reads. Mr Matius says the letter was handwritten by Sukumaran. 'There's so many testimonies about what they're doing inside,' he told reporters. 'I also personally request the government to make a special commission or a special team to investigate what they're doing inside.' The team should then report on the rehab programs to the president, he said. The application for a judicial review detailed the work of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, to assist others through chaplaincy and art programs. Denpasar District Court determined it didn't meet the 'new evidence' criteria for a review. It was the last legal option for the pair, who have been denied clemency by President Joko Widodo. Barrister Julian McMahon says their team is still examining the options after Wednesday's setback. 'It's certainly a major blow, that's for sure, because having this second appeal was probably our best option in having all the issues canvassed,' he told ABC Radio. Prime Minister Tony Abbott, too, says diplomatic efforts to save them are continuing. 'We are not going to engage in last-minute, megaphone diplomacy but I just want to assure people that the Australian government has left no stone unturned to try to ensure that these two Australians on death row have their sentences commuted,' he said. The men's families visited Kerobokan jail again on Thursday, including mother of Andrew Chan, Helen, and Sukumaran's brother Chintu who wrapped his arm around their mother Raji. A text message poll found 52 per cent of Australians say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed . Helen Chan, mother of Andrew Chan, visits her condemned drug smuggler son in Kerobokan jail, Bali, on Thursday . Sydney men Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran lost their last chance of escaping execution by firing squad after a second judicial review of their case was rejected on Wednesday. Their lawyer Julian McMahon told the Sydney Morning Herald a 'snap' poll, commissioned by Triple J radio show Hack about death sentences, in which 2123 Aussies voted 'yes' or 'no' by text message, has been picked up by the Indonesian government to justify the drug smugglers' deaths. The results of the poll by Roy Morgan Research were published in January under the headline 'Australians think Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran should be executed'. But the question that was actually asked  that month was much broader and was only referring to death sentences in principle and not the two men's specific case. Radio show Triple J commissioned the research by Roy Morgan Research and also posed the question on their Facebook page . The radio show published the results of their poll on 26 January saying '60 per cent of young Australians don't think the government should do more to stop the execution' ‘In your opinion if an Australian is convicted of drug trafficking in another country & sentenced to death, should the penalty be carried out?,’ the question said. Mr McMahon told SMH the result ‘is now a tool being used to get my clients killed’. ‘The AG and the ambassador have publicly relied on the SMS poll as a factor justifying execution. They say that it pushes them to do it, that they have Australian public support,’ Mr McMahon reasoned. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Triple J Hack show for comment. Gary Morgan, executive chairman of Roy Morgan Research, defended way the poll was carried out to the SMH. When the poll results were originally published Morgan said in a statement: ‘A slight majority of Australians (52%) say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed. A text message poll found 52 per cent of Australians say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed . Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail . Indonesia has used results from radio host Tom Tilley's (pictured) Triple J listeners to justify sending Aussies to the firing squad, according to the Bali Nine ringleaders' lawyer . ‘However, there is a clear gender split with men (60%) in favour of the death penalty being carried out while only 46% of women believe that convicted drug traffickers overseas should be executed.’ Indonesia's courts rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Chan and Sukumaran again on Wednesday despite a strong campaign for mercy being pushed from the 'highest level' of Australian government. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott promised they 'continued to raise the cases' with the Indonesian government. 'My personal view is that an execution of drug traffickers will not stop the problem of drugs in and out of Indonesia, that there’s a much broader approach that needs to be taken, however, the Indonesian government seems to be intent on pursuing the death penalty for drug traffickers,' Ms Bishop said. It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions . Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail. Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected. The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted. 'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali. Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop said she and Tony Abbott have 'continued to raise the cases' of Chan and Sukurmaran with the Indonesian government. People hold up candles at the I Stand For Mercy vigil and concert for Bali Nine death row inmates Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, at Martin Place in Sydney, Thursday, Jan. 29 . Hasoloan Sianturi, spokesman for Denpasar District Court, with the judicial review application for condemned Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan . It comes after a slight glimmer of hope from the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, who was yet to make a decision on the matter on Tuesday. 'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono previously said according to News Corp. Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Mr McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006. 'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp. It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions. The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap. The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan. From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.","Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have reportedly penned a desperate letter from death row .

"Fox news host Steve Doocy said the movie empowered women by turning men into 'fools and villians' Disney's animated smash hit Frozen has been accused of spreading anti-male propaganda by a US news host. Steve Doocy slammed the film for its lack of strong male characters  during an early morning talk show. He claimed that the movie empowered its female fans by turning men into 'fools and villains.' In a three minute segment on  Fox and Friends Doocy discussed the so-called 'Frozen effect' with Penny Young Nance, the CEO of Concerned Women for America. To illustrate the point the show reportedly showed a clip from the movie of good guy Kristoff discussing picking his nose and another of villain Prince Hans confessing his evil plan. The 2013 movie is inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale the Snow Queen and tells the story of a fearless princess who sets off on an epic journey alongside an iceman, his pet reindeer,and a naive snowman to find her estranged sister, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter. 'They depict men as evil and cold and bumblers,' Ms Young Nance said on the show KSDK,com reported. ''It's not just Disney. 'It's Hollywood in general that has often sent the message that men are superfluous, they're stupid, they're in the way, if they contribute anything to the family, it's a paycheck.' Doocy is said to have later added that it would be 'nice' if there were more 'strong male figures' in movies such as Frozen, it was reported. Frozen took over a billion dollars at the global box office, and is the most successful animated movie of all time. It also won a Golden Globe for the best animated film. Doocy's comments come after a seven minute short film reunites the cast, characters, directors and even songwriters of the original 2013 movie, and will be screened ahead of Disney's Cinderella. The smash hit movie tells the tale of Princess Anna, pictured right, who sets off on an epic journey  to find her  sister Princess Elsa, pictured left, whose icy powers have inadvertently trapped the kingdom in eternal winter .

"The mother of a severely burned boy who died after years of suffering told a Houston court on Tuesday that her son was 'stalked' in the days before his death by the man now standing trial accused of his murder. Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she talked about how her 8-year-old Robert told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire. The incident happened in 1998 and Robert died in 2011 from skin cancer as a result of his horrific injuries after 99 percent of his body was burned. Colleen Middleton choked back tears as she talked about how her 8-year-old Robert told her Don Collins, 13, had tied him up and set him on fire . She says she was 'horrified' in the days before Robbie was burned because Collins had been 'stalking' her son as she testified on the witness stand, reports FOX26. Almost 17 years later, and despite the fact that he died in 2011, the jury will hear a videotaped deposition from Robert in which he accuses Collins of raping him two weeks before setting him on fire. 'He took me out into the woods where I was burned. It was the same place. He took my clothes down and started raping me,' Robert reportedly says in the 30-minute recording. Collins, now 29, was convicted of sexually assaulting a different 8-year-old boy in 2001. A judge determined last March that he could be tried for murder as an adult, despite being a teenager at the time. Robert Middleton suffered burns across 99 percent of his body and endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer . Collins has pleaded not guilty. During Tuesday's court hearing, he turned his head from the screen as prosecutors showed images of Robert Middleton's badly burned body. Defense attorney E. Tay Bond said that, just as there wasn't enough evidence in 1998 to hold Collins, there also isn't now. He has accused the Middleton's attorney of making up the rape theory. Robert Middleton endured years of physical therapy before he died in 2011 from skin cancer. His death was ruled a homicide because the burns were almost exclusively to blame for the cancer. Accused: It's alleged that Don Collins tied eight-year-old Robert Middleton  to a tree, doused him with gasoline, and set him on fire . On trial: Defense attorneys asserted in Galveston County court that there were no witnesses to the attack and prosecutors are playing to the jury's emotions . After learning that the case would go to trial, Colleen Middleton, Robert's mother, said the journey to justice has been a 'long road’. 'When Robert died, we were thinking maybe nothing will ever happen,' Colleen said. Maybe someone is just going to get away with what they did to him.' Defense attorneys said in a Galveston County courtroom on Tuesday that there were no witnesses to the attack and prosecutors are playing to the jury's emotions. 'Do not expect the defense to bring an eyewitness to this tragedy because there is not one,' attorney E. Tay Bond told jurors. 'There are no witnesses from the woods except for Robbie.' But prosecutors countered that witnesses will testify that Collins admitted to them that he poured gasoline on Middleton as the boy walked through woods near his home. Victim: Robert Middleton before he was doused in gasoline and set on fire, resulting in burns to 99 per cent of his body . Brave face: Middleton eventually died from skin cancer in 2011, thought to have been caused by the severe burns he suffered years earlier . Deposition: Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins  of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack . 'Our case is based on the testimony of adults who have come forward and can tell you what this man did when they were children,' Montgomery County prosecutor Kelly Blackburn said in his opening statement. Middleton named Collins as his attacker and the older boy was arrested in 1998. Collins spent several months in juvenile detention but was released after prosecutors said they didn't have enough evidence to pursue the case. Shortly before he died, Middleton gave a videotaped deposition in which he accused Collins for the first time of sexually assaulting him two weeks before the attack. The sexual assault allegation prompted investigators to reopen the case. It was determined last year that Collins, now 29, could be tried as an adult in the trial even though he was 13, pictured above, at the time of the alleged attack . Accused of murder: Collins, now 29, was 13 when prosecutors allege he set fire to eight-year-old Middleton . Prosecutors charged Collins with murder in 2013, but they needed to move the case from juvenile to adult court to take him to trial. After a three-day hearing last March, state District Judge Kathleen Hamilton ruled that Collins could be tried for murder by an adult court. A man who was sexually assaulted by Collins in 2001, when he was eight years old, testified in a hearing to determine whether Collins should be tried as an adult for the crime against Middleton. The victim said that Collins threatened to burn him if he told anyone about the assault.","Colleen Middleton took to the stand on Wednesday and told the court that she was 'horrified' as her son Robert was stalked by an older boy .

"A defiant Nick Clegg this morning rejected a shock poll suggesting he is on course to lose his seat in Parliament. The Deputy Prime Minister said the survey, which has him trailing Labour by 10 points, was 'utter bilge'. According to the Survation poll more than half of Mr Clegg's 2010 supporters are planning to desert him in May - with just 23 per cent of Sheffield Hallam voters now set to back him. Labour has surged to 33 per cent in Sheffield Hallam – up 17 per cent on 2010, according to the survey of 1,011 residents in Mr Clegg's Sheffield Hallam constituency . Labour meanwhile has surged to 33 per cent  – up 17 points on 2010, according to the survey of 1,011 residents in Mr Clegg's South Yorkshire constituency. The Tories are just one point behind Mr Clegg on 22 per cent, with the Greens and Ukip both enjoying a surge in support. The shock poll comes just 24 hours after leaked surveys of crucial seats in Scotland suggested Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander was also on course to lose his seat. But the Deputy Prime Minister shrugged off the polling this morning. Mr Clegg told LBC radio: 'This poll is such utter, utter bilge.' Overall, the SNP are on course to sweep across Scotland, wiping out both the Lib Dems and Labour. Mr Alexander and Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander among those who face losing their seats to the Scottish nationalists, according to the polling by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft. Lord Ashcroft's poll of 16 key seats found Nicola Sturgeon's nationalist party ahead in 15 of the 16 seats, putting the SNP on course to hold the balance of power after May's election. Labour has been rocked by the extraordinary surge in support for the SNP in the wake of the independence referendum in September, despite voters rejecting their plan for separation. According to the Survation poll Mr Clegg is on course to lose more than half his vote in May, dropping 30 points to just 23 per cent . First Minister Alex Salmond quit as SNP leader to be replaced by Miss Sturgeon, but now plans to stand for election to Westminster. Polls have repeatedly suggested the SNP will make huge gains, with Labour facing heavy losses and the Lib Dems and Tories wiped out altogether. Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has been called back to the frontline to support new Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy in an attempt to stem the losses. Lord Ashcroft's research focused mainly on Labour seats in areas which had voted in favour of independence, or only narrowly voted against. Of the 16 seats, it found only Glasgow North East is likely to back Ed Miliband's party. The swing from Labour to the SNP varies from 21 to 27 per cent. If a swing of 21 per cent was repeated across Scotland, Labour would lose 35 of its 41 seats in Scotland. Polls carried out by Lord Ashcroft in 16 key seats show the SNP is on course to win in all but one of them . Lord Ashcroft's poll of 16 key seats found Nicola Sturgeon's nationalist party ahead in 15 of the 16 seats . Mr Clegg will launch the Lib Dems' fight back today announcing plans for 'at least' £8 billion in tax rises if the Liberal Democrats remain in government after the election. The Deputy PM will throw down the gauntlet to David Cameron and Ed Miliband by ruling out an increase in the headline rates of VAT, income tax or National Insurance – the three biggest money-spinners for the Treasury. The move comes less than 24 hours after the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies warned that families face a major tax bombshell regardless of who wins the election. The Lib Dems have so far announced just less than £2.5 billion of tax rises, including the £1.7 billion Mansion Tax on homes worth more than £2 million. It also plans to scrap the Married Couples Tax Allowance introduced by David Cameron, and increase the charges on wealthy foreign non-doms who live in the UK. Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander (left) and Labour's election chief Douglas Alexander both face losing their seats . Sources said the party was also working up proposals on the tax deductibility of interest by businesses and on increasing the annual banking levy, which the party believes could raise at least £1.5 billion. A source close to Mr Clegg said details of a further £4 billion in taxes would be set out ahead of the election, although it is unclear whether details of how the Mansion Tax will work will be ready in time. In a speech in London today, the Lib Dem leader will say his party would target those who are 'not always paying their fair share' as it seeks to balance the books after the general election in May. Like the Conservatives, the Lib Dems are committed to a further £30 billion of austerity in the new parliament in order to clear the deficit in the public finances by 2017/18. But, while the Conservatives want to focus exclusively on cuts to benefits and public spending, the Lib Dems insist tax rises must also play a part. Mr Clegg will say: 'We will finish the job of balancing the books but we will finish the job fairly. 'It is incomprehensible to most people that you would try and balance the books without asking for a contribution from the wealthiest people in our country. 'Liberal Democrat plans are for a bigger tax contribution from those who can afford to pay - the wealthiest individuals and big businesses which are not always paying their fair share. 'If public services and the most vulnerable in society are to be protected, then the wealthiest and big business will have to pay their fair share.' In addition, the Lib Dems say they will raise £16 billion through cutting spending - including £4 billion of welfare savings - and £6 billion through reducing tax avoidance. Welfare cuts include ending free TV licences and the winter fuel allowance for better-off pensioners and capping increases in benefit payments to one per cent for the first two years of the new parliament.","Defiant Nick Clegg this morning rejected the shock poll as 'utter bilge'

"A mother and child were tied up at knifepoint by a masked burglar who carried out a 'horrific sexual assault' during an early-morning raid in a Somerset market town. The knife-wielding sex attacker broke into the home in Sydenham, Bridgwater, before carrying out the assault while wearing a balaclava-style mask and a high-visibility jacket. He then threatened the mother and child with a knife, before demanding money and jewellery, but is believed to have fled from the property empty-handed. A knife was later found in a nearby garden. Scroll down for video . A mother and child were tied up at knifepoint by a masked raider who carried out a 'horrific sexual assault' during an early-morning break-in in the Dunwear Lane area of Sydenham, Bridgwater, Somerset (pictured) Police are now hunting for the burglar, who broke into the home through an unlocked door at 8am on January 21. They said the burglary had been a 'horrendous ordeal' for the pair, but would not confirm which of the victims had been sexually assaulted. Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Andy Williams said it had been a 'horrific incident' but that there was a team a experts working on the case. He added that officers have so far carried out 250 house-to-house inquiries. He said: 'We're treating this as an horrific incident in which a mother and her child were tied up and threatened at knifepoint by an unknown man. This is an upsetting case and all the support that we can provide to the victims is being done. 'An offence of this gravity will naturally cause concern in the local community and I'd like to reassure people that we've got a team of experienced detectives and officers working on the case that are determined to identify this individual and bring him to justice. 'Incidents like this are rare and isolated. We're looking after the victims who've been through an horrendous ordeal and are giving them all the help and support they need.' Police hunting the burglar have carried out 250 house-to-house inquiries and  have received information about the man's sightings and movements after the incident . Officers say they have already received a number of potential sightings and information about the man's movements following the incident. He added: 'During the course of our inquiry we've carried out house-to-house inquiries at more than 250 properties and are following up on any leads resulting from these visits. 'It's likely there will be an ongoing police presence as we continue making inquiries to piece together what happened.' The suspect is described as white, aged between 25 and 60 years old and was said to be wearing a high-vis fluorescent jacket at the time. Avon and Somerset Police released this map to show where the man was seen following the horrific ordeal . He was also wearing a black or dark grey mask with holes for the eye and mouth, as well as a grey hood, dark-coloured tracksuit bottoms and white trainers. A man matching his description was seen in Dunwear Lane at about 8.12am on the day of the burglary, before being spotted running towards the junction of Westonzoyland Road. He turned left into Westonzoyland Road and disappeared from sight but was caught on CCTV near St John and St Francis Primary School. A fence was also broken in St David's Court, possibly about the time the incident happened. Detectives have already discovered a kitchen knife, matching the description of the weapon used, in a garden in nearby Somerville Way. Det Ch Insp  Williams added: 'The offender had his face covered but I'm urging people to look at the following description and think about whether they saw someone matching it on the morning of Wednesday 21 January, or at any point during the day of the incident or the days before.

"Students at a college in Vermont have been warned to tread lightly after a four-foot-long snake mysteriously disappeared from a science lab. Castleton State College sent out a campus-wide email reporting that Brazilian rainbow boa constrictor had gone missing but it was non-venomous and trained to only eat frozen dead mice. Officials at the school believe the orange-colored reptile was stolen and did not escape as its cage  had a weighted lid. On the loose: Castleton State College sent out a campus-wide email reporting that Brazilian rainbow boa constrictor had gone missing but it was non-venomous and trained to only eat frozen dead mice . The door to the classroom it inhabited was also locked shut. 'We’re treating this like a larceny,' Keith Molinari, director of public safety, told the Rutland Herald. 'It’s under investigation the same way any other theft would be.' A California-based reptile store pegs the value of the snake at around $200. Scene of the crime: Officials at the school believe the orange-colored reptile was stolen and did not escape on its own as the cage it was in had a weighted lid .

"Could Saturday Night Live be coming to an end? The popular sketch comedy program is in its 40th season this year, and ahead of the show's highly anticipated special on February 15 to mark the occasion, creator Lorne Michaels is sharing who his favorite cast members have been, the A-list actors who auditioned for roles and he turned down and what the future holds for his show. This as he suggests that when he steps down from his post, it may be the end for the show. Scroll down for videos . Lorne Michaels (above with Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon) has revealed that Saturday Night Live may end when he decides to step down . In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Michaels, who started the show when he was just 30-years-old, was asked what would happen when he left, and said; 'I don't know. I'm going to keep doing it as long as I possibly can because I love it and because it's what I do.' He then added; 'But there is more niche stuff [now]. Us doing Update and giving it 10 minutes in a 90-minute show was a big deal, but Comedy Central and Jon Stewart, none of that existed then. So things have fragmented.' Then he did something he seldom does in interviews, and revealed some of the young talent he passed on who would go on to become huge stars. 'Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell There were lots of people who you'd see how brilliant they were, but you knew on some level that it wasn't going to work.' The same goes for Lisa Kudrow, who he said came at a time where there were already two similar women on the program, Nora Dunn and Jan Hooks. There is one star whoever who seems so perfect for the show, it is almost unfathomable that they passed. 'I wasn't at the Jim Carey audition, but somebody who was there said, 'I don't think Lorne would like it,' and they were probably wrong, but it doesn't matter.,' explained Michaels. 'Or maybe they were right — who knows? No one gets it all right.' Among the A-list stars who auditioned and were not cast on the show are Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell (above) Lisa Kudrow (left) was turned down because there were already two similar women on the show, will it was felt by one of the casting directors that Michaels would not like Jim Carey (right) after his audition . As for his favorite cast members, it seems that Michaels has a big soft spot for Kristen Wiig and Will Ferrell, especially after the two returned to the show even after finding success in movies. This only helps the show he explained, but also endears them to their fans. 'They also have a pact with the people who watch the show: They were there, they loved you at the beginning, they told everyone else about you and they showed up for everything you did,' he explained. 'So you have to make sure that you honor that.' And if Michaels does step down soon, there is one name almost everyone has talked about running the show - Tina Fey. The former head writer for the show, who still turns up at least once a season, has been asked about this in the past, and said; 'I feel like Saturday Night Live is so defined by Lorne's taste and his sensibility. He is the center of that show, and I think it should just — when he wants to stop, it should just stop.' Michaels has won Emmys and Peabodys for his shows, and created Saturday Night Live when he was just 30 . As for the anniversary special, the lineup of past talent that will perform is remarkable, and includes, in addition to Fey, Eddie Murphy, Adam Sandler, Chevy Chase, Jimmy Fallon, Will Ferrell, Martin Short, Tina Fey, Molly Shannon, Mike Myers, Andy Samberg, Bill Murray, Amy Poehler, Dana Carvey, Kristen Wiig, Dan Aykroyd, Chris Rock, Garrett Morris, and Maya Rudolph. And those are just the former cast members. Among the former hosts stopping by are; Emma Stone, Derek Jeter, Kanye West, Paul McCartney, Melissa McCarthy, Jerry Seinfeld, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, Jim Carrey, Peyton Manning, Taylor Swift, Betty White, Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin, Paul Simon, Justin Timberlake, Christopher Walken, and Steve Martin. And last, but certainly not least, even Sarah Palin herself will be there.","Lorne Michaels has suggested in a new interview that Saturday Night Live may end when he steps down .

"Jacqueline Williams hanged herself after she was admitted to hospital with a history of suicide attempts and left on her own for 20 minutes . The family of a mother-of-three who killed herself after being left alone by hospital staff despite being admitted because she was distressed have branded the NHS a 'broken' system. Jacqueline Williams, 42, was suffering from depression and had a history of suicide attempts when she was admitted into Royal Blackburn Hospital, and died two hours later in a side room of the A&E department. The former carer's family said they feel let down by the health service and believe the 'broken system' has led to staff cuts and a lack of knowledge about mental health, which meant she was left alone with enough time to hang herself. Her husband said she had previously begged to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Lisa Turner, 43, said: 'If the NHS hadn't been cutting corners then my sister would still be here. I do feel the NHS is a broken system that has failed us and shockingly it isn't just happening to us but everybody else. This broken system that we see in the news all the time I believe has led directly to my beloved sister's death. 'We hear so much in the news about it and loads has come out in terms of waiting times at A&Es and staff shortages. How long can this go on for? 'People are dying because of stupid mistakes. Apparently it takes seven weeks for people who need psychiatric care to get help.' Mrs Williams, who used to work as a carer at Abiden Rest Home in Burnley, had been mourning the death in 2013 of her father-in-law but her depression worsened in October last year and she was twice admitted to hospital for trying to kill herself. On January 26 - a Monday - Mrs Williams went out for a walk saying she wanted to 'clear her head' only to be found loitering at canal bridge at 10.30pm by a member of the public. An ambulance took her to the hospital where she was seen then left alone in a windowless room next to a nurses' station. It is believed she shut the door and was left alone for about 20 minutes, during which she hanged herself. Mrs Williams, of Burnley, was found at 12.52am and died after attempts to revive her. Her sister said they believed staff shortages meant Mrs Williams was left alone, despite it being a Monday evening which is often quieter. Royal Blackburn Hospitals is likely to face questions about its treatment of patients with mental health issues . She added: 'It is ridiculous. It should never have happened and was so preventable. If more staff had been on that night, hand on my heart, I think my sister would still be alive. 'They must have been just understaffed. People go to hospital for safety and treatment but nowadays it seems they are dying in there. It's safer being in prison as at least inmates on suicide watch are checked every 10 minutes.' Ms Turner said she believes her sister hanged herself as a 'cry for help' and thought staff would be keeping an eye on her. Mrs Williams' sister Lisa Turner said she believe staff shortages are to blame for her death . Wayne Williams said his wife had begged to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act after being admitted . Mrs Williams' husband Wayne, 47, a caretaker at Sabden Primary School in Lancashire said: 'This is the third time she has been to A&E and she has attempted suicide twice before and every time she has been discharged at the end of the night. Plain and simple she should have been watched. They would have had her medical records with her past history. She should not have been allowed to close the door. He added: 'The fact someone could take their own life in an A&E is disgusting. There should have been one-to-one checks or someone sat with her. No one called me to let me know she was even there. So she didn't have anyone there for her. 'If someone had checked her records they would realise not to leave her alone. If they had just made a phone call to me then she would still be here today. We would have had a conversation, I could have calmed her down and it would have been fine. I feel sorry for whoever found her. She shouldn't have been in A&E.' Mrs Williams' family including her daughter Demi (left), husband Wayne (centre) and son Reece (right) said they feel they have been let down by the broken system of the NHS which led to staff shortages that evening . Mrs Williams had twice attempted suicide and is pictured with her daughters, Jade and Demi in 2011 . Lisa Turner (left) and Demi (centre) said NHS cuts are directly to blame for the death of Jacqueline (right) Mr Williams is to make a formal complaint about the treatment of his wife. The family were called to the hospital at midnight on the evening she died, and told by staff to come quickly because she was very poorly. When they arrived they were told she was dead. An inquest was opened and adjourned earlier this week. Dr Ian Stanley, Acting Medical Director at East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'Our sympathies are with the patient's family at this very difficult time. This tragic incident is now the subject of a coroner's inquest and the Trust will be undertaking a multi-agency investigation into the circumstances that led to this and for this reason, we are unable to comment further.' Concerns have previously been raised about a lack of support for patients with mental health problems at Blackburn’s emergency department. Mr and Mrs Williams married in 2006 and the widower says he is to make a formal complaint to the hospital . Last year, the Care Quality Commission highlighted delays for patients requiring psychiatric assessments, and ordered the hospital to carry out a review of its facilities and resources. It found that despite an agreement for mental health practitioners to respond within one hour of being called, staff and managers said this was ‘frequently not achieved’. The hospital’s procedures were also called into question after a 53-year-old male patient, Terence Mullin, hanged himself in the Medical Assessment Unit, which works closely with the emergency department. He was admitted in January last year after taking an intentional overdose of insulin, and had been assessed by a mental health liaison nurse as being at high risk of further suicide attempts. Coroner Michael Singleton criticised the hospital’s safeguarding procedures during an inquest last summer, which prompted a ‘thorough review and improvement plan’. The death of Mrs Williams may also pose questions for Lancashire NHS Foundation Trust, which provides the mental health liaison service with the hospital. When asked if the hospital was a member of the Psychiatric Liaison Accreditation Network, created by the Royal College of Psychiatrists to assure and improve psychiatric care in hospitals, the trust said it was ‘considering joining’. Bosses at the Royal Blackburn thought the Network was not available to them, as they do not provide the liaison service, but a spokesman for the Royal College said it is open to ‘any hospital and any emergency department’.

"Islamic militants overran parts of Iraq's second-largest city of Mosul today, driving security forces from their posts and seizing the provincial government headquarters, security bases and other key buildings. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency. The fight for Mosul was a heavy defeat in Baghdad's battle against a widening insurgency by a breakaway al-Qaida group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which has been trying - with some success - to seize territory both in Iraq and neighboring Syria. Scroll down for video . Smoke rises from burning buildings and cars in Mosul, Iraq after Islamists militants seized the city yesterday . Children are among the 150,000 people who have fled the city where gun battles now rage . Earlier this year, the group captured . another Iraqi city, Fallujah, in the west of the country, and . government forces have been unable to take it back after months of . fighting. The far larger Mosul is an even more strategic prize. The city and surrounding Ninevah province are a major export route for Iraqi oil and a gateway to Syria. Regaining Mosul poses a daunting challenge for al-Maliki. The city has a Sunni Muslim majority and many in the community are already deeply embittered against his Shiite-led government. Thousands of the city's residents are now refugees seeking safety in other parts of the country . Burning vehicles belonging to Iraqi security forces seen during clashes with al Qaeda-linked Islamic militants . During the nearly nine-year American presence in the country, Mosul was . a major stronghold for al-Qaida and U.S. and Iraqi forces carried out . repeated offensives there, regaining a semblance of control but never . routing the insurgents entirely. Islamic . militants and Iraqi troops have been fighting for days in Mosul. But . Monday night and into early Tuesday, the government forces in the city . appeared to collapse. Insurgents . overran the Ninevah provincial government building in the city - a key . symbol of state control - in the evening, and security forces fled many . of their posts. The fighters stormed police stations, bases and prisons, capturing weapons and freeing prisoners. On . Tuesday, Mosul residents said the militants appeared to be in control . of several parts of the city, raising the black banners that are the . emblem of the Islamic State. Thousands fled as Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki pressed parliament to declare a state of emergency . One refugee said: 'The situation is chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us' The residents spoke to The Associated Press by telephone on condition of anonymity, fearing for their safety. In . a nationally televised press conference Tuesday, al-Maliki asked . parliament to declare a state of emergency, acknowledging that militants . had taken control of 'vital areas in Mosul.' He said the public and . government must unite 'to confront this vicious attack, which will spare . no Iraqi.' State TV said parliament would convene on Thursday. Under the constitution, parliament can declare a 30-day state of . emergency on a two-thirds vote by its members, granting the prime . minister the necessary powers to run the country. Legal experts said . that could include powers to impose curfews, restrict public movements . and censor the media. 'What . happened is a disaster by any standard,' parliament speaker Osama . al-Nujaifi - a Sunni from Mosul - said in a televised address. 'The presence of these terrorist groups in this vast province ... threatens not just the security and the unity of Iraq, but the whole . Middle East,' he said. He . said militants had seized helicopters at Mosul airport and captured . weapons depots, and captured several villages and a military airbase . further south in Salahuddin province, he said. Residents began fleeing Mosul - though the size of the flight was not yet clear. A . government employee who lives about a mile from the provincial . government building, Umm Karam, said she left with her family Tuesday . morning. Two Iraqi army officers said security forces had received orders to leave the city after militants captured the Ghizlani army base in southern Mosul and set more than 200 prisoners free from a high security jail . The retreating army and police forces set fire to fuel and ammunition depots in order to prevent the militants from using them, the Iraqi officers said . 'The situation is . chaotic inside the city and there is nobody to help us,' she said, . speaking on condition she be identified by a nickname for fear of her . safety. 'We are afraid ... There is no police or army in Mosul.' The . assault in Mosul is also a sign of Iraq's reversals since American . forces left the country in late 2011. Militants ramped their insurgency . back up over the past two years. The Islamic State has presented itself as the Sunni community's . champion against al-Maliki's Shiite-led government as the group fights . on both sides of the border in what Iraqi officials have said is an . attempt to carve out an enclave for itself in western Iraq and eastern . Syria. The group, which . was once al-Qaida's branch in Iraq, was thrown out of the terrorist . network after it expanded its operations in Syria against the orders of . al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri. It is considered one of the most . ruthless rebel forces fighting to topple President Bashar Assad in . Syria, where it has in seized a major city in the east and other . territory. In Iraq, the . group rose up earlier this year to take over Fallujah and parts of the . nearby city of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province. It has also been . carrying out a campaign of bombings and other violence in Baghdad and . other parts of the country. In . the Mosul fighting, insurgents armed with machineguns and . rocket-propelled grenade launchers stormed the provincial headquarters . building late Monday, overpowering guards in a short firefight, . according to Ali Mahmoud, the media official for Ninevah province. He . confirmed accounts by Mosul residents that many of the police and army . forces that had been stationed in the city had disappeared by Tuesday. Provincial . governor Atheel al-Nujaifi, the parliament speaker's brother, was in a . nearby guest house. He managed to escape the area and left the city, . though he continues to monitor the situation, Mahmoud said. On Monday, the governor had urged residents to fend off the attackers. 'I . call upon the men of Mosul to stand firm in their areas and to defend . them against the strangers and to form public committees in their . districts to help their people and to protect their areas,' he said in a . transcript of a speech posted online.","Captured by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant - an offshoot of al Qaeda .

"After nearly a century of business, struggling electronics retailer RadioShack has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and says it will sell up to 2,400 stores. The company announced Thursday that up to 2,400 of its 4,000 U.S. company-owned stores will go to General Wireless, an affiliate of the Standard General L.P. hedge fund, according to the company's announcement. RadioShack has been on life support for quite some time, but the decision of the New York Stock Exchange to suspend its trading on Monday forced the company to pull the plug. Scroll down for video . RadioShack: After nearly a century of business, struggling electronics retailer RadioShack has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and says it will sell up to 2,400 stores . CEO: RadioShack worked hard on its turnaround efforts, hiring Walgreen Co. executive Joseph Magnacca (photographed) as its CEO in 2013 . The Fort Worth, Texas company said Thursday that it was also having discussions to sell all of its remaining assets. 'These steps are the culmination of a thorough process intended to drive maximum value for our stakeholders,' Joseph Magnacca, RadioShack CEO, said in the statement. But the bankruptcy will not include the company's more than 1,000 stores in 25 other countries, stores operated by its Mexican subsidiaries, or its Asia operations. RadioShack Corp. introduced one of the first mass-market personal computers and used to be the go-to stop for consumers' home electronics needs. But it struggled as shoppers increasingly shifted to making purchases online and growth in its wireless business slowed. It has suffered years of losses.

Still, its CEO (photographed) recently cautioned the chain might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay in business . The NYSE suspended trading of its shares on Monday and sought to delist it. The NYSE requires companies meet certain market capitalization thresholds to remain on the exchange. RadioShack had warned of a possible bankruptcy in September, but received rescue financing that kept it afloat. Still, its CEO recently cautioned the chain might not be able to find a long-term plan to stay in business. RadioShack worked hard on its turnaround efforts, hiring Walgreen Co. executive Magnacca as its CEO and former Treasury Department adviser Harry J. Wilson as chief revitalization officer. It also developed relationships with popular brands like Beats Audio and redesigned almost half of its U.S. locations — some 2,000 stores — in an effort to entice younger shoppers. Its efforts to revitalize the company's brand image failed to pay off and retailer's shares, which were lower than $1 in the beginning of 2015, dropped to $0.24 when the NYSE suspended the company's trading, according to The Verge.

"Britain has threatened an immediate break in intelligence sharing with Germany if it continues to insist on airing secret GCHQ documents in public, it has been claimed. A German magazine claims a crisis meeting was held in Berlin this week to discuss the biggest rift between secret services since the end of WW2. America, which operates closely with Britain, has threatened the same boycott which will essentially strip Germany of the protection of the two best intelligence agencies in the world. The head of the intelligence service, Gerhard Schindler (pictured) had met with German politicians to ask them to drop the demand for British intelligence documents . Focus Magazine, known for its strong links with the BND, the German equivalent of MI6, reveals details of the 'deep partnership crisis' in its forthcoming issue to be published on Saturday. A senior security source told the magazine: 'Without the information supplied by Anglo-Americans, we will be blind.' It would mean high-grade information on jihadists, their movements and terror plans as discovered by London and Washington and directly involving Germany, would cease immediately to be passed on. The upheaval has been caused by left-wing and green politicians still fuming over the spying activities carried out in Germany by America's National Security Agency, which allegedly involved the eavesdropping on Chancellor Angela Merkel's personal mobile telephone. It hinges on a German government request asking Britain to release details of secret operations in Germany to its committee currently probing NSA and other foreign spy agency activities in the country. Phone hacked: The affair risks further straining ties with Washington which were damaged by revelations last year of mass surveillance of German citizens by the U.S. National Security Agency, which included monitoring Chancellor Angela Merkel's (pictured) mobile phone . The move was forced by politicians of the hard-left Die Linke and the environmentalist Green parties, and the official Berlin letter seeking documents was sent to British intelligence a little over a week ago. Both Britain and America are fuming. Both have refused to send any of the requested files to Germany. Included among them was a demand for information about a 2013 operation handled by both countries - and in co-operation with the BND - which was, and remains, top secret but was known to involve a massive surveillance programme on suspected Islamic terrorists across Europe. Britain fears a 'big debate' in the German parliament which would lay open secret sources and intelligence gathering techniques. 'Never has a friendly nation been asked to divulge its secrets in this way,' said one BND source. 'It is outrageous and we completely understand the fury that this has unleashed in Whitehall. 'The British have a horror of secrets being revealed. If they and the Americans withdraw co-operation, it would be catastrophic for Germany. The rift between the secret services came after a German government request asking Britain to release details of secret operations in Germany to its committee currently probing into the NSA affair (pictured) and other foreign spy agency activities in the country . It would brand Germany among the community of nations as a country not to be trusted to share intelligence aimed at combatting terror and spying by hostile governments. It would make us a pariah.' Gerhard Schindler, the president of the BND, met politicians concerned with the enquiry on Wednesday to ask them to drop the demand for British intelligence documents. Chancellor Merkel is known to be angry herself at the high-handed stance of the left and greens but is treading a fine line in a country where many citizens remain outraged at the extent of foreign intelligence snooping in their country. Britain has no intention of releasing one single classified document to the Germans but is threatening the breach nonethless should the demand for them continue. German confirmed the meeting on Wednesday between Schindler and lawmakers but had no further comment on 'security matters.'","A crisis meeting was held in Berlin to discuss the rift between secret services .

"In less than two weeks, Fifty Shades of Grey fans will be queueing up for their popcorn and pic n’ mix, as they get ready to watch the steamiest Hollywood film in a decade. The hotly-anticipated blockbuster is reported to have no less than 12 sex scenes between actors Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, with whips and blindfolds to boot. But what was it really like to film those scenes? Could either of them actually have got turned on? What do you think about when pretending to enjoy being naked with a man or woman other than your partner? And is there some sort of etiquette to follow? Scroll down for video . Actress Claire Kahane, 28, from London, (pictured) has had several sex scenes in her movie career, including opposite in the James Bond film Skyfall. She tells FEMAIL about bedroom etiquette and how awkward it is to fake sex . To answer these (and many more) questions about making love on film, FEMAIL spoke to the actress Claire Kahane, who has taken part in several sex scenes in her movie career. Claire, 28, from London has faked making love on camera in her starring role in the 2014 film The Maid, had a steamy bedroom scene with a Dolce & Gabbana model in 2013’s Head Spinner and was the body double in sex scenes for the James Bond film Skyfall. Claire talks us through the ins and outs - so to speak – of doing it on camera. She reveals all about faking an orgasm face, pulling pranks on your bedroom co-stars and what it’s like to have several people watching you in the throes of passion. Claire in a love scene with the actor Adam Senn in the 2013 film Head Spinner . Is there an etiquette guide when taking part in a sex scene? Make sure you brush your teeth, be washed and have deodorant on. Also, I wouldn’t have anything like cheese and onion crisps beforehand and I’d check if the guy was allergic to seafood, because in that case I wouldn’t have something like a prawn salad. As a rule, you don’t use tongues when kissing, but if the director wants it and no one objects, then you will use tongues. Is it embarrassing? I used to be a showgirl, which I guess is why I don’t mind being nude. Generally, it’s a closed set, so the people in the room are really only the ones that have to be there, but there are still about six of men and women present. There’s the director, the first Assistant Director, the producer, the director of photography, possibly a make-up artist and then the sound guy with a massive boom hanging over your head. So it’s a little less embarrassing than the whole crew in there watching. Claire was a body double in love scenes in James Bond film Skyfall . How do you make it less awkward? You discuss everything before you do it, so nothing comes as a surprise. It’s very choreographed and a lot of the time you rehearse it a bit beforehand, so you know what you’re doing. When I did Head Spinner, I had only known the actor for a few hours before we had to do the love scene. We actually took ourselves offset and we talked about everything that we were going to do, what we’d wear, what we wouldn’t wear, how we’d kiss, so it doesn’t come as a surprise. How do you make sure that X-rated parts don’t get caught on camera? Normally the girls wears pasties (nipple plasters) and sometimes a flesh-coloured G-string, or tape over your lower area. Some men wear a cup, stuck to you with body tape so there are no bits around the back or the side. Claire reveals that she and Adam had a lengthy conversation about what they would do in their sex scene before it took place . How do you make sure that you don’t get carried away? It’s not as sensual or intimate as it comes across on screen at all, I mean there’s a crew in the room. There’s a big furry boom right over your heads to capture every noise and cameras really close up around the sides of the bed or wherever you are. It’s all very different to how it comes across onscreen. It comes down to having to feel in the moment and feel the way your character does, of course, in reality you’re hot and sweaty and uncomfortable but you have to show that you are in the throes of passion. How do you make it look like you are enjoying it? When I did Head Spinner, we had to show everyone who was watching that we were completely comfortable with each other and completely in love because our characters had been together for a really long time as boyfriend and girlfriend. If the director wants you to feel excited or whatever, you have to show that onscreen, so it just comes down to behaving the way your character would. The director tells you what he wants every step of the way, for instance, “Walk through here, sit on this part of the bed, he lies down first, you take his clothes off, touch her face” and so on. You don’t want any surprises, you want to know the position you will be in at all times. The upcoming Fifty Shades Of Grey film is expected to have several raunchy love scenes . How long does it take to film a love scene? You do more than one take but you get there in the end. I have never done something longer than a day. The longest I have done it for is half a day. Do you do a lot of dieting and exercise to prepare for your body being naked on camera? As an actress you have to keep yourself pretty trim anyway, so maybe just a few extra sit ups in the days leading up to it. As an actress, Claire has had to take part in several love scenes . Are there any tricks to make it look more realistic? From the side is always a really good angle because you get the silhouette and you can imply a lot from a side angle. But there isn’t really any way of getting around being close to each other, you just are. There is a make-up artist there to make sure it looks realistic enough, so if they want it to look hot and sweaty then they will spray some oil. Does anyone ever do pranks? Yes, you have to because you have to lighten the mood as it is quite intense when you’re in that situation. So you do things like drawing smiley faces on your pasties, so that when he takes your bra off, he gets a funny shock, that sort of thing. You have to lighten the mood and do a lot of fun with it. How do you fake an orgasm face? Well I always ask the director what he sees the character doing, because the director knows a lot about the character. But you also know if they are a shy person, or really outgoing, or what the relationship is with this person. So is it that character’s husband, or are they somebody you shouldn’t be sleeping with, I think that is kind of generally shows how you would portray a climax scene. It’s not like where porn stars just scream and that’s that, there’s a lot more to it. Do you think Hollywood love scenes are creating an idea that is impossible for a person in real life to achieve? I don’t think so. All of my love scenes have been very normal. I don’t think they have been abnormal ways of intercourse.

"Older women are fuelling a middle-age travel boom, using their landmark 50th birthdays as a reason to head off the beaten track for  adventurous holidays in exotic locations, a survey has found. Many are ditching lazy beach holidays and relaxing cruises in favour of treks to far flung destinations - and they are increasingly willing to backpack, and go solo. The study of 3,500 British women, found 42 per cent are more confident about travelling when they get older and are keen to step out of their comfort zone. Older women are fuelling a middle-age travel boom with increasing numbers jetting off to exotic, far-flung locations on their own, a survey has found . A quarter want to explore more remote places around the globe and meet new people. And four per cent are after a physical challenge. According to the research, conducted by clothing company Cotton Traders, almost half (42 per cent) say they feel more daring about travel in their forties and fifties. And three quarters (74 and 78 per cent) said a beach break or cruise would no longer be their first choice of holiday. As a result more than half (52 per cent) have already been away on their own, with 15 per cent) making a solo trip in the last year and 12 per cent in the last five years. Another one in 20 (six per cent) haven't taken the plunge yet but would like to join the Far Flung Fifties Club sometime soon. One in four women said the focus of their trips in their forties and fifties was exploring somewhere remote . How they spend their holiday also reflects this new-found sense of adventure. One in four (22 per cent) said the main focus of their trip was exploring somewhere remote, while 26 per cent were keen to meet new people. A further (four per cent) wanted to get stuck into some kind of physical challenge on their travels and three per cent were planning volunteer work. As a result they are willing to head further afield. While traditional destinations like Europe and North America are still attractive, more exotic climes are gaining in popularity too. Almost one in 20 (four per cent) named South East Asia as their favourite place to get away from it all, while a curious one per cent said East Africa or South America were their top travel picks. And wherever we travel, we seem to be doing it in some style -  with one in eight splashing out more than £3,000 and another one in four working to a £1,000 annual budget. Many older women are ditching  relaxing cruises in favour of treks to far flung destinations - and they are increasingly willing to backpack and travel solo . The number of trips we take isn't insubstantial either. The majority (79 per cent) regularly travelled overseas twice a year, while a lucky 17 per cent took four foreign breaks each year. And although FFF love travelling solo, when they do take a plus one, their partner tops the list of holiday companions named by 77 per cent as the person they'd like to share the experience with. Shona Jameson, Head of Marketing and eCommerce at Cotton Traders, said: 'For many women middle-age is the perfect time to travel and reaching the 'Far Flung Fifties' often prompts people to look for more exciting, more fulfilling places to visit. 'Often these FFF are women who have already raised a family or achieved a lot in their careers so want more interesting leisure time too. 'They're inspirational bunches who want to try new things, share their life skills and enjoy quality time for themselves and with loved ones.'","Women now feel 'more daring' about travel in their forties and fifties .

"A Kurdish primary school teacher has spoken of how she quit her job to fight ISIS on the frontline near Kobane in Syria. Denis Sipan left her school in the Syrian part of Kurdistan five months ago to join the a rebel enclave of the Kurdish People's Protection Units(YPG) as a sniper. The Kurdish forces made fresh advances yesterday near Kobane, where ISIS surrendered last week, bringing the number of recaptured villages to 50, . Scroll down for video . Hero: Denis Sipan left her job as a primary school teacher to become a sniper on the frontline . 'If we didn't do it, the whole place will be full of ISIS, and they'll destroy everything,' Denis Sipan told CBS News. When asked what it would take for her to give up fighting and go back to teaching, Ms Sipan replied:  'I don't think that's going to happen. 'I need to protect myself, my friends, my people, and my country.' She also revealed that although the YPG and rebel groups are making advances against ISIS, they are woefully under-equipped and she is forced to share her rifle with another sniper. Ms Sipan fights alongside local volunteers, a group made up of wheat-farmers, housewives and shop owners, using weapons they have bought on the black market. Frontline: Ms Sipan now fights for Kurdish forces as a sniper, trying to hold off and push back ISIS . Making moves: Kurdish forces made fresh advances yesterday near Kobane bringing the number of recaptured villages to 50 . Fighting on: The rebels are so under-equipped that Ms Sipan has to share her rifle with another fighter . Last night, The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the YPG, backed by rebel fighters such as Ms Sipan, 'are continuing to advance in the countryside of Kobane, facing no resistance from the ISIS'. 'As soon as the YPG enters into a village, the IS withdraws its fighters,' Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman said. After nearly five months of fighting for Kobane, which is strategically located in Kurdish Syria on the border to Tyrkey, the YPG recaptured the town last Monday. Battles then broke out for the 350 villages surrounding the town, out of which 50 have been reclaimed by the Kurdish forces . Motley crew: The rebel group Ms Sipan is part of is made up of volunteers from the local towns and villages, comprising housewives, teachers, farmers and shopkeepers . One win: After nearly five months of fighting for Kobane, Kurdish forces recaptured the town last Monday . Final blow: Airstrikes by the US-led coalition were the main reason why extremists were forced to withdraw from the town, according to two of the group's fighters . 'The number of villages reclaimed by the YPG... has risen to 50,' the Britain-based group said. The YPG's advances come amid fresh US-led coalition air strikes against IS positions around Kobane. According to the Pentagon, coalition warplanes carried out 11 strikes against IS positions in the area from Tuesday to Wednesday morning. The Observatory says 10 IS militants have been killed in fighting around Kobane since the Kurds reclaimed the town.","Denis Sipan, a former teacher, joined the fight in Syria five months ago .

"A bus driver who has been off work with depression for seven months after the sudden death of his daughter following childbirth has been sacked. Robert Parkisson, 62, from Greater Manchester, lost his child Lisa, 35, last June, just two days after she gave birth to her son Zac. Mr Parkisson was diagnosed with reactive depression and has been on sick leave ever since but has lost his job for failing to give bosses a date for his return. He said: 'I understand that I will have to return to work at some point, but at the moment it just isn't possible. I wish the company would understand that and be a bit more supportive. Bereft: Bus driver Robert Parkisson, centre with grandson Zac, has been told he has been sacked after being off work with depression for seven months after the death of his daughter Lisa after Zac's birth. Pictured are Lisa's mother Judith Smith and her sister Ally Ziemniak . Tragedy: Lisa Parkisson, 35, died in June, just two days after giving birth to her son Zac at the Royal Oldham Hospital, pictured . 'When I'm behind the wheel and I'm carrying a bus full of passengers, I'm responsible for their safety. 'But, with how I feel at the moment, I just couldn't drive the bus. Sometimes I lose concentration and drift, sometimes I just break down into tears'. Seven months to the day since Lisa's death, Mr Parkisson claims he was handed 90 days' notice by First Group and told he was losing his job for failing to tell them when he will be returning to work. Mr Parkisson, who has worked at First for more than 10 years, said: 'It is a disgusting way to treat someone while they are grieving for their daughter. 'I'm just a number to them. All they care about is me coming back to work. 'They don't care about me as a person. It is so disrespectful to my daughter's memory.' Mr Parkisson spends his time with his ex-wife, Lisa's mother Judith Smith, and her sister Ally Ziemniak. He added: 'The whole family is still grieving we rely on each other to get through each day. We are all devastated.' Lisa, from Derker, gave birth via a Caesarean section, but was found unconscious by a midwife early on the morning of June 23, two days after giving birth. A team of eight medical professionals were unable to revive her. Her family paid a heartfelt tribute to Lisa, a cruise consultant with Cruise 118, in the week following her death. Much loved: Lisa, 35, (pictured) was described as a a 'beautiful and funny' girl who had an 'infectious personality' Loss: Lisa gave birth to Zac following a Caesarean section but was found unconscious by a midwife early on the morning of June 23, two days after giving birth . They described her as a 'beautiful and funny' girl who had an 'infectious personality'. Her baby son is being cared for by her sister Ally in Watersheddings and is growing into a healthy, happy little boy. His granddad said he is proud of the way the youngster is developing and the pair share a close bond - as well as a name, as Lisa gave her son  Mr Parkisson's middle name. Mr Parkisson said: 'First Bus keep asking me for a date to return to work but I just can't give them one. 'When I'm behind the wheel and I'm carrying a bus full of passengers, I'm responsible for their safety. 'But, with how I feel at the moment, I just couldn't drive the bus.

'I've spoken to three doctors, my own and two that were sent by the company, and they all agree that I am just not able to give a return to work date. The news of Mr Parkisson's job loss was made all the more difficult  as it came on the same day the family received the latest report into Lisa's death. Mr Parkisson said: 'The coroner's office have been very good with us, keeping us up to date with their inquiries as there are still further reports to be done. 'We have so many questions about Lisa's death but we are no nearer to any answers. 'Every few weeks when we receive a new report or a bit more information, the grief just hits us again. We are constantly being reminded of that day. 'But we have had barely any other support from anyone else and to find out that I've lost my job as well has just been too much for us all to take.' A date for the inquest into Lisa's death has yet to be finalised as more reports are still to be prepared. In a statement a spokesman for First Group said the company could not comment on Mr Parkisson's case but added that it does have polices in place to support and engage with employees after a bereavement. The spokesman said: 'We cannot comment on individual cases but we do follow very clear and supportive policies in such cases. 'We absolutely recognise the support required when our colleagues suffer close bereavement. 'Such support includes a company confidential support line, counselling services and face-to-face meetings at work or at home as well as trade union support.'","Robert Parkisson, 62, claims he was sacked after failing to return to work .

"A 10-year-old schoolboy has become a virtual rock star after notching up 1.4 million views on a video playing the guitar. Toby Lee from Bloxham, Oxon, has appeared on BBC Radio Two and a Seattle-based rock and blues radio station after stunning fans with YouTube footage of his performances. In his most recent rendition, the schoolboy sports a red and white uniform to belt out a version of AC/DC's hit, Thunderstruck, in honour of his idol Angus Young. Scroll down for video . Ten-year-old Toby Lee has amassed a fan-base any modern rock star would be proud of, with more than 1.4million people having watched his performance online . Within days of the clip being shared online, hundreds of thousands of people had viewed it - with countless more sharing it on social media. By January 29, more than 1.4million people from around the world had pressed play. Far from letting his new-found fame go to his head, 10-year-old Toby said there was still room for improvement. 'I'd give my guitar playing 9.5 out of 10 because no one is perfect. 'I play the blues and rock and roll but I don't sing, I really hate singing.' Among Toby's fans in the music world is blues legend Bernie Marsden and Mick Box, lead guitarist of Uriah Heep. The talented took an interest in music from a young age, picking up the ukulele aged four. 'I got the ukulele when I was four and started to play the guitar when I was six. The schoolboy said he was surprised by the number of people who had viewed his clips online . A star in the making: In homage to his idol, AC/DC's Angus Young (right), Toby dons a school uniform for his performance of the hit Thunderstruck . Toby took up the guitar at the age of six after learning to play the ukulele. The youngster's father said he has 'always' been passionate about the instrument . Among Toby's musical idols is blues singer Bernie Marsden (pictured above). The 10-year-old has famous fans of his own, with BBC Radio's Chris Evans praising his talent in the past . 'I'm not sure where liking rock came from, but I listen to it all the time now and my mum and dad quite like it. 'I just love playing and when we put the videos up on Facebook I thought they would have about ten people look at them. 'When I found out more than a million people had seen it, that was a surprise.' Toby's father, Terry Lee, said he is 'delighted' his son has gained so many fans at such a young age. 'Toby's always been very passionate about the guitar. He's always strumming in the back of the car on his way to school,' said Mr Lee, a photographer. 'I shot a few videos of him playing at home and put them on Facebook and within a few days over a million people had watched them including people in America. 'He's only ten but is already getting fan mail. It's amazing and we're delighted his music is being appreciated by so many people.'","Toby Lee has been playing the guitar since he was just six-years-old .

"Man's best friend has not been around for nearly as long as thought. A new study claims that the remains of a supposed dog dating to 31,680 years ago actually belong to a wolf. This brings the emergence of modern dogs forward by some 15,000 years. Scroll down for video . 3D analysis showed the skulls were in fact those of wolves - not the earliest dogs as claims in other studies . The finding follows the reclassification of two fossil skulls, one more than 30,000 years old, that were the basis for dating dog domestication. Researchers used 3D computer imaging to study the 31,680-year-old fossil found at Goyet Cave in Belgium, as well as a 13,905-year-old fossil found at a site called Eliseevichi in Russia near Lake Baikal. Their results suggest both skulls were in fact those of wolves - not the earliest dogs as claimed in other studies. This means that the earliest fossil evidence for domesticated dogs still dates to about 15,000 years ago - a time when humans started forming permanent settlements and farming, said the team. The team used scans and 3D visualisation software to study the shape and size of the two skulls and compare the data with measurements from the skulls of other dogs and wolves - both modern-day and ancient . 'Scientists have been eager to put a collar on the earliest domesticated dog,' said biologist and study co-author Abby Drake of Skidmore College, New York. 'Unfortunately, their analyses weren't sensitive enough to accurately determine the identity of these fossils.' It may come as no surprise to most dog owners, but canines became domesticated simply to make it easier to get food, researchers have said. In a study last year, they found that the key difference between wolves and dogs is that centuries of eating human food has meant dogs possess genes for digesting starches, allowing them to thrive on a human diet. The Swedish team say the dog's love of human food supports the idea that dogs became domesticated by lingering around human settlements. While it’s possible that humans might have gone out to take wolf pups and domesticated them, it may have been more attractive for dogs to start eating from the scrap heaps as modern agriculture started,' said Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, a geneticist at Uppsala University in Sweden, who led the work. Lindblad-Toh and her team catalogued the genetic changes involved in domestication by looking for differences between the genomes of 12 wolves and 60 dogs from 14 different breeds. Their search identified 36 regions of the genome that set dogs apart from wolves, and the team believe these are the reason dogs are so much more friendly than wolves. Drake and a team used scans and 3D visualisation software to study the shape and size of the two skulls and compare the data with measurements from the skulls of other dogs and wolves - both modern-day and ancient. The same technology had previously been used to study human fossils, but never to identify members of the canid family, Drake told AFP. It allowed the team to identify subtle morphological differences between dogs and wolves, such as the direction of the eye cavity and the angle between the muzzle and forehead. 'Our study provides a new and more accurate method for determining if a fossil is a wolf or a dog,' Drake said, adding the findings demonstrated that other measurements used until now 'are extremely inaccurate'. 'We were able to determine if a skull was from a dog or wolf with 96 per cent accuracy,' she said. Many scientists believe that dog domestication started when ancient wolves started scavenging on waste dumps near human settlements. The dog is estimated to have split from the wolf anything from 7,000 to 30,000 years ago. It was a relatively short time ago, 200 years or so, that the first breeds were named and breed standards introduced, said Drake. Since then, 'we have seen an explosion in dog diversity.' The dog was likely the first animal to be domesticated by man - a key step in the development of modern human civilisation. 'People are inherently interested in dogs and we have influenced their evolution,' Drake said of the motivation for the research. 'They are such a part of our lives. Knowing when domestication of dogs took place in the course of human history is important to our story and theirs.' esearchers used 3D computer imaging to study the 31,680-year-old fossil found at Goyet Cave in Belgium, as well as a 13,905-year-old fossil found at a site called Eliseevichi in Russia near Lake Baikal .","Researchers in New York used 3D imaging to study two ancient skulls .

"Farming has been blamed for turning modern-day men into weaklings, and now agriculture has been linked to causing dental problems. Before the introduction of agricultural processes, hunter-gatherers had what has been dubbed as ‘perfect harmony’ between the shape of their jaws and the size and alignment of their teeth. But as farming became more widespread, and food became easier to chew, jaws shrunk and in turn triggered the beginnings of a condition known as malocclusion and dental crowding. Researchers from the University College Dublin analysed the lower jaws and teeth of 292 skeletons from the Levant, Anatolia and Europe, dating back between 6,000 and 28,000 years ago. They discovered that hunter-gatherers had an almost ‘perfect harmony’ between their lower jaws and teeth (example pictured) Researchers from the University College Dublin (UCD) analysed the lower jaws and teeth dimensions of 292 skeletons from the Levant, Anatolia and Europe, dating back between 6,000 and 28,000 years ago. This included hunter-gatherers, semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers, transitional farmers, and farmers. Skeletons were studied from different regions in order to rule out specific geographic anomalies. In the case of hunter-gatherers, the scientists from UCD, led by Professor Ron Pinhasi, Israel Antiquity Authority, and the State University of New York, Buffalo, found a correlation between inter-individual jawbones and dental distances, suggesting an almost ‘perfect’ state of equilibrium between the two. Malocclusion is the medical term for teeth that are out of position. It can occur as teeth develop in children as a result of certain behaviours, such as thumb sucking, or an injury to the teeth or bones of the face. Many cases of malocclusion do not pose serious health concerns. However, if malocclusion is not corrected, it can affect the appearance of the teeth and the shape of the face. Severe cases of malocclusion can also make it difficult to eat, or clean  teeth. Today, malocclusion and dental crowding affects around one in five people in modern-world populations. While in the case of semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers and farming groups, they found no such correlation. This suggests the 'harmony' between the teeth and the jawbone was disrupted during the shift towards agriculture. The researchers believe farming practices led to changes in diet that directly impacted the shape and structure of the jawbones. For example, the diet of a hunter-gatherer was based on ‘hard’ foods such as wild uncooked vegetables and meat. By comparison, the staple diet of the sedentary farmer is based on ‘soft’ cooked or processed foods like cereals and legumes. Eating soft cooked foods requires less, chewing which in turn lessened the size of the jaws. However, instead of the farmers’ jaws and teeth simply being smaller versions of their ancestors’, the jaws reduced in size while the teeth kept the same dimensions. Without adequate space for the teeth in the mouths of farmers, this led to malocclusion – the misalignment of teeth - and dental crowding. Today, malocclusion and dental crowding affects around one in five people in modern-world populations. ‘Our analysis shows that the lower jaws of the world's earliest farmers in the Levant are not simply smaller versions of those of the predecessor hunter-gatherers, but that the lower jaw underwent a complex series of shape changes commensurate with the transition to agriculture,’ said Professor Pinhasi. But, the jaws of semi-sedentary, and farming groups showed signs of dental crowding (pictured). The experts said farming led to dietary changes that impacted the structure of the jaw. Hunter-gatherers needed stronger, larger jaws to chew 'hard' foods, but sedentary  farmers ate ‘soft’ foods, which required less chewing . The experts measured the jaws (pictured), and found that the farmers’ jaws and teeth weren't just smaller versions of their ancestors’, instead, the jaws reduced in size but the teeth kept the same dimensions. Without adequate space for the teeth, this led to malocclusion - the misalignment of teeth . ‘Our findings show that the hunter gatherer populations have an almost ‘perfect harmony’ between their lower jaws and teeth,’ he explained. ‘But this harmony begins to fade when you examine the lower jaws and teeth of the earliest farmers’. The findings are published in the journal Plos One. Last year, separate research, covering a period of more than 7,000 years of human evolution, revealed modern-day skeletons are lighter and more fragile than those belonging to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. In fact, the bones of our early ancestors were comparable in strength to modern orangutans, but once farming spread, these bones became 20 per cent weaker. Research from the University of Cambridge, covering a period of more than 7,000 years of human evolution, recently revealed modern-day skeletons (pictured bottom) are lighter and more fragile than those belonging to our hunter-gatherer ancestors (pictured top). They studied hip joints on ancient femurs . Research from the University of Cambridge - covering a period of more than 7,000 years of human evolution - recently revealed modern-day skeletons are lighter and more fragile than those belonging to our hunter-gatherer ancestors. In fact, the bones of our early ancestors were comparable in strength to modern orangutans, but once farming spread, these bones became 20 per cent weaker. Researchers used X-rays and CT scans to study ancient samples of human femur bones, along with femora from other primate species. In particular, they focused on the inside of the femoral head - the ball at the top of the femur which fits into the pelvis to form the hip joint. The bones studied covered four distinct archaeological human populations. The trabecular, mesh-like structure was found to be similar in all populations, but  hunter-gatherers (left) from 7,000 years ago had a much higher amount of actual bone relative to air than agriculturalists (right) just 1,000 years later . The structure was found to be very similar in all populations, but the hunter-gatherers had a much higher amount of actual bone relative to air. This thickening is the result of constant loading on the bone from physical activity as hunter-gatherers roamed the landscape, seeking food. This exertion would result in minor damage that caused the bone mesh to grow back stronger and thicker throughout life - building to a 'peak point' of bone strength, which counter-balanced the deterioration of bones with age. Bone mass was around 20 per cent higher in the foragers - the equivalent to what an average person would lose after three months of weightlessness in space. And after ruling out diet differences and changes in body size as possible causes, researchers concluded a drop in physical activity are the root cause of degradation in human bone strength across millennia.","Researchers analysed lower jaws and teeth of 292 skeletons from the Levant, Anatolia and Europe between 6,000 and 28,000 years ago .

"A comedian has taken a hilarious stand against pompous foodies and the 'contrived' cuisine that is found at so many top restaurants by 'opening' a fake eatery which serves a select menu of minuscule portions which are small enough to fit on a knife blade. Danny Palumbo, from Austin, Texas, and his brother Anthony came up with the concept for minimalist restaurant Abbrev's - which is short for abbreviated - after growing tired of seeing so many food critics singing the praises of a pretentious and over-the-top dish known as a 'deconstructed BLT'. 'It was pork belly, romaine lettuce and grilled heirloom tomato on a plate - separately,' Danny told ABC News. 'I was like, ""Well, this is ridiculous and contrived"" so we started talking about doing awful, pretentious things with food.' Hope you're hungry! Abbrev's menu includes a number of minuscule meals, like this steak and potato dish which is served on the blade of a knife . For your eyes, only: Mostly Garnish is listed on the menu as being intended strictly for 'observation' Funny guy: Danny Palumbo founded the 'restaurant' alongside his brother Anthony . Thus, the concept of Abbrev's - a restaurant specializing in serving up pretentious portions of ridiculous finger food - was born. And while the restaurant itself is entirely fake, Danny invested a great deal of time and energy into its website, ensuring that it would appear to the uninitiated as an entirely legitimate eatery - so much so that it is rumored more than one food fan has actually tried to track down the non-existent venue in the hopes of enjoying one of its signature micro-meals. The menu lists a selection of weird and wonderful signature dishes, including Mostly Garnish, which is clearly labeled as being for 'observation only', meat n mash, a bite size steak and potato dish served on the blade of a knife and f.g. tacs - tacos which are are prepared on a toothpick. And if you're feeling to full to even think about taking on one of those dishes, never fear - Abbrev's also boasts an 'Even Less' section to its menu, which features dishes such as micro micro green salad, Tun N' Foie, which is so small it must be viewed under a magnifying glass, and charcüt, a selection of near-invisible cold meat cuts. Tiny tacos: This Mexican-inspired dish is served on a toothpick . Carb overload: The restaurant also offers a petite ravioli and meatball dish . Only the best: While the portions may be small, the restaurant promises the quality of its ingredients cannot be outdone . Danny insists that all of the ingredients used in the menu images are the real deal and admits he went to extraordinary lengths in order to achieve the highest level of authenticity. 'I made foie gras tacos,' he said. 'And maybe we could have used something that looked like foie, but I was like, ""No it's gotta be foie"". Commit to the idea.' He added that he spent a total of $300 preparing the Abbrev's site, including paying for someone to draw on fake tattoos to his skin for his 'chef's' profile picture. 'Abbrev's is another one of our heavily financed concept restaurants,' the brothers explain on the website. 'At Abbrev's, we serve abbreviated versions of food. Each dish is less than a bite, not even a morsel. 'A minimal nourishment restaurant with a focus on leaving you still hungry - the hope is to create an entirely new dining experience where the ""eater"" is only somewhat satisfied but thoroughly intrigued.'","Abbrev's is the brainchild of Danny Palumbo, from Austin, Texas .

"Boko Haram fighters have massacred more than 100 people in the north Cameroon town of Fotokol. Militants from the terrorist Islamist group murdered residents inside their own homes and at a mosque on Tuesday. Many of the dead were found with their throats slit, according to a local newspaper. The raid comes amid a major offensive by Cameroon and its neighbouring African states against Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in Nigeria and  begun to mount increasingly bloody cross-border raids. Boko Haram fighters attacked the north Cameroon town of Fotokol on Tuesday until they were driven out by Cameroon and Chad forces (pictured) 'Boko Haram entered Fotokol through Gambaru early in the morning and they killed more than 100 people in the mosque, in the houses and they burned property,' said the civic leader Abatchou Abatcha, whose own son was shot dead during the raid. Cameroon's information minister Issa Tchiroma said the Cameroon army had pushed Boko Haram out of the border town after heavy fighting, which killed 50 militants and six of its own soldiers. The Sunni Muslim jihadist group is seen as the main security threat to Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and top oil producer which will hold a presidential election on February 14. On Thursday, extremists on the run from the three-nation offensive took revenge on civilians in Fotokol, shooting and burning scores to death and razing mosques and churches. Cameroonian officials said more than 500 wounded people are trapped in the town where fighting continued Thursday. They said Boko Haram fighters are using civilians as shields. The African Union last week authorised a regional force of 7,500 troops to fight the militants. In neighbouring Chad, state television reported its army had 'completely wiped out' Boko Haram bases at Gambaru and Ngala in northern Nigeria on Tuesday, killing more than 200 militants with nine Chad losses. The raid comes amid a major regional offensive (pictured as Chadian and Cameroonian soldiers defend against the jihadists) in Cameroon against Boko Haram, which has killed thousands and kidnapped hundreds in neighbouring Nigeria . Cameroon's information minister Issa Tchiroma said the Cameroon army, supported by Chadian forces, had pushed Boko Haram out of the border town after heavy fighting, which killed 50 militants and six of its own soldiers . Chadian TV footage on Wednesday showed jubilant Chadian soldiers cheering near to the bodies of what it said were two Boko Haram fighters. Chad and Cameroon are deploying thousands of troops and Niger has reinforced its border against the militant group which has been fighting for five years to create an Islamist emirate. But analysts say they are facing an uphill battle against a sect that has already seen off major offensives by Nigeria's military. 'Whether through intimidation, opportunism or genuine support for the radical Islamist cause, local communities continue to swell Boko Haram's ranks,' said Roddy Barclay, senior Africa analyst at consultancy Control Risks. Chad, reputed to have one of the region's best militaries, has carried out air strikes on insurgent positions over the last few days.  France is also sending aircraft from its base in the Chadian capital to carry out surveillance missions in the border area.","Boko Haram fighters had attacked the north Cameroon town of Fotokol .

"Bobbi Kristina Brown's family members are gathering around her hospital bed to say goodbye, five days after she was found face-down in a bathtub, it has been reported. A doctor told the family of the 21-year-old, who is in a medically-induced coma with minimal brain activity, that nothing more could be done for her, People magazine reported. 'Everyone is coming to the hospital to say goodbye,' a family member told the magazine. Bobby Brown was pictured heading to the hospital on Wednesday with his wife Alicia Etheredge and his other daughter, LaPrincia. Bobbi Kristina is his daughter with Whitney Houston. 'Bobby has been crying nonstop since yesterday,' the source added. 'We are grieving.' Scroll down for video . Fears: Bobby Brown and wife Alicia Etheredge head towards Emory University Hospital on Wednesday morning to visit his daughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, who was moved to the facility on Monday . Heading to her side: They headed to the hospital with another of his daughters, LaPrincia, on Wednesday . TMZ reported that doctors have told Bobby Brown that it's time to withdraw life support - but that he wants to wait until after the weekend. Today is his birthday. Some reports claimed the young woman was brain-dead but this has not been confirmed. Still, family members are hopeful that she could pull through, they told the magazine. 'It's sinking in that this is it,' one said. 'But we're all still praying that God will intervene and heal her body.' The devastating news comes as a friend of Bobbi Kristina's claimed he was the one who called 911 after finding her in the bathtub on Saturday - not her 'husband' Nick Gordon. Max Lomas, who has previously been arrested on drug distribution charges, claims Gordon was ‘elsewhere in the residence’ and it was he who removed her from the tub. Lomas’ lawyer told Access Hollywood on Wednesday that it was his client ‘who began the process of hopefully helping her recover.’ ‘Max was actually the one that found her and he’s the one that removed her from bathtub and called 9-1-1, and Max is the one who began the process of hopefully helping her recover,’ said Phillip Holloway. According to Holloway, the experience was traumatic for his client. The couple's friend Max Lomas is claiming that he found Bobbi Kristina and not her partner Nick Gordon who he says was 'elsewhere' ‘He was terrorized. It was absolute pure panic, and he was frightened for his friend, his close friend who was not breathing and did not appear to show any signs of life. He's petrified,’ Holloway said. ‘And he wanted to get her the help that she so desperately needed at the time.’ Max Lomas claims he was the one to call 911 after finding Bobbi Kristina unresponsive in her bathtub . According to Holloway, Gordon arrived in the bathroom he started CPR on Bobbi Kristina as Lomas did not know how to conduct life-saving measures. ‘Max assisted in the best of his ability - he's not trained in CPR – but he's the one who removed her from the bathtub and called 9-1-1,’ Holloway said. While the Roswell Police Department is no longer commenting on the incident, Holloway said Lomas is considered a witness, not a suspect, and is cooperating with authorities regarding the case. ‘He's absolutely not in hiding, no,’ Holloway told Access. ‘In fact, we're doing all we can to cooperate to find out exactly what happened to Bobbi Kristina, and under what circumstances. That's everybody's goal, including Max.’ Lomas was arrested on January 15 and charged with weapons offenses, marijuana possession and possession of an anxiety drug. Holloway says Lomas pleaded not guilty and the arrest is unrelated to the discovery of Brown in the tub. It has also emerged that police are looking into the possibility that eye-witnesses may have fled the scene after Bobbi Kristina was found on Saturday morning. Roswell Police Detectives are investigating whether people fled before officers arrived and have been asking local businesses if they saw anything suspicious that morning, E! News reported. Nearby bank employees told detectives they saw nothing but police have requested surveillance footage, sources told the website . Heading to her side: The couple, who married in 2012, have remained tight-lipped about Bobbi's condition . Bobbi Kristina is being treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta after being moved from North Fulton Hospital on Monday, WXIA reported . She remains in a medically-induced coma and is breathing with the help of a ventilator. During tests for brain activity, she briefly opened her eyes and doctors have found 'minimal' improvement in her brain function. Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend. Bobby Brown has had his own share of drug troubles, including how he admitted to using 'an awful lot' of cocaine after marrying Whitney Houston in 1992. 'I think I was bored,' he previously told VH1's Behind the Music. 'I had just gotten married and things weren't right. Unfortunately, I turned to alcohol and drugs.' He was also previously arrested for drug possession, including in 2002 when he was found carrying marijuana while speeding - just months after he was taken to hospital by his concerned wife and friends. In 2000, he also spent 26 days in a Florida jail for violating probation on a 1996 drunken-driving charge by not submitting to a drug test. Other, more recent troubles have included a 2012 arrest for DUI and a stint in rehab in August of that year for alcohol addiction - before being arrested for another DUI just three months later. In 2013, he served just nine hours behind bars after pleading no contest to suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol. Vigil: Gordon was pictured outside the North Fulton Hospital, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken, on Sunday . He has remained tight-lipped about Bobbi Kristina's condition, only saying on Monday that the young woman was continuing to fight for her life. But on Tuesday, he spoke out again through his lawyer to correct reports that his daughter had married Gordon. Following Houston's death three years ago, Bobbi entered into a relationship with Gordon - a sort-of step-brother after her mother welcomed him into their home when he was 12. Then last January the couple announced that they had got married, and Bobbi Kristina posted photos of their 'wedding rings' on social media. But on Tuesday a lawyer representing Bobbi's father released the following statement: 'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina.' 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon,' added Christopher Brown of Brown & Rosen LLC. Relations between Gordon and  other family members have been rocky and he remains subject to a protective order barring him from being within 200 feet of Bobbi Kristina's aunt, Patricia Houston. Bobby has five children; LaPrincia, 24, is his daughter with Kim Ward, from who he split in 1991. Bobbi Kristina is his only child with Whitney Houston, whom he divorced in 2007.

"French President Francois Hollande has warned that diplomacy with Russia  'cannot go on forever' as world leaders prepare to meet Vladimir Putin to discuss and end to the war in Ukraine. Speaking at a news conference in Paris this morning, Hollande said he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will go to Kiev this afternoon to produce a conflict-resolution deal that would be acceptable to all parties. But he told journalists that while France and Berlin had chosen diplomacy rather than arming Kiev troops against the pro-Russian separatists, negotiations could not drag on indefinitely. Earlier this morning US Secretary of State John Kerry arrived in Kiev to join the talks, with Hollande and Merkel confirming they will be travelling on to continue the talks with Putin in Moscow tomorrow. In a sign of the importance of the initiative, this will be Merkel's first trip to Moscow since the conflict in Ukraine broke out a year ago. Scroll down for video . Warning: Speaking at a news conference in Paris this morning French President Hollande said 'diplomacy cannot go on forever' as world leaders prepare to meet Putin to discuss an end to war in the Ukraine . Not forever: Francois Hollande told journalists that while France and Berlin had chosen diplomacy rather than arming Kiev troops against the pro-Russian separatists, negotiations could not drag on indefinitely . Big moment: In a sign of the importance of the visit, this will be Angela Merkel's first trip to Moscow since the conflict in Ukraine broke out a year ago . In a new push for peace in eastern Ukraine, the leaders of France and Germany this morning made the announcement that they were heading to Kiev and Moscow with a proposal to end the fighting. The surprise move came as the U.S. edged toward offering Ukraine lethal military aid as part of a new deal to help protect the country's borders. The flurry of high-level diplomacy aimed to end the resurgent fighting in eastern Ukraine that is threatening European security. France and Germany hoped this time they could come up with a peace deal that both Ukraine and Russia could agree to. Kerry is already visiting Kiev and in Brussels, NATO prepared to boost its forces today in response to Ukraine's unrest and Russia's increased military forcefulness. Fighting between Russia-backed separatists and government forces picked up in January after a month of relative calm, with more than 220 civilians killed in the past three weeks alone, according to the United Nations. The UN has sharply criticized both sides for indiscriminate shelling and called for a temporary truce. Talks: Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel have confirmed they will be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured with chief of staff of Russia's Armed Forces, Valery Gerasimov) in Moscow . Greeting: Earlier this morning US Secretary of State John Kerry (pictured shaking hands with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko) arrived in Kiev to join the talks . Arrival: John Kerry travelled to Ukraine this morning to show support for its embattled government as the Obama administration weighs sending arms to Kiev to help it fight Russian-backed separatists . At least three people were killed in overnight shelling in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, local officials said today, amid fierce fighting in several areas of eastern Ukraine. Hollande said he and  Merkel would travel to Kiev today and then to Moscow tomorrow, with a proposal 'based on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.' 'It will not be said that France and Germany together have not tried everything, undertaken everything, to preserve the peace,' Hollande said. Merkel's spokesman Steffen Siebert said 'given the escalation of violence in the past days, the chancellor and President Hollande are intensifying their months-long efforts for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine.' In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies that Putin, Merkel and Hollande will discuss 'what the three nations can do to help put a quick end to a civil war in southeastern Ukraine, which has exacerbated in recent days with mounting casualties.' Kerry came to Ukraine to show support for its embattled government as the Obama administration weighs sending arms to Kiev to help it fight Russian-backed separatists. He brought $16.4 million in new U.S. humanitarian aid but the Ukrainian government is anxious to use the visit to reiterate its plea for lethal aid. Members of the armed forces of the separatist self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic gather near an armoured vehicle destroyed during battles with the Ukrainian armed forces in Vuhlehirsk, Donetsk . An armoured vehicle and a building damaged during battles between pro-Russian rebels and Ukrainian government troops are seen in Vuhlehirsk, Donetsk region yesterday . An elderly woman reacts as her friends board a bus to leave Debaltseve, Ukraine as a result of the conflict . President Barack Obama has opposed the idea of sending weapons to Ukraine but sources in his administration say this position could change in the light of recent fighting. Officials with Kerry said he would discuss those needs with Ukrainian officials as well as new initiatives to resurrect a moribund cease-fire and resume a political dialogue to end the conflict. Germany remains fiercely opposed to sending arms to Ukraine, a position that German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier reiterated today. Speaking after meeting with his Latvian counterpart, Edgars Rinkevics, in Riga, Steinmeier said it would not improve the situation if 'we now bring more weapons to the region.' 'We believe that we must make another attempt to finally bring the violence to an end,' he said, according to the DPA news agency. In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the defense ministers meeting today are expected to approve boosting the size of the alliance's Response Force from 13,000 to 30,000, in reaction to Russian actions in Ukraine. Russia has vehemently denied allegations of helping the rebels in Ukraine . Pro-Russian rebels arrive at a hospital in Tekstilshik, Donetsk after it was hit by a shelling yesterday . The UN has sharply criticized both sides for indiscriminate shelling and called for a temporary truce . The diplomatic push to end the conflict, which has killed more than 5,000 people since last April, comes amid intensified fighting . The Kremlin acknowledged that Russian volunteers are fighting in eastern Ukraine but insists that Moscow has not sent its troops or weapons to help the rebels. Russia has expressed concerned about NATO's buildup in eastern Europe while defending a heavy military presence at its border with Ukraine. Hollande appeared to be offering a nod to Putin on one of his key demands: that Ukraine stay out of NATO. 'France is not favorable to Ukraine's entry into NATO, let us be clear,' Hollande said today. 'We have to speak the truth to all the countries that are around us. ... For the Russians who are worried ... We have to settle this problem among Europeans. We are on the same continent.' The news comes as EU leaders are expected to consider punishing new economic sanctions against Moscow next week, and as Germany hosts world leaders at a security conference over the weekend at which Ukraine is expected to be the main subject. Britain has confirmed it will make 1,000 troops available to a rapid reaction force in the Baltic. The creation of a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force to bolster the security of the alliance's eastern flanks was agreed when its leaders met for a summit in Wales last year. It will be on standby to deploy up to 5,000 troops within two to five days in the event of a new crisis to provide reassurance to allies who fear they could be the next targets of aggression from neighbouring Russia. UK armed forces will take the rotating lead role of the force in 2017. The RAF will also continue the deployment of four RAF Typhoon jets to upgraded airspace patrols over Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said the sustained fighting in Ukraine and Russia's continued arming and training of rebel forces was one of the greatest security challenges facing the world. It was vital, he said ahead of the gathering in Brussels attended by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, to 'make clear that Nato is determined to defend all Allies against any threats from any direction'. Mr Fallon said the UK would provide manpower to two regional headquarters - in Poland and Romania - and to force integration units in those countries as well as the three Baltic States and Bulgaria. 'Nato's credibility in the face of the security challenges we face depends on everyone playing their part to implement the decisions taken at Wales last year,' he said. 'The Readiness Action Plan demonstrates the Alliance's commitment to reinforce our collective defence but strong words must be backed up with firm action. 'That is why I am delighted to announce that the UK will lead the VJTF in 2017 and contribute to the Baltic Air Policing mission again in order to put the Plan into practice.' Around 3,500 military personnel are also taking part in a series of Nato exercises ths year intended to ensure a persistent alliance presence in the region while providing further financial assistance to the government in Kiev.","Francois Hollande and Angela Merkel are travelling to Ukraine today .

"Frozen: Ali Bunney, pictured with girlfriend Summer Pineda, died of hypothermia after a night out . A university student died of hypothermia after walking home from a night out in 4C temperatures wearing a short-sleeved shirt. Ali Bunney could have been four times the drink drive limit when he attempted the nine-mile trek along a dual carriageway just days before his 21st birthday, an inquest heard. Today a coroner said the student, whose full name was Jason Bunney but who was known as Ali, died of hypothermia contributed to by alcohol intoxication. But his mother Marissa hit out at the conclusion - saying she still believed he was taken by someone, dumped unconscious and left to die. Gloucestershire Coroner's Court heard Mr Bunney was 'swaying' sideways at a nightclub in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where he was celebrating the friend's 21st birthday after a day with his girlfriend Summer Pineda. He became separated from his friends in the early hours of February 9 last year and left the town's Subtone nightclub at around 2.30am, attempting to return to his home in Gloucester. Friends realised the Cardiff University student was missing, but after they were unable to raise him on the phone they thought he must have taken a taxi home. The student was found unconscious by a dog walker the next afternoon beside the A40 dual carriageway near Gloucestershire Airport. Despite the efforts of paramedics he died later that day in the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. Pathologist Dr Stephen Ferryman gave the cause of Ali's death as hypothermia secondary to alcohol intoxication. The doctor said that toxicology tests showed Ali had a urine alcohol reading of 167mg, one and a half times the driving limit, and a blood alcohol reading of 56mg, below the limit. But he said the readings would have been lower than they were 15 hours earlier, the time when Mr Bunney was last seen alive. He calculated the student's blood alcohol level could have been as high as 326mg, more than four times the drink drive limit. Solicitor Leo Goatley, representing the student's family, said the samples were not taken until three days after Mr Bunney's death and changes to his body could have artificially raised the readings. Family: Mr Bunney pictured second from right with his father Nigel, mother Marissa and brother Jefferson. A solicitor for his family questioned findings that the student could have been four times the drink drive limit . Missed: Mr Bunney, pictured right and with his girlfriend Summer Pineda (left), was celebrating a friend's 21st . 'The family are obviously distressed, knowing their son, that his death certificate indicates alcohol intoxication,' he said. 'I put it to you there was some scope for error on the issue of intoxication?' The doctor said he stood by his findings. The student had eaten a meal and friends described seeing him drinking pints of lager, glasses of cocktails and shots of spirits during the night out. Alexander Petrie, who was celebrating his birthday that night, told the hearing how Mr Bunney left his hooded top and coat at a friend's house after eating the meal. They went to a couple of pubs and carried on drinking cocktails, he said. 'I don't think Ali was too drunk - probably similar to me, I guess,' he told the court. 'At Subtone he had only one drink during the time he was there and I remember it was a rum and coke - he was drinking with one of my friends. Party: Mr Bunney had been at the Subtone nightclub in Cheltenham town centre (pictured) before his death . Dual carriageway: A dog walker found Mr Bunney near the A40 which connects Cheltenham and Gloucester . 'Later, my friend, who he was spending most of his time with, said 'Where's Ali?' and we couldn't see him. We checked the whole club.' Mr Petrie said it was at around 2.30am when his friend 'just disappeared'. He said: 'At that point I just assumed he had got a taxi home as he had done this on one or two occasions after a night out in Cheltenham.' Asked about the weather, Mr Petrie said: 'I remember it being very cold and I think it was raining quite a bit.' He also said the group of friends were not drinking heavily and Mr Bunney had drunk 'just as much as the rest of us'. 'I definitely cannot say how much he had to drink,' he added. Matthew Davis, another friend celebrating Mr Petrie's birthday, said he and Mr Bunney spoke regularly during the night. 'Ali was fine, he did not seem drunk,' he told the court in a written statement. Mr Davis said that by the time he was in the nightclub he was drunk - describing himself as 'eight out of 10' on a drunkenness scale - and he assumed Mr Bunney was as well. Response: Paramedics and a fire crew from the airport came to the student's aid but he could not be saved . One friend said of Mr Bunney (pictured with his girlfriend): 'Ali had a drink in his hand and was swaying' 'I guess he was drunk because we had been drinking a similar amount,' he said. Matthew James, who was also out that night, described seeing Mr Bunney unsteady on his feet in the nightclub. 'Ali had a drink in his hand and was swaying from side to side but did not look out of control,' he said in a written statement. The court heard police had received reports that a man was walking along the A40 at 3.15am but were unable to find anyone. At the start of the inquest Mr Goatley expressed concern  that a police officer due to give evidence would not be attending because of long term illness. Pc Simon Kilmister, who responded to the 999 call, said in a written statement that he travelled the 'whole length' of both carriageways of the by-pass in his patrol car but did not see anyone. But Mr Goatley said there were 'crucial questions' the family wanted to ask the officer about whether he did in fact check the whole length of the by-pass when asked to do so by his control room. 'He did half the journey and then didn't actually check up to the Gloucester end of the road,' said Mr Goatley. 'That raises the question about what sort of duty of care the police have to the public.' Family man: Mr Bunney with his brother Jefferson. The family questioned the thoroughness of police . Gloucestershire Coroner Katy Skerrett said the cause of death would be given as hypothermia caused by alcohol intoxication. 'This was a young man who had been out drinking with friends and had a very good, fun evening,' she said. 'He had been drinking a significantly large amount of alcohol during the evening with his friends. 'For whatever reason, he chose to depart from the plans of going back to a friend's house and it seems more likely than not that he was trying to make his way home. 'Due to the amount of alcohol he had consumed and this was a very cold and wet night - both those two factors got the better of this young man, which led to him being found. 'Everything was done to save him and I can find no criticism of the attempts to resuscitate him. 'The appropriate conclusion is a short-form conclusion. A tragic death and a short-form conclusion will be an alcohol-related death.' But speaking after the inquest, Mr Bunney's parents Nigel and Marissa questioned the coroner's findings. 'There are a lot of unanswered questions,' Mr Bunney said. His wife added: 'I don't believe he walked all that way. It's a mother's instinct. I don't believe he walked four miles in an hour - someone has dumped him there. 'I don't believe it is the right verdict. As a mother I believe he was dumped there unconscious but no one believes me.' Mrs Bunney also questioned whether the man seen walking along the A40 by a passing motorist was in fact her son. 'The witness was saying that he was wearing dark clothing - he didn't even see his face,' she said. 'He was inside the car, so he cannot be sure it was Ali. People do walk along the  by-pass.' Mrs Bunney added: 'I always pray for him and pray for justice for Ali.'","Ali Bunney, 20, walked home from club at 2.30am in temperatures of 4C .

"An extra three million people face being dragged into higher rates of income tax unless the Government acts to ease the burden on hard-working families, figures showed yesterday. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the ranks of workers paying the 40p ‘higher’ rate of income tax and 45p ‘additional’ rate will swell dramatically to eight million over the next decade under current plans – meaning around one in four taxpayers are hit. The warning about ‘fiscal drag’ – where tax thresholds do not rise as fast as inflation or wages – is likely to alarm middle-class voters who are forced to pay 40p in every pound they earn over £41,865 to the Exchequer. The news will pile pressure on David Cameron and George Osborne to outline how they intend to pay for the tax cuts they have promised if the Conservatives win a majority at the general election in May . The IFS said ‘politicians may come under pressure to increase thresholds’ in the coming years given how many people are expected to be drawn into higher rates of tax. Stuart Adam, an analyst at the IFS, said: ‘Ten years of fiscal drag creating more higher-rate taxpayers would leave a large fraction of the workforce paying higher-rate tax. 'It’s a big increase, and therefore might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with.’ It will pile pressure on David Cameron and George Osborne to outline how they intend to pay for the tax cuts they have promised if the Conservatives win a majority at the general election in May. The number of families losing some or all of their child benefit will more than double in the next ten years, the IFS said.The . It predicted that 1.2million families will have some or all of their child benefit withdrawn next year as austerity bites. But that number is expected to rise to 1.8million by 2020-21 and 2.5million by 2025-26. The IFS report blamed ‘fiscal drag’. It said the thresholds at which child benefit starts being withdrawn – one parent earning over £50,000 – and is then cut completely – £60,000 – are frozen. This means more and more families are hit as wages rise. The number of earners hit by the 40p tax rate has already soared from 1.7 million in 1990 to 3 million in 2010 and 4.6 million today. When combined with those paying the 45p ‘additional’ tax rate – which kicks-in on incomes of £150,000 a year – 4.9 million are paying more than the basic rate of 20p. Figures from the IFS yesterday showed that this number will soar to 6.3million in 2020-21 and 7.9 million in 2025-26 – or around a quarter of those in the UK who pay income tax. The 40p tax threshold is rising to £42,385 from April, and the Prime Minister and Chancellor have pledged to increase it to £50,000 by 2020. The policy has been opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The Prime Minister and Chancellor have pledged to raise the 40p income tax threshold to £50,000 by 2020 if the Conservatives win the general election. That would mean 900,000 fewer workers would be dragged into the higher rate of tax by the end of the decade than if the threshold rose by inflation as currently planned. But the Tories have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund such a tax cut amid ongoing austerity. The policy has been opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats. Critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in. One leading tax advisor said the 40p rate of income tax ‘was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune’. The number of earners hit by the 40p tax rate has already soared from 1.7 million in 1990 to 4.6 million today . Ryan Bourne, head of public policy at the Institute of Economic Affairs, said: ‘Higher marginal rates reduce incentives to work, so dragging more people into paying the 40p income tax rate would be bad economics. ‘Even with the implementation of an increased threshold of £50,000, the Treasury still expects the number of taxpayers paying higher tax rates to increase further to 5.5million people by the end of the next Parliament. ‘The Government should introduce legislation requiring all income tax thresholds to be increased annually by the higher of wage growth or inflation, to ease the burden on middle earners. Savings should come from spending restraint, not pernicious tax rises.’ The Chancellor used last year’s Autumn Statement to lift the 40p tax threshold to £42,385 from April this year – the first increase in line with inflation since 2010. But middle-class families are still being hit by so-called ‘fiscal drag’ as they are pulled into the higher rate of tax despite not earning huge sums of money. Tory MPs have urged Downing Street to act to ease the pressure on middle-class voters. Former Cabinet minister Owen Paterson recently said the threshold for the 40p higher income tax rate would now stand at more than £75,000 if it had risen in line with wages. The IFS said the ‘politicians may come under pressure to increase thresholds’ in the coming years given how many people are expected to be drawn into higher rates of tax. ‘10 years of fiscal drag creating more higher-rate taxpayers would leave a large fraction of the workforce paying higher-rate tax,’ said Stuart Adam, an analyst at the IFS. ‘It’s a big increase, and therefore might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with.’","Experts say workers paying the 40p ‘higher’ rate of income tax and 45p ‘additional’ rate will swell dramatically to eight million over the next decade .

"IT is the most infamous stretch of ground in Australia, the notorious Belanglo Forest where serial killer Ivan Milat took seven victims to rape, torture, hunt and murder them before burying their bodies in shallow graves covered with twigs. The lonely patch of scrub, just a turn off the highway 140km south-west of Sydney, still strikes fear in those who know the gruesome truth of what Backpacker Killer Ivan Milat did there, but it was a source of inspiration to his grand nephew. From a young age, Matthew Milat had an ambition. He wanted to be like his notorious uncle Ivan, the backpacker murderer whose reign of fear slaughtering hitchhikers has its own shocking place in Australian history. Scroll down for video . Sordid ambition: Matthew Milat (pictured being led into court during his murder trial) boasted about copying his infamous great uncle, the  backpacker murderer, Ivan Milat, and did just that, taking a 17-year-old to the killing field, the Belanglo Forest and murdering him with an axe . The legend: The gruesome exploits of serial killer Ivan Milat (pictured) who raped, tortured and killed seven backpackers chill the Australian public, but they excited his nephew who revered his uncle as a legend and chose the Belanglo Forest to murder David Auchterlonie . Killed on his birthday: David Auchterlonie (pictured) was lured to the Belanglo forest on his 17th birthday to drink beer and smoke cannabis, but was cruelly attacked by his two teenage 'friends' with a double-headed axe, and his death throes recorded on a mobile phone . Killing ground: Killed in the lonely Belanglo State Forest by Ivan Milat were, pictured, top left to right, Australian, Deborah Everist, Germans Anja Habschied and Simone Schmidl, bottom left to right, Joanne Walters of Wales, German, Gabor Neugebauer, Caroline Clarke of England, and James Gibson, an Australian . On Thursday night, a special episode of the Nine Network's Inside Story entitled 'Born Bad', explores the lives of three young men and Matthew Milat who as teenagers committed the most horrific of crimes. Their victims were also teens, and friends of their killers who showed them no mercy. As Matthew Milat said before he and his accomplice, Cohan Klein, set out for the fateful evening with a double-bladed axe, 'We’re going out to Belanglo and someone’s going to die'. It was November 20, 2010, David Auchterlonie's 17th birthday. He had celebrated the morning with his family near Bargo, a town 100km south-west of Sydney and his grandmother Sandra had given him $20 to spend. 'Babes in the wood': Forensic police carry a body from the Belanglo Forest after the remains of seven young backpackers were found tortured and killed and buried in shallow graves under twigs and leaves 'like babes in the wood' by serial killer Ivan Milat, whose nephew would later try to emulate his hideous crimes . Murder weapon: Matthew Milat drove David Auchterlonie to the Belanglo Forest where he pulled out this double-bladed axe (pictured) and taunted the 17-year-old before striking him in the head until he was dead . NO mercy: The final moments of Sandra Auchterlonie's (above) grandson, David, 17, in the Belanglo Forest include these cold, angry words of his killer, Matthew Milat: 'You wanna f***ing die man? Look at the f***in' dirt ... You keep looking at me and I'll cut your head off. Look at the ground c***' Shallow graves: the scrubland and outcrops inside the Belanglo Forest (above) 140km south-west of Sydney are unsettling even today, more than 30 years after Ivan Milat's backpacker killings, but just over four years after his nephew revisited the spot to carry out his own bloodthirstycrime . Matthew Milat and Cohen Klein, both 19,  lured him away with the promise of drinking and smoking cannabis in the area where Ivan Milat had murdered seven young travellers - two Australians, Two Britons and three Germans - in the early 1990s. Matthew Milat was the one in control. He had changed his real surname - Muleman, to match his great uncle's after leaving school, where he was remembered as a non-achiever and Cohen as a kind-hearted, quiet kid. With a fourth teenager, Chase Day, the young men drove to the forest. Auchterlonie was oblivious as to his companions' intent until Milat produced the quaint looking axe with the double head and began to threaten him before striking struck him on the head until 'Auchto', as the boys called him, was dead. Mad, bad and dangerous to know: Serial killer Ivan Milat had a cowboy and gun fantasy and raped, hunted and executed his victims - both male and female - before hiding their remains under brush in the forest south-west of Sydney . Stupid: Matthew Milat (pictured) changed his surname from Muleman to match that of his infamous uncle and then set out on a successful mission to murder, earning himself a 43 year sentence in the same prison system where uncle Ivan will eventually die in jail . Weapon of choice: Recreated in the Nine Network episode of Inside Story, Born Bad, Matthew Milat carries a double headed axe on what was meant to be a boys' night out, which ended in murder of a teenage boy and the sentencing of serial killer Ivan Milat's great nephewand another to decades in prison . Klein recorded the entire attack on a mobile phone. The audio records their torment of Auchterlonie, blow by blow, and his dying gutteral moan. It starts with the cold, angry voice of Matthew Milat saying, 'I'm being dead set Auchto, you wanna f***ing die man? You wanna f***ing get in my business?'. 'Look at the f***in' dirt Auchto. I am going to f***in' kill you if you keep f***in' movin'. Look at the ground and answer my questions.' David Auchterlonie is heard crying. A smirking Ivan Milat is led off in handcuffs during his 1996 murder trial for the serial killing of seven young backpackers who he raped and tortured . Milat then says, 'You keep looking at me and I'll cut your head off. Look at the ground c***. Tell me, is it true you have been going around telling people my affairs?' Auchterlonie: 'No it is not true, alright?' In several more exchanges, Milat again tells Auchterlonie to to look at the ground and to swear his innocence. Finally, Milat says, 'Yeah you give me your word and your word isn't f***in' good enough Auchto. I've had your word before and It aint worth a pinch of cold f***in' s***'. The next sound is of the axe striking Auchterlonie. The Nine Network's  programme features exclusive interviews with a witness to the crime and with members of the victim’s family, including his grandmother Sandra Auchterlonie. Also in this episode is a crime just as brazen and shocking. It is the story of two 16-year-old schoolmates in America who made a real-life version of the horror flick 'SCREAM'. Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik had such a passion for horror movies,they decided to make their own – a slasher movie with a real-life victim, their school friend from Pocatello High School, Idaho, Cassie Stoddard, while she was house sitting for a relative. Draper and Adamcik visited Stoddard and her boyfriend, left, then returned with masks, gloves, knives and black clothing. They cut off the house's electricity and then entered the house and stabbed Stoddart 29 times, nine times fatally. They captured  the episode on a video camera, from the moment they planned the murder in their school library through to the get-away as the two baby-faced killers, high on adrenaline, sped off into the night. Like Matthew Milat and Cohen Klein, their home-made horror movie would also be their downfall. All four killers are in prison. Matthew Milat is serving a maximum 43 years in the same prison system as Ivan Milat and  lost his appeal last October for a reduction of his sentence. The court did reduce the Cohan Klein's maximum sentence  by five years to 27 years, with an earliest release date of 2030. Following their arrest, Brian Draper and Torey Adamcik blamed each other. Both were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility for parole for first degree murder and 30 years-to-life for conspiracy to commit murder.

"David Lowe has been jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing 10 young boys in two schools in the 1970s and 1980s . A former housemaster at a prestigious Catholic private school has been jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing pupils. David Lowe, 61, took advantage of boys as they slept in their dormitory beds and during singing lessons at Westminster Cathedral Choir School, London's Southwark Crown Court heard. Lowe invited the youngsters to his flat and 'spanked' them when they had broken school rules. He also crept into pupils' dormitory and touched them  while carrying out night-time checks, his trial was told. Many of his victims studied at the £16,000-a-year choir school, while others were abused at the Benedictine monk-run Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire, where Lowe taught after leaving Westminster. The attacks, which took place between 1978 and 1984, were carried out on boys aged eight to 13. Sentencing Lowe today, Judge Martin Beddoe told him: 'All these boys were to some degree emotionally and physically vulnerable - some were more so than others. You took advantage of that and made it all the worse by what you did. 'What you did has remained more or less a secret for the best part of 35 years until now. But for the courage of all 10 complainants, in particular those most affected, a secret it would have remained.' A jury found Lowe, from Bristol, guilty of 15 counts of indecent assault on boys under the age of 14 following a trial last month. Lowe bowed his head in the dock throughout today's hearing and showed no emotion as his sentence was delivered. His wife and son were in the public gallery along with most of the retired teacher's victims, many of whom were supported by their wives and partners. Judge Beddoe said: 'All (of the victims) were entrusted to your care as a member of staff at school. That trust was seriously betrayed by what you did.' The judge said many victims were 'severely confused' at the time of the abuse, some of whom were 'unsure if it was right or wrong'. 'I'm quite sure you have caused a number of your victims serious psychological harm,' he added. Judge Beddoe said victims were left 'ashamed and embarrassed' by Lowe's 'selfish sexual acts', which had 'sullied' the reputations of two institutions. The court heard that some of the victims came forward after reports of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation into historic sexual abuse in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. Many of the victims felt Lowe had 'violated them all over again' by denying the offences and taking them to trial. The first of the offences took place at London's prestigious Westminster Cathedral Choir School (pictured) Following the sentencing, Tracey Emmott, solicitor for one of the victims, said: 'This is the best sentence the victims could have hoped for. Proper justice has been done. 'There has been a great deal of pain and this has enabled, certainly in my client, some closure. 'It's never complete and it would have been helpful if there had been evidence of remorse or contrition.' One former pupil told the court he was 10 years old when he was abused. The inappropriate touching began as 'massages' during piano lessons. In 1981, one of Lowe's victims complained about being repeatedly abused by him, and shortly afterwards the teacher left the prestigious school, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said. However, it was not long before Lowe started working at Ampleforth College, where he abused four of his 10 victims. The man told the trial: 'He called me upstairs, and I remember thinking ""Here we go again, I am going to get some more of this"". Lowe denied the charges, meaning his victims had to go through the stress and heartache of a lengthy trial . In mitigation, Sarah Elliott QC said father-of-five Lowe 'removed himself from temptation' by no longer working with boys under 13 after he left Ampleforth College. She said: 'Mr Lowe bears the burden that he has brought such misery and shame to his family.' Following the hearing, Detective Sergeant Kirstie Martin, of the Met's sexual offences, exploitation and child abuse command, said: 'David Lowe was a well-respected and talented teacher. 'He knew the boys he targeted felt hugely loyal to their schools and their teachers. He used this knowledge to abuse his position of trust in a truly terrible way. 'Despite the abuse, his victims, now all adults, somehow found the courage to relive their experiences. That courage has directly secured Lowe's conviction and we can only hope that they can now find some closure.'","Teacher abused boys aged eight to 13 in two schools in 1970s and 1980s .

"The Voice contestant Lisbeth Gonzalez Ruiz, 18, became the fourth victim of the Mexican show's curse after she was killed in a car crash . The Mexican version of The Voice is feared to be cursed after the show was rocked by a fourth death. Talented female singer Lizbeth Gonzalez Ruiz, who appeared as a contestant on the current series, was killed in a car crash. The 18-year-old was on her way to a performance with her twin sister Lizeth when their father lost control of his car and it overturned. Moments before the accident, the teen tweeted followers: 'I have never taken the highway at 3am #TengoMiedo' which translates into I'm afraid'. Friends of the teenager, who along with her sister had been signed to perform across Mexico after appearing on the show, said that she was aware of the curse and was fearful of it. The family was travelling between  Guaymas and Hermosillo, in the north-western Mexican state of Sonora, when the accident happened. Lizbeth's mother, father, sister and cousin, were all understood to have escaped without serious injury. The first victim of the 'curse' was the singer and judge Jenni Rivera, who was named 'La Diva of the band' among Mexican public. She died in a plane crash in 2012  on her way to the capital Mexico City to record a duet with her partner Paulina Rubio. She was 43-years-old and had five children. Lizbeth and her twin sister Lizeth appeared as a duo on season four of the hit television series . In season two presenter Jacqueline Bracamontes, 35, suffered the death of one of her twin babies, a boy, due to respiratory problems. And the rumours that the show was cursed started when tragedy struck again in season three, when contestant Gibran David Martiz, 22, who was in the team of music duo Wisin and Yandel, was found dead with one of his friends inside a car after a horrific crash.

"Starbucks has reported its first-ever UK profit, putting an end to years of losses that saw it avoid paying taxes in Britain. The coffee chain was branded ‘immoral’ by MPs for using a host of schemes that effectively funnelled money out of the UK and overseas. The practice allowed it to notch up losses, avoiding the need to pay corporation tax, despite reporting years of bumper sales. Profit: Starbucks made its first-ever UK profit of £1.1m after sales for the previous year were more than £300m . But the US giant yesterday reported a modest pre-tax profit of £1.1million in its British operations – a paltry amount given that sales for the previous year were in excess of £300million. The firm refused to issue details of its revenues in a highly unusual move. The small profit resulted in a meagre tax payment of just £232,363, a sum that is likely to be dwarfed by its multi-million pound revenues when it issues full accounts later this week. It paid an additional £11.2million in corporation tax, which it said was the final instalment of the £20million it offered to pay three years ago when faced with a consumer backlash. Starbucks faced protests and boycotts following revelations that it had scrimped on tax payments in the UK for years. It emerged the group had paid just £8.6million in corporation tax since coming to Britain in 1998, despite racking up combined sales of more than £3billion. UK boss, Mark Fox, said company's performance is a result of 'engaging with its employees, giving customers more and growing the business' The firm claimed this was due to high costs of renting its stores but an investigation uncovered payments made to the Netherlands and Switzerland for purchasing its coffee. The latest profit figures also are in stark contrast to comments made last year by UK boss Mark Fox, who said that the company needed to ‘get its mojo back’ before it returned to the black. Yesterday he said: ‘Starbucks UK is now showing a profit before tax, representing an important milestone for the UK business. ‘The company’s strong performance is the result of a turnaround strategy that has focused on engaging with our employees, giving customers more, growing the business and improving our model by rebalancing the store portfolio and carefully managing costs.’ The Seattle-based chain, which first opened in Britain on London’s Kings Road, said that over the past three years it had closed 67 unprofitable cafes. But it has opened more Starbucks franchises that have cheaper running costs. Mr Fox said Britain is the firm’s largest market across Europe. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said choosing not to reveal its sales figure was ‘rather odd’. He said: ‘We have consistently said that the way to avoid criticism is to give us all of the information, and be transparent. Starbucks haven’t given us the information.’ The European Commission has been investigating links between the Netherlands and companies that base themselves in the country for tax purposes. Starbucks moved its European headquarters to the UK from the Netherlands last year, just as the Brussels began investigating its tax affairs. But it still brews all of its European coffee in the country before selling it on to its businesses in other parts of the world, including the UK.","Starbucks made its first-ever UK profit - putting an end to years of losses .

'We are absolutely honored and ecstatic to collaborate with Disney on this line inspired by the live-action Cinderella movie,' Danny Haile, the CEO and creator of Gelish, said of the collection. 'For this classic story, we really wanted to create an iconic selection. Drawing inspiration from the movie, we were inspired to develop colors and statement glitters in soft, playful shades for the collection.' And when it comes to the film's younger fans, there is already a swathe of merchandise available, with Disney launching its own official collection of products online and in stores earlier this week - much to the delight of parents everywhere.

Profitable products: After Disney's Frozen-themed dolls sold out around the world, parents are eagerly buying up similar Cinderella items like these dolls, priced between $35 and $70, in order to avoid disappointment . 'Considering this is one of 3500 I would get yours before they are all gone,' one man said of the pricey dress - which is an exact replica of the gown worn by Cinderella star Lily James in the upcoming movie. But while the dress is currently still available, a trio of collectible pins inspired by the movie sold out on the Disney website within hours of being made available earlier this week. The limited edition set, which retailed for $69.95 and comes complete with a collectors box, featured three ornately-detailed designs - Cinderella, her iconic glass slipper, and one of the gold butterflies featured on her dress. Anyone desperate to get their hands on the set can however opt to purchase it on eBay, where sellers are asking for anything up to $300 in return for the limited edition collectibles. Similarly, a $20 ornament modeled on the glittering gold carriage which transports Cinderella off to the ball is also no longer available on the the official Disney website, but is already being sold by a enterprising seller on eBay for almost $50 - more than twice the original price. Must-have items: As part of its new collection, Disney has released new tsum tsums - plush collectibles - modeled after the movie's most popular characters including Cinderella (L) and the Fairy Godmother (R) Cashing in: JC Penney has also announced the launch of its own official collection of Cinderella products . Star in the making: British actress Lily James plays the role of Cinderella in the upcoming live action adaptation . Disney's newly-released collection of Cinderella-themed 'tsum tsums', collectible plush toys which can be stacked on top of one another, has also proved incredibly popular online. Film fans eagerly awaiting the launch shared their excitement on Twitter, with many admitting that they had stayed up until midnight so they could purchase the new tsum tsums as soon as they became available online. 'Me: laying on my bed ready to refresh the tsum tsum Disney store page at midnight cause Cinderella collection and new collection announcement [sic],' one person wrote, while a second admitted: 'I bought all of the Cinderella tsum tsums and I'm not even sorry.' And for anyone unable to get their hands on the perfect piece of merchandise from Disney, JC Penney will also be offering a special collection of official products in the hopes of repeating the same success it saw with its sales of Frozen products last year. 'What’s different about Cinderella is that it’s a known story line,' Deb Berman, JC Penney’s senior vice president of marketing, told Dallas News. 'It’s nostalgic for the grandparents, and everyone will want to see how Disney remakes the 1950 animated film today.'

"Investigation: Town councillor Bernard Borman is being investigated over claims that he called a motorist a 'smelly cow' A politician once dubbed the real-life Victor Meldrew because he complained to councils so often is now being investigated himself over claims he called a motorist a 'smelly cow'. Over the years Bernard Borman-Schreiber von Ullersdorf - a Prussian count - cost taxpayers £125,000 after he spawned 1,046 letters, faxes, and e-mails to and from his local council, who in the end gave him his own officer. Such was his dissatisfaction with local government that he stood as a candidate and was elected as a town councillor in Leyburn in North Yorkshire. But he is now facing a probe himself after a female motorist claims she was verbally abused by him after she parked across the street from his home. The woman, who did not want to be named, said: 'I parked up where I wasn't blocking anyone's driveway on either side of the road. 'As I got out of my car I heard shouting from the opposite side of the road. I realised that a gentleman standing in front of gates across the road was shouting at me to move my car, which was actually parked well forward of his gates. 'I was absolutely shocked and appalled - amongst other expletives I was called a 'stupid cow' and a 'smelly cow''. The councillor, who is better known as Bernard Borman, has said: 'Obviously, I regret it if I may have used inappropriate language.' But councillor Borman has disputed the motorist's version of events. He said: 'I politely asked the woman to move her car forward so that we could exit our driveway without complicated manoeuvres. 'It was she who started a shouting match and then refused to move her car.' Row: The councillor got into a row with a woman who parked opposite his drive in this North Yorkshire street . He added: 'I dare say that when one is confronted by rude and inconsiderate people, one may lose one's temper and say things which are not necessarily appropriate. 'I notice that the so-called lady failed to mention that she gave me two fingers and to distribute a story which is not accurate and to my detriment speaks for itself. 'Why could she not have moved a few feet further forward without causing an argument?' The woman has denied making an offensive gesture or being rude to him. Mr Borman achieved national fame in 2002 for being a serial complainer. Richmond Borough Council had to hold a special meeting about the mountain of paperwork his letters, faxes and phone calls created for them, and calculated it cost them £125,000. But Mr Borman said at the time: 'I eat, sleep and drink local authority laws. They're my hobby'. Then council chief executive Harry Tabiner said of his reputation: 'To compare this man to Victor Meldrew would be wrong. Some people sympathise with Mr Meldrew'. Probe: Leyburn Town Council, pictured, says they are 'obliged' to investigate and will warn him about his future conduct . The local authority even set aside an officer to deal with his correspondence, to which Mr Borman said at the time: 'I'm told I can only deal with an administration officer. It's an insult and I've written to complain.' Leyburn Town Council, which he is now a member of, estimated his complaints and queries to them had cost them £7,000. Today its chairman said his behaviour in the parking row had been 'unacceptable'. Chairman Trixie Walker said: 'We have to investigate it.  He has admitted he used inappropriate language and that was unacceptable for a councillor'. On his reputation for complaining she said: 'Bernard is an articulate and intelligent man but he does get frustrated by bureaucracy'. Mrs Walker added that she would be writing to him and warning him about his future behaviour. The incident was reported to North Yorkshire Police, although the force said it was not taking any action.","North Yorkshire councillor allegedly called woman 'stupid' and 'smelly cow'

"A powerful new ad campaign has launched to warn people about the dangers of indoor tanning beds by confronting them with their own mortality. New York-based agency Area 23 created the YouTube video ad for melanoma awareness organization Mollie's Fund, and set up a fake pop-up tanning salon in Manhattan to lure in passers-by, offering them a free solarium session. The participants are handed goggles and towels, but are shocked when they are led not into a tanning booth, but the scene of their own 'funeral', complete with a coffin, solemn music and assembled mourners. Dying for a tan: A powerful new video ad campaign for Mollie's Fund has launched to warn people about the dangers of indoor tanning beds by confronting them with their own mortality (pictured) According to Mollie's Fund, 10,000 Americans die of melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - every year, and indoor tanning is a 'major' cause. For the unsuspecting participants in the video, this is of clearly no concern, and they gladly accept the free offer. 'This is so cute!' exclaims one giddy customer. Participants are subsequently photographed for a 'before and after' series, then handed a towel and some safety goggles. Irresistible?

As they push the curtain aside expecting to enter a tanning booth, they are confronted with a makeshift chapel lined with benches of downcast black-clad mourners. 'Are you f***ing kidding me?' asks one bewildered participant. At the end of the room sits a tanning bed assembled to look like a coffin with a sign propped on its lid. 'In loving memory', it reads, alongside the earlier-snapped photo of the duped customer. 'You are gone but not forgotten.'

The truth hurts: At the end of the room sits a tanning bed assembled to look like a coffin with a sign propped on its lid . Actors: The chapel is lined with benches of downcast black-clad mourners . RIP: 'In loving memory', the memorial sign reads, alongside the photo of the duped customer. 'You are gone but not forgotten' When asked how the scene made them feel, one respondent states, 'I feel terrible', while another admits, 'I'm in shock'. 'This is my first time tanning,' claims a young girl. 'After this, never again.' The ad closes with a chilling statistic: 'Just one indoor tanning session increases your risk of melanoma by 20per cent.' Mollie's Fund was founded after sophomore college student Mollie Biggane, who died shortly after discovering a cancerous mole on her thigh at the age of 20. According to the foundation, more than one million new cases of skin cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year.","The video campaign was launched by Mollie's Fund to raise awareness for skin cancer .

"Struggle to find the right shade of lipstick? Never feel you can find foundation to match your skin? Well, it may surprise you to know that, for years, wealthy women have rejected one-colour-suits-all cosmetics in favour of having beauty products made specifically to suit them. And now — thanks to a raft of new High Street services — the rest of us can get in on the act, too. Alice Smellie rounds up the best bespoke beauty products at bargain basement prices. LIPSTICK . Cosmetics a la Carte offer a bespoke lipstick service at the Motcomb Street shop . Bespoke lipstick service, £50 per lipstick, at Cosmetics a la Carte, alacartelondon.com . Make an appointment at the pretty Motcomb Street shop, in London’s South Kensington, and you will be talked through the bespoke make-up of your choice: eyeshadow, foundation or lipstick. Foundations are blended to your skin tone and eyeshadows and lipsticks can be any shade you like. Compare this £50 price tag per product with the bespoke lipstick I have heard about, which would set you back more than £40,000 (the case is made of gold and is covered in jewels). I sit down with manager Laura Martin — these all take place in person — and she asks what I’m looking for. I know exactly what I want. Back in the Eighties, Rimmel made a lipstick called Black Cherry — a rich reddish purple which I wore throughout my teens. I’ve never found anything which suits me quite so well. The shop is literally packed with hundreds of lipsticks, so I select one that is similar, but too dark and not as sheer as my teen favourite. So Laura scrapes a little off this, then some from a rich lip balm with gold flecks and mixes them together with a brush on a small palate. It looks gorgeous when I try it on and I am transported back to my teens. ‘Wait a moment,’ says Laura. ‘Why don’t we add just a touch of rose pink?’ She mixes in a bit of a pinker lipstick and I apply it again. Without wanting to sound evangelical (or vain), it looks staggering. OK, £50 is a lot for a lipstick, but I waste so much money on shades which don’t suit me that I think it money well spent. VERDICT: I am presented with two stunning lipsticks — one the grown up version of Black Cherry and another a slightly (and admittedly more flattering) pinker shade. Nancy (after my grandmother) and Lara (after my daughter) are just perfect. 10/10 . PERFUME . The Perfume Studio hold events nationwide where you learn about perfume and create your own blend (picture posed by model) Perfume Studio, from £39, theperfumestudio.com . Master perfumer Francois Robert is the inspiration behind the business. This cheerful but austere Frenchman is a fourth generation perfumer whose father worked at Chanel in the Fifties. They hold events nationwide for 20-odd participants, where you learn about perfume and then create your own blend. I am astonished by the low prices. A high-end, bespoke perfume could easily cost £25,000. I meet with consultant manager Helen Janousek in Central London. Consultations and events are all in person, though once they have details of your perfume on the database, you can simply order more. She shows me an array of glass bottles, containing 18 blends of perfume oils, arranged in three sets of six and explains the three key notes of a perfume: the base, middle and the top. The plan is that you select three from these blends — one from each section — to create your own. I am invited to dip a scent strip (basically a strip of paper) into each one and smell it. I’m surprised at how easily I discard most of them — anything spicy is instantly put to one side. I especially like Green, which is reminiscent of damp grass on a warm June evening, and I also love a floral blend similar to Amarige by Givenchy, which I wear most of the time. When I have isolated my three favourite smells, they are poured into a bottle, and blended to create my own fragrance. Tempting as it is to call my perfume Smellie (the one time my surname comes in handy) I hold off, and call it Alice instead. VERDICT: The result is all of my favourite scents in one little bottle. It has the sweetness of Amarige, but with a hint of fresh grass. I am over the moon and waft happily through the next few days. A session would make an amazing present. 9/10 . FACE CREAM . Jennifer Young bespoke products start at £12 (picture posed by model) Jennifer Young, £40, jenniferyoung.co.uk . ‘I wanted to be able to offer bespoke products to everyone,’ says Jennifer Young when I ask her about her extraordinarily low prices. Consultations are either in person, on the phone or online and products start at £12. Bespoke face creams tend to cost at least as much as a week’s groceries. There is a beautiful, but pricey offering for £195 from The Organic Pharmacy and, this week, a new one was reported as being exclusively available at the Dorchester Hotel for an extraordinary £950, made with your own blood (yuck). So I am enchanted with the idea of having a face cream with my name on it, especially as people (my husband) are always stealing things from my bathroom shelf. Jennifer and one of her consultants come to meet me to talk through the process and she tries a few different oils on the back of my hand. ‘The ones which suit your skin sink in,’ she explains — macadamia nut oil leaves no residue but rosehip sits on the top. Next, she asks me to identify three key issues which I’d like to tackle in order to select the most beneficial essential oils. I think hard and decide on sleeplessness, mature skin and anger (come on, it’s winter). She suggests a soothing combination of lavender, bergamot and sandalwood. Two days later, my very own face cream arrives in the post. VERDICT: The originally named Alice’s Moisturiser is richly scented and cotton soft. I pat it onto my face after a bath and my skin feels deliciously smooth. Worth mentioning: having your name on a product doesn’t stop people nicking it. 7/10 . FOUNDATION . Protect and Perfect Foundation in Warm Beige, £16.59, boots.com . No 7 Match Made service, free in more than 900 stores nationwide, (Protect and Perfect Foundation in Warm Beige, £16.59, boots.com) Boots’ own brand No 7 has developed a gadget which takes a close-up shot of your skin then exactly matches it to one of their foundations. The accepted method of testing foundation along my jawline and then looking at it in daylight is so last decade. This is a mobile-phone-like device containing a camera, which, when held against your face, takes 27 individual pictures of the skin using LED lights, covering the whole colour spectrum. These pictures are analysed by the machine and every single element of your skin tone (looking at yellows and blues as well as light and dark) is matched to the ideal foundation shade. After a couple of minutes, the screen flashes up with the information that my ideal skin product is Warm Beige in Protect and Perfect Foundation. Clearly, the service is only applicable to No 7 products, although it can recommend products if you want to go lighter or darker than your natural skin tone (which is fairly likely in early February). VERDICT: It’s a perfectly pleasant foundation, evening out my skin and giving it a dewy finish. However, it’s a bit paler than I’d like ideally. A good service, but it feels a bit of a gimmick . 6/10 . FACE OIL . Facial oil, £40, skinbistro.co.uk . Award-winning scientist and skincare specialist Andrea Palluch makes bespoke products for anyone wanting a touch of luxury, as well as those who struggle to find the right products for specific skin needs. Her blends are made with completely natural and Fairtrade ingredients. Facial oils are gloriously moisturising. As it happens, I have just finished the final drops of one, which I can’t justify replacing in these belt-tightened post-tax-bill times. When I shop around, I find that a personally blended oil can cost £250 if you go to a luxury brand such as de Mamiel. Not a chance! I fill in the online consultation form, which is detailed — asking both skin condition and tone, skincare routine, diet and any medical conditions or allergies. Andrea writes back to me (you can also have a phone call) recommending that she use rosehip oil which is good for fine lines, camellia for intense moisturising, hemp, kiwi and avocado. VERDICT: Ironically, the bottle is similar to that produced by the expensive cousin and the oil is both blissfully moisturising on my skin and smells as though it cost at least twice the price. 8/10 .","Do you struggle to find make-up that suits your skin tone?

"An endangered killer whale who has spent almost her entire life performing in one of the smallest whale enclosures in the world may have only a few more hoops to jump through to earn her freedom. Lolita's 44 years in captivity at the Miami Seaquarium could be over after officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) placed her on the endangered species list with the wild orcas she was taken from decades ago. 'Captive animals such as Lolita cannot be assigned separate legal status from their wild counterparts,' the agency announced Wednesday, saying the change would take effect in 90 days. Scroll down for video . Captive: Lolita, a 7,000-pound orca, has spent almost her entire life performing in one of the smallest whale enclosures in the world, but after being listed as endangered could be set free . Though this would clear the way for activists to petition a federal court under the Endangered Species Act, officials at NOAA cautioned the ruling was not the agency granting Lolita her freedom. 'Whether or not she's ultimately going to be released, or not, is an issue we're not deciding today,' said Will Stelle, administrator of NOAA Fisheries West Coast region. The 20-foot, 7,000-pound whale has been the subject of campaigns from animal cruelty groups for decades, having been captured from the wild off the coast of Seattle in 1970, according to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). The Miami Herald reports that year a group of whale hunters using speedboats and explosives herded dozens of orcas from Lolita's pod into a 3-acre enclosure in Penn Cove. Lolita, who was originally called Tokitae, was bought for $20,000 and transported across the country to Miami. Seattle Post-Intelligence reported that Patricia Sykes, a former show assistant at the Seaquarium, recalled Lolita refused to move or swim after first arriving in Miami. Cramped quarters: Lolita has lived 44 years in an enclosure that activists say is 35 feet wide at its narrowest point . Wild creatures: Orcas swim together in Puget Sound off the coast of Washington State . Squeezed tight: Seen from above in this drone footage, Lolita's pen is only 35 feet across at the area where a concrete divider separates parts of the pool . 'She just barely floated,' said Sykes, who has also testified in favor of including Lolita on the list of endangered orcas. 'The skin on her back cracked and bled from the sun and wind exposure. She wouldn’t eat the diet of frozen herring.' She eventually began sharing a tank with another orca, Hugo, from the same killer whale resident community in Seattle, with whom Lolita mated but did not produce offspring. Hugo had a horrifying tendency to bash his head against the walls and windows of the small tank, and died of an aneurysm in 1980, leaving Lolita completely along in the enclosure. That tank, a petition to NOAA claims, is illegal because it is 35 feet wide at its narrowest due to a concrete divider that allows trainers an area to stand, though the aquarium claims it is 80 by 60 feet, . 'She's been there languishing in a bath tub for longer than . all but one orca in captivity,' said Jared S. Goodman, PETA's . director of animal law. Though a sale of the park last year to California-based Palace Entertainment gave some hope for Lolita to go free, so far nothing has changed about her captivity. The Miami Seaquarium has argued in the past that at this point, Lolita would far better living at the park than in the wild. They cite the case of Keiko, who played the killer whale in the 1993 movie 'Free Willy,' who died in 2003 after being released off Iceland, where he was rejected by wild pods. Animal rights groups like PETA support a plan to slowly introduce Lolita back into the water through an enclosure before releasing her to L pod, the group an 86-year-old orca believed to be her mother still lives with, according to the NOAA petition.","Lolita who has spent most of her life at the Miami Seaquarium could be released under the Endangered Species Act .
Activists have petitioned the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to have Lolita listed as endangered ."
"It's been more than 20 years since the original cast of Saved By The Bell walked the halls of Bayside High School. But on Wednesday the onscreen pals got together for a reunion on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, showing fans what they've been missing all these years. The passage of time has, of course, worked some changes on the actors who rose to international fame as teenagers. Scroll down for video . Hooray! On Wednesday the cast of Saved By The Bell reunited for  on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, featuring a clearly pregnant Tiffani Thiessen, Elizabeth Berkley, Mario Lopez and Mark-Paul Gosselaar . The pretext of the reunion was a parody of the beloved series with a twist, as Tonight Show host Fallon played the part of a new student at Bayside. But as the cameras rolled a few things became clear - the profound effect of time on the actors. Cherubic Tiffani Thiessen (who played cheerleader Kelly Kapowski), 41,  is pregnant with her second child with husband Brady Smith. High school sweethearts: Tiffani, pregnant with her second child, posted a photo with her former on-screen love on her Instagram (L) which proved they hadn't aged a bit since 1991 (R) Principal Belding: Dennis Haskins, 64, appears to have kept most of his thinning mane but has certainly acquired a more rotund figure over the decades, pictured on left in 1989 . Muscle man: Mario Lopez, also 41, appears to have turned back the clock, looking leaner and more muscular than he did 25 years ago at the show's inception . While Mario Lopez, also 41, appears to have turned back the clock, looking leaner and more muscular than he did 25 years ago at the show's inception. Dennis Haskins (Principal Belding), 64, appears to have kept most of his thinning mane but has certainly acquired a more rotund figure over the decades. Forty-year-old Mark-Paul Gosselaar (Zack Morris), however, doesn't appear to have aged a day and is currently enjoying a prosperous TV career, starring most recently in TNT's Franklin & Bash. Spot the difference! Elizabeth (L) didn't look a day older than she did while filming the show in 1991 (R) Time keeps on ticking: The passage of time has, of course, worked some changes on the actors who rose to international fame as teenagers . Brick phone: Gosselaar (right) is seen taking a phone call as he stands next to 'new student' Jimmy Fallon . And Elizabeth Berkley (Jessie Spano), while the oldest of the bunch at 42, is nearly identical to her 1990s self. Missing from the line-up was Dustin Diamond (Screech) and a Lark Voorhies (Lisa). Dustin is accused of stabbing a man during a bar fight on Christmas, while Lark has withdrawn from the limelight as she is reportedly battling bipolar disorder. Where was Screech? Dustin Diamond was recently charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon'; pictured in his mug shot (L) and in 1993 (R) Missing: Lark Voorhies who played Lisa (Screech's love interest) was absent from the reunion as she is reportedly battling mental illness, pictured in LA in May . During the evening Lopez took to Instagram to share behind-the-scenes snaps with his nearly 400,000 followers. In the photos, the Extra host barely looked a day older than his teenage self, wearing a pair of high-waisted bleached trousers and a bright blue short-sleeve shirt with black vintage print. Mario even showcased his former trademark hairstyle - curly locks with a mullet-like section in the back. In one of the pictures he is seen posing beside Gosselaar - who models spray-painted blonde hair. Flashdance? While in character for their skit, Mario busted out some impressive ballet moves . She's preggers! Kelly arrives on the scene with some big news . Nothing has changed: Jessie confuses Slater with an emotional outburst . The Franklin & Bash actor also donned his respective character's wardrobe - khaki trousers, a blue print shirt and a salmon button-up shirt over top - for the realistic parody. In their hilarious skit the group of stars are  joined by a new Bayside High student - Jimmy Fallon. As Jimmy stands at his locker he begins talking with Gosselaar and soon the duo are joined by Mario dressed as Slater. Spinning for joy: Mario showed off his incredible physique in a leotard . Oh oh! The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins . He walks in with a too-cool-for-school gait and greets them with, 'What's up, preppies?'. The three guys begin discussing the upcoming 'big Valentine's Day dance' and who they're each bringing as a date. A short time later they are joined by Mario's former flame from the show, Berkley. Mario rips off his attire, revealing a skintight black leotard, as he performs an impressive ballet dance. Team spirit: The five friends bonded as they discussed future plans . Hurrah! The parody came to a close as they all leaped for joy . Shortly after, Gosselaar receives a phone call from his beloved girlfriend, Kelly, played by Tiffani. As they wait for Kelly to arrive Jimmy confesses that he is moving to New York City. He says, 'I love it here but I want to be on Saturday Night Live. Host my own talk show, who knows, maybe one day, date Nicole Kidman'. The comedian pokes fun at himself following a recent awkward revelation on his show, in which Kidman said she had been interested in dating the star many years ago but thought he wasn't interested in return. The 'students' are then confronted by the school's principal Belding, played by Haskins. Reunited: Mario - who played A.C. Slater - and Mark-Paul Gosselaar - who played Zach Morris - were each dressed in their former character's favorite garb . Former TV flame: Mario also posed with co-star Elizabeth Berkley - also known as Jessie Spano - who he dated on the television programme . After he leaves Tiffani joins them in the hall way where she  announces she's pregnant, showing off a baby bump in her cheerleading uniform. Meanwhile, some of the other castmates have been experiencing some dark times. Dustin Diamond and his fiancee Amanda Schutz were arrested on December 25. He was charged with 'second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct and carrying a concealed weapon', according to People. Back to school: Elizabeth cuddles up to Mark-Paul . Also backstage: Mario then shared a picture with LA Lakers basketball star Kobe Bryant, who has been recovering from surgery on his shoulder . Diamond's onscreen love interest Voorhies (Lisa), who was also absent from the reunion, has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, according to her mother. Lark, now 38, has largely shied away from the spotlight following her tenure on Saved By The Bell, which wrapped in 1993, unlike her co-stars. Her mother told People Magazine in October: ‘There are things that have traumatised her. I care deeply about my daughter and I want her to resume her life.’ Special guests: Mario saved a snap of the Saved By The Bell signage from backstage of The Tonight Show . The 64-year-old shares a home with her daughter, who found fame aged 15, in Pasadena, California. But it seems Lark is not willing to face up to her condition. When asked by the magazine if she is suffering from any chronic condition including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, she responded: ‘Oh no. We’re alive in a major time of all-in-all prophecy.’ The Jehovah’s Witness also said her long lapses of silence during conversations were merely moments in which she is praying, and added: ‘I have a strong spiritual sense.’","Saved By The Bell ran from 1989 to 1993 .

"Warped thinking: Abu Rahin Aziz, pictured in Syria, has justified the brutality of ISIS by claiming the regime has weekly bin collections . A British fighter has justified the barbarism of the Islamic State including the burning alive of a Jordanian pilot by claiming the terror group has set up regular household bin collections for the Syrian people under its control. Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, from Luton, said: 'Did you know? The #islamicstate is so barbaric & their streets filthy, they have regular cleaning services. Bin collection, street cleaning.' Aziz, who made the sick claim on twitter, also promised that when Sharia law comes to the UK it would mean executions in Trafalgar Square and Buckingham Palace being turned into a grand mosque. In a series of extreme tweets, he said the Jordanian pilot 'got what he deserved'. In other vile Twitter boasts: . His Twitter account has since been suspended. The Islamic State plunged to new depths of depravity this week after releasing a video showing Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh being burned alive. The sickening murder has triggered worldwide revulsion, including a promise by Jordan's king to wage a 'harsh' war against the militants. Aziz, 33, who tweets under the name 'Abu Abdullah Britani', is an associate of hate cleric Anjem Choudary. He was once a member of radical group 'Muslims Against Crusaders' who set fire to a large poppy on Armistice Day in 2010. Last month, he fled to join ISIS in Syria while on bail for stabbing a football fan in the head with a pen. Scroll down for video . Jihadi: Aziz has posted several photos of himself on Twitter dressed in military clothes and holding a rifle . Abu Rahin Aziz's vile boast comes as new figures laid bare the soaring cost of fly-tipping in Britain amid cuts to rubbish collections. Councils dealt with 852,000 reports of waste being dumped by roads or byways last year – 140,000 up on 2013. Household waste was behind two-thirds of the fly-tipping, according to the figures from rom the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The cost of clearing up the mess was £45million, 25 per cent more than the year before. Councils are imposing new restrictions on households, including the introduction of collections every third week in some areas. Others have made recycling even more complicated, have rationed the amount of waste they will remove or brought in fees for one-off pick-ups. Town halls in Bury in the North West and Gwynedd in Wales have introduced three-weekly collections while Somerset has tested out the idea. In Aziz's hometown of Luton, household waste collections are weekly, but garden waste  has been suspended for the winter until March 2. Luton Borough Council has not yet responded to a request for comment. He was later handed a 36-week jail sentence in his absence over the attack in London's West End. He recently told his followers on Twitter that he 'stabbed a kafir [non-believer] in the back of a head (sic) with a pen in London for insulting the prophet Mohammed.' The former credit control operator has since posted a pictures of himself dressed in a military vest and posing with an AK-47 rifle. He has also contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK. He wrote: 'Still deciding to what to do with my British passport, could burn it, flush it down the toilet.' It is understood Aziz fled via Amsterdam to Turkey and crossed over the Syrian-Turkish border. The whereabouts of his wife and two children are not known. The jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 38, captioned: 'This is us breaking our bail conditions being together in UK.' The photo shows the two bearded radicals, dressed in matching white thobes and pakol hats. Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, a former NHS surgeon, fled the UK in 2013, after he was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally. Last week, Aziz also threatened MPs and servicemen in a string of sinister tweets by inciting fellow extremists to carry out attacks on the West using guns, bombs or even by throwing stones. The jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 38, on Twitter which was captioned: 'This is us breaking our bail conditions being together in UK.' Ali, a former NHS surgeon, fled the UK in 2013 . Aziz, a former credit control operator, also contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK. He suggested he could 'burn or flush it' Depraved: Pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh is pictured just before he is burned alive in a cage in an ISIS video released earlier this week . 'Muslims in the West given instructions to strike the enemies of Islam and Muslims within their own countries,' Aziz wrote. 'Wonder who will strike first? 'Could it be UK first to be attacked? They've attacked us with jets killing scores, plus they have many Muslims in prison as war on Islam. 'Maybe sit and wait outside TA offices? Maybe some other interests, maybe an MP. Hmm interesting.

"'Vindicated': Stephen Perry has been cleared of seven sexual offences . An insurance boss accused of hiring attractive teenage girls to ogle and grope has been cleared of seven sexual offences. Stephen Perry denied sexually assaulting two 17-year-olds when they worked for him at his Rotherham business throughout a trial at Sheffield Crown Court. The 58-year-old widow was today found not guilty of seven sexual offences against the two women but admitted some of his behaviour 'could have been taken in the wrong way'. rothe . Speaking after the case, Mr Perry said he felt 'vindicated' by the outcome of the trial. 'I feel I have been vindicated. These allegations were unfounded and I told the police as much. 'I am a friendly man and one of them described me as a fatherly figure which is about right. I encouraged a friendly, relaxed atmosphere at work and they misconstrued things.' The insurance chief added he would not hire teenagers to work at his firm in the future. 'I have made the decision like Lionel Blair once said that I'm not going to work with children any more. 'I now employ two 45-year-old women in the office who work for me.' During the trial it was alleged Mr Perry told recruitment managers to hire 'cracking' young women and that he liked employees 'young and fresh'. Sean Kilbride, who supplied candidates to the business, told jurors Mr Perry had instructed him: ''If they’re cracking, they’ll get the job, you know what I mean,' before adding he liked employees 'young and fresh'. 'He told me he was looking for 16 and 17-year-olds, preferably a girl,' Mr Kilbride said. One of the women alleged he grabbed her from behind while she was bent over in front of a filing cabinet, while the other claimed she felt 'uncomfortably' with the 'touchy, feely' boss. 'He was eyeing me up and down. I felt uncomfortable. I was trying to shrug it off, it was disgusting. He had his tongue out and was staring at me . 'He said: ""Don’t ever come to work in a skirt and glasses because I will not be held responsible for my actions if we are left alone.""' Mr Perry denied the allegations, insisting he had a 'fatherly' relationship with the two women and that there was no sexual motive behind his behaviour towards them. Jurors at Sheffield Crown Court (above) took just 40 minutes to clear the 58-year-old widow of all charges . Accused of putting his hands over one of the girl's faces so that she would not see what was on his computer screen, he said: 'I don’t know where that’s come from.' Both were 17 when they worked for Mr Perry in 2012 and 2013. They were sent to the company where they earned £100-a-week as apprentice clerks, but quit after a few months. During their interviews the women claimed Mr Perry quizzed them on whether or not they had boyfriends and 'oohed' at one woman's bottom in the office. On one occasion one of the women claimed he grabbed her from behind and 'rubbed' his crotch against her. This was strong denied by Mr Perry throughout. Jurors took 40 minutes to clear him of all seven charges brought. Speaking after the trial, the widow said: 'In hindsight I probably did say things that could have been taken the wrong way,' adding he 'may have comforted' one of the women in 'a fatherly manner' by patting her bottom. The only other contact was when he put his hands on one of their shoulders while she was working at a computer to poke fun at her height, he said. Mr Perry admitted to observing one of the women had 'big' breasts but did not touch them, and says he may have 'touched' her thigh instead of slapping it as accused. She was hired, he insisted, on the basis of her CV but that he once had to tell her off for coming to work in what he thought was an inappropriate blouse. At the time of the alleged assaults, Mr Perry's wife was dying of cancer, it was heard.","Stephen Perry has been found not guilty of seven sexual offences .

"A man in Florida reportedly killed his mother before going after his two young nieces Thursday morning in a brutal attack. Jason Rios from New Port Richey, a paranoid schizophrenic who was on drugs at the time according to one family member, is suspected of killing his mother Angela, an amputee with no legs, in their home, attacking two of his nieces with a blunt weapon and was in the process of attacking a third child when his father Ernesto came upon him, dragging the boy outside as police were called. The girls are at St. Joseph's Hospital in Tampa where 9-year-old Jenica Randazzo is in serious condition and 7-year-old La'nyla Heater is in stable condition. Scroll down for video . Jason Rios (left) is suspected of killing his mother Angela (right) Thursday morning in their Florida home and then attacking his two neices . After the attack he barricaded himself in his uncle's home next door, which led to a three hour standoff with a SWAT team (above) While Rios, 23, was being held by his father, he managed to run into a nearby house belonging to an uncle and barricade himself inside according to ABC Tampa. This led to a three hour standoff, as a SWAT team was called in and tried to convince Rios to come outside, unsure if there were individuals in the house being held hostage. During this time authorities also evacuated other houses in the area to ensure the safety of residents, and got the children out of the Rios home, where Mrs. Rios was pronounced dead on the scene. When reasoning with Rios proved to be ineffective, a BearCat was used to take out one of the walls in the home and deploy tear gas and flash bang devices, at which point Rios stumbled out with one hand in his pocket. Officers believe he may have done so in hopes of being shot dead, but not one member of the SWAT team even fired at the troubled young man. As he was making his way out he ran into one of the SWAT vehicles and ended up knocking himself out, and was taken from the scene on a stretcher. Rios (above) finally fled the home after tear gas was released inside and is now in custody . Rios was taken away on a stretcher following the standoff (above) Pasco Sheriff Chris Nocco called it 'a horrific situation.' There were two other young boys, ages 13 and 4, at the home that morning, who were unharmed. Ernesto, the grandfather to the two girls, was about to take them to school for the day. Rios also had cuts on his neck, stomach and head that were likely self-inflected, and which cops believe he did using a drill bit. Meanwhile, the scene back at the home where the brutal attack took place was so bad, Nocco had crisis counseling on site for everyone. One of Rios' nephews, who was in the house during the attack, wrote on Facebook Thursday afternoon; 'I love you grandma. I hope everythings good in heaven ik Jason didnt mean he was on drugs its not his fault i just wanna say i love you grandma and let just hope that the girls make it i love you all i love you to jason ik you didnt mean it ima miss you all i love you guys.' Rios' condition is not clear at this time, and he is in police custody. 'If our community can rally prayers for these young girls and their families, they need them,' said Nocco. Meanwhile, friends of Rios are shocked with what happened Thursday. That's not what Jason would've done,' childhood friend Josh Melching told the Tampa Bay Times. 'He's always had my brother's and my back. He was a caring person. He was Jason. I don't know how to explain other than that. He was Jason.' Rios faces one charge of murder and two counts of attempted murder, the sheriff’s office said.","Jason Rios of New Port Richey, Florida murdered his mother and attacked his nieces, ages 7 and 9, with a blunt weapon Thursday morning .

"Model Patricia Velasquez - widely touted as the world's first Latina supermodel - is set to release a memoir in which she comes out as a lesbian, and confirms decades-long rumors that she once dated comedian Sandra Bernhard. Ms Velasquez, 44, who was born in Venezuela but has been based between New York and Los Angeles throughout most of her glittering modeling career, has kept her 'torturous' secret hidden until now. In her book, Straight Walk, the mother-of-one says she realized she was gay in the 90s - at a time when she was modeling for Victoria's Secret, Sports Illustrated, Chanel and Gucci, among others - only after meeting Ms Berhard, now 59. Revealed: Model Patricia Velasquez, pictured last year, is set to release a memoir in which she comes out as a lesbian, and confirms decades-long rumors that she once dated comedian Sandra Bernhard . According to The New York Post, which reviewed the memoir, Ms Velasquez had 'never kissed a girl' before she met Ms Bernhard backstage at a fashion show in Paris. Ms Bernhard - who is openly bisexual and rumored to have once enjoyed a fling with Madonna - invited Ms Velasquez back to her hotel, where they 'hooked up'. 'I was in deeply in love with Sandra in a way I'd never experienced before', the South American beauty writes in her book. Ms Velasquez dated Ms Bernhard for a while and says she 'cried for two years' when the relationship ended, though doesn't go into any more detail about their time together. She says that keeping her sexuality a secret for all those years was 'torturous'.

Speaking to Yahoo Parenting, the stunning model says she then dated a woman called Lauren for eight years, who gave birth to their child Maya, now eight. The pair are still on good terms, and Ms Velasquez has been with her current partner Ileanna for a year. 'It’s very difficult to face your past, so I put off doing anything like this for a long time', she tells the website. 'But as my daughter started growing up and I was teaching her to be honest and proud, I knew it was time for me to set an example - and that meant facing my truth.' Ms Velazquez also says she felt compelled to come out because of anti-gay prejudice in the Latin community.

"A rich husband is less likely to help you with the housework than one on a lower income. This is according to a new study which claims to have found a link between a man's wealth and attitudes towards gender equality. The research also found that women are still doing the most around the home, no matter how many hours they work or how much they are paid. A rich husband is less likely to help you with the housework than one on a lower income. This is according to a new study which claims to have found a link between a man's wealth and attitudes towards gender equality . 'It seems men on lower incomes are happily picking up the dusters, filling the dishwasher and generally starting to do their bit,' said Dr Clare Lyonette from Warwick University. But there is a different attitude when it comes to higher earners – and women could be partly to blame, the researchers say. 'We found that while men in these households do also recognise the need to help their partners, they remain reluctant to lift a finger and appear to simply throw money at the issue by hiring a cleaner instead,' said Dr Lyonette. The researchers interviewed 36 partnered women and 12 partnered men for the project, all of whom had at least one child under the age of 14. 'Inequality still exists and that's perpetuated, in part, by the so-called 'myth of male incompetence',' added Dr Lyonette. It seems men on lower incomes are happily picking up the dusters, filling the dishwasher and generally starting to do their bit,' said Dr Clare Lyonette from Warwick University. But there is a different attitude when it comes to higher earners – and women could be partly to blame, the researchers say . 'This is a belief by some women - and our study shows it's still rife - that men are unable to complete housework to an acceptable standard.' One participant in the survey told the researcher: 'I think they do it on purpose, men, don't they? 'Using the cleaner, he'll just clean around things, then all of a sudden you'll move the sofa and you're like, ""what is that under there?""... or he says: ""Don't clean upstairs now because no one goes up there bar us, you don't need to hoover' is his argument"".' Dr Lyonette concluded that men from lower-income families seem to be starting to do their bit around the home. 'But until all men are willing to take on more domestic tasks, so allowing women to take on greater responsibility within the workplace, any hoped-for progress in gender equality is likely to stall,' she added. You may imagine that a man who is adept at housework would be attractive to woman. But sociologists claim that mopping the kitchen and washing up dishes won’t help men get lucky in the bedroom - with middle-aged women at least. A study has found that men who regularly do housework, such as cooking and cleaning, have less sex than men who don’t bother. Researchers from the Juan March Institute in Madrid studied data based on relationships of 4,561 middle-aged US couples over 20 years, including their sex lives and how they divide household chores. The study found that home tasks such as cooking and cleaning are traditionally perceived as women’s work – and 80 per cent of housework is still done by females. The results showed that men performed around 55 per cent of 'masculine' tasks such as paying bills and mowing the lawn. While egalitarian marriages tended to be happier, men who did ‘feminine’ tasks had sex less often than those who shunned the iron and oven.","This is because they can throw money at the problem, scientists claim .

"The Malaysian government has revealed it has spent just a fraction of what Australia has paid in the search for missing flight MH370, as officials from both countries prepare to meet to discuss the next phase of the mission. But Federal  Treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia will pay its fair share in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. 'It is understood that the plane went down in waters that are our responsibility, and there is a cost to having responsibility and we don't shirk that,' he told reporters on Tuesday morning. 'We accept responsibility and will pay for it. We're not a country that begs others for money to do our job.' Scroll down for video . Australia has set aside $90 million to find MH370 - expected to be the most the country has spent in aviation history . Officials from Malaysia are expected in Canberra today for talks, including discussions around funding for the operation. The Australian government has set aside almost $90 million for the search - expected to be the most expensive in aviation history - but it's possible that figure could increase. The Federal Government put the $90 million price tag on the search for the first time when it handed down the budget in May. The budget papers stated the actual cost will depend on a multiple factors, including the outcome of procurement processes for specialist services, the length of the search, and the extent of contributions from other countries. The head of the joint task force charged with finding MH370, Angus Houston, said on Tuesday discussions around the next phase of the search would include negotiations with Malaysia over the cost of the search. Malaysia has spent $9.3 million on the search so far and Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri said costs of the next phase will be shared . 'The government has allocated $89.9 million. I think about $25 million of that is to go the defence force for the visual search they conducted,' former defence force chief Air Chief Marshal Houston told the ABC. 'There's another $60 million that's been allocated for the underwater search.' 'That money has been allocated but we're still to crunch, or still to negotiate the burden-sharing with for example Malaysia.' A Joint Agency Coordination Centre spokesperson said via a statement that a full accounting of Australia's search costs to date is 'not available at this stage'. 'However, for transparency the full costs across Australian Government agencies will be compiled at a later date,' the statement said. 'Malaysian, Chinese and Australian officials, including Air Chief Marshal Houston, will meet in Canberra this afternoon to discuss the ongoing search for missing flight MH370 and cost sharing arrangements. 'Currently, each country bears its own costs.' Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri, pictured left, has said search costs will be shared 50-50 between Malaysia and Australia, while Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, pictured right, confirmed his government had spent about $9.3 million in the search . But a senior Malaysian government official has already said Australia was expected to share the cost of the next phase, adding there were no figures yet for how much would have to be spent. 'Costs will be shared 50-50 between Malaysia and Australia,' Malaysia's Deputy Defence Minister Abdul Rahim Bakri said. The comments came as Malaysia's Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein confirmed his government had spent 27.6 million ringgit ($A9.30 million) in fuel and food for equipment and personnel in the search. 'The cost that we had to bear is relatively small compared to the other assets given by other countries used in the search,' Mr Hishammuddin said. 'I am proud that many of our friends have come forward to help in the search, and they bear their own expenses and have not made any claims from us.' More than three months have passed since the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard - including six Australians. The Boeing 777 is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, but an extensive search has turned up no sign of wreckage. The Australia Transport Safety Board last week issued a tender to continue the deep-water search for the ill-fated flight.","The Malaysian government confirms it has spent $9.3 million on fuel and food for equipment and personnel in the search for MH370 .

"The Brazilian family of a pregnant woman allegedly murdered with a tomahawk by her partner is trying to raise money to fly to Australia to deal with the tragedy. Brock Wall, 34, is accused of bludgeoning to death his partner Fabiana Palhares, 35, who was 10 weeks pregnant,  in Varsity Lakes on Queensland's Gold Coast on Monday. Ms Palhares' family members - who reside in Brazil - are trying to raise $50,000 via website My Cause and with the help of domestic violence charity White Ribbon. So far they have raised $10,205. The Brazilian family of  pregnant woman Fabiana Palhares, 35, allegedly murdered with a tomahawk by her partner is trying to raise money to fly to Australia to deal with the tragedy . Ms Palhares' family members - who reside in Brazil - are trying to raise $50,000 and are considering bring her body home . 'Fabiana had the biggest heart you could even imagine, and she would be the first to put her hand up to help someone,' the fundraising page reads. 'Fabiana's family need help to be able to come over to Australia and to pay for the expenses this tragedy has left.' Ms Palhares' friend Lu Flores said her family is 'pretty lost' and her mother in 'shock'. Ms Flores said she was not sure if Ms Palhares' father knew yet, because he was recovering from heart surgery. The family is considering taking her body back to Brazil to be cremated or buried there. 'Bringing the body is expensive, but if they decide to bury her in Australia then the family would go to Australia, either both ideas are expensive,' Ms Flores told Daily Mail Australia. If they raise enough money Ms Palhares' brother and another family member would fly to Australia to organise her affairs. Ms Palhares had lived in Australia for 11 years, ran her own cleaning business and owned a dog. 'This money its not just to pay for tickets flight... Fabiana had her whole life here, a car that probably was still being paid, she got a business with lots of contracts,' Ms Flores said.

Ms Palhares' family also needs to organise her affairs and debts. She had lived in Australia for 11 years, ran her own cleaning business and had a dog . 'Also $1 [Australian] dollar means about $2.70 [Brazilian real]. 'I reckon the biggest expense will be to bring her body or her ashes in case of cremation. 'If the family decides to bring her personal stuffs a ship container can cost nearly $10,000.' Ms Plahares uncle Leo Palhares spoke to Daily Mail Australia from Brazil on behalf of her family. 'We can not believe our darling girl is gone, leaving such a void in our hearts,' said Mr Palhares. 'Our Fabiana was such a special person, a person of great light.' 'It is almost impossible to speak about it.' 'She was dearly loved by us and will be so greatly missed.' 'We feel nostalgic thinking about her infectious smile, she gave us so much joy.' Police have charged her partner Wall with her murder, the murder of an unborn child and unlawful assault of a pregnant woman. The case was mentioned at Southport Magistrates Court on Tuesday but Wall did not appear and no bail application was made. A man - understood to be her partner - was located in a car reportedly covered in blood, around the corner from the house and has been arrested . The woman was believed to be 10 weeks pregnant and according to neighbours she was a 'beautiful' person . A committal hearing for Wall's case will be heard in May. She was found in her home in Randwick Court, Varsity Lakes on Monday afternoon after the domestic incident.

"America's right-wing political pin-up Sarah Palin is to reprise her ratings-busting turn on Saturday Night Live for the show's 40th anniversary special, it is claimed. Producers have invited the former Alaska governor and onetime vice-presidential hopeful back to the programme and she has accepted, a source close to Mrs Palin told People.com. It will give Mrs Palin, who no longer holds office but is still active on the Republican right, a chance to spar with Tina Fey, whose uncanny resemblance to the politician was used to lampoon her during the 2008 presidential race. So which is which? Sarah Palin and Tina Fey in 2008. The right-wing politician is set to appear once again on Saturday Night Live, where she will have the opportunity to joust with lookalike Tina Fey. (Palin is right) Older and wiser? Mrs Palin pictured in September last year. She no longer holds office but has used her SarahPAC - along with her reality TV programs and Fox News appearances - to keep her name in the mix . Mrs Palin last appeared on Saturday Night Live in 2008, just two weeks before election day - although on that occasion viewers were disappointed when she did not appear side-by-side with Fey. Still, the anticipation of such a moment sent the programme's ratings soaring to a 14-year high, with about 17million viewers tuning in for the first half hour. A fresh appearance could be a crafty move to boost her national standing. Mrs Palin, who turned 51 on Monday, recently fanned speculation that she might seek the Republican nomination in 2016. She has used her SarahPAC - along with her reality television programs and Fox News appearances - to keep her name in the mix and to pay for travel to campaign rallies with allies. However she is still notorious for the kinds of gaffes that persistently hounded her when she first appeared as John McCain's running mate in 2008. Just last week her political stock plummetted when she admitted that a rambling and incoherent speech she recently made in Iowa came after her teleprompter froze. The admission came in a freewheeling television segment with Host Sean Hannity in which she also downplayed reports from days earlier that she was planning to run for president in the first place. 'I was asked by a testy reporter while I was promoting my Sportsman Channel show, Amazing America With Sarah Palin,' the self-promoting pol told Hannity. 'I was asked if I were to be interested at all in running for office, maybe the presidency.' 'And it's certainly not newsworthy,' she added with a shrug and an eye roll, 'for me to have answered, ""Oh yeah, I'm interested, yeah. Next question?"" Good sport: Mrs Palin getting into the vibe on her visit SNL appearance. She is still notorious for the kinds of gaffes that persistently hounded her when she first appeared as John McCain's running mate in 2008 . But she had been forced to recover from negative headlines when at the Iowa Freedom Summit she flipped through a binder of notes and strung together a series of odd one-liners, leaving a welcoming audience confused. 'Did the teleprompter go down? Did you have trouble with the copy?' Hannity asked her. 'Was there any moment in the speech where you had any difficulty? Because people have been so critical.' Palin insisted that 'I don't read the praise and I don't read the criticism. ... I'm used to teleprompters not working.' The Saturday Night Live 40th anniversary special is due to be broadcast on February 15 at 8pm ET on NBC.","Right-wing Republican last appeared on the show during 2008 election race .

"He's the robot boy who fights evil with his superhuman strength and now the Australian company behind The Lego Movie is set to make a live-action superhero film based on the popular cartoon character Astro Boy. With production of the second and third Lego spin-off's set to start later this year in Sydney, animation company Animal Logic has signed on to reinterpret the classic Japanese manga series Astro Boy and producer Zareh Nalbandian has promised they will not disappoint. Having sold over 100 million manga copies worldwide, Astro Boy is the kind of film an animation producer dreams of and for Nalbandian it's a chance for him to bring a beloved and iconic character to life. He's the robot boy who fights evil with his superhuman strength and now the Australian company behind The Lego Movie is set to make a live-action superhero film based on the popular cartoon character Astro Boy . 'It is a big challenge but it’s also really exciting. It’s the kind of thing you dream of as a film-maker to be able to bring such a beloved and iconic character to life but in a way that’s never been done before,' Nalbandian told Daily Mail Australia. Astro Boy, known in Japan as 'Mighty Atom' was created by Osamu Tezuka, who is considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney. The boy with the supernatural powers first appeared as a cartoon series from 1951 to 1968, set in a time where Japan was recovering from the atomic blasts during World War II. Astro Boy went on to become one of the most-loved cartoon characters ever created. Since his emergence, Astro Boy has been made into a TV animation series twice. He was also turned into feature length animation in Hollywood in 2009. Using his superpowers, including strength, jet flight, adjustable hearing and instant language translation, the cartoon character fights evil while possessing the kindness of a child. With production of the second and third Lego spin-off's set to start later this year in Sydney, animation company Animal Logic has signed on to reinterpret the classic Japanese manga series Astro Boy and producer Zareh Nalbandian (pictured) has promised they will not disappoint . Producer Nalbandian admits that there will be high expectations for the film from avid cartoon audiences, but believes he has the opportunity to make Astro Boy as big a success as Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy. 'We have high expectations. We won’t make a mediocre movie, this is a once in a generation opportunity to reinterpret Astro Boy for a 21st century audience,' Nalbandian said. 'Ultimately we've got the passion and we have the commitment but we need to partner with great writers and great film-makers and I think that right combination will empower us to do what we want to do.' Nalbandian's impressive career spans over decades with films such as Walking with Dinosaurs 3D and Happy Feet under his belt. He knows what it takes to reinterpret a classic icon and bring him to the big screen and believes Astro Boy needs to be taken into the 21st Century to be a success. The producer believes we are living in 'an exciting time' in film for the convergence of life-action, animation and visual effects and says anything is possible. Nalbandian produced The Lego Movie last year . It was a huge shock for Animal Logic that The Lego Movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar this year . 'We can’t stick to the TV series and we’re certainly not going to be referencing the 2009 animated movie. We really want us to reinterpret him in a very contemporary way.' 'If you look at Legend of the Guardians and more recently Lego and before that Walking with Dinosaurs or the Great Gatsby movie they're all very different but they all have one thing in common which is they break new ground,' he said, . This will be the fist time Astro Boy will have ever been made into a Hollywood blockbuster film. Japan's Tezuka Productions have been very careful about who they let lay their hands on their prized possession. 'They wanted to make sure that whoever did it would do justice to the property,' Nalbandian said. Happy Feet won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year in 2007 . Nalbandian produced and worked on visual effects for the widely acclaimed film . 'There has been an explosion in this type of film in the last half a decade particularly and I think it’s a great time to bring him to the big screen as a live action superhero. 'Whether it’s Spiderman or Iron Man or Guardians of the Galaxy there is just such a love from audiences for this type of property so the timing is perfect.' he said. Nalbandian and Animal Logic are in the pre-production stages of the next instalment of the Lego movies. The first one will be called Lego Ninjago, based on a Lego toy line and the second film will go by the name Lego Batman, to be directed by Chris McKay who co-directed the first film. The company is also working on a Betty Boop movie, in collaboration with Simon Cowell's Syco Entertainment. 'They’re both (Lego movies) being produced out of Animal Logic in Sydney which is very exciting because it means that the people who worked on the first film will be able to continue to do great work on the second and third,' Nalbandian said. Nalbandian produced Walking with Dinosaurs 3D in 2013 . The animation film depicted what it was like when dinosaurs walked the earth . 'It really supports out animation industry in Australia and it supports long-term creative jobs so it’s not just about the films it’s about the industry as well. We’re really pleased it solidifies the position we’re in in Australia.' in 2006, Nalbandian's work on Happy Feet contributed to the monumental Oscar win for the penguin film. However, he says he is 'perplexed' that The Lego Movie wasn't even nominated for an Oscar nod this year. 'I feel perplexed and disappointed and that’s being really honest,' Nalbandian said. 'If you look at the amount of news that was generated when the Oscars were announced there was more news generated around why Lego didn't get a nomination than any other nomination actually announced so we weren't the only ones perplexed.' Zareh Nalbandian worked on visual effects for The Great Gatsby. The film won over critics and was hailed a success . Baz Lurhman worked with Nalbandian on the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan were the stars . From Nalbandian's point of view, The Lego Movie was 'the most ground-breaking and most challenging animated film that was produced last year'. 'It found the biggest audience in America of any animated film produced last year so all I can think is the Academy maybe was a little bit unsure because it was a toy brand. Perhaps they didn't understand the complexity of the film because we made it look too easy.' Nalbandian said the Academy like to hold on to traditional methods of film making and believes there are not enough categories at the awards for animation movies. 'There’s not enough slots because if the Academy wants to keep supporting traditional animation and recognise innovative animation and animated story-telling, perhaps five slots is not enough. The funny thing the only bad review we had about Lego was someone actually said that they got sick of laughing so hard in the first 20 minutes.'","Australian company  are set to make a superhero film based on Astro Boy .

"CCTV footage from a 'haunted' Midlands pub captures the moment staff say a ghost pushed a bottle of cordial off the bar. A series of strange incidents have been reported at The Old Crown in Digbeth, Birmingham - where barmaids and cleaners claim a ghost pinches their bottoms. Staff at the pub now believe they have surveillance footage which proves the ghoul's existence. The video shows a bottle of blackcurrant cordial mysteriously moving across a surface and falling on the ground. Scroll down for video . CCTV from the The Old Crown in Digbeth, Birmingham shows a bottle of cordial moving over the bar . The incident was witnessed by two customers seated at the bar, Andy Lightfoot, 48, and Rudie Jones, 26, who immediately leaned over to get a look at what had happened. Mr Lightfoot, a builder from Ellesmere Port who was staying in the pub at the time, said: 'It was very freaky. We couldn't understand how on earth the bottle toppled over the bar like that.' The eerie incident happened when barmaid Amy Carter had momentarily left the bar to go to the basement. Ms Carter, 24, says: 'I went down to the cellar to get some more spirits and suddenly I heard a big bang from upstairs. 'I immediately rushed back to the bar to see Andy and Rudie leaning over staring at the bottle on the floor. 'They told me what happened and I was spooked. It's so weird.' The Old Crown's Landlord, Ciaran Healy, initially refused to believe Andy's and Rudie's explanation. Landlord Ciaran Healey, 24, say the incident is not the first strange event to have happened at the pub . Barmaid Amy Carter was present when the bottle smashed and says she has experienced the ghost herself . Mr Healy, 24, said: 'When I came to the bar and saw the blackcurrant cordial on the floor, I was furious. 'I thought Andy and Rudie had been messing around and dropped the bottle on purpose. We were really busy that night. I didn't appreciate them fooling around like this. 'But Andy and Rudie kept swearing that it wasn't them and begged me to check out the CCTV footage. 'I actually made a £20 bet that they had pushed the bottle themselves as a prank. But when I saw the recording, I couldn't believe it. I tried to explain it away. 'I thought maybe Andy and Rudie had used some string to push the bottle but there's no rational explanation for what happens in that video. It's shaken me.' There have been several ghosts sightings reported at The Old Crown, which dates from 1368. Barmaid Miss Carter and another female staff member claim that they have had their bottoms pinched by the ghost. Staff have even quit their jobs at the historic pub - which Queen Elizabeth I reportedly stayed in - because of fears about ghosts. The pub dates back to the 14th century and is near the site of The Battle of Camp Hill in the English Civil War . Bar staff say they thought drinkers were pulling their legs when they first heard of the incident, but now say they are convinced it was the work of the ghost . Mr Healy added: 'Two years ago, our long-serving chef came in one morning and saw a ghostly figure of a lady walk straight through a door. 'He was so scared afterwards that he locked himself in the disabled toilet until the other staff arrived. A day later, he quit the job for good even though he'd been really happy at The Old Crown. 'To be honest, we usually try to detach ourselves from our ghostly reputation because it makes it hard to find employees who are willing to work here. 'Barmaids don't usually stay long here because they become terrified of the place when they're locking up at night.' Mr Healy has hired psychic mediums in a bid to put an end to the ghostly sightings. 'We've had several mediums come to The Old Crown. The Battle of Camp Hill during The English Civil War, was fought just outside the pub so they reckon that's why we have so many ghosts here. 'A few mediums have talked about a drunken ghost called Gus - who we think is responsible for pinching bottoms and smashing bottles. 'The psychics also mentioned a ghostly woman whose baby fell down the well that we have in The Old Crown. Apparently, she wanders around longing for her lost child.'","Birmingham pub dates back to 14th century and is said to be haunted .

"Britain's ‘tiny’ role in the global fight against Islamic State terrorists will be condemned by MPs today. Just two days after the sickening video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive emerged, the Defence Select Committee will blast Britain’s contribution in the fight against the terror group as ‘unacceptable’ and ‘deeply concerning’. The UK has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against Islamist jihadists – amounting to less than one a day, the committee’s report will reveal. Scroll down for video . Criticism: The Defence Select Committee will blast Britain’s contribution in the fight against ISIS - just two days after the sickening video of a Jordanian pilot being burnt alive, pictured, emerged . There were only three UK military personnel outside the Kurdish regions of Iraq, compared with 400 Australians, 280 Italians and 300 Spanish, when the MPs visited Iraq before Christmas. This is despite David Cameron claiming that defeating IS – also known as Daesh and Isil – was a ‘priority’ for Britain. In December last year, he said: ‘We must, with our allies, use everything in our power to defeat it. That means combating terrorism. It means defeating Isil in Iraq and Syria.’ But the report says it is ‘very surprising that the UK Government is doing so little’, given the rise of Islamic State has proven the ‘sum of all our fears’. ‘Given that Daesh is the most dramatic and significant threat to regional stability and international security to have emerged in the Middle East in decades, we are surprised and deeply concerned that the UK is not doing more,’ it will say. The criticisms come after the Daily Mail revealed the Government had delayed a decision to send hundreds of troops to train Iraqi forces for fear of casualties in the run-up to the general election. 'Priority': David Cameron insisted during Prime Minister’s Questions, pictured, he will fight to eradicate IS . Defence Secretary Michael Fallon had announced last year that the soldiers would be deployed to the region in January. But despite calls by the Iraqis for help, it is understood there are only 48 UK personnel carrying out training there. In addition, there are around 400 UK personnel operating eight Tornado jets, a Rivet Joint spy plane and other UK resources – though most of those are not based in Iraq. Committee chairman Rory Stewart MP said: ‘Daesh controls territory equivalent to the size of the UK, has contributed to the displacement of millions, destabilising and threatening neighbouring states, and providing a safe haven to an estimated 20,000 foreign fighters – many dedicated to an international terrorist campaign. ‘Yet the role that the UK is playing in combating it is strikingly modest.’ Report: Committee chairman Rory Stewart MP, pictured, said the role the UK is playing is 'modest' If Britain does not properly respond to the ‘threat and horrors represented by Daesh’, there will be political ramifications. It would ‘heighten perceptions’ that the UK has ‘stepped back from its international role’ and could risk undermining wider commitment to the US-led coalition. The report adds: ‘It would undermine the UK’s national security interests through destabilisation of the region and through Daesh’s sponsorship of terrorist attacks and training of British foreign fighters in military tactics, which could be used upon the UK public following their return home.’ The MPs said there was a ‘significant gap’ between the rhetoric of Britain and its partners and the reality of the campaign on the ground. While the politicians did not call for combat troops on the ground, they said the UK should increase its support from the air and meet the request from the Iraqi army to provide training in counter-IED (Improvised Explosive Device) skills. Mr Stewart said the UK should deploy Special Forces and far more people in intelligence, planning and regional politics. He added: ‘We must clearly acknowledge the previous failures in Iraq, and reform our approach. But that does not mean lurching to doing nothing. The UK should find a way of engaging with Iraq that is moderate, pragmatic, but energetic. ‘There are dozens of things the UK could be doing, without deploying combat troops, to work with coalition partners to help address one of the most extreme threats that we have faced in the last 20 years.’ Only the deployment of a few hundred personnel would be required, the cost would be relatively modest, and it would not entail the risks inherent in deploying UK troops in combat roles, he said. Another criticism raised in the report, titled The situation in Iraq and Syria and the response to Daesh, is how the Chiefs of Staff are unable or unwilling to provide a ‘clear and articulate’ statement of the UK’s objectives or strategic plan. There was a lack of clarity over who owns a policy – and indeed whether such a policy exists, they found. And despite the UK’s long involvement in Iraq, there were no UK personnel on the ground with deep expertise in the region. It was ‘unacceptable’ for the UK to ‘simply sign up’ to providing military support for the campaign without any assessment, detail or viability of the campaign plan. David Cameron yesterday insisted during Prime Minister’s Questions he will fight to eradicate IS. Referring to the latest IS video, he said: ‘I can assure the House that we will not stop until the murderous Isil extremists behind this and their poisonous ideology are eradicated.’","UK has so far carried out only 6 per cent of the air strikes against jihadists .

"House Speaker John Boehner announced Thursday that Pope Francis will address a joint meeting of Congress in the fall. He'll be the first Pontiff to do so. Boehner made the announcement at his weekly press conference, then issued a statement of thanks that the pope had accepted his invitation. The joint meeting of the House and Senate wil be convened on Sept. 24. Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued an 'open invitation' to Francisin March 2014 . SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . HOLY CONGRESS: Pope Francis will become the first Pontiff to address a joint meeting of Congress in September . COMING TO THE EAST COAST: On Wednesday the pope held his weekly 'general audience' in the Vatican, and thousands showed up . Six million people turned out in Manila to worship at a Mass celebrated by the pope during his visit last month to the Philippines . 'Whether inspired by St. Francis of Assisi, who cared for all of God’s creation, or by St. Joseph, protector of the church, Pope Francis has lived his values and upheld his promise to be a moral force, to protect the poor and the needy, to serve as a champion of the less fortunate, and to promote love and understanding among faiths and nations,' Pelosi said then in a statement. Both Pelosi and Boehner are Catholics, although the top cardinal at the highest court in the Holy See has declared that Pelosi forfeited her right to take Communion because of her pro-abortion views. Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke said Canon 915 states that Catholics who are stubbornly contrary 'in manifest grave sin are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.' Pope Francis has scheduled his first papal visit to the United States this fall, with stops in Washington, New York and Philadelphia. In New York he will address a general session of the United Nations. President Obama plans to greet him at the White House. Throngs of Roman Catholics are expected to clog streets in all three cities to hear him speak. Last month in Manila, 6 million of the faithful came to a Mass the pope celebrated during his visit to the Philippines, which is 86 per cent Catholic. There are 78.2 million baptized Catholics in the United States, or about a quarter of the population. Catholicism is America's most prevalent religious denomination. House Speaker John Boehner announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will address a joint meeting of the US Congress on Sept. 24 . SPEAKER'S DUTY: Boehner greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2011 before he spoke to Congress, and 'Bibi' is scheduled to return on March 3 . Like John Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is a Catholic – but the top cardinal at the Vatican's highest court says she can't receive Communion because she's pro-abortion . The pope 'will become the first leader of the Holy See to address a joint meeting of Congress,' Boehner's statement said. 'It will be a historic visit, and we are truly grateful that Pope Francis has accepted our invitation.' 'In a time of global upheaval, the Holy Father's message of compassion and human dignity has moved people of all faiths and backgrounds,' the speaker said. 'His teachings, prayers, and very example bring us back to the blessings of simple things and our obligations to one another.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell added that 'the American people look forward to hearing Pope Francis’ call to love our neighbors and to find new and creative ways to meet the pressing needs of those who exist on the fringes of society.' 'From the slums of Buenos Aires to St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis is moving the hearts of millions and inspiring a new generation with an engaging and compelling style.' The last U.S. papal visit came in 2008 when Pope Benedict XVI visited Washington and celebrated Mass at Nationals Stadium, a baseball park that seats nearly 42,000.","The pope is planning to visit Washington, Philadelphia and New York City during his first papal visit to the US in the fall .

The 6C Sport Berlinetta, which sat in a barn in America for 21 years from 1949, has been brought back to its former glory – and snapped up at auction. Scroll down for video . An Alfa Romeo bought by Benito Mussolini for his girlfriend has been sold for £1.4million after being lovingly restored . The Italian dictator (left) gave the 1939 car to his mistress Clara Petacci (right) – only for the pair to be caught when the vehicle was stopped as they tried to flee from Italy at the end of the Second World War . The 6C Sport Berlinetta, which sat in a barn in America for 21 years from 1949, has been brought back to its former glory – and snapped up at auction . Mussolini met up with Petacci at Lake Como after she travelled in t meet him in the four speed, 110 horse power vehicle. The pair then planned to seek asylum in Switzerland. A motorcade they were in, which included a retreating German anti-aircraft unit, was stopped at a roadblock near the town of Dongo on April 27, 1945. The fascist leader and his mistress were both identified before being shot dead and their bodies hung upside down at a petrol station. Petacci’s Alfa Romeo was confiscated and eventually acquired by an American Army Air Corps officer, Major Charles Pettit. He shipped the two-door sedan back to his family’s farm in New York State in 1949, but when the vehicle broke down it was put into a barn.

"Letting Go . by Emma Woolf . (Sumersdale Books £8.99) How intriguing it is to see how often women talk about their lives in terms of physical exertion. We juggle, we multi-task, we lean in. Emma Woolf writes vividly about her battle with healthy eating (picture posed by model) I once had a riding teacher whose motto, in life as in showjumping, was Kick On! Emma Woolf, journalist and television presenter of Channel 4’s Supersize vs Superskinny, suspects that all this strenuous effort is getting us nowhere. A perfectionist, whose struggle to overcome anorexia is described in her memoir, An Apple A Day, she noticed that even after her recovery, her efforts to keep rigid control over every aspect of her life were holding her back. Woolf’s story begins in a French manor house, where five women and a lone businessman had gathered for a nine-day course of self-improvement. The programme offered vegetarian food, yoga, meditation, life coaching and twice-daily sessions of neurofeedback, a form of brain training that uses ‘low-resolution electromagnetic tomography to work deep areas of the brain’. To her surprise, Woolf embraced it all with enthusiasm, though she had terrible trouble with the trauma release session, where the participants were supposed to rid themselves of deeply ingrained trauma by lying on the floor and shaking all over. Woolf couldn’t muster so much as a twitch. But she nevertheless ‘came back to London feeling as if she could take on the world. Six months later, the transformation was striking enough to inspire her to examine the benefits of letting go in more detail. She begins with body image. ‘We all have body hang-ups,’ she argues — a magazine survey found 97 per cent of respondents admitted to having severe negative thoughts about their body every day. She writes vividly about her continuing battle to eat not just healthily, but with pleasure. And there is a bleakly comic account of going on the road for Supersize vs Superskinny with the director, Helen, and assistant producer, Louise. Helen, who once weighed 19 st, had recently lost 7 st, and survived on raw broccoli drenched in vinegar and small bags of cashew nuts, while Louise ate large quantities of salmon and sprinkled chilli flakes on everything. What with Woolf’s diet of multi-seed bread, banana and Greek yoghurt, it doesn’t sound like an enjoyable version of healthy eating, but as always, she sees the positives. ‘We were healthy, happy, not over-weight nor under-weight, managing to live perfectly well, despite our weird tastes.’ A potpourri of ideas and observations from everyone from the Buddha to Samantha Brick, Woolf’s kindness and enthusiasm for helping those who have suffered, like her, from a crippling lack of confidence is beguiling. As she says: ‘We all heal each other.’","Emma Woolf presents Channel 4’s Supersize vs Superskinny .

"A Coast Guard member shot two colleagues at a Cape Cod condo complex early Thursday, lit a car on fire to hamper police, planted fake bombs and then opened fire on officers, authorities said. The episode, which police chief in the town of Bourne called 'crazy and hectic,' left one woman dead, another woman and an officer wounded, and the suspect in custody. Coast Guard spokesman Ross Ruddell said both women involved were stationed on Cape Cod, while the suspected gunman was a man stationed in Virginia. Ruddell said he could not disclose the names of the victims or how they knew each other, but the suspect has been identified as Adrian Loya, 31, of Chesapeake, Virginia. Ambush: Massachusetts police say Adrian Loya, 31 (center), shot two of his female colleagues at a condo complex in Bourne early this morning, killing one, before opening fire during a police ambush, hitting one officer. Loya also set fire to a car to block the only road into the complex and set up fake bombs, police say . Apprehended: Coast Guardsman Adrian Loya ,of Chesapeake, Va., right, stands in the glass enclosed defendant's area in District Court on Thursday, February 5, 2015, in Falmouth, Massachusetts, during an arraignment on charges he killed one woman, injured another and shot a police officer in Bourne before dawn . The incident began about 2.15am amid reports of a vehicle on fire, but it quickly escalated into a 'crazy and hectic' scene, Bourne police Chief Dennis Woodside said. Police say Loya set fire to the vehicle to block the only road into the condo complex, and that he also set up devices resembling bombs, authorities said. Officers made their way around the burning vehicle on foot but were pinned down by gunfire, O'Keefe said. One officer was shot in the back below his bulletproof vest during the ambush. He took cover between two vehicles, but his fellow officers were unable to reach him. Woodside described the officer as a veteran with at least 10 years of service. After a half-hour standoff, Loya finally gave himself in to police and was arrested about 2.45am. Even then, police remained wary, because they were not aware if there were other gunmen. Inside the complex, the surviving female victim had called 911. Police entered the condo and found the other victim dead. The state police bomb squad examined the devices and determined they were all fakes that contained no explosives, Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said. Scene: A burned car that Loya allegedly used as a distraction is towed from the scene at a Cape Cod condo community where one woman was shot to death and two other people, including a police officer, were wounded . 'Crazy and hectic': Police vehicles line a road leading to a Cape Cod condo community about 2.15am Thursday after one woman was shot to death and two other people, including a police officer, were wounded . According to CBS Boston, Loya drove from his base in Chesapeake, Virginia, to Bourne on Tuesday and checked into a local hotel. He then left the hotel about 2am Thursday and drove to the Cape Cod complex, where he burst into the victims' condo and started shooting. He was armed with two rifles and a handgun, CBS reported. Loya reportedly had a previous relationship with one of the victims. Loya pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, armed assault, home invasion and assault and battery of a police officer on Thursday afternoon during an arraignment in Falmouth District Court. A judge ordered Loya to be held without bail and to undergo a mental health examination, and also ordered the file sealed. Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe and Loya's attorney, J. Drew Segadelli, didn't discuss details of the case during the court hearing. Afterward, Segadelli said Loya and the two women had some type of relationship but said he couldn't comment further because the file was sealed. Behind bars: Adrian Loya pleaded not guilty to charges including murder, armed assault, home invasion and assault and battery of a police officer on Thursday afternoon during an arraignment in Falmouth District Court . Investigation: Police said the bomb squad responded to examine items suspected of being hoax devices found there, allegedly placed by the shooting suspect, who was taken into custody . The wounded officer was carried through the woods and snow by colleagues so he could be taken to the hospital, where he was stabilized and improving, the chief said. Residents were at first told to stay inside their units, but Woodside later said the area was safe. He did not disclose any other details or a motive, and it was unclear when the suspect would be arraigned. The Coast Guard was helping in the investigation. 'Today the Coast Guard family suffered a tragic loss,' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Linda Fagan said in a statement. 'We have chaplains and counselors on site to support friends and families affected by this crime. 'My thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been touched by today's sad event.'

"Paris has banned action movies being filmed in and around the city over concerns that locals could mistake the actors for genuine terrorists following last month's Charlie Hebdo massacre. Filming outdoor scenes with police, army or security services was quietly banned in the aftermath of the attacks in the French capital that left 17 dead, along with the three gunmen. Police officials responsible for granting permission for outdoor filming in the city said the ban is intended to prevent passers-by confusing chase scenes for authentic police incidents - and may even prevent actors and crew becoming an easy target for terror attacks themselves. Action: French soldiers patrol near the Louvre Museum. Fearing that actors could be mistaken for police and chase scenes confused for the real thing, Paris has now banned the filming of action movies in the city . Tribute: Millions marched through Paris in the days that followed last month's attack as they showed their support for freedom of speech and the Charlie Hebdo staff . Speaking of the decision to ban action movies, Sylvie Barnaud, the police official who grants outside filming permission in Paris, said: 'There's a problem with these action-type scenes, as the actors in uniform could be targets for terrorists.' 'Also, the actors could pose confusion for the general public during this highly sensitive period.' She did not know how long the ban could last, but there was not indication it would be reversed anytime soon. Tensions remain high in Paris, with armed police and soldiers still posted outside sensitive sites, including synagogues, media offices and major shopping areas. Earlier this week French counter-terrorism identified 64 suburbs in dozens of cities that act as breeding grounds for Islamic extremism. Extremists: Brothers Said (left) and Cherif Kouachi (right), who killed 12 people in an attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine offices in central Paris. The pair then died following a siege . Impossible: 2014's blockbuster 'Edge of Tomorrow'  staring Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise (pictured) was partly filmed in the French capital.  Under the new rules filming would have been impossible . The French government has been ridiculed for producing a poster to help identify potential jihadists - with one suggestion that giving up baguettes is a telltale sign. They claim pointers that someone is being radicalised by Islamist fanatics include alarm bells such as losing interest in sports, rejecting family members and changing eating habits. The poster was launched as part of a new £320million campaign to counter terrorism in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. But the attempt to inform the public backfired, with many ridiculing the Stop Jihadism poster for the suggestions it made. So-called 'ghettos' with high rates of youth unemployment, immigration and single-parent families, such as L'Ariane near Nice, have been linked to the radicalisation of young and vulnerable people. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic 'apartheid' - the first time a senior politician has conceded that economic marginalisation and religious tensions have led to serious divides. Paris has long been a favored filming location, especially for chase scenes that feature some of the world's most recognizable landmarks. Luc Besson's 2014 box-office hit 'Lucy' with Scarlett Johansson features a police chase next to the Louvre - something impossible under the new rules. The same may have been true of 2014's blockbuster 'Edge of Tomorrow,' which was partly filmed in the French capital, staring Emily Blunt and Tom Cruise. Je Suis Charlie: The satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo was targeted by Islamic terrorists because of it frequently published cartoons about the religion. 17 people died over three bloody days last month . Claim: French Prime Minister Manuel Valls (pictured) last month admitted that the country had collapsed into social and ethnic 'apartheid' Several productions have already been disrupted — included one called 'Flics Tout Simplement' ('Simply Cops,') which was supposed to have a scene with a police officer outside a school. Scenes with religious sites or schools, both protected under the emergency security plans, are also banned. 'Yes, we were meant to film this scene. But it wasn't allowed. Of course, we have to respect the new rules, and we changed the production plan,' said the film unit director Stephan Guillemet. Paris is holding its annual Film Set Fair this week, hoping that it will continue to attract big productions. It trumpets giving the green light to 1,159 film productions in the capital last year alone. 'It could have an impact on the big American productions ... It's not the right moment to do it,' said Agnes Naggeotte of the Cinema Mission of the City of Paris. 'Even if Steven Spielberg wanted to film a big scene with police and a shoot-out in the streets in January I'm sure it would not have got made,' she added. French authorities are investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video titled Blow Up France 2 may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist- a source has claimed. The footage, released by French-speaking ISIS fighters on Tuesday, shows masked jihadists praising the attacks on Paris last month and calling on Muslims to carry out further terror attacks in France. Questions: French authorities are said to be investigating if a woman appearing in ISIS's latest video (pictured in camouflage headgear) may be the wife of the Paris kosher deli Islamist . Hayat Boumeddiene, wife of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly, is believed to be in Syria . In a chilling statement to camera, the terrorist says: 'Don’t give up and particularly don’t lower your weapons, don’t surrender, kill.' 'Today it’s our darwa, kill them, you now have more than 4 million targets.' A source close to the French investigation into the kosher deli attacks told CNN that authorities in France believe that the woman who appears in the video wearing camouflage clothing and holding a weapon could be Hayat Boumeddiene. Boumeddiene is the wife of Amedy Coulibaly, the Islamist gunman who killed four hostages at the kosher Hyper Cacher market in the eastern part of the French capital on January 9. He was killed by police following an hours-long standoff. Authorities are searching for Boumeddiene, who is also believed to have been a co-conspirator in attack. She is currently thought to be in Syria.","Police have banned high-octane scenes being filmed outdoors in the city .

"A young woman suffering excruciating stomach pains diagnosed herself with ovarian cancer using Google. By the time the Sadie Rance's disease was discovered, a tumour growing on her ovary had reached the size of a melon. Until then, the 22-year-old had been told her agonising stomach pain and constipation were caused by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As her pain became unbearable Mrs Rance turned to the internet to search for answers. She discovered her symptoms met almost all the key signs of advanced ovarian cancer. Scroll down for video . Sadie Rance diagnosed her own ovarian cancer online after doctors mistook her symptoms for IBS . The then 22-year-old started to suffer excruciating stomach pain and constipation while she and her boyfriend Jason, pictured left with her, were travelling through Australia. Doctors operated, right, in January last year - but discovered there was nothing they could do . But after returning home to be told by doctors she was suffering IBS, she did her own research when her pain became unbearable. She discovered she had most of the signs of ovarian cancer. After she requested more tests doctors discovered a tumour the size of a melon in her stomach . After requesting more tests doctors diagnosed her with stage four ovarian cancer in September 2013. In January last year doctors performed an exploratory operation but discovered  they could not  remove the growth, because it had attached itself to her internal organs. The advanced cancer had spread to her small bowel, liver, diaphragm, heart and lungs. Mrs Rance has now been told she has between one and two years to live. But the positive 23-year-old has responded well to chemotherapy, which has shrunk the tumour. In June last year, Mrs Rance's then boyfriend Jason got down on one knee to propose. The couple, who met at university, married surrounded by friends and their families the next month. Mrs Rance, from Bromley, Kent, said: 'The trouble I had was that ovarian cancer is very rare in people under 50, and the type I have is even more rare, so I don't think it was ever even something that was considered. 'Still, when my problems seemed to get worse, I remember looking online and saw I had eight out of the nine symptoms of ovarian cancer. 'I asked my mum what she thought and, like any friend or mum would say to reassure you, she said ""Don't be silly, you don't have cancer"". 'But I knew my body and I could tell something wasn't right. I'm a very happy person and I'm determined to stay that way. 'When my doctor gave me the diagnosis, he said: ""I'm really sorry, you're such a positive person"". 'Jason has been amazing throughout all this. When he proposed I burst into tears because I couldn't face leaving him behind. Six months after first going to the doctors Mrs Rance was told her cancer was terminal. In July last year she and Jason tied the knot, after he got down on one knee to propose in the June . Mrs Rance, from Bromley in Kent, said she burst into tears when her husband proposed because she couldn't bear the thought of leaving him behind . The signs of ovarian cancer are not easy to spot and can be vague. They can just about all be attributed to another less serious condition, particularly where the disease is less advanced. Many women suffering the very early stages of ovarian cancer, stage one, won't have any symptoms at all. If they do notice changes, they are most likely to suffer pain in the lower abdomen or side, and bloating, or a full feeling in the abdomen. By the time ovarian cancer has spread outside the ovaries (stages two and three), the symptoms include: . When the cancer spreads to a distant body organ, for example the lungs, it is classed as being stage four ovarian cancer. Symptoms in this late stage include: . Source: Cancer Research UK . 'But the wedding was the best day of my life and he's helped me through so many struggles, including losing my hair. 'He would tell me my bald head was beautiful.' Mrs Rance first began suffering with stomach pains and constipation when she went travelling with her now husband, who is also 23. They spent six months in the Australian outback after graduating from the University of Winchester. Initially, Mrs Rance put the symptoms down to a change in her diet and new surroundings. But her health continued to deteriorate, despite all her blood tests and scans coming back clear. And it wasn't until the couple returned to the UK in May 2013 that she went to see her GP - by which time she had not been to the toilet for five weeks. She was told it was Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and prescribed laxatives. Over the next four months, while in constant agony, Mrs Rance returned to the surgery five times. Her pain became so unbearable she would double over in agony and could only stand for a few minutes. She said: 'When my symptoms began in Australia, I put it down to the water or the change in diet. 'But it was getting worse and worse and I was feeling so awful. 'I had two ultrasounds and some blood tests but nothing was picked up. 'By the time I flew home to the UK, I hadn't been to the toilet in five weeks. 'My mum said I looked really ill and took me to the doctors that day, but they just put me on laxatives. 'In the end I said to my GP: ""I'm not leaving here until you look at me and tell me I need to go to hospital"". Doctors told Mrs Rance she has between a year and two years to live. By the time her disease was detected it had already spread to her liver, bowel, heart and lungs. Despite her terminal diagnosis, the now 23-year-old is determined to remain positive . 'I couldn't take any more, I felt horrific and I couldn't even go to the supermarket without needing to sit down after five minutes because I was in so much agony. 'I had really bad pain in my stomach and when the doctors finally said it could be ovarian or bowel cancer, I thought it all made sense. 'I should have said to my doctor ""I think this is what I've got, do something about it,"" but there's no point on dwelling on what I could have done.' Mrs Rance is being treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital and responded well to weekly chemotherapy, which successfully shrank the tumour. But when it stopped working in September, she was put on a clinical trial with monthly sessions. The 23-year-old said she wants to share her story to encourage young people to be more persistent with doctors, and to raise awareness. She said: 'I've met lots of young people aged 24 and under with cancer on my journey and there's a massive problem with young people being diagnosed in later stages because doctors don't believe it could be cancer. 'I'd absolutely urge people to go the doctors and be persistent. 'When you know something's really wrong with your body you know and you need to make the doctor believe it.' Her husband Jason, who now works one day a week at a supermarket and devotes the rest of his time to his wife, has been by her side throughout. The pair have been determined to make the most of their time together by enjoying as many days out and memorable experiences as possible. He said: 'Sadie is quite simply the most amazing young lady I have ever met in my life. She has now urged other young people who fear something is wrong to push doctors for a diagnosis . Mr and Mrs Rance have raised more than £35,000 for the gynaecological unit at the Royal Marsden Hospital, where she is undergoing treatment . 'Through everything she has gone through, she never moans and always finds a positive no matter how bad things are. 'I'm the luckiest man in the world - firstly to have met her, but now being married to her means the world to me. 'We make the most of every minute together and take each day as it comes. 'We have no idea how long we have left together so for us, so all we can do is enjoy each other's company and make the most of it. 'The way she looks at life is so inspiring. 'She hates the phrase but she really is a role model. She shows you can look at life in a positive way, no matter how bad things get.'

"New evidence showing the level of atmospheric CO2 millions of years ago supports recent climate change predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), according to research scientists. A multinational research team, led by scientists at the University of Southampton, has analysed new records showing the CO2 content of Earth's atmosphere between 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago, during the Pliocene era. And this data could be used to work out how Earth today will react as the climate continues to warm due to human activities. Scroll down for video . Research led by the University of Southampton looked at the history of Earth's climate 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago in the Pilocene era. They say this data confirms the IPCC's warnings about our modern climate (stock image shown) if CO2 levels are allowed to continue to rise . During the Pliocene, the Earth was around 2°C warmer than it is today and atmospheric CO2 levels were around 350-400 parts per million (ppm), similar to the levels reached in recent years. By studying the relationship between CO2 levels and climate change during a warmer period in Earth's history, the scientists have been able to estimate how the climate will respond to increasing levels of carbon dioxide, a parameter known as climate sensitivity. The Pliocene is particularly useful as it is the last time CO2 levels on Earth were as high as they are today, Dr Gavin Foster, co-author of the study, told MailOnline. Continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes. It will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems.' This includes extreme weather and rising sea levels, heat waves, flooding and droughts. Ocean acidification, which comes from the added carbon absorbed by oceans, will harm marine life. Without changes in emissions, 'climate change risks are likely to be high or very high by the end of the 21st century.' At the current rate, by mid-century temperatures will increase by about another 2°C (3.6°F) compared to temperatures from 1986 to 2005. By the end of the century, that scenario will bring temperatures that are about 3.7°C (6.7°F) warmer. The impact on the Earth could already be considered dangerous, the report claims. He said the Arctic ‘wasn’t a tropical paradise, but it certainly had animals and trees, it was a lot warmer back then.’ The geological record provides a rich archive that we can dip in to, to see the effects on our planet as the climate continues to warm. As the planet warms even further at a rapid rate that cannot be attributed to natural processes alone, it will be necessary to go further and further back in time in the geological record. For example, 50 million years ago it was 12°C warmer than it is today, when there were crocodiles in the Arctic and sub-tropical forests on Antarctica. The findings, which have been published in Nature, also show how climate sensitivity can vary over the long term. Dr Foster added in a release: 'Today the Earth is still adjusting to the recent rapid rise of CO2 caused by human activities, whereas the longer-term Pliocene records document the full response of CO2-related warming. 'Our estimates of climate sensitivity lie well within the range of 1.5 to 4.5°C increase per CO2 doubling summarised in the latest IPCC report. 'This suggests that the research community has a sound understanding of what the climate will be like as we move toward a Pliocene-like warmer future caused by human greenhouse gas emissions.' CO2 levels in the Pliocene - when animals like the sabre-tooth cat Dinofelis (illustrated) roamed - were similar to the levels now reached. At that time the Arctic was warm enough to have animals and trees. And as the climate warms further due to human activity, scientists will look even further back in the geological record . The Pliocene is particularly useful as it is the last time CO2 levels on Earth were as high as they are today, now due to man-made emissions (stock image shown), Dr Gavin Foster told MailOnline . Lead author of the study, Dr Miguel Martinez-Boti, also from Southampton said: 'Our new records also reveal an important change at around 2.8 million years ago, when levels rapidly dropped to values of about 280ppm, similar to those seen before the Industrial Revolution. 'This caused a dramatic global cooling that initiated the ice-age cycles that have dominated Earth's climate ever since.' The research team also assessed whether climate sensitivity was different in warmer times, like the Pliocene, than in colder times, like the glacial cycles of the last 800,000 years. Dr Eelco Rohling, of the Australian National University in Canberra, said: 'We find that climate change in response to CO2 change in the warmer period was around half that of the colder period. 'We determine that this difference is driven by the growth and retreat of large continental ice sheets that are present in the cold ice-age climates; these ice sheets reflect a lot of sunlight and their growth consequently amplifies the impact of CO2 changes.' Dr Richard Pancost, from the University of Bristol Cabot Institute, added: 'When we account for the influence of the ice sheets, we confirm that the Earth's climate changed with a similar sensitivity to overall [radiative] forcing during both warmer and colder climates.' According to last year's IPCC report, continued emission of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and long-lasting changes (some shown on the map). It will increase the likelihood of 'severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems,' said the report .","Research led by the University of Southampton looked at the history of Earth's climate 2.3 to 3.3 million years ago in the Pilocene era .

"Coronation Street star Beverley Callard has revealed how friends distanced themselves and 'abandoned' her after learning of her battle with depression. The actress, who plays Liz McDonald on the ITV soap, said people battling mental illness should be encouraged to share their fears with those close to them. The 57-year-old, who has fought depression and attempted suicide in the past, told BBC Radio Manchester it was easy for sufferers to feel isolated and alone. 'I had one person say to me, and we'd been friends for a long time, ""I don't think we should see each for a while because you're not yourself and you're not good for me"",' she said. Scroll down for video . Coronation Street star Beverley Callard has revealed close friends 'abandoned' her after learning of her battle with mental health problems. The 57-year-old has battled depression for years, and has attempted suicide . 'We actually got way beyond that, but at that time I felt abandoned by lots of people - and I think many people do.' Beverley said she believes the stigma attached to mental health issues can prevent people discussing their problems with family and friends. She said: 'We say to someone ""how are you?"" but more often than not we actually don't wait for the answer. 'If you just get the feeling that someone you know is suffering is sad say, ""how are you? Do you want to talk about it?"" 'And if you are the person being asked that question, try to talk about it.' The actress spoke out as a new survey revealed almost 60 per cent of people with mental health problems wait more than a year to tell the people closest to them. The survey, carried out by campaign group Time to Change, also found 64 per cent of respondents believe the stigma and discrimination they experienced was as bad as or worse than the mental health problem itself. The group is calling for people to 'break the silence' surrounding mental health problems and to spend five minutes today discussing the subject. Sue Baker, director of Time to Change, said: 'It's shocking to see that so many people are still waiting over a year to talk to their nearest and dearest - it's hard to imagine this happening with other health issues. The actress, who plays Liz McDonald on the ITV soap, said people should be encouraged to talk to those closest to them when dealing with mental health issues . 'We know that talking openly about mental health is a vital first step towards breaking down stigma and discrimination, so we are asking people to take five minutes on February 5 to do just that. 'With major employers, politicians, universities, schools and tens of thousands of individuals taking part, we've come a long way towards breaking the silence. 'But this new data shows there is still much further to go until talking about mental health is an ordinary and unremarkable thing to do.' Beverley, who was forced to take five months off from Coronation Street in 2009 after checking into The Priory for depression, spoke in 2013 of how her mental health problems had affected her work. 'I think some people see you as unreliable and flaky and that you might not be able to do your job as well as you could,' she told the Radio Times. 'And I was very aware that some people at Granada felt like that about me at the time. I didn't want to be talked about like that because, if I take something on, I usually finish it to the very end and do the best that I can.' In 2007, Beverley revealed how five years after a hysterectomy in March 1991 - carried out as treatment for cancer - she began to feel 'life was a battle' and dreaded going to work. After a year of increasing despair, the day came where she broke down on set. Beverley, pictured with her on-screen ex-husband Jim McDonald, played by Charles Lawson, spoke out as the campaign group Time to Change launched a campaign encouraging people to talk about mental health issues for five minutes a day . 'The pretence was over. My heart was beating fast, I was sweating - I didn't have a shread of self-esteem.' It was then that the ITV doctor diagnosed the actress with depression. 'I was shaking and felt numb,' she said in an interview. 'When he said I had clinical depression it was a surprise. I never thought that I would suffer depression.' Fifteen months later, Beverley collapsed at home and was admitted to The Priory. Then, two years after her first diagnosis, she learned the problem was actually her ovaries. They were no longer producing enough oestrogen - a hormone that affects mood and cognition. She was prescribed the antidepressant Clomipramine along with the oestrogen supplement Climaval, and a testosterone supplement Restandol. Slowly, she began to have days when she felt less miserable. In 2002 things began to improve markedly and Beverley came off the antidepressants and was put on Prozac. The next year she returned to Coronation Street.","Actress who plays Liz McDonald said people battling mental health issues should be encouraged to speak to those closest to them .

"Harper Lee's biographer, who suggested the novelist had been coerced into releasing a To Kill A Mockingbird sequel, has changed his mind. Charles J Shields was among a throng of literary figures to suggest the reclusive 88-year-old may not have the capacity to make the decision herself. But today, after Lee released a statement to say she is 'happy as hell' about the release, Shields backed down. However, doubts remain as a number of Lee's hometown friends maintain the novelist, who has been left blind after suffering a stroke, was 'manipulated'. 'I'm happy as hell': Harper Lee's publisher has released a statement slamming claims she has been coerced into publishing Go Set A Watchman, the sequel to To Kill A Mockingbird, 60 years after it was written . Explaining his u-turn, Shields told DailyMail.com: 'You know what, I've decided I'm happy as hell too now. 'I believe that statement was genuine and, really, this can only be a good thing for the industry.' Shields initially said Lee was vulnerable to manipulation after her sister and lawyer, Alice Lee, died. Alice, who died in November 2014 at the age of 103, was 'Harper Lee's buffer against the publicity hungry world,' he told the International Business Times. Today, however, he told DailyMail.com: 'I expressed concerns about the book, the process, and the fact that it is unedited. 'But this is good news for booksellers. I hope we will all be reading the same book this summer and I hope it is Go Set A Watchman. 'At the end of the day, people are really looking forward to another story about Scout, and so am I.' Addressing his fellow critics, Shields said: 'I think the tide is turning.' Unaware? Harper Lee, pictured with Gregory Peck, who starred in the movie version of To Kill A Mockingbird, allegedly did not know the manuscript for her original version - Go Set A Watchman - survived 60 years . However, that sea change has yet to reach Monroeville, where Lee grew up. Janet Sawyer, owner of the Courthouse Café and childhood friend of the Lee sisters, told AL.com: 'I don't think she agreed to do it. I think it's her attorney being greedy, because Ms. Lee was a very private person who didn't like a lot of publicity. 'She had a stroke several years ago and her mind is not in a condition to make these decisions, I don't think, personally. 'Tonja Carter [Lee's attorney] doesn't allow her to see her friends anymore. She's isolated her from the world in order to manipulate her.' Lee previously said she had not realized the manuscript of her new book had survived and that she was 'humbled and amazed' it was going to be published now. Best-seller: After the publication of To Kill A Mockingbird, Harper Lee did not publish again . Adding to the outcry, Marja Mills, a friend of the Lee family and author of a Harper Lee memoir, told the New York Times: 'I have some concerns about statements that have been attributed to her.' She said  Alice Lee, told her that Harper 'can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.' Furthermore, publisher Jonathan Burnham acknowledged that the publisher has had no direct conversations about the new book with Harper Lee, but communicated through her Monroeville attorney, Tonja Carter, and literary agent Andrew Nurnburg. However, slamming the allegations of coercion, a spokesman for the publishing house claims Lee said: 'I'm alive and kicking and happy as hell with the reactions to Watchman.' The novel, called Go Set A Watchman, was written before To Kill A Mockingbird but was rejected by publishers who set her to work on the novel that made her famous. To Kill A Mockingbird, set around a rape trial in the racially-divided Deep South of the US, has sold more than 40 million copies since it was published in 1960. Its central characters, Scout, her brother Jem and their lawyer father Atticus, were brought to life in a 1962 film starring Gregory Peck. The new book revolves around the now-adult Scout's return to her native Alabama from New York to visit her father. A spokesman for her publisher said: 'Harper Lee still enjoys reading and uses a magnifying machine from the New York Institute for the Blind to read books, newspapers and documents.' Go Set A Watchman will be published on July 14 by William Heinemann, which was the original UK publisher of To Kill A Mockingbird. The publisher says Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird. Burnham said during a telephone interview that he had known both Carter and Nurnburg for years and was 'completely confident' Lee was fully involved in the decision to release the book. 'We've had a great deal of communication with Andrew and Tonja,' said Burnham, adding that Nurnburg had met with her recently and found her 'feisty and in very fine spirits.","Publisher claims Harper Lee 'said she is happy as hell' about new book .

"A radical new weapon that can fire a shell at seven times the speed of sound has been shown off in public for the first time. Described as 'Star Wars technology' by researchers, the railgun can fire shells at seven times speed of sound, and penetrate concrete 100 miles away. The weapon was on display to the public for the first time at the Naval Future Force Science and Technology EXPO at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. Scroll down for videos . Using electromagnetic energy, the gun can fire a shell weighing 10kg at up to 5,400mph over 100 miles – with such force and accuracy it penetrates three concrete walls or six half-inch thick steel plates. Two prototypes of the weapon have been developed for the US Navy – one by British arms manufacturer BAE Systems and the second by a US firm. The BAE version was shown off this week. Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, head of US Naval Research, said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone extensive testing on land. It will be mounted on high-speed vessel the USNS Millinocket for sea trials in 2016. 'It's now reality and it's not science fiction,' Admiral Klunder said. 'It's firing. An electromagnetic railgun is a gun that uses just electricity – no gun powder – and … can shoot a projectile well over 100 miles at Mach 7. Energetic weapons, such as EM railguns, are the future of naval combat.' Electromagnetic launchers were one of the areas researched by Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defence Initiative, nicknamed 'Star Wars' after the science fiction film franchise. Rear Admiral Matthew Klunder, head of US . Naval Research, said the futuristic electromagnetic railgun – so called . because it fires from two parallel rails – had already undergone . extensive testing on land . Admiral Klunder added: 'It will help us in air defence, it will help us in cruise missile defence, it will help us in ballistic missile defence … we're also talking about a gun that's going to shoot a projectile that's about one one-hundredth of the cost of an existing missile system today. 'It … will give our adversaries a huge moment of pause to go, 'Do I even want to go engage a naval ship?'.' The weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing Latin motto 'I, who am speed, eradicate' Warships can carry dozens of conventional missiles, which cost around £600,000 each, but could be loaded with hundreds of railgun projectiles, at only £15,000 each. The projectiles,Hyper Velocity Projectiles, are also under developemtn by BAE. It is a next-generation, guided projectile capable of completing multiple missions for the Electromagnetic Railgun, as well as existing 5-inch and 155-mm gun systems. 'The HVP takes the next evolutionary step in providing an affordable, precise, multi-mission capability for multiple gun platforms,' said Chris Hughes, vice president and general manager of Weapon Systems at BAE Systems. 'We look forward to applying our expertise and technologies to this important program.' The HVP is designed to provide lethality and performance enhancements to current and future gun systems. The objective of the first phase is to produce a concept design and development roadmap towards fully guided flight demonstrations. The weapon uses speed rather than explosives to destroy its target and comes equipped with the menacing Latin motto 'I, who am speed, eradicate'. Using an electromagnetic force known as the Lorenz Force, the gun accelerates a projectile between two rails that conduct electricity, before launching it at ferocious speed. This means the railgun can fire further than conventional guns and maintain enough kinetic energy to inflict tremendous damage. Railguns were first conceived of nearly a century ago and patented by French inventor Louis Octave Fauchon-Villeplee. Nazi Germany took up the research during the Second World War to adapt its anti-aircraft guns. The first sea trials of the new railguns will take place in 2016 aboard high-speed vessel the USNS Millinocket (artist's impression above)","Technology fires a shell weighing 10kg at up to 5,400mph over 100 miles .

"Drink driver Tariq Mahmood, 31, was caught when he ran out of petrol on the motorway, pictured at Manchester Magistrates Court . A drink-driver who had been downing shots was caught when he ran out of petrol on the motorway and police stopped to help. Officers quickly realised that Tariq Mahmood, 31, stank of booze when they stopped to assist him at around 5am on the hard shoulder of the M62 near Eccles. The 31-year-old from Stoke-On-Trent has been banned from driving for three-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to driving over the limit. Police spotted him and another man standing over the Vauxhall Astra in the early hours of the morning, Manchester Magistrates Court heard. They went over to see if he needed any assistance. But after speaking to him they soon realised that he smelt of alcohol, the court was told. Mahmood was breathalysed and was found to be two and a half times the legal limit and was taken to a nearby police station. It is his second drink driving conviction and his fourth driving-related offence in five years. Defending himself, Mahmood said: 'I stopped drinking but my mates gave me a couple of drinks, a couple of shots. 'And I thought I was covered on my girlfriend's insurance because we are both fully comp.' He was also fined £480 and ordered to pay £85 costs with a £32 surcharge. Matthew Siddall, prosecuting, said: 'This difficulty with this case is his record.' Chairman of the bench Margaret Elridge told him: 'This is a serious matter. 'This is your second drink-driving offence in 10 years so this period of disqualification is obligatory. 'However, we have taken into account your prompt guilty plea.' His lowest reading was 85mg of alcohol in 100 ml of breath, nearly two and a half times the limit of 35.

"An exclusive private members' club set up by Eurythmics star Dave Stewart has been slated by food hygiene inspectors who found mouse droppings littered around the kitchen. The seven-floor Hospital Club, in Covent Garden, was set up Stewart and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen ten years ago, and has hosted performances by the likes of The Who, Bastille and Johnny Marr. But mouse droppings were found throughout the kitchens, including in a pastry area next to a microwave, leading inspectors to give the club the lowest possible hygiene rating - a zero. Mouse droppings were found all over the kitchen of the Hospital Club, in Covent Garden, central London . Eurythmics star Dave Stewart (left) and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen (right) set up the club in 2004 and are still involved with the running of the exclusive members club in Covent Garden, London . The central London club was pulled up on 23 points related to poor food hygiene. Inspectors found mouse excrement around ovens, behind wheeled containers, between equipment, by a wall and inside the vent section of an ice cream machine. Inspectors said: 'The head chef immediately ordered his staff to clean and disinfect the affected areas. However, such areas must be routinely inspected every day and any signs of infestation reported to your pest contractor. 'Such areas will need to be cleaned and disinfected after any signs of pest activity.' Other problems included the club using a vacuum packing machine, used for sealing food, for both raw and cooked meals - posing a risk of cross-contamination. Spoons were being stored in contact with sauces in a fridge, there was no evidence of fruit being washed in a bar area, a hand basin did not have soap or drying facilities and the inside of ice machines in a kitchen were found to be dirty. The inspector also found food was being kept on the floor of a walk-in freezer. A ceiling and a vent were dirty and the club had not identified the risks of serving under-cooked burgers, the report, written in February, found. Hygiene inspectors from Camden Council gave the club a zero-rating, with mouse excrement found around ovens, behind wheeled containers, between equipment and inside the vent section of an ice cream machine .

"By BELINDA BROWN FOR THE DAILY MAIL . Why is the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity — both cornerstones of the modern feminist movement — measured by the number of women who are in top jobs such as directors of FTSE 100 companies or High Court judges? The depressing answer is that the so-called feminist agenda has been hijacked by one group of women who have turned it into a self-improvement manifesto for their own social type: the well-educated, professional and political elite of high-flying woman. Recently, Professor Alison Wolf, an economist at King’s College London, argued that feminism has become obsessed with these ambitious over-achievers and is ignoring the concerns of the majority of women — those who didn’t go to university, those who are stay-at-home mums and those in low-paid jobs. Scroll down for video . The so-called feminist agenda has been hijacked by  the well-educated, professional and political elite of high-flying woman . While Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has predictably criticised Baroness Wolf, I couldn’t agree with her more. This privileged middle-class sisterhood — who have enough money to farm out their childcare to a small army of nannies, au pairs and nursery school teachers — judge themselves by the success of their working lives. Sadly, they judge all other women, too, by the same unreasonable yardstick. In doing so, they patronisingly ignore millions of other women, many of whom would prefer to stay at home and raise a family — at least until their children start full-time education. The fact is that many of those women who choose to work treat their often low-grade, poorly-paid job principally as a financial means of supporting their family, rather than as an end in itself. In short, whereas there is a powerful feminist elite who live to work, the vast majority of women work — if they have to, for economic reasons — simply as a means to live. The tragedy is that, in their blinkered attitude, modern feminists are causing deep damage to the latter for not espousing their values. Thanks to their high public profiles and influential positions, they are able to dictate how the success of female emancipation and equal opportunity should be measured. To watch the video in full please click here . Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman (pictured) has criticised Baroness Wolf for her comments on feminism . And, of course, they measure it as they measure their own success — strictly in terms of work. As a result, the policies of governments of all political parties over recent years have been dominated by the principle of getting all women into work or back into work. This, in my view, is utterly misguided. For the unforeseen consequence is that Britain is now one of the most family-unfriendly countries in the developed world — with a distorted tax and benefit system to match. Astonishingly, given how often David Cameron talks about the importance of marriage and the family, he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single-earner households and which seems to be driven by the belief that even mothers with young children should go out to work as much as possible. This emphasis on working-women perfectly suits those well-educated, professional, middle-class couples in which both husband and wife work. Their double incomes allow them to buy a big house, good schools for their children, more exotic holidays and, crucially, round-the-clock childcare. But for governments to adhere to such a distorted mindset does not help the millions of women who do not feel defined by their job — but who care passionately about keeping their relationships and families together. By ignoring the wishes of this large group of women, the blinkered feminists — unable to conceive of a world where not all women think like them — make the tough lives of so many mothers even tougher. What these feminists seem to have forgotten is that not all women are the same. Admittedly, some women will always strive to succeed at the highest level — and it is absolutely right that they have the equal opportunity to do so. But there are millions of women who, for all sorts of reasons — relating to their life-priorities, wealth and education or social background — have no interest in pursuing a career. They simply want to have happy, healthy children; a supportive, loving husband, and enough money to get by. The problem is, however, that as a result of the pressure from modern feminists and their influence on people such as Mr Cameron (whose high-flying wife once earned an estimated £400,000 salary as creative director of an upmarket stationery firm), women with more modest, family-oriented ambitions suffer. Prime Minister, David Cameron (pictured), often talks about the importance of marriage and the family while he continues to head a government that has a particular bias against single-earner households . At the top end of the social ladder, successful working women are invariably supported by an equally well-remunerated husband. But at the other end of the social scale, life is very different. Encouraged by government incentives to go out to work (for example, given childcare vouchers) — and, of course, through economic necessity — they feel they have to take a job . . . even if they don’t want to. Every morning I see women leave the council estate where I live, to go to work — stopping with a heavy heart at the nursery or child-minder to drop off a young child. This is the routine of millions of women all over the country. The term feminism, first used in Britain in the 1890s, comes from the French word ‘feminisme,’ coined by utopian socialist Charles Fourier. There is another side-effect. The increase in the number of women at the lower end of the social scale who feel they have to go out to work inevitably means a reduction of the numbers of men in the workplace. Indeed, all the official statistics show that male unemployment is on the rise. As a result, working women — if they have a partner — often return home from work to find an unemployed partner who’s been kicking his heels at home all day, seething with resentment and low self-esteem. Not surprisingly, she, in turn, will often seethe — in despair at the lack of gratitude. This can easily lead to a downward spiral, with couples much more likely to break up. Then, sadly, the great risk is that this will damage the couple’s children, with boys, in particular, suffering at school, experimenting with drugs or drifting into crime. And so, in the next generation, male unemployment is the almost inevitable outcome. And all this is because of the power of a feminist elite who have relentlessly promoted social policies that sacrifice the values and interests of ordinary and relatively happy family lives in the name of ‘equal opportunity’. The damage, I fear, they are doing to conventional family life in this country is enormous. So what can be done to reverse this? Professor Alison Wolf (pictured) argued that feminism has become obsessed with these ambitious over-achievers and is ignoring the concerns of the majority of women . Of course, nobody wishes to stop any talented and ambitious woman from achieving at the highest level and it’s absolutely right that such women compete with men on a truly level playing field. But there needs to be an acknowledgement that a woman’s worth cannot be judged solely by the job she does, and that a woman who stays at home to bring up a family is every bit as valuable as other more professionally ambitious women. What’s needed is a major sea-change in thinking, one that acknowledges that men and women are not the same — but also that all women are not the same, either. I’m not saying that those who choose to stay at home should be offered unfair financial inducements to do so — but they should certainly not be punished for doing so. Yet that’s exactly what the current tax and benefits system does. This is perverse. Why, for example, shouldn’t a stay-at-home mother be able to transfer her . personal income tax allowance to her husband and partner, thereby reducing the tax burden on hard-pressed family finances. But that should only be a first step. Since the feminist revolution began in the Seventies, billions of pounds must have been spent on promoting sexual equality and women’s role in the workplace. The great irony is that its success has resulted, today, with the Government worried about levels of male unemployment. For the incontrovertible fact is that men are suffering: falling behind women in education; in the numbers taking up apprenticeships and, increasingly, in the workplace, too. This isn’t a development for feminists to crow over; it’s a potential social disaster. It is a truism that men in work are happier men, and they make better husbands and more attentive fathers. I believe that if more men could be helped to find jobs, while more women choose to stay at home, society would benefit with a virtuous circle of happier husbands, happier wives and, of course, happier children. But that can only happen if the Government — and the feminist elite it seems to be in thrall to — accept that a woman who stays at home and raises children can be every bit as valuable to society as a whole as the woman who goes out to forge a brilliant career.","The feminist agenda has been hijacked by the well-educated professionals .

Kim called on her husband Kanye, who has strong connections in the fashion world, to help reinvent her and he famously cleared out Kim's wardrobe . Writing on her Twitter, the mother-of-one said: 'Up all night redoing my whole wardrobe with Kanye.....I'm so ready for new looks for the New Year! New 2015 vision.' Of course, her new husband Kanye has played a large part in her style transformation. Kim has spoken on many occasions about the rapper-come-designer's influence on her wardrobe choices. Last year, Kanye introduced his wife to fashion label A.W.A.K.E. - and she loved it so much she wore it twice in four days. Kanye offers his input on a Balmain shoot alongside super designer, Olivier Rousteing . The brand, which is actually run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar former fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian, was discovered online by Kim's husband, Mr West. 'He researches everything and he loves to find new talent, and he introduced me to her and told me she’s part Armenian, and so am I,' Kim told WWD. 'I’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it’s really important to me to support designers that I believe in and friends that I believe in that are hardworking.' In one episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Kanye is even seen clearing out her closet to make way for a sleeker look. And it seemed his help worked. She has since been asked by Carine Roitfeld, the former editor of French Vogue, to cover her CR Fashion book and is a firm favourite of style bible, LOVE magazine.
