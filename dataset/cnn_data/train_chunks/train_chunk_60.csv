"(CNN) -- A nationwide search continued Monday for two of three inmates who escaped from an Arizona prison Friday -- after a third was apprehended 670 miles away following a shootout in Colorado. An all-points-bulletin has been issued to authorities around the country for the escapees identified as Tracy Province and John McCluskey. The third inmate was captured Sunday in Rifle, Colorado. Daniel Renwick, 36, was spotted driving a brown Chevy Blazer by a Rifle police officer who gave chase, according to Arizona Department of Corrections Director Charles Ryan. Gunshots were exchanged, and Renwick was ultimately taken into custody. Renwick was serving 22 years for second-degree murder. He is being held in Colorado, awaiting questioning by the U.S. Marshals Service. Province and McCluskey are believed to be with a female accomplice who was on the visitation list for one of the inmates. Charles Ryan, director of the Arizona Department of Corrections, told HLN that it's believed she has a relationship with McClusky and may have aided the escape by throwing cutting tools over a fence . The suspected accomplice was identified as 43-year-old Casslyn Mae Welch, who is 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 135 pounds, with brown hair and green eyes. After their escape, the inmates and the accomplice abducted two truck drivers at gunpoint on Interstate 40 outside of Kingman, Arizona, and hijacked their 18-wheeler, according to the Mohave County sheriff's department in Kingman. The truck drivers and the rig were released five hours later in Flagstaff, about 135 miles to the east. One of the truck drivers spoke about it later. ""They said, 'If you guys are nice to us, we will be nice to you. If you do anything, we will shoot you,' "" said Prabhjeet Bains. ""Every time he looked at me, I thought he was going to shoot me, so I'm glad we are still alive."" The fugitives were later believed to be driving a 2002 silver Volkswagon Jetta, purchased Saturday in west Phoenix. They were later spotted on a security camera in a bank inside a grocery store in Goodyear, Arizona, according to Barrett Marson, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Corrections. Province, 42, was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. McCluskey, 45, was serving 15 years for attempted second-degree murder and other charges. The men were discovered missing after the 9:45 p.m. count Friday at the privately-operated Kingman facility. The escapees cut a hole in the fence. A helicopter and dogs began a search. ""Precisely how they escaped is under investigation,"" Ryan said, noting some ""operational security problems"" at the prison. ""Those are being evaluated and investigated as we speak,"" he added. Specifically, Ryan told HLN that authorities are looking at two possible failures in security. First, an alarm didn't go off when a door was opened inside the prison. Ryan said he's not sure why it didn't activate. And second, a radio alarm indicating that the fence had been cut ""wasn't detected for some time,"" he said. ""Staff did not respond sufficiently to alarms on the perimeter system,and we believe that afforded (the escapees) an opportunity to go through the fence and escape,"" he  said. The escaped prisoners are described as armed and dangerous. CNN Radio's Barbara Hall contributed to this report.","NEW: Nationwide search under way for two inmates who remain at large .

"(CNN) -- A Brazilian goalie, his lover and his wife were among nine people charged with the murder of his former girlfriend who had been trying to prove he had fathered her son. The prosecutor filed the charges against Bruno Fernandes Das Dores de Souza and eight others in Contagem, Minas Gerais on Wednesday. Charges include murder with special circumstances, kidnapping, imprisonment, concealment of a corpse, conspiracy and corruption of a minor. Eliza Samudio, 25, remains missing two months after she was last reported seen. A former policeman, Marcos Aparecido dos Santos, was also charged with murder, conspiracy and concealment of corpse. All suspects are in jail except for one who is being sought. Souza's 17-year-old cousin told police the woman was killed. The teen said Souza watched as the missing woman was asphyxiated, mutilated and fed to dogs, local police investigator Wagner Pinto told reporters last month. Souza's new lawyer has said his client denies all the accusations. Attorney Ercio Quaresma said it's ""irresponsible"" to charge the nine suspects with corpse concealment since no body has been found. ""It's an inconsequence to sign something like that not having concrete proof,"" Quaresma said. Quaresma said the goalie will not answer any questions for now. ""He has not spoken and he won't speak until the defense decides he needs to speak,"" the lawyer said. ""And that might not happen"". Samudio was trying to prove that the goalie fathered her infant son, who is currently being cared for by her mother, police said. The police investigator described her death to reporters last month. ""They tied her hands, and this other individual strangled her,"" Pinto said, referring to Santos. ""Later, they deboned and disemboweled her."" The woman's body was taken to an undisclosed location where her remains were fed to several Rottweilers, police said. The cousin told investigators that Souza watched the entire incident, according to Pinto. Souza's lawyer decried the accusations. ""Are the Rottweilers being charged too?"" he asked reporters. Souza's former attorney, Michel Assef Filho, said last month that the goalie has ""no knowledge of the facts, he is astonished and scared by his cousin's testimony and that's it."" Filho stopped representing Souza when the Flamengo Club suspended Souza's contract. The attorney works on behalf of the soccer club. The football star was last seen with Samudio in June as they headed for his country home in the state of Minas Gerais. A search for Samudio's body is under way. The Flamengo Club said it is suspending the goalie's contract until all facts are known. Journalist Luciani Gomes contributed to this report.","Brazilian goalie among nine people charged .

"Bristow, Virginia (CNN) -- Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has ordered an investigation after a man who was in the United States illegally killed a nun in a car crash, authorities said. Napolitano is trying determine why the man was still in the country because he had been arrested two previous times for drunken driving offenses. The suspect, Carlos Montano, driving Sunday morning under the influence of alcohol, slammed head-on into three nuns in a Toyota sedan, police said. The three were just a few miles from a monastery in Bristow, Virginia, heading for their annual retreat. Sister Denise Mosier was killed instantly, and the other two remained hospitalized Tuesday. The suspect has twice been in custody -- the first time, almost two years ago in October 2008 -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. But both times, Montano was released on his own recognizance pending deportation proceedings, because he was not convicted of a violent felony such as murder, rape, or robbery. ""He was in removal proceedings,"" Napolitano told CNN on Tuesday. ""Why were the removal proceedings taking so long? I do not obviously as of today have the results of that, but I will get them."" Corey Stewart, chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors, said he was furious with how immigration officials have handled the case. ""We identified him as an illegal alien, we told ICE that he had twice been convicted now of DUI's, that he posed a threat to the community,"" said Stewart. ""And they turned around and they released him right back into the neighborhood."" County prosecutor Paul Ebert said Montano has previously been convicted twice for drunken driving, as well as reckless driving, speeding, and public drunkenness. He spent 20 days in jail in 2009. The suspect, 23, has now been charged with involuntary manslaughter. It was unclear if he has retained a defense lawyer. The incident comes amid a contentious national debate about illegal immigration, just days after a strict new immigration law was scheduled to go into effect in Arizona. The most controversial provisions of the law have been stayed by a judge, but supporters of the law said a failure by Washington to crack down on illegal immigration forced Arizona to act. The Department of Homeland Security says record numbers of immigrants who have committed crimes have been removed in the last 18 months. ""This administration has fundamentally reformed immigration enforcement,"" said spokesman Matt Chandler, ""identifying and removing criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety."" But Stewart said more needs to be done. ""Congress has deliberately understaffed and underfunded immigration enforcement for years,"" Stewart said. On Tuesday, the Virginia monastery's chapel was adorned with flowers, and a vigil and funeral are scheduled for later this week. Mosier, the victim in the car accident, had served as a missionary in South Africa, and regularly acted as a spiritual mentor to the 30 other nuns at the convent. ""It's a great loss, because they depended on her,"" said Sister Andrea Verchuck. But the convent said in a statement, ""The Benedictine Sisters are dismayed and saddened that this tragedy has been politicized, and become an apparent forum for the illegal immigration agenda."" Verchuck said she would rather focus on the needless tragedies caused by drinking and driving, and on forgiveness, in memory of Mosier. ""If she had been conscious at the time that she was taken from the wreck,"" she said, ""If Carlos had been there, she would have said, 'Carlos, I forgive you.' "" CNN's Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.","Death of nun has angered local authorities .

"(CNN) -- Marathon man John Isner gained revenge at the hands of his Wimbledon conqueror Thiemo De Bakker after knocking the Dutchman out of the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington. Isner lost in straight sets to De Bakker in the second round in London after his record-breaking win over Nicolas Mahout, from France. The American's 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68 win over Mahout at Wimbledon became the longest match in tennis history, stretching over three days and lasting 11 hours. It was no surprise when an exhausted Isner was dumped out by De Bakker in round two but Isner got one over on his rival with a narrow win in the U.S. capital. The match yielded only one break point but Isner couldn't take it. Instead he had to rely on two tie-break wins to triumph 7-6 7-6 and continue his decent run of form -- Isner was beaten by Mardy Fish in the final of the Atlanta Tennis Championships last month. His record in tie-breaks this season is now 25-14 and his win set up a third round match with Belgian Xavier Malisse. After the match he claimed he hadn't been seeking to avenge his Wimbledon defeat. ""It wasn't like a revenge factor at all,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. ""I treated it like any other match. ""It wasn't pretty out there. The only thing that kept me in the match was the way I competed. Not much was working right. Probably just the way I compete [got me through]. More times than not you're not going to play your best out there."" Isner was pipped in the 2007 final by fellow American Andy Roddick and the number two seed got his quest for a fourth Legg Mason title off to a winning start by beating Slovenian qualifier Grega Zemlja. Roddick conceded just nine points on his serve in the entire match and made the most of his two break point chances to earn a straight sets victory. ""I accomplished what I wanted to,"" he told the official ATP Tour website. ""I got into some rallies early and moved the ball around the court and mixed up paces and different heights. ""I put a high percentage of returns in the court and got back to playing clean tennis. Doing things that don't always show up on the stats sheet but they win you tennis matches."" Roddick was beaten in last year's final by Juan Martin del Potro in a third set tie-break and will now face world No. 6 Gilles Simon, who beat Russian Igor Kunitsyn 6-1 6-2 in just under an hour. Elsewhere, number three seed Fernando Verdasco had a scare against German Michael Berrer before eventually battling through to win 4-6 7-5 7-6 and set up a tie with American qualifier Ryan Sweeting. The number four seed Marin Cilic survived a clutch of break points to beat Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin 6-4 6-2 and book a date with American Mardy Fish.","Marathon man John Isner beats Thiemo De Bakker 7-6 7-6 in Washington .

"Washington (CNN) -- James Clapper was confirmed unanimously by the Senate Thursday night to be the nation's next intelligence chief. Clapper, tapped by President Obama for the Director of National Intelligence job, will oversee the nation's 16 spy agencies. He will be the fourth person in the position since it was created five years ago. He succeeds Dennis Blair, who was pressured to resign because of differences with the White House over the scope of his role and turf battles with the CIA director. The Senate vote came before the Senate's August recess and several days after Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said he would hold up the confirmation process until he received a report he had requested. ""This is good news because to have left this key position vacant could well have damaged our national security,"" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Clapper is a retired Air Force lieutenant general who has spent most of his career in the intelligence community. He served as the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. He is currently the Defense Department's chief intelligence officer. ""General Clapper has excellent credentials, and the support of the White House and key intelligence leaders,"" Feinstein, D-California, said in a statement released after the vote. ""He is mindful of the importance of independence from the Pentagon, he understands the DNI's responsibility to provide strategic intelligence to policymakers, and he knows that the job entails more than simple coordination."" Acting Director of National Intelligence David Gompert said in a statement after the vote that Clapper was the right person for the job. ""As we face evolving security threats and continue to build an integrated intelligence enterprise, the intelligence community and the nation are extremely fortunate to have such a distinguished leader at the helm,"" he said. During his recent confirmation hearing, Clapper said he wouldn't agree to take the job if he thought he ""was going to be a titular figurehead or hood ornament."" A number of senators had questioned whether the DNI had enough authority to get the job done. Clapper said he did not need any new authority to oversee the 16 intelligence agencies and offices. ""With all of the discussion about the lack of authority, of the perceived weakness of the office of director of national intelligence, I believe it already does have considerable authority, either explicit in the law... or implicit that can be exerted,"" Clapper said. He vowed to ""push the envelope"" to be successful in the job. The office of DNI was established by Congress in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks to help improve the coordination of the intelligence community and to correct deficiencies in information-sharing among its members. CNN's Ted Barrett and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","The vote comes before the Senate's August recess .

"(CNN) -- As the voice of opposition to Arizona's controversial immigration law gets louder, the state's reputation can expect to take a hit. Critics of the law are calling for economic boycotts of Arizona, urging corporations and organizations to refrain from holding conventions in the state. They're also pressuring Major League Baseball to take its 2011 All-Star Game elsewhere, much like the National Football League did in 1993 when Arizona refused to recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday. While Arizona can ride out the backlash in the short term, the impact could hit hard later on, said Brayden King, assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""The reputational consequences will have long-term economic consequences if it's not resolved,"" King said. Critics have said the law will lead to racial profiling. Supporters argue it will crack down on illegal immigration. Latino rights groups, others call for Arizona boycott . As originally passed, the bill would have allowed police to ask anyone for proof of legal U.S. residency based solely on an officer's suspicion. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed a bill to amend the law so that officers could check a person's status only if the person had been detained or arrested for another reason. Brewer said the changes should ease concerns about racial profiling, but opponents say the changes are not sufficient. Days after the bill was signed into law, Debbie Johnson, president and CEO of the Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association, said three conferences were canceled, including a gathering of the American Immigration Lawyers Association scheduled for fall. Arizona governor signs changes into immigration law . Now, the calls for boycotts are coming from across the country. The Boston City Council approved a resolution calling on the Massachusetts city to pull investments from Arizona. The Oakland, California, City Council voted this week to boycott Arizona businesses. Chris Coleman, mayor of St. Paul, Minnesota, banned city-funded travel to the state. Coleman also planned to write letters to the chairmen of the Republican and Democratic national committees, encouraging them not to choose Phoenix as the host city for their 2012 conventions. In Arizona, the Tucson and Flagstaff city councils voted this week to file suit against the immigration law. The city councils said they're taking action because of concerns over enforcement costs and negative effects on Arizona's tourism industry. Tucson Mayor Bob Walkup said up to 38 percent of retail sales in the city come from legal Mexican visitors. The Arizona Hotel & Lodging Association has set up a Facebook page titled ""Don't Boycott AZ Tourism,"" which urges visitors not to scapegoat the tourist industry and its workers. Supporters of the law outside of the state are mobilizing. Organizers with Voice of the People USA and Tea Party Patriots Live announced Thursday they planned to hold rallies in Phoenix and across the country the week of June 5 to counter any boycotts and show support for the immigration law. Brewer has dismissed the notion that the state's immigration law would hurt economic development, saying many businesses have long wanted tougher action. The law is slated to go into effect late this summer unless court challenges hold it up. What does the law do? In an editorial on ESPN.com, Brewer said the recent boycotts and calls for MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to move next year's All-Star game are misguided. ""Put simply, history shows that boycotts backfire and harm innocent people. Boycotts are just more politics and manipulation by out-of-state interests. As a border state, Arizona has already paid a heavy price for the federal government's failure -- hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in unreimbursed costs -- and its citizens should not be punished further,"" she wrote in the Wednesday article. But King, the Northwestern professor, said history also has shown the opposite to be true. Citing the Boston Tea Party in the 1770s and the civil rights-era boycotts in the South, King noted, ""Those did not hurt the innocent, and they had real impact on political and social change."" A majority of Americans support Arizona's law, even though most of them think it could lead to racial profiling, according to a recent national poll. A CBS/New York Times survey released Tuesday indicates that Americans overwhelmingly believe that the country's immigration laws need to be changed. A Gallup Poll released last week showed similar public attitudes: Nearly four in 10 Americans supported the law, with three in 10 opposed, and 31 percent saying they had not heard of the new law at the time, or had no opinion. While the boycotts are keeping the law in the spotlight, King predicted that even those apathetic about the issue could take a side. ""Even people who wouldn't have cared in the first place are now becoming aware of it and are starting to develop opinions about it. They may have been lukewarm or moderate in the beginning, but they are probably becoming polarized as they become more educated about the issue,"" he said, noting that Arizonans' opinion on the issue could change as well. ""[Brewer's] constituents will not be happy if Arizona loses major business revenue like a Super Bowl or an All-Star Game,"" he said. ""Even if their own pocketbook is not being affected, they're not going to want to be associated with that kind of negative press."" Brewer is rejecting a request from a top Senate Democrat to hold the immigration bill for one year to give Congress time to pass comprehensive immigration reform. In a letter dated Thursday and obtained by CNN, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, made the request to Brewer, a Republican. Schumer, the Senate Democrats' point man for immigration reform, called Arizona's concerns about illegal immigration ""legitimate security interests"" and said he appreciates that Brewer ""felt duty-bound to take action to address the security concerns in your state."" ""But I simply do not believe the remedy Arizona has enacted will succeed in resolving the problem it is designed to address,"" Schumer wrote. He called the law, ""wrong-hearted"" and ""likely unconstitutional."" He also asked Brewer to call on Arizona's two GOP senators - John McCain and Jon Kyl - to ""immediately begin discussions with me to enact"" immigration reform. On Friday, Brewer's office informed CNN of the governor's response. ""The governor is certainly grateful that Sen. Schumer has focused some attention on Arizona's border security plight,"" said Paul Senseman, Brewer's deputy chief of staff for communications. But, Senseman continued, Brewer ""is waiting for action on border security."" Attempting to highlight federal inaction on the matter, Senseman referred to a letter sent from border state governors, including Brewer, to Congressional leaders in April 2009. It called for more National Guard personnel to help local law enforcement agencies combat violence, crime and illegal immigration along the U.S.-Mexico border. ""The governor has been waiting over a year,"" Senseman told CNN in reaction to Schumer's letter. CNN's A. Pawlowski contributed to this report.","NEW: Senator asks Arizona to hold off on law until Congress acts on issue .

"(CNN) -- An Alabama man described as a jihadist ""rock star,"" two Minnesota women and a California man are among more than a dozen people now charged with aiding al Qaeda-linked rebels in Somalia. The Justice Department unsealed a slew of indictments Thursday that accused 14 people of providing ""money, personnel and services"" to Al-Shabaab, the Islamist militant group battling Somalia's U.N.-backed transitional government. Most were in Minnesota, where the group has attempted to find recruits from among Somali immigrants. FBI agents have arrested two women in Rochester, Minnesota, about 85 miles south of Minneapolis, on charges of raising money for the insurgents, the Justice Department announced. The rest named in Thursday's indictments are believed to be in Somalia, fighting with the rebels. ""While our investigations are ongoing around the country, these arrests and charges should serve as an unmistakable warning to others considering joining or supporting terrorist groups like Al-Shabaab: If you choose this route you can expect to find yourself in a U.S. jail cell or a casualty on the battlefield in Somalia,"" Attorney General Eric Holder told reporters Thursday. Two men -- Omar Shafik Hammami, 26, a former resident of Daphne, Alabama, and Jehad Serwan Mostafa, 28, a former resident of San Diego, California -- have been charged in separate cases of providing material support to Al-Shabaab. Both are U.S. citizens, and are thought to be fighting alongside the rebels in Somalia, U.S. officials said. Hammami in particular has become a ""rock star"" among jihadists, with rap-style videos that bridge American and Somali culture, said Frank Cilluffo, an analyst with the Homeland Security Policy Institute in Washington. In one such video, Hammami declares, ""Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell."" In another, he boasts that he and his comrades are waiting for the enemy ""away from our families, away from the cities, away from ice, candy bars."" ""This isn't just someone reciting dusty old texts,"" Cilluffo said. ""This is someone Americans see glimmers of themselves in."" Hammami was raised a Baptist in Alabama, but converted to Islam as a young man. His father, Shafik Hammami, said in a written statement, ""What we know of the current situation is what everyone is learning from the same news reports, nothing more."" ""Omar is my son and I love him dearly, just as a father should,"" he said. ""However, I do not, in any way, condone his current philosophy nor his actions."" Holder said Hammami is now believed to be a ranking Al-Shabaab member who has ""operational responsibilities."" Another indictment in Minnesota charged 10 men with leaving the country to join Al-Shabaab. Seven had faced previous related charges. Abdikadir Ali Abdi, 19; Abdisalan Hussein Ali, 21; Cabdulaahi Ahmed Faarax, 33; Farah Mohamed Beledi, 26; and Abdiweli Yassin Isse, 26, are charged with conspiring to provide and providing material support to Al-Shabaab and conspiring to kill, maim and injure people abroad. Faarax and Isse had been charged previously in a criminal complaint, and Abdi, Ali and Faarax are U.S. citizens, the Justice Department said. Meanwhile, Ahmed Ali Omar, 27; Khalid Mohamud Abshir, 27; Zakaria Maruf, 31; Mohamed Abdullahi Hassan, 22; and Mustafa Ali Salat, 20, are charged with conspiracies to provide material support to terrorists and foreign terrorist organizations; conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim and injure persons abroad; possessing and discharging a firearm during a crime of violence; and solicitation to commit a crime of violence. All five have been previously charged. A separate indictment charged Amina Farah Ali, 33, and Hawo Mohamed Hassan, 63, on Thursday. The Rochester women, both of whom are naturalized citizens, were charged with providing material support to terrorists by raising money for the rebels among Somali immigrants in Minnesota, other states and Canada, Holder said. ""In some cases, these funds were raised under the false pretense that they would be used to aid the poor and the needy,"" Holder said. The attorney general emphasized that innocent Muslims have been the victims of attacks by Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other terror groups and pointed out that American Muslims have been vital in helping battle ""this emerging threat"" in the United States. ""These individuals have consistently -- and correctly -- expressed deep concern about the recruitment of their youth by terrorist groups,"" he said. ""Many members of the community have taken proactive steps to stop the recruitment of their youth by terrorist groups.  Just recently, a group of prominent American Muslims joined together in a video to repudiate the tactics employed by radicalized militants to recruit young Muslims via the internet."" The announcement comes a day after federal prosecutors in Chicago, Illinois, charged a U.S. citizen with trying to provide material support to two terrorist organizations -- al Qaeda and Al-Shabaab -- and with another charge related to weapons of mass destruction, according to a criminal complaint. Shaker Masri, 26, a U.S. citizen who lives in Chicago, was arrested Tuesday after he allegedly tried to violate a law that prohibits U.S. nationals ""from using, threatening, attempting or conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction outside the United States,"" the complaint said. Minnesota is home to the country's largest population of Somali residents, according to the Minneapolis Foundation, a philanthropic community organization. Most of those Somalis came to the United States as refugees, the foundation says. The 2000 Census showed that 13 percent of Minnesota's foreign-born residents were from Africa, a higher percentage than any other state in the country. According to the Minneapolis Foundation, there were 5,000 Minnesota residents in 1990 who had been born in Africa. Ten years later, that number had grown to more than 34,000.

"TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (CNN) -- He's no Julia Child, but Honduran President Manuel Zelaya showed Tuesday he can attack a cantaloupe and U.S. government claims in a single motion. President Manuel Zelaya chews on a slice of Honduran melon to demonstrate its safety. ""It's not in our fruit,"" he said about last week's report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that some Honduran cantaloupes may be contaminated with salmonella. ""It's not true what they are saying. Logically, we believe it is an error."" Then, the 55-year-old father of four asked the viewers of CNN en Español to indulge him as he engaged in a show-and-tell demonstration. ""Permit me a second,"" he said as he stretched his left arm across the tabletop and outside the view of the camera, then pulled into view a box of fruit. ""Here I have the box of melons that we are exporting to the United States; here are the protective bags,"" he said. Zelaya lifted a cantaloupe from the box, placed it in front of him, then grabbed a knife and a fork. ""Permit me to make a demonstration,"" he said, then cut open the fruit, sliced off a chunk, put it in his mouth and chewed vigorously. ""I eat this fruit without any fear,"" he said with his mouth full. ""It's a delicious fruit. Nothing happens to me!"" Though the symptoms of salmonella infection -- nausea, vomiting, fever, diarrhea and abdominal cramps -- typically do not occur for several hours after eating tainted food, the point was made. The demonstration came three days after the FDA said it had linked 50 cases of salmonella in 16 states and nine in Canada to melons from Agropecuaria Montelibana, a grower and packer in San Lorenzo, Honduras. Though there have been no reports of fatalities, 14 people have been hospitalized in Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin, the FDA said. While the company has continued exporting to Europe and Central America and has received no reports of illness, the daily export of 45 containers of melon to the United States has halted, a company official said Monday. As a result, some 1,500 workers have been laid off, most of them single mothers, and company losses have exceeded $3 million, company officials said. The FDA alert advised U.S. grocers, food-service operators and produce processors to remove from their stock any cantaloupes from the company. The agency also recommended consumers throw away any cantaloupes determined to be from the company. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Monday, the official first day of winter, airlines were scrambling to accommodate passengers affected by the cancellation of hundreds of flights after a monster weekend winter storm blanketed a swath of the East Coast. Charlene Fisk, a filmmaker from Atlanta, Georgia, tried her best not to lose it at Hartsfield International Airport on Monday at 4:30 a.m. when she found out she wouldn't be getting home to upstate New York anytime soon. Her US Airways connecting flight had been canceled, so she was placed on another flight to Philadelphia, which was then canceled. She's going to have to fly to Chicago on Monday evening, hopefully stay the night with friends and then hop on a standby flight to Syracuse. Her family will have to drive about an hour from their home to pick her up. ""Passengers are talking about renting cars together and just driving home,"" Fisk said. US Airways is picking up the tab to fly Fisk to Chicago. And while some airlines are offering refunds, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines said the company is providing weather waivers that allow passengers to reschedule without a penalty if they were scheduled to travel before Christmas. Another strong winter system will be developing by Tuesday in the Rockies. The system will take a track through the central Plains, Midwest, and into the western Great Lakes. Winter storm and blizzard watches are already in effect for the Central Plains for Tuesday night through Thursday. Severe weather also will be possible from Dallas and Houston, Texas, to Little Rock, Arkansas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. On Monday, CNN correspondent Susan Candiotti was taking her first day of vacation when she began a chaotic journey from Newark, New Jersey. Already with boarding pass in hand, she spent nearly two hours in three different lines because agents were unsure which line passengers should be in, she said. Another agent eventually told Candiotti and others to go directly to TSA security where they got in another line. A different Continental agent then lead them to an upper floor to check their bags. Then, they were sent back to security and she made it to her  8:45 a.m. flight gate with 10 minutes to spare only to learn that the flight had been postponed until around 11 a.m., when it eventually took off for Columbus, Ohio. Her final destination is northern Kentucky which she'll eventually reach once her sister picks her up in Ohio and drives her home. ""My experience today was nothing compared to many people we interviewed (on Sunday) who stood in line for three or four hours,"" Candiotti said. ""One student trying to get to Denver had to spend two sleepless nights at the airport. So, my delay pales by comparison."" Washington's Dulles and Reagan National airports saw snowfall of 18 inches and 16.4 inches respectively on Sunday, the highest one-day totals ever for December. Alison Young posted on her Facebook page that she's glad her brother finally made it to Omaha, Nebraska. He arrived at 3 a.m. central time on Monday. He began his journey at 7 a.m. Sunday at Reagan National, had to scramble to find a flight out of Dulles, went through Denver and then made it home. ""Can't wait to attempt my own trek home Tuesday,"" Young joked. American Airlines said it would add extra flights, use bigger planes where possible and reflow passengers to other flights. Passengers who were affected can switch flights with no change fees through Thursday, said Charley Wilson, airline spokesman. Continental Airlines said though flights are extremely full because of the Christmas season, staffers are working on a ""case-by-case basis"" to ensure passengers get home for the holidays. Passengers can also get a refund or change their flights for free at Continental's Web site or through the 800 number, said spokeswoman Mary Clark. Areas from the Mid-Atlantic through the Northeast set snowfall records this weekend. Record snow blanketed some areas Sunday, including 23 inches in Bethesda, Maryland, and 24 inches in Medford, New Jersey. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, received 23.2 inches -- its second-highest snowfall ever in a single event. Two people were killed in weather-related crashes, the Virginia State Police said Sunday, and ""there are two additional deaths that are likely related to the winter storm."" The storm, known as a nor'easter, blanketed the mid-Atlantic region and the heavily populated Interstate 95 corridor. Meanwhile, western North Carolina residents were digging out from the powerful storm. In Washington, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty said the storm is ""perhaps the biggest we've seen in several years."" ""We are going to throw everything we have at it to keep the District open for business on this busy pre-holiday weekend,"" Fenty said when he announced the snow emergency. But, he also urged residents to stay put in their homes. ""We urge everyone if you don't have to go anywhere, wait. We should have a lot of streets ready to go by rush hour Monday. And, hopefully, all of it done between Monday and Wednesday."" Nine people were taken to a hospital after a bus and a city snow plow collided, a D.C. fire official said. The injuries were not considered serious.","Monster weekend winter storm blankets a swath of the East Coast .

"(Mental Floss) -- When Americans sit down with their families for Thanksgiving dinner, most of us will probably gorge ourselves on the same traditional Thanksgiving menu, with turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and pumpkin pie taking up the most real estate on our plates. Pumpkin pie didn't make an appearance at the First Thanksgiving, though pumpkins were probably served. How did these dishes become the national ""what you eat on Thanksgiving"" options, though? Are they holdovers from the First Thanksgiving, or did they gradually sneak in? The Pilgrims may not have had turkey . Turkey may not have been on the menu at the 1621 celebration by the Pilgrims of Plymouth that is widely considered the First Thanksgiving (though fans of Virginia's Berkeley Plantation might quibble with the ""First"" part). There were definitely wild turkeys in the Plymouth area, as colonist William Bradford noted in his journal. However, the best existing account of the Pilgrims' harvest feast comes from colonist Edward Winslow, author of ""Mourt's Relation: A Journal of the Pilgrims at Plymouth."" Winslow's first-hand account of the First Thanksgiving included no explicit mention of turkey. He does, however, mention the Pilgrims gathering ""wild fowl"" for the meal, although that could just as likely have meant ducks or geese. So why do we chow down on turkey, then? It helps to know a bit about the history of Thanksgiving. While the idea of giving thanks and celebrating the harvest was popular in certain parts of the country, it was by no means an annual national holiday. Presidents would occasionally declare a Thanksgiving Day celebration, but the holiday hadn't completely caught on nationwide. Many of these early celebrations included turkey; Alexander Hamilton once remarked that, ""No citizen of the U.S. shall refrain from turkey on Thanksgiving Day."" Mental Floss: Manly ways to prepare turkey . When Bradford's journals were reprinted in 1856 after being lost for a century, they found a receptive audience with advocates who wanted Thanksgiving turned into a national holiday. Since Bradford wrote of how the colonists had hunted wild turkeys during the autumn of 1621 and since turkey is a uniquely American (and scrumptious) bird, it gained traction as the Thanksgiving meal of choice for Americans after Lincoln declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863. Moreover, there were pragmatic reasons for eating turkey rather than, say, chicken at a feast like Thanksgiving. The birds are large enough that they can feed a table full of hungry family members, and unlike chickens or cows, they didn't serve much utilitarian purpose like laying eggs or making milk. Unlike pork, turkey wasn't so common that it didn't seem like a suitable choice for a special occasion, either. An interesting 2007 piece in Slate discussed these reasons for turkey's prominence, but also made another intriguing point. The publication of ""A Christmas Carol"" in 1843 may have helped force along the turkey's cause as a holiday delicacy when Scrooge magnanimously sends the Cratchit family a Christmas turkey. Mental Floss: 10 things that deflated the Macy's parade . There was no cranberry sauce, either . While the cranberries the Pilgrims needed were probably easy to come by, making cranberry sauce requires sugar. Sugar was a rare luxury at the time of First Thanksgiving, so while revelers may have eaten cranberries it's unlikely that the feast featured the tasty sauce. What's more, it's not even entirely clear that cranberry sauce had been invented yet. It's not until 1663 that visitors to the area started commenting on a sweet sauce made of boiled cranberries that accompanied meat. There's the same problem with potatoes. Neither sweet potatoes nor white potatoes were available to the colonists in 1621, so the Pilgrims definitely didn't feast on everyone's favorite tubers. But they had plenty of venison . Winslow mentions in his writings that the governor sent out a party of four men to do some fowling for the feast, but the Pilgrims and Wampanoag also enjoyed five deer as part of their feasting. The meat supposedly arrived at the celebration as a gift from the Wampanoag king Massasoit. On top of the venison, other meats probably included lots of fish and shellfish, which were staples of the Pilgrims' diets. So if you want to wolf down a lobster or some oysters in lieu of turkey on Thursday, nobody can fault you for being historically inaccurate. And pumpkin pie didn't cap things off . It may be the flagship dessert at modern Thanksgiving dinners, but pumpkin pie didn't make an appearance at the First Thanksgiving. The Pilgrims probably lacked the butter and flour needed to make a pie crust, and it's not clear that they even had an oven in which they could have baked a pumpkin pie. That doesn't mean pumpkins weren't available for the meal, though; they were probably served after being baked in the coals of a fire or stewed. Pumpkin pie became a popular dish on 17th-century American tables, though, and it might have shown up for Thanksgiving as early as the second celebration of the holiday in 1623.

"(CNN) -- In 2005, Haitian-born and Brooklyn-raised musician Wyclef Jean created the grassroots charity organization Yéle Haiti. The former member of the Grammy-winning group The Fugees coined the term Yéle in a song and imbued it with the meaning, ""a cry for freedom."" The purpose of the organization has been, from its inception, to restore pride and hope to the Haitian people through projects that will allow citizens to ultimately help themselves, such as the creation of scholarships, support for the arts, food distribution and emergency relief. ""I see old women with large bags of rice on their heads and men on street corners selling sugarcane and mangos, all just trying to survive with a strong sense of pride,"" Jean said in a statement on the group's Web site. ""Walking past a church in my village, I hear the congregation singing an appeal to God to hear their cries and grant deliverance to Haiti. Through experiences like this, I sense where my mother and my father got their strength. Now the whole country needs to reach deep into the spirit and strength that is part of our heritage. ""The objective of Yéle Haiti is to restore pride and a reason to hope, and for the whole country to regain the deep spirit and force that is part of our heritage."" Within two hours of Tuesday's 7.0 magnitude  earthquake, Jean and Yéle mobilized on social networking sites to raise funds for disaster relief. Jean is encouraging people to text ""Yéle"" to 501501, which will automatically donate $5 to the Yéle Haiti Earthquake Fund, or to visit http://www.yele.org/. ""I cannot stress enough what a human disaster this is, and idle hands will only make this tragedy worse. The over 2 million people in Port-au-Prince tonight face catastrophe alone. We must act now,"" Jean said in a statement Tuesday night. In its first year, the organization, which Jean created in collaboration with his cousin, music producer Jerry Duplessis, provided scholarships to more than 3,600 children. In 2007 Jean testified before the House of Representatives urging the U.S. government to earmark more funds for education in Haiti and to encourage the U.S. private sector to enter the Haitian market in order to create jobs for the Haitian people. Jean also stressed the important of the arts in Haiti. The group has used local musicians to deliver food into slum neighborhoods where no other organizations are able to go. They have held annual hip-hop competitions where underprivileged youth are invited to write raps on social issues. A project called Yéle Cinema shows free Creole-dubbed films in slum neighborhoods, interspersed with short messages about social and development themes. Jean hasn't been shy about using his celebrity status to advance the aims of Yéle Haiti. Following the devastation of several consecutive tropical storms in September 2008, Jean brought actor Matt Damon to the island. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have traveled with Jean several times, most notably in 2006 when Jolie was pregnant with their first child. Last March the musician brought United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and President Clinton to tour the region. ""I was honored to show my support when they asked me to join them on this important humanitarian trip which also gave them the opportunity to experience the beauty underneath the devastation my country and its people have had to face. It's crucial for me to do all I can to raise awareness and help Haiti get through this tough time,"" Jean said in a statement. While in Haiti the group visited a Yéle sponsored feeding program and met with President René Preval and senior government officials. In May 2008, Jean and Yéle Haiti partnered with the United Nations World Food Program and the Pan American Development Foundation to create ""Together for Haiti,"" a program that specifically provides resources for targeted food distribution, employment creation, micro-enterprise grants and farm training. ""The food crisis we've seen develop in Haiti over the last 60 days is more serious than any emergency I've seen over my years of work with the country,"" Jean said in a statement. ""Even where food is available, the citizens of Haiti do not have the resources to buy it -- and we must take immediate action. I'm confident that through the commitment of these three powerful organizations, 'Together for Haiti' will rise to meet this urgent challenge and provide direct relief to the people.""","Haitian born musician Wyclef Jean founded charity organization Yéle Haiti in 2005 .

"(CNN)  -- The U.S. Coast Guard closed 98 miles of the Mississippi River from New Orleans, Louisiana, southward after a fuel barge and a tanker collided early Wednesday, spilling more than 400,000 gallons of fuel oil. Coast Guard personnel try to contain a fuel oil spill in the Mississippi River in New Orleans on Wednesday. The closure -- on what is a major shipping route between the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico -- could last days, and the cleanup could take weeks, said Capt. Lincoln Stroh, the Coast Guard chief in New Orleans. The collision between the Liberian-flagged chemical tanker Tintomara and the barge pushed by the tug Mel Oliver happened about 1:30 a.m.  Wednesday, splitting the barge nearly in half and dumping more than 419,000 gallons of oil into the river, the Coast Guard said. The accident happened just north of the massive bridges connecting downtown New Orleans to the west bank of the Mississippi, the Coast Guard said. The tanker was undamaged.  See a map of where the spill happened » . The Coast Guard said Wednesday evening that the tug had no properly licensed crew on board at the time of the collision. No injuries were reported, and the National Transportation Safety Board said it has dispatched investigators to look into the accident. The accident left a sheen of oil over much of the river and its banks. Booms were deployed to contain the oil, and skimmers are being used to suck it off the surface, said Petty Officer Thomas Blue, a Coast Guard spokesman.  Watch scenes from the oil spill » . The spill is much smaller than the ones that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the Coast Guard estimated that more than 7 million gallons of oil were dumped into the Mississippi and nearby waterways. But Wilma Subra, a chemist who advises the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, said the oil could affect wildlife and work its way up the food chain into residents, many of whom fish for subsistence. ""This is a spill that occurred in a very urban area, and it can impact a very large number of people,"" she said. The oil, widely used as marine fuel, is heavier than diesel but lighter than crude, and it is likely to stick to rocks, trees and wildlife, Stroh said. ""Some will evaporate with sunlight, but there will be residuals in the waterway which need to be cleaned up,"" he said. However, State Department of Environmental Quality officials said the oil is so thick that it could sink, which would complicate the cleanup, the Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported. The Mississippi is the primary source of drinking water for the region, and workers have deployed booms around intakes for local water systems, said Paul Book, the head of the cleanup effort for barge owners American Commercial Lines. Water intakes in the oil spill area -- those for Algiers, Gretna, St. Bernard Parish and Plaquemines Parish -- were closed to prevent contamination, though residents there still could get water through their taps because of reserve supplies, the Times-Picayune reported. A swifter-than-normal current quickly drew the slick downstream. The Coast Guard initially closed 29 miles of the river but expanded that to 98 miles by Wednesday evening, the service said. The heavy, sticky oil left a ""real strong"" smell hanging over much of downtown New Orleans, said Carl Bauder, who runs a barber shop near the foot of Canal Street. The Coast Guard's closure of traffic shut down commuter ferries across the river, said Bauder, who lives in the West Bank neighborhood of Algiers. ""[The oil has] done a lot of damage to our Moonwalk area and down by the aquarium,"" he said. Department of Environmental Quality officials said they didn't believe breathing the air near the river would be a problem, adding that emergency personnel were checking the air with portable monitors and hadn't found dangerous hydrocarbon levels, the Times-Picayune reported. New Orleans is among the largest U.S. ports. More than 30 ships were queued early Wednesday afternoon, waiting to pass through the closed zone, Coast Guard spokeswoman Jaclyn Young said. Ships approaching the mouth of the river from the Gulf of Mexico were being asked to stay out, Stroh said.","Ninety-eight miles of Mississippi River closed from New Orleans southward .

"(CNET) -- Coulomb Technologies on Wednesday said it will build 4,600 electric vehicle charging stations in nine regions of the U.S., funded by $37 million in grants. More than half of the charging stations in the program called ChargePoint America will go in public locations, such as overnight parking spaces, offices, or retail locations. About 2,000 going into people's homes as part of the purchase of an electric vehicle. The goal of the charging network and others like it is to make electric vehicles more accessible to consumers, as these cars come to market in the coming months, said Richard Lowenthal, the CEO of Campbell, California-based Coulomb Technologies during a press conference. The program differs from other electric vehicle charging networks in that Coulomb is working with Ford Motor, General Motors, and Smart USA on the roll out, Lowenthal said. Ford will release an electric Transit Connect utility van and electric Ford Focus sedan in 2011, GM plans to release the Volt by November, and the electric Smart fortwo will begin pilot testing in the U.S. by 2011. The stations themselves will be equipped with 220-volt service at either 16 or 30 amps, which enables faster charging than regular home electrical service. Lowenthal said that an electric car with a large battery could charge from empty in under four hours. Drivers will be able to find available charging stations using either an iPhone or Blackberry application, which can also send alerts if a car battery is running low or if a connected car is unplugged. The system includes software for station owners to set billing rates. Regions are considering cheaper off-peak rates to encourage drivers to charge overnight. Utilities can see available energy electric vehicles or run demand-response programs to slow charging rates during peak times if needed. ""Our stations are unique in that they are all networked. That allows them to support a bunch of software applications which are important to different constituents,"" Lownenthal said, adding that installation will begin immediately and continue for 18 months. The nine regions are: the Bellevue and Redmond, Washington area; Sacramento, Calif.; the San Francisco and San Jose, California. region; Los Angeles; Orlando, Florida; Washington D.C.; New York City; Austin, Texas; and Detroit, Michigan. Of the total in grants, $15 million will come from the Department of Energy as part of the stimulus act and another $22 million will come from other sources, Lowenthal said. As part of project, Coulomb will gather data on driver usage patterns and report it to the Department of Energy until October 2013. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- Robert Enke, the goalkeeper for the German national football team who killed himself on Tuesday, was suffering from depression, his widow has revealed. Valentin Markser, a doctor who treated Enke, said the goalkeeper first sought treatment in 2003, when he lost his starting place at Barcelona and developed anxieties and fear of failure. The couple's biological daughter died three years ago from a heart problem when she was aged just two. Dr. Charles L. Raison, Clinical Director of the Mind-Body Program at Emory University School of Medicine, in Atlanta, answers some key questions about some of the issues associated with depression. What are the signs or symptoms that someone is suffering from this illness? The classic symptom of depression is feeling emotionally down or blue, but when humans start feeling this way a whole bunch of other symptoms usually tag along. When people feel emotionally depressed they tend to lose interest in the world around them and their ability to experience pleasure withers. They often become very hopeless and feel overwhelmed by responsibilities that would normally be no problem for them. They have trouble thinking and concentrating, and when depression is severe they can feel like they are losing their minds. Depressed people often feel very badly about themselves. They can be haunted by guilt and consumed by negative thoughts that run over and over again like a bad movie. This level of psychic misery begins to make death seem like a form of relief, so it is not surprising that most depressed people spend at least some of their time thinking about suicide. Depressed people almost always have changes in their sleep and appetite. In addition, people with depression typically experience tremendous fatigue and are often plagued by aches and pains in their bodies for which no bodily cause can be found. What causes depression? Depression is caused by an interaction between genes and environment. Some people carry genes that make them so prone to depression that almost any degree of hardship will bump them into depression. At the other extreme there are environments that are so terrible that all but the most resistant people will develop depression. Psychological stress and medical illness are the two royal roads to depression. Almost all episodes of depression are set off by one or the other of these factors, although the more often a person is depressed the less adversity is needed to set off a new episode. That is one type of answer to the question of what causes depression. Scientists are discovering a different kind of answer which has to do with the types of abnormalities in the brain and body that are characteristic of people with depression. We might say that depression is caused by hyperactivity of body-brain danger pathways and not enough activity in brain areas that help us get a grip on our emotions. In this way depression is very much a physical illness. What can be done to treat it? The short answer is ""many things"". In general, treatments boil down to either pharmacological or behavioral. In the pharmacological category are numerous antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs, such as lithium and atypical antipsychotics. In the behavioral realm are a number of psychotherapeutic techniques, ranging from psychoanalysis to behavioral therapy. Overall, medications and therapy appear about equal in efficacy. Recent data suggest that therapy might have a longer-lasting protective effect than medications once treatment has stopped. In addition to medications and therapy, recent studies suggest that vigorous exercise is also an effective treatment for depression. Have attitudes within the medical profession changed? No one in medicine -- in my experience -- questions either the reality or validity of major depression. In fact, far from disputing the importance of depression, what I usually find is a huge hunger on the part of the medical profession to learn more so they can better help their patients. The World Health Organization now places depression as the fourth most disabling medical condition worldwide and estimates it will rise to number two by 2020. The days when doctors looked askance at depression as a clinical entity are long gone.","Dr. Charles Raison tells CNN about the symptoms and causes of depression .

"JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (CNN) -- South African police and military units raided three hostels Thursday in a clampdown on xenophobic attacks that have left more than 40 dead, authorities said. Twenty-eight people were arrested in the ""extremely successful"" first joint operation, according to a statement from the South African police and South African National Defence Force. The statement said 150 kilograms (330.6 pounds) of marijuana was seized along with firearms, ammunition and suspected stolen property. Two of the hostels raided were in Jeppe and the third was in Cleveland, all in the Johannesburg area. South African President Thabo Mbeki approved the deployment of the army Wednesday to help stop the attacks, which have drawn condemnation from South African officials and other African leaders. Police said 42 people have been killed in the violence, which began last week in Johannesburg's Alexandra Township and has been concentrated in the city's poorest areas. Some 28,000 people have been displaced by the violence, Hangwani Malaudzi, a spokesman for the Ministry of Safety and Security said. And more than 400 have been arrested for crimes ranging from murder, to causing a public disturbance, he said. The country has also seen a disturbing throwback to the 1980s apartheid-era lynching tactic of ""necklacing,"" which was widely used in the townships at the time. Used on suspected informants, the ""necklace"" is a car tire, filled with petrol, put around the person's neck and set alight. The victims are mainly immigrants and refugees from other parts of Africa, including Zimbabwe, where a devastated economy has sent at least two million people across the border in search of a better life. Some say the attacks stem from a long-standing feeling among locals that the number of immigrants in South Africa results in shortages of jobs and essential needs. Inadequate housing, a lack of running water and electricity, the rising prices of food, and escalating crime -- nearly 20,000 people were slain in South Africa last year -- add to the resentment.  Watch analysis of reasons behind xenophobic attacks » . South Africa's army has been patrolling riot-hit townships to restore calm as the country counts the cost of the xenophobic attacks. Brigadier General Kwena Mangope of the South African Department of Defense said troops were assisting the South African Police Service, the national police. ""We are in a supporting role,"" Mangope said. ""We are not taking over the operation."" He said the army was providing troops and equipment, such as helicopters and tents. The deployment of the military and the continued operations of the police service helped quell the violence, Malaudzi said. Community groups, churches, and communication between police and affected communities also helped the situation, he said. ""The message is going out there to say we condemn this kind of action, and (to) those that are involved in instigating this violence, the law is going to come down on them very, very seriously,"" Malaudzi said. According to South Africa's latest census, the country has about 45 million people. The South African Department of Human Affairs estimates that more than 4 million people reside in South Africa illegally, but that figure is based on a 10-year-old study and some feel the number of immigrants in South Africa is much higher. Some say that millions have recently fled to South Africa from Zimbabwe because of violence there since the county's stalled election. A presidential run-off between long-time leader President Robert Mugabe and his opposition challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, is scheduled for June 27 in Zimbabwe -- three months after the initial vote. Zimbabwe also is in the midst of an economic collapse, with nearly 80 percent unemployment.","Army patrol street to restore calm after violence targeting foreigners flared .

"Orlando, Florida (CNN) -- Golfer Tiger Woods will be issued a careless driving citation for the crash outside his home last week, but he will not face criminal charges, the Florida Highway Patrol said Tuesday. Woods, 33, struck a fire hydrant and a tree with his 2009 Cadillac SUV in his luxury neighborhood near Windermere, Florida, early Friday, police said. Upon conviction of careless driving, a moving violation, Woods faces a $164 fine and four points on his license, Maj. Cindy Williams of the Florida Highway Patrol said. ""Mr. Woods' status in no way impacted our investigation or conclusion,"" Williams said. ""The investigation has determined that Mr. Woods is at fault in the crash."" Woods satisfied the requirements of Florida law regarding motor vehicle accidents by providing his driver's license, registration and proof of insurance to authorities, Williams said. ""With the issuance of this citation, the Florida Highway Patrol has completed its investigation into this matter,"" she said. There was insufficient evidence to request a subpoena for medical information in the case, said Sgt. Kim Montes, an FHP spokeswoman. There were no claims of domestic abuse. Authorities have said they don't have details on why Woods was driving away from his home around 2:25 a.m. Friday. State troopers three times have asked to question him about the accident, but he has declined, the highway patrol has said. What do you think about the Tiger Woods saga? Police have said the accident was not alcohol-related. Woods canceled plans to attend the Chevron World Challenge in Southern California ""due to injuries sustained in a one-car accident last week,"" according to a statement Monday from the golfer. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon on his Web site, Woods offered no details of his accident except to say he had cuts and bruises and was ""pretty sore."" ""This situation is my fault, and it's obviously embarrassing to my family and me,"" he said. ""I'm human and I'm not perfect. I will certainly make sure this doesn't happen again."" Woods is a four-time winner of the tournament. A knee injury kept him from competing last year. ""I am extremely disappointed that I will not be at my tournament this week,"" Woods said. ""I am certain it will be an outstanding event, and I'm very sorry that I can't be there."" People holding tickets for the event -- which runs Wednesday through Sunday -- can apply for full refunds starting next Monday, tournament officials said. Ticketholders who do not ask for refunds can get a 20 percent discount when buying 2010 tickets, they said. The annual charity event, which Woods hosts in Thousand Oaks, California, is a major fundraiser for the Tiger Woods Foundation, but it was not immediately clear how much money it would lose because of Woods' cancellation. The incident has ended Woods' golf appearances until next season, according to a statement posted on his Web site. The PGA Tour has ended for the year, but the first tournament of the 2010 season is just five weeks away. At least one other charity event is scheduled, but it is not clear if Woods had planned to attend. Woods has won the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament four times each, as well as three U.S. Open Championships. Last week, a story in the National Enquirer alleged that Woods has been seeing a New York nightclub hostess. The woman denied having an affair with Woods when contacted by The Associated Press. The woman in question has retained Los Angeles lawyer Gloria Allred, who is know for handling high-profile cases, to represent her. Allred told CNN there were no immediate plans for a news conference, although she may soon release a written statement. Windermere's mayor called on the news media to back away from the story, saying, ""Our residents would like to put this behind us."" ""It's time to move on,"" Mayor Gary Bruhn said. ""Let the man recover if he is injured, and let him get back to his life, and let our residents get back to normalcy."" Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, said the Florida Highway Patrol informed them that further discussion with them is both voluntary and optional. ""Although Tiger realizes that there is a great deal of public curiosity, it has been conveyed to FHP that he simply has nothing more to add and wishes to protect the privacy of his family."" Under Florida law, Woods is not obligated to give a statement about the crash. His attorney, Mark NeJame, handed over the required documents to the troopers Sunday at Woods' home, Montes said. Investigators had sought possible surveillance tapes of the accident from neighbors, but none were found, she said. In his statement, Woods praised his wife, Elin Nordegren, who he said ""acted courageously when she saw I was hurt and in trouble."" Nordegren told police she used a golf club to break out the rear window of the vehicle, and then pulled Woods from the SUV after she heard the accident from inside their home. But Woods said, ""This is a private matter, and I want to keep it that way."" And, he added, ""The only person responsible for the accident is me."" Woods and his wife have two children, a 2-year-old and a baby born in February. CNN's Susan Candiotti, Alan Duke, Ross Levitt and Marc Balinsky contributed to this report.","NEW: Tiger Woods faces $164 fine, four points on his license, Florida Highway Patrol says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- One of the women who tried to assassinate President Ford 32 years ago was released on parole Monday from a federal prison in California, according to a Bureau of Prisons spokesman. Sara Jane Moore, 77, was released in the morning from the federal women's prison in Dublin, outside San Francisco, according to Mike Truman of the Bureau of Prisons. There was no immediate comment from the prison facility, where Moore had been Inmate No. 04851180. Officials said she had a recent parole hearing, but they did not know what prompted her release. Nor was it clear what her plans are or where she is headed. The former nurse and mother of five had been trying for 20 years to gain her freedom. Moore was arrested in September 22, 1975, outside the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco after firing a single shot at  Ford. A bystander had grabbed Moore's arms just before she fired a .38 caliber revolver and was credited with probably saving the president's life. The bullet missed Ford's head by inches. Seventeen days earlier Ford survived another attempt on his life by Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, a follower of Charles Manson, in Sacramento, California. Moore pleaded guilty to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison. At the time she had been married and divorced seven times. In recent interviews Moore said she regretted her actions, which she said were motivated by radical revolutionary politics. As an inmate she worked as an accountant in the prison drapery factory.

Bush signed July 26, 1990, is credited with smashing barriers and creating opportunities for the disabled in a nation where more than 3 million people 15 and older use wheelchairs. It prohibits discrimination against disabled people, guaranteeing them equal opportunity in employment, transportation, government services and other areas. Although some critics say the act can be burdensome, costly and an overextension of the government's authority over the private sector, others say it could be stronger. The executive order signed by Obama calls for strategic planning, mandatory training and other steps to increase federal hiring of people with disabilities. In addition, Obama said, the Department of Justice was publishing rules to prohibit disability-based discrimination by state and local governments as well as private businesses. He called the 1990 law ""one of the most comprehensive civil rights bills in the history of this country"" and cited examples of people who faced discrimination for their disabilities or overcame them. ""When told you can't, you responded with that age-old American creed, 'yes, we can,' "" Obama said; applause and cheers greeted his 2008 campaign theme. The outdoor commemoration featured a presentation in sign language by actress Marlee Matlin, who starred in the film ""Children of a Lesser God,"" and musical performances by Nathaniel Anthony Ayers, the subject of the film ""The Soloist,"" and Patti LaBelle. Also Monday, Democratic Rep. James Langevin of Rhode Island, who is a quadriplegic, became the first person in a wheelchair to preside over the House of Representatives. Langevin, who was paralyzed as a teenager, credits the community support he received after his injury with inspiring him to go into public service.","President Obama celebrates the Americans with Disabilities Act .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- French police are searching the home of the daughter of L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt, a spokeswoman from the prosecutor's office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre told CNN Wednesday. Bettencourt's daughter, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, went to court last month accusing a photographer of bilking her mother out of a billion euros. Bettencourt, who is France's richest woman, allegedly gave the money to the photographer, but her daughter says she is not mentally competent to handle her own affairs. At the same time, police are investigating claims that Bettencourt's adviser gave envelopes of cash to French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Labor Minister Eric Woerth.Police questioned Liliane Bettencourt on Monday. It was unclear whether the search at her daughter's home and the questioning of Liliane Bettencourt were related, or to what case the search was tied. Woerth and Sarkozy have both denied the allegations, which resulted from secret recordings that surfaced last month. The recordings, allegedly made by Bettencourt's butler, also refer to a bank account in Switzerland containing 80 million euros ($98.3 million), which had not been reported on Bettencourt's taxes. Woerth will be questioned by police at some point, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office said last week. No date for that has been set. Woerth's wife, Florence, was questioned last week, the spokeswoman said. The secret recordings published last month revealed that Florence Woerth was, until late June, the deputy to Bettencourt's financial adviser, Patrice de Maistre. Bettencourt's former bookkeeper, Claire Thibout, elaborated on the allegations in an interview this month with a French investigative website. She said she prepared envelopes of cash that were to be given to Sarkozy and Woerth, who previously worked in the Budget Ministry and was in charge of reforms to France's retirement system. Thibout's lawyer told French news agency Agence France-Presse this month that de Maistre once asked his client for 150,000 euros ($188,800) and said he would give it ""discreetly"" to Woerth at a dinner. Thibout testified before a judge about the allegations earlier in July. The French newspaper Le Monde published her testimony, in which she repeated her allegations against de Maistre and said she regularly withdrew large sums of money at his request. Among other claims is that Sarkozy's 2007 presidential campaign received money from Bettencourt in excess of campaign finance limits.","Police are searching the home of Liliane Bettencourt's daughter .

"(Mental Floss) -- President Barack Obama turns 48 on Tuesday. While the first family encourages you to send contributions to your favorite charity in lieu of the White House, if you insist on doing some last-minute birthday shopping for 44, you might consider a pair of jeans or a case of Bud Light. For some historical precedent, here's a look back at some of the more interesting presidential gifts. Future president Barack Obama and his family blow out the candles on his birthday cake in 2004. George W. Bush: Raw lamb . President Bush and his family received about 1,000 gifts per month during his two terms in office. Bush's haul included an iPod from U2 lead singer, Bono, ""The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook"" and vocabulary-building game from the Sultan of Brunei, and an electric harp with a speakerphone from Vietnam. The most unusual gift Bush received may have been the 300 pounds of raw lamb meat from the president of Argentina in 2003. The lamb, like all gifts from overseas, was accepted by the Office of the President on behalf of the nation, and passed along to the General Services Administration. Most non-perishable gifts of state end up in presidential libraries or the National Archives. Bill Clinton: Portraits -- on a carpet . We'll say this for President Heydar Aliyev's gift to President Clinton: It was unique. The president of Azerbaijan wanted his gift to be representative of Azerbaijani craftsmanship, so he called upon Kamil Aliyev, a renowned carpet portrait artist. Kamil Aliyev's design featured the first couple inside a heart-shaped medallion, the first double portrait he ever attempted. ""I wanted to convey their lives as one beating heart,"" he said. While Aliyev designed the carpet and dyed the yarn, 12 young women were employed to help complete the portrait in 10 weeks. Heydar Aliyev presented the carpet to the Clintons in August 1997. George H.W. Bush: Komodo dragon . In 1990, the president of Indonesia presented a Komodo dragon to President Bush. Perhaps worried that the venomous, flesh-eating lizard wouldn't play nice with Millie, the first dog, Bush donated the dragon, named Naga, to the Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. Naga, who sired 32 offspring, died of an abdominal infection at the age of 24 in 2007. During his stay in Cincinnati, Naga was a star attraction, drawing about one million visits each year. Mental Floss: The bizarre history of White House pets . Ronald Reagan: Embroidered saddle . President Reagan, who was gifted 372 belt buckles while in office, also received enough tacking equipment during his time in Washington to outfit an entire stable. Jimmy Carter: Metamorphic portrait . Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo commissioned Octavio Ocampo to paint a portrait of President Carter in Ocampo's trademark metamorphic style, which juxtaposes various images within a larger image to create an optical illusion. Carter's image in the portrait is created out of national symbols, including buildings, flags, sailing ships, and truck convoys. Portillo presented the portrait to Carter in 1979. Richard Nixon: Edible portraits . A Pakistani man's gift to President Nixon required an unusual accessory to fully appreciate. S. Nabi Ahmed Rizvi provided a magnifying glass inside a plush blue velvet box, along with two snapshots of himself and two grains of rice. One grain of rice featured a portrait of Nixon as president; the other featured a portrait of a young Nixon in the Navy. The gift was displayed as part of the National Portrait Gallery's ""To the President: Folk Portraits by the People"" exhibit. John F. Kennedy: Carved peach pit . What better way to show your president you admire him than by carving his likeness into a peach pit? R.J. McErlean's remarkable ode to JFK features a portrait of Kennedy and the inscription ""President John F. Kennedy of the United States."" An eagle on a shield is carved on the left side of the pit, above a depiction of Saint Christopher. Harry S. Truman: Bowling alley . A two-lane bowling alley was installed in the White House in 1947 as a birthday gift to President Truman. No matter that he hadn't bowled since he was 19, Truman knocked down seven pins on the first roll at the alley, which was paid for by donors from Truman's home state of Missouri and moved to the Old Executive Office Building in 1955. Truman didn't use the alley much himself - he was more of a poker player -- but the addition was a big hit with Truman's staff, some of whom formed a bowling league. Mental Floss: The White House lanes and other famous bowling alleys . Franklin D. Roosevelt: A giant cake . The birthday cake presented to FDR on the occasion of his 59th birthday was 5 feet high and weighed 300 pounds. The cake was a gift of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America. Along with the cake, the union donated $500 to FDR's ""Fight Infantile-Paralysis"" campaign. Rutherford B. Hayes: Carved lemon . When life gives you lemons, make pigs. A lemon carved to look like a pig was presented to President Hayes and later featured in an exhibit at the Herbert Hoover presidential library titled, ""Weird and Wonderful: Gifts Fit For a President."" Museum director Richard N. Smith said at the time, ""It looks a little like you'd expect a 110-year-old lemon to look."" While she may or may not have been the inspiration for the bizarre gift, Hayes' wife, Lucy, was nicknamed ""Lemonade Lucy"" because she banned alcoholic beverages at state functions. Abraham Lincoln: Clothes . While he donated most of the wine and liquor he received to military hospitals, President Lincoln made good use of many of the other gifts showered upon him throughout his presidency. He was inaugurated in a suit donated by Titsworth and Brothers of Chicago, and, according to Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer, is reported to have told his wife, ""There is one thing to come out of this scrape anyhow. We are going to have some new clothes!"" Thomas Jefferson: Cheese . One of the earliest recorded gifts of state was the mammoth cheese presented to President Jefferson by the Republican Baptists in Cheshire, Massachusetts, in 1802. To celebrate Jefferson's election, town elder John Leland inspired his Baptist congregation to manufacture a 1,235-pound cheese to give to the president. When it was finished, the cheese was filled with milk from the town's cows, save for those owned by the hated Federalists. The cheese was inscribed with the phrase ""Rebellion to tyrants is obedience to God"" and presented to Jefferson after a month-long journey to Washington on New Year's Day 1802. Jefferson, who had a policy not to accept free gifts, insisted that he pay $200 for the cheese. Mental Floss: The maggot cheese of the Mediterranean . George Washington: A federal holiday . In 1880, Congress created ""Washington's Birthday,"" the first federal holiday to honor an American-born citizen. The holiday was celebrated on February 22 until 1968, when Congress moved it from its fixed day to the third Monday in February as part of the Uniform Monday Holidays Act.

"(CNN) -- The Court of Amsterdam on Friday ordered giant oil-trading company Trafigura to pay a fine of 1 million euros ($1.3 million) for illegally dumping chemical waste in Ivory Coast in 2006. An employee of Trafigura and the captain of the ship that dumped the waste also were convicted, and the employee was fined 25,000 euros ($32,200), the court said. The United Nations says the dumping killed 15 people and sickened about 100,000 others. The fine was issued by a Dutch court because the ship carrying the waste belonging to Trafigura departed from the Port of Amsterdam. A multimillion-dollar settlement was reached in September last year between Trafigura and the law firm representing people who claimed they had become sick from the toxic waste. Despite the settlement, Trafigura denies any responsibility for the actions of the contractor that dumped the waste. It called the court's ruling Friday ""incorrect."" ""The court has decided that different technical legislation is applicable than that claimed by Trafigura in its defense,"" the company said. It promised to study the court's findings ""carefully"" with a view to appeal. The convicted Trafigura employee, whom the company named as Naeem Ahmed, ""did nothing wrong,"" it said, adding it will provide him with legal assistance. Amnesty International immediately welcomed the fine and said it is the first time the company has been held criminally accountable for its involvement in the waste dumping. ""This judgment appears damning given Trafigura's previous denials of any wrongdoing,"" said Benedetta Lacey, a special advisor to Amnesty International who has visited Ivory Coast and met victims of the dumping. Lacey said there remain questions about the impact of the waste on the people's health, and she said the area where the waste was dumped has yet to be fully decontaminated. Friday's fine was also for delivering products to Amsterdam that are detrimental to health, ""and whose detrimental nature was concealed,"" the court said. In August and September of 2006, the cargo ship Probo Koala dumped 500 tons of toxic waste belonging to Trafigura at various sites, including waterways, around the port city of Abidjan, according to the United Nations. It says the waste was a liquid sludge that contained large amounts of hydrocarbons and toxic substances including hydrogen sulfide and caustic soda. Those who got sick complained of nausea and vomiting after inhaling fumes, the United Nations says. The British newspaper The Guardian last year published a draft report about the scientific nature of the waste that indicated it could cause severe human health problems. The author of the report, however, said the findings in the draft were superseded by other data showing the waste caused, at worst, short-term flu-like symptoms and anxiety. Last month, the United Nations helped set up a new laboratory in Abidjan to improve the monitoring of hazardous materials on ships entering the port, as a way to prevent toxic waste dumps there in the future.","Dutch court orders oil giant Trafigura to pay $1.3 million fine .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN) -- Roberto Sanchez, the Argentine singer known as ""Sandro"" and who drew comparisons to Elvis Presley, died Monday night after complications from surgery, his doctor told reporters. He was 64. Sandro's romantic ballads made him a star in the 1960s, but he first found the limelight as rock and roll singer who imitated Elvis' style. In his long career, Sandro recorded dozens of albums and also acted in 16 movies, according to the Web site Rock.com.ar. He is considered one of the pioneers of the Spanish Rock movement. The singer was also known as ""El Gitano,"" or ""the Gypsy,"" because of his family's Roma roots. Some accounts place Sandro as the first Latino artist to sell out Madison Square Garden in New York. Sandro died at the Italian Hospital in Mendoza, Argentina, where he was being treated for complications from a heart and lung transplant last month. He is survived by his wife, Olga Garaventa. Funeral arrangements are pending.","Argentine singer Roberto Sanchez dies at age 64 following surgery complications, his doctor says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- A mudslide triggered by torrential rains may have buried up to 800 villagers in southern Taiwan, media reports said Monday, as the country counted the cost of its worst flooding in decades. A girl is carried out from mudslide caused by Typhoon Morakot in southern Taiwan on Monday. The death toll so far in Taiwan stands at 15, with 55 missing and 32 hurt, since Typhoon Morakot struck the island Friday and remained in the area over the weekend before crashing into eastern China, state-run China Daily reported. Rescuers using military helicopters managed to pluck more than 100 people to safety in the village of Hsiao Lin, as rains washed out roads and bridges in Kaohsiung County, severing all land vehicle traffic, Taiwan's Central News Agency said. Locals estimated there were about 5,000-6,000 people in the mountainous village when the typhoon struck. Journalist Andrew Lee told CNN that it was difficult to know the exact number of people stranded or dead because ""SOS"" reports were still filtering in, and damaged communication and power lines were being repaired. Watch more about the rescue effort » . He cited one report coming in that said 30 bodies had been spotted floating on the water close to a bridge in the area. According to Lee, a number of other villages in the region had been washed away or buried by mudslides, with local government officials unable to determine the number of casualties. Meanwhile, government officials said 1.5 million homes across the island were without electricity, and 440,000 were without water.  Watch as six-storey hotel topples over » . The storm -- measuring about 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) across -- continued to pummel China's populous east coast, but forecasters said it is unlikely that Morakot would reach Shanghai, the country's largest city, which sits farther north along the coast. Chinese government officials expect the typhoon to cause more than 8.5 million yuan ($1.2 billion) in damages, the newspaper said. The storm made landfall in the coastal area of Beibi town, Xiapu county, in Fujian province, about 4:20 p.m. Sunday (4:20 a.m. Sunday ET), according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. Morakot's winds were clocked at 118 kilometers per hour (73 mph) in its eye, according to the province's meteorological bureau, as cited by Xinhua. Five houses were destroyed as the front of the typhoon brought flooding rains to Wenzhou city in neighboring Zhejiang province just after 8 a.m. Sunday, Xinhua said. Three adults and a 4-year-old boy were buried in debris about 8 a.m. Rescuers could not save the child, the city's flood-control headquarters told the news agency.  Watch a dog escape as house is swept away » . A ""red alert"" -- the highest degree in danger levels -- was issued in Zhejiang, where more than 35,000 vessels were called back from sea, China Daily reported, citing provincial flood control officials. More than 300 homes collapsed, and more than 16,000 hectares (39,500 acres) were flooded, Xinhua said. The city's airport was closed and 56 roads were rendered impassable. As the eye of the storm reached Beibi, the sky turned completely dark, and people caught in rainstorms staggered as they used flashlights to see, Xinhua reported. Trees were uprooted and torn apart by damaging winds. Farmers tried to recapture large numbers of fish, flushed from mudflat fish farms by high winds, Xinhua said. Nearly 1 million people were evacuated from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as Morakot approached. Late Friday, the storm lashed Taiwan, killing two people, wounding 15 and cutting power to about 650,000 households, according to Hong Kong's Metro Radio. Meanwhile, another storm hit western Japan on Monday, with 13 people confirmed dead. Twenty others were missing, police said. Among the victims of Typhoon Etau was a 68-year-old woman who died when a landslide caused a hill to collapse on her home in Okayama prefecture, police said. In neighboring Hyogo prefecture, an 86-year-old woman was found dead in her flooded house and a 54-year-old man in his submerged car. Officials expect the number of victims to rise as torrential rains continue.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Over the past year, searchers have taken to the woods, waterways and even the skies over Bolingbrook, Illinois. They've looked, and then they've looked again. Stacy Peterson disappeared on October 28, 2007, and police consider her husband the prime suspect. But there's been no sign of Stacy Peterson, the 23-year-old fourth wife of former Bolingbrook police sergeant Drew Peterson. Police have named Peterson a suspect in his wife's disappearance. He maintains he is innocent, and says she ran off with another man. The Peterson case has become a cable television staple and has spawned several books. But as Stacy Peterson's disappearance approaches the one-year mark, police seem no closer to solving the mystery than they were on October 28, 2007. That morning, a Sunday, Drew Peterson, now 54, says he awoke at his suburban tract home to find his wife gone. He says he received a phone call from her at 9 p.m. She said that she was leaving him, Peterson says. Police confirm there was some activity on Stacy Peterson's cell phone around 9 p.m. on October 28, but her family and close friends say she would never leave her two children behind or go away without mentioning it to her family. In the days leading up to her disappearance, Stacy Peterson confided in friends and her sister. She said she was afraid of her husband and wanted to leave him, according to her sister, Cassandra Cales. ""If anything happens to me, he killed me. It wasn't an accident,"" Cales quoted her as saying.  Watch how the case has unfolded » . At 10 a.m. that Sunday morning, Stacy Peterson called a friend and scheduled an afternoon appointment. It was the last time anyone in her close circle of family and friends heard from her. She never showed up for the appointment, and was not seen or heard from again. Worried, Cales called the police that Monday, October 29, and reported her sister missing. The media frenzy and police scrutiny soon revealed that Drew Peterson's third wife had died mysteriously a few years before while in the throes of a nasty divorce. Kathleen Savio died just before the division of the marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary. Savio was found drowned in the dry bathtub of her home. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. But her family continued to insist that Savio died as a result of foul play. The investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death has now been ruled a ""homicide staged to look like an accident."" Witness statements that have been leaked to the media portray Drew Peterson as jealous, possessive and controlling. He was said to keep such close track of his wife that he frequently called her on her cell phone and appeared unannounced at social outings to take her home. This caused tension in the marriage, the witnesses told police. Police named Drew Peterson as the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance in November 2007. He has not been charged in the case, but he has been charged with illegal gun possession, which could put him behind bars for up to five years if he is convicted. Drew Peterson continues to insist that his wife left of her own accord and ran off with another man. Asked why he believes this, he responds that she called him and told him so. He also says that she had a number of younger male friends during their marriage. He adds that although it is embarrassing for him to admit it, he often had to deal with her flirtations. He paints himself as a victim left holding their household together and raising their children while living under an umbrella of suspicion and near-constant police and media scrutiny.  Watch how he failed a lie detector test » . The investigation remains open and police and family urge anyone with information about Stacy Peterson's whereabouts to call 815-740-0678 or the family tip line: 866-847-5143. A $35,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to Stacy Peterson or to the conviction of the person responsible for harming her. She is 5 feet 2 inches tall, weighs 100 pounds and has brown hair and brown eyes. She has a blue and yellow carnation tattoo on the small of her back and red cherries tattooed on her left front hip.","Stacy Peterson disappeared on October 28, 2007 .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- They're at the top of the ocean's food chain -- but it is still a mystery how the oil disaster is affecting the shark population in the Gulf of Mexico. Even if sharks never touch the oil slick, their sources of oxygen and food are at risk. And a reduced shark population could impact the entire Gulf ecosystem, according to Neil Hammerschlag, a researcher at the University of Miami, who has been studying sharks for a decade -- tagging them to determine their migratory patterns and other behaviors. Today, his research focus has changed. ""The oil spill opens up a whole new avenue for critical research,"" says Hammerschlag. As with most weekends, Hammerschlag leads a university research team packed into a boat with interns and high school students, to fish for sharks. They research the impact of the oil on sharks and other species of fish in the Gulf of Mexico. Because sharks eat nearly everything beneath them on the food chain, they provide a lot of information about the ecosystem. ""If you see high levels of oil in a shark, you better believe it's in the whole food chain,"" says Hammerschlag's assistant, Austin Gallagher. In order to take biological samples from the sharks, first they must be caught. Ten lines are baited in areas believed to be attractive to sharks. ""Sharks don't chew their food they swallow it,"" Hammerschlag says. The lines are equipped with special circle-shaped hooks to prevent the sharks from harming themselves when they swallow the bait. Swallowing a circle hook, with an inward point does not hurt the shark, Hammerschlag says. The shark swallows the bait and, as it starts to swim away, the hook turns and catches the animal's jaw. He compares it to a lip piercing. ""It heals very, very quickly,"" he says. Once a shark is on the line, it is pulled up to the side of the boat. Larger sharks are kept in the water. The researchers lean over the side of the boat and gather tissue and blood samples, before attaching a tag to the fin. The process usually takes just a few minutes from the time it is reeled in until the shark's release. The information has been used for creating protected marine areas, as well as medical research. Large sharks that migrate long distances -- bull, hammerhead, and tiger sharks -- are outfitted with satellite tracking devices with sensors. When the shark breaks the water's surface, its location is sent to a satellite. Hammerschlag then receives an e-mail containing the coordinates. The data on the sharks' movement -- published on the University of Miami's website -- will tell researchers whether the sharks encounter the oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Hammerschlag thinks the odds are high that sharks will swim through water filled with oil, but he can't be certain because there's no precedent. He's hopeful the sharks can outsmart the environmental disaster. ""There is a possibility that these animals might be able to anticipate the oil and sense the oil and actually move away from it,"" he said. Swimming through the oil could be deadly for sharks. ""Sharks breathe through the water,"" says Hammerschlag. ""They take in the water, the water goes over their gills and they extract oxygen out of the water."" If the water is mixed with oil, it would hinder their normal breathing pattern, he says. It's still too early in Hammerschlag's research to determine whether sharks are swimming through the oil. ""Hurley"" the hammerhead shark had transmitted a signal nearly every day for three months, until just a couple of days after the rig explosion that caused the oil spill. ""The tag could have failed or it could have headed off somewhere else into deep water and just not come up in the last few months,"" Hammerschlag says.  ""But that's very unlike the shark's characteristics."" Either way, as long as there are fish in the oiled area, Hammerschlag and his team will be looking at the effects on sharks. ""You know, there's fishing areas closed in the Gulf of Mexico because they don't want people catching and eating that fish,"" he said.  ""But I don't know if the sharks got the memo.""","Researcher Neil Hammerschlag has been tracking sharks for 10 years .

"TAIPEI, Taiwan (CNN) -- Former Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian was convicted Friday on corruption and money laundering charges, and was sentenced to life in prison, according to officials at Taipei City Court. Former Taiwan president Chen Shui-bian walks inside the Taipei Detention Centre in Tucheng on Friday. He was fined 200 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S.$6.1 million) as well. Chen's wife, Wu Shu-chen, who earlier had been convicted of lying to prosecutors, also was convicted on similar charges. She received a life sentence and was fined 300 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S. $9.1 million), according to the Central News Agency, Taiwan's official news agency. The former president was not at the courthouse when the verdict was read. He had asked to be excused and was being held at a detention center. Supporters of Chen gathered outside the courthouse hours before the verdict, wearing bright-green shirts, and carrying yellow balloons and banners. Riot police stood by in case the crowd got out of control as they protested the verdict. The former president's corruption trial began in March. It is the first for a former head of state, and has gripped the island for months. He has denied wrongdoing and has said the charges are politically motivated. Prosecutors say Chen embezzled 600 million New Taiwan dollars (U.S.$17.7 million), took bribes, laundered money and illegally removed classified documents from the president's office. Chen has countered that the bribe money was actually political donations. He has also said that a special presidential fund from which he is accused of embezzling does not clearly say what the money can and cannot be used for. Ahead of Friday's verdict, the island's former first lady was sentenced to a year in prison for lying in her husband's corruption case. Wu was convicted on charges that she helped her son, daughter and son-in-law provide false testimony. Prosecutors said the former first couple's son has a Swiss bank account with $22 million they think are illegal proceeds. The challenge for prosecutors was to prove that Chen handed out political favors in exchange for money. The former president said he was being persecuted politically by his successor. Chen's party favors independence for Taiwan. His successor, President Ma Ying-jeou, favors closer ties with mainland China. Journalist Yin Chen contributed to this report.","Riot police stand by, as Chen supporters gather outside courthouse .

"(CNN) -- The state of Florida must fund some of Casey Anthony's defense in her first-degree murder trial for the death of daughter Caylee, a judge ruled Friday. ""All costs submitted shall be in compliance with the Ninth Judicial Circuit's caps and rates and are subject to further review,"" Circuit Court Judge Stan Strickland said in a order issued Friday. Anthony's defense team told the court Thursday that she was broke and could not bear expenses associated with her defense. In Friday's order, Strickland granted Anthony's request to be declared indigent, which means the state will pay expenses related to her defense on a discretionary basis except for private attorney's fees. Under Florida law, there is a presumption that a defendant is not indigent if he or she has assets of $2,500 or more, excluding the value of a home and one vehicle having a net value less than $5,000. The ""expectancy"" of money is also taken into consideration. Defense lawyers testified Thursday that there were not any book or movie deals on the horizon for Anthony. A spokeswoman for the DePaul Center for Justice in Capital Cases praised the ruling. ""The defense is pleased that this ruling came after an analysis of supplementary documents detailing the defense's income and expenditures, which were deemed by the court to meet the legal standards for the determination of indigency for costs,"" Liz Brown said. ""After consistent misinformation from legal analysts, bloggers, and commentators, the defense hopes this ruling ends inappropriate speculation regarding any misuse of funds and looks forward to Miss Anthony's day in court."" Anthony's lead attorney, Jose Baez, and Chicago death penalty attorney Andrea Lyon said in a four-page motion that they are not asking the state to pay their legal fees. They asked for assistance with fees for the service of subpoenas, investigations, travel, experts to interpret forensic evidence, expert witness fees and the cost of depositions. The defense attorneys argued that Anthony is entitled to financial assistance under the Constitution's Sixth Amendment, which protects her right to a fair trial. Because prosecutors have indicated they are seeking the death penalty, Anthony also is entitled to ""the unique standard of care required for a capital defense,"" the attorneys assert. Caylee Anthony's body was found in a lot near her grandparents' home in December 2008. The grandparents, George and Cindy Anthony, have been supportive of Casey Anthony but now are fighting foreclosure, according to a complaint filed by Bank of America. Baez testified Thursday that the defense received and spent about $275,000 over the past year and a half. Of that, $5,000 came from an anonymous donor; $70,000 came from a former defense attorney, Todd Macaluso; and $200,000 came from ABC through a ""deal"" with Anthony. The terms of the deal were not released. That money, Baez said, was spent on defense costs including travel, depositions and retention of experts. ""It's been quite an expensive task,"" he said. Baez, who testified that he has spent about 2,500 hours on the case, has been paid an estimated $89,454, according to financial affidavits released by the court and written in what appears to be Casey Anthony's handwriting. Lyon has received $22,500 but testified Thursday that all of that money went back into costs associated with the case. ""There's not a dime"" left, she said. Anthony wrote that both attorneys ""were or are being paid by myself"" and said her income is ""zero"" and her assets are ""zero."" She did not list her debts or liabilities. Two more attorneys, Linda Kenney Baden and Cheney Mason, testified that they are working pro bono -- for free -- on the case.","NEW: Defense hopes ruling will end ""inappropriate speculation regarding any misuse of funds""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- New York has scrapped a proposal that would have raised taxes on items such as sugary soft drinks, iTunes downloads and haircuts, Gov. David Paterson said Wednesday. New York has dropped proposed tax hikes on items such as haircuts, soft drinks and clothing under $100. Paterson said he was dropping a number of proposed taxes after the Legislature agreed to use $1.3 billion in federal stimulus money to help balance the state's budget next year. ""The proposed tax increases we are eliminating today were only put forward as a last resort when the deficit ballooned to an unprecedented level,"" Paterson said in a written statement. The tax hikes were proposed in December, as part of an attempt to close a $14 billion budget deficit for the state's next fiscal year. Paterson said proposals were being dropped for taxes on sugary soft drinks, clothing under $110, haircuts, manicures, cable and satellite television, digital services such as iTunes downloads, concerts, movies, golf, live theater and health clubs. The high-profile proposed taxes had drawn widespread criticism from New Yorkers. In a statement, Paterson said the federal funding could not serve as an ""excuse to avoid the tough choices we must inevitably make to get our fiscal house in order. Federal funding will cover only a fraction of our overall budget deficit, and the economic outlook remains uncertain, so we must ensure that we use this aid in a responsible manner that strengthens our state's long-term finances."" Budget negotiations are ongoing.","New York drops proposed taxes on iTunes downloads, haircuts .

"(Coastal Living) -- There's a stillness that permeates the streets -- and the water -- in Irvington, Virginia. The glasslike surface of Carter's Creek is so calm you can't help but touch it to see if you'll cause a ripple. The scent of warm, dry grass fills the air. Colors appear softer. It feels almost magical. Irvington, Virginia, is three hours from Washington, D.C., and 90 minutes from Richmond and Norfolk. But wander around a bit and you'll discover something more: an energy beneath the quiet facade. A former steamboat port, Irvington is reestablishing itself as the hub of the state's Northern Neck. Just three hours from Washington, D.C., and 90 minutes from Richmond and Norfolk, the town that George Washington called the ""Garden of Virginia"" still serves as a quiet getaway from the city. But now it also offers two fine inns, several upscale restaurants and trendy shops. The Dandelion -- once a church parsonage -- fills its two floors with apparel, accessories and gifts. Across the street, Avolon specializes in hip designer clothing, and, two doors down, Khakis offers way more than neutral slacks. River Cottage's 19th-century building is as captivating as its merchandise: Check out the wavy-glass windows and original flooring from Washington, D.C.'s historic Willard Hotel. Owner Paul Carlson welcomes clientele to browse his hodgepodge of Peacock Alley linens, Maine Cottage furniture, Zekiah stained glass and Hobie kayaks. At The Bay Window, Nancy Drake, Candy Terry and Mary Ragland provide knitting supplies and classes. ""It's so quiet here,"" Mary says. ""This is truly country."" She's right. Locals spend time outdoors. Nightlife consists of gazing at stars in the velvety sky. It also consists of dining at Irvington's sophisticated but playful social mecca, Trick Dog Cafe. Many patrons return for homegrown dishes, prepared by chefs Jeffrey Johnson and Tony Filiberti and flavored with ingredients harvested within 10 to 15 miles of town. Although still largely undiscovered, Irvington revels in its new identity as a destination -- thanks in part to the Tides Inn. Renovated in 2002, the 480-acre resort features 106 rooms overlooking Carter's Creek and a 64-slip marina. Four on-site restaurants include the Chesapeake Club for local seafood and regional cuisine. Guests can golf, bike, play croquet, and take sailing lessons at the resort's Premier Sailing School. For a more eclectic getaway, The Hope and Glory Inn's recently refreshed accommodations comprise seven rooms in an 1890 schoolhouse, plus six cottages. Owner Dudley Patteson says he encourages guests to ""step away from what's going on in life and reconnect."" That's easy to do this time of year, when autumn brightens the town's trees, and straw-color mums decorate Victorian porches on King Carter Drive. Irvington, even with its metropolitan touches, offers its visitors a low-key respite from daily life. In this ""Garden of Virginia,"" the harvest may just be peace and quiet. If you go ...

"Hanoi, Vietnam (CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton expressed U.S. concerns about Myanmar's reported military ties to North Korea and its potential impact on the region during a visit to Vietnam Thursday. ""We know that a ship from North Korea recently delivered military equipment to Burma and we continue to be concerned by the reports that Burma may be seeking assistance from North Korea with regard to a nuclear program,"" Clinton said. Myanmar was formerly known as Burma. Clinton's comments came after meetings with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Gia Khiem. In June, Sen. Jim Webb, D-Virginia, a key member of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, postponed a trip to Myanmar out of concern that Myanmar's government was working with North Korea on the development of a nuclear program. At the time, Webb noted that ""a defecting officer from [Myanmar's] military claims direct knowledge of such plans, and reportedly has furnished documents to corroborate his claims."" Webb said it was unclear ""whether these allegations have substantive merit."" However, in light of the U.S. State Department's recent accusation that Myanmar has violated a U.N. Security Council resolution ""with respect to a suspected shipment of arms from North Korea, there are now two unresolved matters related to activities of serious concern between these two countries."" The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, Regional Forum begins in Friday in Hanoi. Developments in Myanmar are likely to be a popular topic of discussion at the summit. A military junta has ruled Myanmar since 1962 and preparing to hold its first elections in 20 years, but no date has been announced.","The United States has concerns about Myanmar-North Korea military ties .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- More than 1,000 Russians have drowned recently as they attempted to find relief from a stifling heat wave -- many of them after drinking alcohol, officials said. Vadim Seryogin, a department head at Russia's Emergencies Ministry, told reporters Wednesday that 49 people, including two children, had drowned in the last day. More than 1,200 total have drowned, 223 of them between July 5 and July 12. ""The majority of those drowned were drunk,"" Seryogin said. ""The children died because adults simply did not look after them."" A heat wave settled over Russia in mid-June, according to the state-run RIA-Novosti news agency. The region has experienced record-breaking heat, with temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). The heat has caused an emergency situation in Russia, according to a column on RIA-Novosti. Officials have urged citizens to take a siesta in the afternoon to avoid the hottest part of the day. Cases of heat stroke and sunburn have increased in children, and adults with heart problems and diabetes are suffering complications. Asphalt softened in the heat has been blamed for traffic accidents. A state of emergency has been declared in 14 regions, and some areas are facing water shortages as wells dry up. The heat has exacerbated a smog problem, as well, the RIA-Novosti column said, adding Russia has not experienced such heat in 130 years. Winter and spring crops are withering under the heat, the column said.","Two children among those who drowned this week .

"(CNN) -- A prominent supporter of Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday compared Bill Clinton's appeals for his wife, Sen. Hillary Clinton, in South Carolina to the tactics used by a former Republican strategist that are infamous within Democratic circles. Former President Bill Clinton responds to a reporter who asked him about criticism from the Obama campaign. When asked about the comparison, the former president reacted with disapproval, saying it was a distraction from what voters really cared about. In an interview with CNN, Dick Harpootlian, a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and an Obama backer, said some of Clinton's recent remarks on the campaign trail were appeals based on race and gender, meant to ""suppress the vote, demoralize voters and distort the record."" Harpootlian said the remarks were ""reminiscent of Lee Atwater,"" a hard-hitting Republican strategist who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and whose tactics were reviled by many Democrats. Atwater died in 1991. When CNN's Jessica Yellin asked Clinton about Harpootlian's comments, Clinton disputed the charge and lashed out, saying: ""You live for this. This hurts the people of South Carolina.""  Watch Clinton rebuke the media » . ""Because the people of South Carolina come to these meetings and ask questions about what they care about, "" he said. ""And what they care about is not what's going to be in the news coverage tonight, because you don't care about it."" ""What you care about is this. And the Obama people know that. So they just spin you up on this and you happily go along,"" Clinton told Yellin. ""And that's not right. That is not right. This election ought to belong to those people who are out here asking questions about their lives."" The former president's angry response comes just days before the South's first Democratic contest on Saturday and is the latest in a series of heated exchanges between the Obama and Clinton camps. Sen. Hillary Clinton is focusing her attention on states with contests next month on ""Super Tuesday,"" leaving the campaigning for this week's South Carolina primary to her husband. South Carolina's primary is the Democrats' last big contest before Super Tuesday on February 5, when two dozen states hold primaries or caucuses. The senator from New York is zigzagging across the country, while Bill Clinton makes the rounds in South Carolina and doubles up the attacks on Obama. Obama sees his rival's absence as a good thing, according to Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent David Brody, who interviewed the senator from Illinois on Tuesday. ""He believes that it is a sign, in essence, the fact that she's leaving the state -- that that bodes well for him,"" Brody said. ""He was talking about the fact that she had said that ... he's not running against Bill Clinton. But then, at the same time, Bill Clinton is here in South Carolina by proxy, running against Barack Obama down here in South Carolina."" The 42nd president has been immersed in the intense, back-and-forth exchanges between his wife and Obama, who said this week in a debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, that he sometimes can't tell which one he's running against in the race. The former president has attacked Obama in recent days, accusing him of overstating his opposition to the Iraq war, complaining about Obama's union supporters in the Nevada caucuses last weekend and blasting his remarks on former President Reagan in a newspaper interview.  Watch the battle brewing between the Clintons and Obama » . Clinton on Wednesday tried to distance himself from the attacks, telling a CNN correspondent that the rhetoric was ""crazy"" and ""getting a little carried away."" But earlier in the day, the Clinton campaign launched a radio ad in South Carolina that takes another jab at Obama, highlighting some of his recent comments on the Republican Party. The ad plays a portion of his interview with the Reno Journal-Gazette in which Obama said in part, ""The Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years."" The ad's narrator asks, ""Really? Aren't those the ideas that got us into the economic mess we're in today? Ideas like special tax breaks for Wall Street?"" The narrator goes on to say, ""Running up a $9 trillion debt. Refusing to raise the minimum wage or deal with the housing crisis. Are those the ideas Barack Obama's talking about?"" Obama's campaign has said the Clintons are mischaracterizing his comments, and Obama spokesman Bill Burton called it a ""negative, dishonest attack.""  Watch what the exchanges could mean for the election » . ""The fact that Hillary Clinton has praised Ronald Reagan and supported some of the very worst Republican ideas just underscores that she will say or do anything to get elected,"" Burton said. CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said the Clintons ""know exactly what they are doing."" ""This may be a very smart political strategy for them. They've gotten Obama a little bit off his game right now because he's busy responding to Bill Clinton, and that's not what he wanted to be doing,"" Borger said. E-mail to a friend .

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- It was an ethnic twist on an American classic, the kind of thing that some people consider appealing and others frightening. Pinto beans, diced tomatoes, salsa and jalapenos top a hot dog that's grilled to perfection. It's 10 o'clock on a Saturday night at ground zero in the immigration debate. The hot dog vendor, a woman from the Mexican state of Sinaloa, would normally be doing a brisk business. Her cart is across the street from a popular Latino dance club that used to be frequented by Mexican-Americans but is now normally crammed with Mexican immigrants. No mas. ""The city feels abandoned,"" the woman tells me in Spanish. ""Everyone has left."" It sure looks that way during a drive though the city's predominantly Latino west side, with its abandoned buildings, deserted homes and empty parks. Since April, when Gov. Jan Brewer signed SB 1070 to punish illegal immigrants for the sins of the employers who hire them, estimates are that tens of thousands of illegal immigrants have left Arizona for a warmer climate in Utah, Colorado, Texas or New Mexico. Last week, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton struck down four of the most grotesque and illogical parts of the law, including the requirement that local police attempt to determine the immigration status of individuals they suspect of being in the country illegally and language making it a crime to solicit work. I have been watching this drama play out from California. But as someone who lived in Arizona about 10 years ago, I needed a closer look to see what life is like in this desert metropolis now that the law has taken effect -- or rather, what's left of it. I'm a U.S. citizen; my parents and three of my four grandparents were born in the United States. When I lived here a decade ago, I was struck by how comfortable Latinos and whites seemed with one another. There was the occasional conflict, but more often there was compromise and cooperation, even on the issue of immigration. Today a heated debate has produced hard feelings. The everyday interactions between Latinos and whites are much more frayed than when I was covering Phoenix as a reporter for The Arizona Republic. Seventy percent of whites, according to polls, support SB 1070 but 70 percent of Latinos oppose it. Until the judge's decision, there were many whites who were happy the state was taking action against illegal immigration; now they're unhappy with the judge's ruling, meaning almost every group in the state is up in arms for one reason or another. I ask the hot dog vendor how ""los Americanos"" -- her landlord, the people at the supermarket, etc. -- are treating her. ""Everyone is different,"" she says. ""Some are friendly. Others look at you funny, like you're not welcomed."" I think about my question. Unwittingly, I had invited her to engage in the same kind of racial profiling that most opponents of SB 1070 deplore. She prefers instead to judge people as individuals and not generalize based on stereotypes. Good for her. I wonder if this woman is available to give seminars to Arizona law enforcement officers who might soon find themselves in need of that skill set. Later, I interviewed a married couple who came to the United States legally but lapsed into illegal status when their visa expired. They should have gone back to Mexico, but they'd already put down roots in Phoenix, where the husband could earn at least 10 times what he could make in Mexico. We talked about how some conservatives insist that illegal immigrants take jobs from U.S. workers. ""That's not true,"" says the husband, who's worked his way up from manual labor to an office job for a jeweler. ""Americans are lazy. They don't want to work."" But then, he catches himself -- and corrects himself. ""I shouldn't say that,"" he says. ""They're not all like that, but some are. They're spoiled. They think it's easy to come to the United States legally, and they speak from ignorance."" It's interesting that even in a state that recently made it legal for police officers to make assumptions and jump to conclusions about who is or isn't an illegal immigrant, there are illegal immigrants who are fair-minded enough not to make assumptions and jump to conclusions about the rest of us. No matter what Bolton decided, the hot dog vendor is still worried. She thinks a lot of Phoenix police officers and county sheriff deputies, under the command of cartoonish Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, have been champing at the bit for a law like this to give them an excuse to hassle people with brown skin. People like that, she says, won't let the judge's ruling get in the way of enforcing a law which they support. Since the law took effect, Arpaio's deputies have raided residences thought to be ""drop houses,"" where illegal immigrant smugglers harbor their human cargo. No wonder immigrants are afraid. Those who haven't left the state are living as shut-ins. They go outside when they have to go to work. Otherwise, they stay behind closed doors. There is another kind of racism at play here. You've heard how Arizona tried to empower local police to arrest gardeners and housekeepers to crack down on Mexican drug dealers. Baloney. That's just how the state's anti-immigrant efforts are packaged for public consumption. The Mexican drug dealer is the Willie Horton of the immigration debate. I get it. What are nativists supposed to do? Convince Arizonans that the nannies they give their babies to every day are dangerous, that the gardeners to whom they volunteer their security code are a threat. You need drug dealers in this dialogue. Who else are people going to be afraid of? Not a hot dog vendor. Think about where that woman was from -- Sinaloa. That state is the capital of the Mexican drug trafficking industry. It's quite simple. If you're from Sinaloa and you sell drugs, you can live a luxurious life in Mexico. If you sell hot dogs, you work long, hot nights in the desert. Arizonans are ginning up fear of one to rid their state of the other. I finish my second hot dog -- the best I've tasted this side of Coney Island -- and pay the bill. Oh, by the way, I ask the woman: ""What's your name?"" She smiles, looks away and shakes her head. She won't tell me. She must figure, why take chances? For immigrants, there's enough of that going on already in this city, where just getting in a car or walking down the street can be a high-stakes gamble. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.","New immigration law adds to tension in Arizona, says Ruben Navarrette Jr.

"Washington (CNN) -- Lawmakers have scheduled a hearing Thursday to look into the recall of popular pediatric medicines by drugmaker McNeil Consumer Healthcare, which has initiated four recalls of its products in the past seven months. Among those testifying will be Colleen Goggins, the worldwide chairman of Johnson and Johnson, of which McNeil is a division. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform also invited Johnson and Johnson Chief Executive William Weldon, but he declined to attend because of health reasons. A panel of Food and Drug Administration officials will also be at the hearing. The recalls include popular over-the-counter drugs such as Tylenol, Motrin and Benadryl. More information on recalled products . Fifty children's versions of these nonprescription medicines were also recalled on May 1 because of quality and safety concerns. McNeil has maintained that its recall of the children's drugs was not ""undertaken on the basis of adverse medical events"" but as a precautionary measure. Adverse event reports are consumer complaints of a serious side effect associated with the use of a medical product, according to the FDA. Adverse events could include death, hospitalization, disability and other health complications. Following the pediatric medicine recall, Johnson and Johnson suspended production at McNeil's facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania that manufactured the children's drugs. On Tuesday, the drugmaker outlined steps to remedy serious quality and safety lapses at the Fort Washington plant and its other manufacturing facilities. ""McNeil is taking steps to bring its operation back to a level of quality that Johnson and Johnson demands of its companies, and that the public rightly expects of us, and that we expect of ourselves,"" the company said in a statement. Among the measures, the drugmaker said it has hired an independent pharmaceutical consulting firm to identify corrective actions to improve quality and manufacturing systems at its Fort Washington facility. McNeil did not say when it would resume production at the plant. Regarding its products, McNeil said it will conduct in-depth quality assessments for each product that the company manufactures to ""ensure each product's ability to meet specifications throughout its shelf life."" The company also said it will update the FDA about its progress implementing the plan at least once a month and would involve an independent firm in making product decisions during the first six months of operation. McNeil's other recalls in the past seven months were: . -- In November 2009, five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ-open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. -- In December, the recall was expanded to include all product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ-open cap. -- In January 2010, the recall was widened to an undisclosed number of Tylenol, Motrin and other over-the-counter drugs after complaints of consumers feeling sick from an odor.","Drug company has recalled products 4 times in 7 months .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Kara DioGuardi is ensconced in the black velvet cocoon of a small home-recording studio, laying down a demo track while warmed by the glow of spice-scented candles. Kara DioGuardi is joining the ""American Idol"" judges for the show's eighth season. She's crooning a song she co-wrote -- an encapsulation of falling in love that involves shooting stars and dancing shadows -- in a powerhouse pop voice that lies somewhere between Natasha Bedingfield and Sara Bareilles. Somewhere good, that is. ""She kills it every time she sings,"" raves her writing partner, Jason Reeves. ""He's one of the greatest melody writers I've ever worked with,"" DioGuardi returns. Sweet, right? So sweet, in fact, that we're starting to worry for DioGuardi, a heretofore behind-the-scenes songwriter-producer who's about to take on the most-watched, most-dissected job in pop music: When ""American Idol"" returns to Fox on January 13, she'll become a fourth judge to Randy, Paula, and Simon. It's a job that requires a distinct dearth of sweetness, and a certain amount of, for lack of a better term, Simon Cowell-ness. ""Oh, I'm not gonna be this nice on the show,"" DioGuardi assures us. In case we weren't convinced, she drops this rant when the subject of ""Idol"" auditions comes up: ""A lot of times people will sing a big song that they don't have the voice for instead of bringing out the uniqueness in their tone,"" she says. ""Another thing is, don't cheese me out. It's not a wedding band. And emote. Make me feel like you mean it. Don't just sing the way the song was written. That was Mariah's interpretation. Now what are you gonna do?"" OK, we're worried again -- but this time for the contestants. That's exactly what ""Idol's"" producers are counting on. Heading into season 8, they're hoping viewers will be as rapt with how DioGuardi shakes up ""Idol's"" ""dawg""/""beautiful""/""dreadful"" judging dynamic as they are with which singer takes the big prize. And though the show has constantly worked to stay fresh -- allowing contestants to play instruments last year, for instance -- DioGuardi's new energy comes at a critical time, after last season's ratings took an 8 percent dip from 29.8 million viewers to 27.3 million. ""Idol"" actually tried adding a fourth judge once before in season 2, with New York radio personality Angie Martinez, but she quit just a few days in, saying it was ""uncomfortable for me to tell someone else to give up on their dream."" Producers expect no such trouble with DioGuardi, who regularly evaluates new talent as a VP of A&R at Warner Bros. and co-owner of music production and publishing house ArtHouse Entertainment. She's the kind of 38-year-old who can rock a black leather jacket with leggings and write hits for everyone from Pink to Ashlee Simpson to the Jonas Brothers. ""She's very strong-willed, and we needed that with Simon around,"" explains exec producer Ken Warwick. ""I don't want anybody too benign on that panel. Kara tells it as it is."" The feisty spirit that landed DioGuardi on America's most-judged panel of judges goes back to her Italian upbringing in Scarsdale, New York. ""My grandfather was a guy who came through Ellis Island and started a grocery store,"" she says. ""So my father had incredible balls. He had this I'm-gonna-do-whatever-I-want-to-do-and-you-can't-stop-me thing that I got."" That drive spurred her to college at Duke, where she started out in the opera program but didn't quite fit in with the classical crowd -- so instead she went pre-law. ""I always wanted to be a trial attorney,"" she says. ""I love to argue."" After graduation in 1993, DioGuardi was living at home and fronting a garage band called Gramma Trips -- ""covering songs, not writing my own"" -- when a friend snagged her an interview for a job as the assistant to the editor in chief and publisher at Billboard magazine, where she ended up spending five years. While mastering the business side of the music industry during her workday, DioGuardi spent her downtime learning to craft songs, which she now describes as ""the worst things I've ever heard in my life. My first song was called 'Show Me Love,' about a girl who wants the guy to open up his heart. It was like, Honey, he's just not that into you."" Eventually, though, she pulled together a respectable demo that she gave to none other than a pre-""Idol"" Paula Abdul in 1998 by simply walking up to the pop star in New York and dropping the name of a Billboard connection. ""I asked her if she was any good,"" Abdul recalls. ""She said, 'Yeah, I'm really good.' And I believed her."" Luckily, the demo delivered on DioGuardi's chutzpah: Abdul liked DioGuardi's work so much that she flew her out to stay at her Los Angeles home for six weeks of intensive collaboration. The results: a song called ""Spinning Around"" that became Kylie Minogue's 2000 comeback single -- and a genial relationship with Abdul that both women hope will help squelch those intra-panel rivalry rumors. ""We were the best roommates,"" says Abdul. Adds DioGuardi, ""We didn't have one argument. We lived very well together -- it was the strangest thing."" The following year DioGuardi scored with Enrique Iglesias' multiplatinum album ""Escape,"" on which she co-wrote seven songs. The title track in particular revealed her knack for irresistible pop hooks, which led to a stunning roll on those charts published by her former employer. With 168 of her songs appearing on multiplatinum albums, you can thank (or curse) her for Simpson's ""Pieces of Me,"" Celine Dion's ""Taking Chances,"" Gwen Stefani's ""Rich Girl,"" Hilary Duff's ""Come Clean,"" Christina Aguilera's ""Ain't No Other Man,"" and Pink's ""Sober."" She's also penned cuts for several products of the ""Idol"" machine, including Kelly Clarkson, David Archuleta, David Cook, and Katherine McPhee. Industry insiders attribute DioGuardi's prolific portfolio to her no-nonsense work ethic. ""If you're in a jam and need something done, she's a great closer,"" says Jimmy Iovine, whose Interscope Records includes DioGuardi collaborators the Pussycat Dolls and will.i.am. ""I'd use her for anything."" Music mogul Tommy Mottola -- who paired her with Dion, Marc Anthony, and Jessica Simpson, among others -- agrees: ""She's one of the best I've ever encountered. In pop music, where things can be sort of crap and mundane, she finds new twists lyrically, and her melodies are extraordinary."" Another plus, as far as her ""Idol"" credentials go: She's got vocal chops. ""The truth is she can sing like there's no tomorrow,"" Warwick says. ""So whereas in the past when the kid would say, 'Aw, you couldn't sing any better' and none of the judges even tried, she does, and she can."" But the question remains: Can she hold her own as a TV star? Sure, she appeared on ABC's 2006 ""Idol"" rip-off ""The One,"" but it was canceled after only four episodes. And crashing Randy, Paula, and Simon's party is something else altogether. ""They're like brothers and sisters at this point,"" she says, having already wrapped the brutal preliminary auditions as well as the Hollywood round. ""And I'm like the long-lost cousin who they're not sure they wanted to see, but now they're like, Okay, you can stay for dinner."" She has what sounds like Randy Jackson's unequivocal -- and ever-so-Randyesque -- endorsement: ""I think people will look at me first and say, If the dawg is feeling her, then I should feel her too."" For the record, she'll sit between Randy and Paula. ""They tried [putting] me between her and Simon,"" explains DioGuardi, ""but they kept trying to communicate and I didn't want to be in the middle of that."" And, yes, both she and Abdul will be keeping their seats; producers insist DioGuardi isn't being groomed as her former mentor's replacement. ""That's just cheeky journalistic hype,"" Warwick says. Adds DioGuardi, ""Paula and I have a good vibe. I have respect for Paula. I'm not of the thinking that women should drag each other down."" Abdul says she isn't worrying about her job security (""I was never told that she was coming in to take my place"") -- and, in fact, only feels more confident with DioGuardi around: ""When I heard she was going to be the fourth judge, I thought, ha ha, hee hee, Simon has no idea I have an ally now."" That's a relief to DioGuardi, who says her biggest challenge will be ""being aware of when to shut up."" But could her penchant for telling it like it is end up rankling a nation of rabid ""Idol"" fans? In between singing the praises of a new love on her demo and waxing rhapsodic about writing partner Reeves, DioGuardi muses repeatedly, and without prompting, about whether America will think she's just too darn mean. ""I know who I am, but what are people going to perceive me as?"" she wonders. ""They may think my intensity and my boldness are bitchy. I hope not. I don't think I'm bitchy. Do you think I'm bitchy?"" No, but fortunately for ""Idol,"" we think she has a lot of potential. CLICK HERE to Try 2 RISK FREE issues of Entertainment Weekly .

"Washington (CNN) -- Among the 90,000 secret U.S. military documents posted on the internet this week by WikiLeaks are more than a dozen reports of possible attacks on Afghanistan coalition aircraft using heat-seeking shoulder-fired missiles. It was that type of missile that brought down numerous Soviet military aircraft when the Soviet Union tried to occupy Afghanistan in the 1980s. But among all the reports, one day stands out: May 30, 2007. In the first of three attacks on that day, an American CH-47 helicopter code named ""Flipper"" was, according to a leaked report, ""engaged and struck with a missile."" ""The missile struck the aircraft in the left engine,"" the report says. ""The impact of the missile projected the aft end of the aircraft up as it burst into flames, followed immediately by a nose dive into the crash site."" All seven troops on board died, including five Americans, a Briton and a Canadian. The report goes onto say, ""Based on description of launch, size of round, and impact force of the projectile, it is assessed to be bigger than an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) and possibly a surface-to-air missile. Witness statements ...  suggest Flipper was struck by MANPAD (man-portable air-defense system)."" MANPADs are shoulder-fired missiles that can home in on the heat from an aircraft's engine to destroy it. A U.S. military official in Afghanistan said the reports don't tell the whole story. ""We're aware of the report on surface-to-air missiles. What's being presented is a pretty broad and somewhat random selection of documents that includes information that in some cases is incomplete or not verified by other sources or studies,"" the official said. ""There's been no recent activity suggesting that these weapons are a threat, as attested by the volume of our daily air activity and the causes of aircraft incidents, which we report."" Within half an hour of the first attack, two Apache helicopter gunships were fired on by what the pilots thought was a missile. The helicopters were not damaged. Another half hour later, another attack came from the ground on the same Apaches. The report on that incident reads, ""This was possibly the second MANPAD engagement against this flight of Apaches in a 30-minute period. Clearly, the Taliban were attempting to down an Apache after downing the CH-47."" Many more reported MANPAD attacks or possible MANPAD attacks were reported in 2007, but none brought down a coalition aircraft. Perhaps the best known and most effective MANPADs are American-made Stingers, which the United States supplied to Afghan militia to fight the Soviets. At least two of the reports indicate that a Stinger missile could have been used to attack coalition aircraft, albeit unsuccessfully. One report details that case of a missile fired at an American F-18 Hornet by what was believed to be a MANPAD. And because the missile blew itself up as it approached anti-missile flares, the report's author suggested it was a Stinger. ""A Stinger Basic would have likely been the only MANPAD (currently known to be in Afghanistan) capable of a proximity detonation onto the dispensed flares,"" the unidentified commander wrote. The Hornet was not damaged and no one was hurt. Most of the reports mentioning the specific type of MANPADs refer to older, less sophisticated missiles of Chinese or Soviet design. ""The 1st or 2nd generation MANPADs generally encountered in Afghanistan (HN-5, SA-7, SA-14, SA-16) would have had to have made direct contact with one of the flares (in order to) initiate the detonator,"" the report on the F-18 Hornet attack says. There's no doubt MANPADs are in Afghanistan. One coalition raid on a weapons cache in 2005 found four MANPADs in storage. And during a meeting between U.S. military leaders and a provincial governor, ""the governor reported that a man claiming to have MANPADs for sale has been in touch with his staff, presumably to give CF (coalition forces) an opportunity to buy them and get them out of circulation,"" one of the leaked reports says. ""The governor referred to them as Blowpipe missiles. The seller is going to show the governor a picture to prove that he has them."" It is unclear from the report whether the coalition ever secured the missiles the governor talked about.","Documents posted on WikiLeaks.org include possible attacks by MANPADs .

"(CNN) -- The tens of thousands of secret documents released this week by WikiLeaks.org don't provide major new insights into the Afghanistan war, and the media response to the disclosures has been ""vastly overdone,"" says analyst Fareed Zakaria. WikiLeaks released more than 75,000 U.S. military documents on Sunday after giving The New York Times, The Guardian and Der Spiegel an advance look at them. The disclosures prompted headlines around the world, focusing particularly on reports of ties between Pakistani military and intelligence officials and militant groups fighting NATO forces in Afghanistan. The author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" spoke to CNN on Tuesday. Here is an edited transcript: . CNN: What do you make of the disclosures in the WikiLeaks documents? Fareed Zakaria: I think the reaction has been vastly overdone. Frankly I think it was overdone by the three newspapers that published them and then by the rest of the media. This has been compared by almost everybody involved to the Pentagon Papers. They are in fact nothing like that. CNN: How were the Pentagon Papers different? Zakaria: The Pentagon Papers was a secret report commissioned by the highest levels of government to assess how the war was going in Vietnam. What it revealed was that the government, at the very highest level, had been deceiving itself and the American people about the progress of the war, and that the war was in fact going much, much worse than the public had been led to believe. What the war logs show is nothing like that at all. They provide a lot of granular detail about the complexities of fighting a counterinsurgency war. CNN: What's the major thrust of the war logs? Zakaria: They effectively show you what Barack Obama was saying on the campaign trail for about a year, which [Sen. John] McCain largely concurred with -- which was that the war in Afghanistan had been badly fought in the years 2004-2008, which is roughly when the logs date from, that it had been under-resourced from 2004-6, that the Taliban had managed to come back ... and that one of the reasons it had been able to come back was the support of the Pakistani military. So all this was fairly well known. It does provide some richness and bears some little details such as the fact that the Taliban had been using heat-seeking missiles, which was reported but not widely reported. To me, that doesn't add up to a basic change in what we know about the war. ... If these documents had not been marked ""secret"" and someone presented you with that as reporting, at this point it would not even have made the front page. CNN: The head of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, has suggested the documents may show ""war crimes"" and said on the Larry King show Monday that ""we see events that are very suspicious. ... We see an incident in August 2006 where U.S. forces, in one report, kill 181 [of] what they say are insurgents. There's one wounded and zero captured."" Zakaria: He cited one episode on the Larry King show. A lot of counterinsurgency warfare is being done by helicopters and drones, in which cases there are aerial bombardments. Yes there are high casualty rates in those cases, but unless he's alleging that those people were civilians, unless he's alleging something a little more specific, it's very difficult to know what he means by isolating one incident and saying it's suspicious. I'm not ruling it out, I'm saying it's a pretty serious charge to make and he's tossed it around rather cavalierly. CNN: What's the impact of the release going to be? Zakaria: I think the most specific impact is the issue of Pakistan ... the reality is that Pakistan's interest and America's interest are not the same. Pakistan has been maintaining its contact with these militant groups. The one thing that this report did is to provide enough detail on this set of problems that it's essentially pretty undeniable and it also is very difficult now for the administration to deny that there is a huge problem here -- that the Pakistanis have been playing a double game. That part of it seems to shed light very centrally on the role of Pakistan. Again to be fair, the Obama administration came into power arguing that Afghanistan needed to be thought of as ""Afpak,"" that Pakistan is very much part of the problem and part of the solution. And they have been working on that. It's not an easy problem because we have limited leverage with Pakistan. CNN: Why can't the United States take a firmer stance with Pakistan? Zakaria: If you were to shun and isolate them, it would probably strengthen even further their contacts with the militants. So I recognize that this is a thorny problem for any administration. But I do think it centrally highlights this problem, that you're really never going to solve the Afghanistan problem as long as you have not just a safe haven across the border, but a safe haven in which the government on the other side is playing footsie with the terrorists. CNN: Regarding the Afghan war, you've noted that CIA director Leon Panetta has said there are probably only 50-100 members of al Qaeda in Afghanistan now. How should that affect U.S. policy? Zakaria: There's no question that our efforts in Afghanistan are disproportionate. There are simply many cheaper and more cost effective ways to deal with the very real problem of al Qaeda and the potential for a reconstituted Taliban that would shelter al Qaeda. Those are both real threats but I think there are ways to deal with them short of a foreign troop presence of 150,000 and expenditures in the $200 billion a year range. That said, you can't switch this engagement off like a television set. There are 50 countries involved, NATO involved and the entire international community at some level involved. I think that what we have in place right now is a strategy that says Gen. [David] Petraeus [the top military commander in Afghanistan] is going to be given a year to try to stabilize the situation, and then a year from now we are going to begin a drawdown. I think that that's perfectly reasonable. I don't see any advantage to an immediate, precipitous drawdown that begins tomorrow. ... But I do think we need to start moving to rebalance American foreign policy. CNN: What do you mean by rebalancing? Zakaria: We have simply spent far too much time in Iraq and Afghanistan. We are dealing there with the problems of the past. The problems of the future, the opportunities of the future, lie elsewhere in the world, in Asia and Latin America, and we should be spending more time and effort on those rather than on reorganizing the tribal relations between the Pashtuns and the non-Pashtuns in Afghanistan and and the Sunnis and the Shia in Iraq. These are pretty much the same problems the British were dealing with 100 years ago and they are not going to be amenable to a simple solution. We should stabilize things and then draw down.","WikiLeaks released more than 75,000 U.S. military documents on Afghan war .

"(CNN) -- Former President Bill Clinton said Wednesday that overhauling the nation's health care system should be easier now than when he tried in the early '90s, despite the current financial doldrums. Bill Clinton says fewer obstacles to health care reform exist now compared to when he was president. ""I think that the consensus is overwhelming,"" Clinton said in an interview with Dr. Sanjay Gupta taped for CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""The politics and the economics are much better now and the policies are better,"" he said. ""They've made advances over where we were."" In 1993, Clinton pushed for a universal health care plan, with his wife, then-first lady Hillary Clinton, heading a task force on the issue. Small-business groups, doctors, the insurance industry and congressional Republicans lined up to fight the plan, which was officially declared dead in Congress the next year. President Obama's plan, which offers people the chance to buy into the same health plan federal government employees use, avoids some of the more controversial aspects of that effort. ""We have a simpler, clearer path to the future than we did when I was there,"" Clinton said.  Watch Clinton discuss health care reform » . ""You don't have to have an employer mandate. You don't have to have a tax increase now,"" he said. ""I think the obstacles are less than they were."" Those differences have made doctors, small-business owners and even some in the insurance industry more open to reform, Clinton said. Plus, Democrats now hold comfortable majorities in both the House and Senate, meaning fewer Republican votes are needed to reach the 60 votes needed to avoid a filibuster in the Senate. Clinton said Obama is well-situated to handle the fight for health care reform, in part because of the fine-tuning his plans went through during his Democratic nomination fight with now-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He cited a health care forum in which Obama, Clinton and others spelled out their plans, opening them up to criticism from their opponents and creating the opportunity to continue improving them. ""By the time the primary was winnowed down to two candidates, there was some difference on how universal the coverage would be, but Hillary's plan and then-Sen. Obama's plan looked pretty close,"" Clinton said. ""The president then made it very clear he was going to pursue this."" Tough economic times shouldn't hinder reform, Clinton said. ""I believe that health care and education and energy are all economic issues,"" he said. ""For many people, many working families in America, before the financial crisis, the economic problem they had was health care,"" he said. ""Health care was driving the majority of the bankruptcies in this country. It was keeping parents up late at night.""","Clinton says President Obama's plan less controversial than plan he pushed in 1993 .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Criminal defendants are expected to make initial appearances in federal courts in Phoenix and Tucson on Friday in connection with what one federal agency calls the largest human smuggling investigation in its history. U.S. and Mexican authorities arrested dozens of people Thursday in what U.S. officials say is ""the culmination of a comprehensive year-long"" investigation focusing on shuttle buses operating along the border between Arizona and Mexico. ""This operation has dealt a serious blow to the infrastructure of some of Arizona's most prolific and profitable human smuggling organizations -- organizations that made their money by moving people,"" John Morton, homeland security assistant secretary for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said at a news conference Thursday afternoon. The investigation is called Operation In Plain Sight because of what officials call the ""brazen nature"" of the shuttle services, allegedly part of a confederation of illegal immigrant smuggling rings. The investigation ""included unprecedented cooperation with Mexico's Secretariade Securidad Publica,"" and it ""ultimately implicated high-level members of human smuggling organizations"" in northern Mexico and the Arizona cities of Phoenix, Tucson and Nogales, ICE said. Eight hundred agents and officers from nine federal and local law enforcement agencies fanned out across Arizona on Thursday, making arrests in the three above cities, plus Rio Rico, and shutting down businesses. Authorities in Mexico and Tennessee also made arrests. ICE, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, said owners and employees of five Arizona commercial shuttle services are among the 47 criminal suspects taken into custody after search and arrest warrants were executed in Arizona. Mexican agents made four criminal arrests, according to Virginia Kice, ICE's Western regional communications director. Authorities announced two arrests in Tennessee, a location underscoring the national reach of the smuggling operation. Here's how the rings operated, federal authorities said: Smugglers would help illegal immigrants enter the United States near a border city such as Nogales. They would then be transported to Tucson, where one of the shuttle vans would take them to Phoenix. Once there, they would rendezvous with another vehicle and be taken to a drop house, and they would then be moved to cities all over the United States, authorities said. Illegal immigrants were allegedly issued phony tickets for shuttle trips, which enabled drivers to claim they were operating legitimate businesses if they were stopped by law enforcement. While most of the smuggled people identified in the investigation came from Mexico and Central America, others came from far-flung locations, such as China. ""The defendants wrongly believed they could operate with impunity by hiding behind the veil of legitimacy these businesses provided. Using our investigative expertise, we've dismantled these transnational organizations and literally seized the engines that were driving the criminal enterprise,"" Morton said. The timing of the raids has drawn criticism from immigration rights groups. ""I think we're getting absolutely mixed messages,"" Jennifer Allen, director of Border Action, said Thursday. ""I saw that just yesterday, first lady Michelle Obama said she wants to see immigration reform happen, and then we wake up this morning and we have ICE raids intensively throughout the state of Arizona."" The first lady visited Mexico this week, where she met with her counterpart, Margarita Zavala de Calderon. ICE officials say politics played no role in the operation. They say the massive investigation and resulting sweep represent a shift in enforcement strategy. For years, law enforcement officials concentrated on busting illegal immigrant drop houses. Now, federal officials say, they are after the transportation networks that supply the smugglers' human cargo. CNN's Casey Wian and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","Operation in Plain Sight deals ""serious blow"" to smugglers, Homeland Security official says .

"(CNN) -- Bill Haslam, the mayor of Knoxville and considered a moderate Republican, easily won the Tennessee GOP primary for governor Thursday, the Tennessee Department of State's website reported. With all of the state's precincts reporting Haslam had 47.5 percent of the vote as he defeated Congressman Zach Wamp and Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey. Halsam, who helped fund some of his own campaign, will now face Mike McWherter, a Democratic businessman and son of a former governor. The race is  to succeed Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, who is prevented by term limits from running for a third term. Political handicappers think Republicans have a good shot at winning back the governor's office. Republican Governors Association spokesman Tim Murtaugh in a statement: ""Bill Haslam emerges as a strong candidate headed toward November, having beaten a pair of qualified office holders in a spirited primary.  As Tennessee faces great economic challenges, Bill Haslam will be a strong voice for job creation, fiscal restraint and individual freedom. ""A successful mayor and businessman, he has the leadership experience necessary to create jobs and grow the economy.  We look forward to seeing him elected the next governor of Tennessee."" Democratic Governors Association executive director Nathan Daschle said, ""Mike McWherter has spent his career growing jobs and strengthening the economy. The only thing Bill Haslam has increased in his career is Knoxville's taxes and unemployment rate."" ""Voters are looking for someone with the know-how to move the state in the right direction, and that candidate is Mike McWherter,"" Daschle added. The race grabbed national attention last month because of controversial comments by two of the challengers. Wamp appeared to suggest that Tennessee should consider secession in light of mandates forced on the states by the Obama administration's health care bill. The eight-term congressman later stepped back from those comments. Ramsey also drew attention to himself last month after he was seen in a YouTube video questioning whether Islam is a religion.  He was expressing his opposition to the expansion of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, which has become a hot-button issue in the city about 35 miles southeast of Nashville. Ramsey, who has been endorsed by 20 Tea Party organizations, said he is a supporter of religious freedoms, but such protections may not extend to bringing ""Shariah [Islamic] law into the state of Tennessee ... into the United States."" ""Now, you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, a cult, whatever you want to call it,"" he continued. ""But certainly we do protect our religions, but at the same time, this is something we are going to have to face."" Following criticism, Ramsey defended his comments, saying, ""My concern is that far too much of Islam has come to resemble a violent political philosophy more than peace-loving religion."" In a high-profile Congressional primary, two-term Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen overwhelmingly defeated former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton. The campaign in the 9th District, which covers Memphis and has a large African-American population, was dominated by race. With all precincts reporting, Cohen had 78.7 percent of the vote to Herenton's 21.3 percent. Herenton has been urging voters to elect him as the only African-American member of the state's congressional delegation, saying, ""It is as if only white people live in the great state of Tennessee. No African-Americans. I believe that it is very clear to the majority of the citizens of this community that we lack representation."" Cohen, who served as a state lawmaker in the area before being elected to Congress, has campaigned on what he's done for education and health care in the area. ""I represent everybody and I work hard for people to get them opportunities. And I just think that race should not be an issue in 2010,"" he said. President Barack Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus backed Cohen. Stephen Fincher won the 8th District Republican primary. Fincher collected 48.5 percent of the vote over Ron Kirkland at 24.4 percent and George Flinn at 24 percent. The race, for Rep. John Tanner's seat, is noteworthy because the Center for Responsible Politics has called it the most expensive House primary in the country, . Fincher will face Roy Herron, who easily won the Democratic primary.","Cohen is winner of 9th District Democratic primary .

"Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Conson was downgraded from a typhoon early Saturday, a day after the deadly storm roared into China, along the southern tip of the island of Hainan. Conson is forecast to move through the Gulf of Tonkin on Saturday, making a final landfall in northern Vietnam, near Hanoi, in the afternoon, according to CNN World Weather. The storm, which killed at least 39 people during its westward march across the Philippines this week, had maximum sustained winds of 112 kph (70 mph) Saturday, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. At one point Friday morning, the storm's winds reached 139 kph (86 mph), making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane when it reached China. Southern China already had been battling severe flooding that killed 146 people over the past two weeks, destroyed about 113,000 homes and forced more than 1.2 million people to relocate this month, state media said Friday. Forty people were missing. According to the state-run Xinhua news agency, Chen Lei of the State Flood Control and Drought Relief office said the coming rain would exacerbate the flooding. Storms and floods have affected more than 35 million people in 10 China provinces this month. By Thursday, the nation had recorded at least 26 billion yuan (about $3.8 billion) in economic losses, Xinhua said. Conson had weakened from a typhoon to a tropical storm before its landfall late Tuesday in the Philippines, but that didn't keep the storm from wreaking havoc as it traversed the archipelago off the Asian mainland. Conson then traveled across the South China Sea, picking up strength. Along with the rising death toll, the Philippines' National Disaster Coordinating Council said Friday that 84 people were missing.","Conson is downgraded to a tropical storm .

"Editor's note: This article contains profanity that some may find offensive. This is part one of a three part series showing different aspects of life inside Colombia's drug gangs. A gang member sniffs in a cloud of cocaine dust as he cuts the drug with other substances. MEDELLIN, Colombia (CNN) -- A young man with tattoos covering one arm rolls hundreds of marijuana joints in the half-light of a shack, perched on a hillside in a Medellin slum. A 9mm pistol and a .38 revolver lie on his work bench. An old battery-powered radio blares out the salsa music classic, ""Todo Tiene Su Final"" or ""Everything Comes To An End."" ""I'm getting calluses on my tongue rolling all these spliffs,"" he laughs, telling me has enough marijuana for about 1,000 joints. He and his comrades plan to sell them for about 50 cents apiece. A few doors away, two other gang members have raided their mother's kitchen for soup plates, drinking glasses and a blender. They've just taken delivery of a kilogram (2.2 pound) brick of pure cocaine. Their job now is to cut it and package it in gram bags to peddle on street corners they control.  Watch as cocaine is cut » . A female gang member shows up with two more bags, one containing powdered caffeine and the other lidocaine, a dental anesthetic used to dilute the pure cocaine. They mix business with pleasure. Every now and again one of the gang members pulls off the top of the blender and breathes in a cloud of pulverized cocaine. One of them coughs and keels over in the kitchen. Seconds later, he's back on his feet snorting cocaine off a spoon. ""Breathing that cocaine cloud mellows me out so I need a line to take me back up,"" he says. Standing in the background, snorting lines of pure cocaine off a pocketknife is the gang leader, a man in his mid-20s. His cohorts call him ""Chief."" He tells me they'll sell the heavily cut cocaine for $1.50 a gram. Higher purity powder goes for about $4 a gram. That's much cheaper than the $50 or $60 a heavily cut gram costs on most U.S. and European streets, according to estimates from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. I agree to conceal Chief's true identity to protect him from the police and rival gangs. As we chat, he dismantles a small caliber pistol.  Watch the gangs in action » . ""Around here the only law is the rules of the street,"" he explains. ""The rules don't change; they always will be the rules, here or anywhere else."" A trusted source, who made the introduction for me, tells me Chief is a ""total animal living on borrowed time,"" who has earned so many enemies he cannot risk stepping outside the few hundred square yards of his home turf. ""I'm only human, of course I get afraid,"" he says. ""Afraid my life will end suddenly before I can do anything to get out of this war."" Since the time when undisputed cocaine king Pablo Escobar held sway here, the ""northeastern commune"" district has forged a fearsome reputation as a recruiting ground for drug cartel hit men and violent gang wars. Medellin is once again in the grip of a vicious drug war. In January to September this year, city authorities say the murder rate has more than doubled with almost 2,000 killings. Officials at the Medellin public prosecutor's offices say the vast majority of victims were shot, likely victims of rival drug gangs and cocaine capos.  Watch marijuana joints being rolled by the hundreds » . That makes Medellin as dangerous as Ciudad Juarez, the frontier town dubbed Mexico's most dangerous city as a result of the ongoing cartel war there. Authorities in Juarez say killings are up from last year and are hitting record highs. Colombian authorities estimate there are around 130 street gangs -- known as ""combos"" -- in Medellin, totaling some 6,000 members. Their only real loyalty is to the money that drug capos dole out to hire a gang's services. Capos will supply them with drugs to retail on street corners and occasionally issue them weapons to take on rival gangs loyal to another crime boss. Until earlier this year, Medellin's drug underworld was ruled by the so-called ""Office of Envigado,"" named after a district of the Medellin metropolitan area. The ""office"" was a syndicate of the top cocaine bosses who agreed on the basic rules of doing business in the area. They shared smuggling routes and acted as the ultimate enforcers if cartel members reneged on deals or debts. But the ""office"" has been ripped apart by infighting. Some senior members were arrested, some of those already in jail were extradited and others cut cooperation deals with U.S. authorities. That left the lower ranks fighting to fill the power vacuum. It's an internal battle that is still raging.  Watch how CNN's Karl Penhaul got unprecedented access to the gangs » . ""The ones fueling this war are the ones from the other side. They've f***ed up Medellin,"" Chief says. ""They're from Medellin but they're traitors."" ""They want to get control of all Medellin so they're shooting up one gang then another. They're getting paid to fight. These are wars between the big capos and we're paying the price out here on the streets,"" he adds. Chief and his allies have stopped rivals intruding on their turf by strictly enforcing what they call ""street rules."" A day before our meeting, Chief says he helped bury one of his friends who had been gunned down when he ventured into the heart of Medellin with a girlfriend. ""I couldn't even bear to take a look inside the coffin,"" he began explaining. ""We don't really know who did it. But it was that crack head girlfriend who persuaded him to go down there. So we killed the bitch. ""You see that's street rules. You have to answer for our friend and the only way you can do that is pay with your life,"" he says. Chief shies away from questions about which cartel boss is bankrolling his gang. But clearly somebody has been supplying them with guns. They pose with a Czech-made .22-caliber rifle and an assortment of semi-automatic pistols -- as well as the wholesale supply of drugs they then sell on the streets. My conversation with Chief is interrupted when another gang member arrives at the improvised drug den. He mumbles to his boss that a local man has been beating up his wife. Chief authorizes his underling to go and thrash the accused man with a pool cue. ""I don't think we need cameras for this one please,"" he requests. As I get ready to leave I have one last question for Chief: I want to know if he ever had any dreams. ""I've tried to get out of this but it's never quite worked out,"" he says. ""I'd like to sail away in a sailboat. Alone and far away.""","Drug war raging in Medellin, Colombia, has seen almost 2,000 killings this year .

"CALAIS, France (CNN) -- French authorities on Tuesday dismantled a makeshift camp dubbed ""the Jungle,"" which housed illegal migrants fleeing dangerous homelands to seek a more prosperous life in Europe. After being forced from their makeshift home, occupants of ""the Jungle"" were driven away in buses for processing. French police broke up protests by refugee rights advocates and began clearing the squalid camp. The French government said it was targeting human smuggling and did not say where the migrants would be relocated. Police arrested 276 migrants, 125 of whom were minors, said Calais prefecture official Catherine Mande.  See photos of police clearing the camp » . A statement from the French immigration minister's office said the ""illegal encampments"" would be destroyed and then three bulldozers, a dozen trucks and a logging company would return the land to its natural state.  Watch a report on the camp's closure » . The statement said the goal was to destroy the Jungle and other migrant shanties, ""which have become the main launch pad for clandestine immigration into the United Kingdom."" Was the French government right to demolish the illegal migrant camp? Aided by smugglers, many of the migrants in coastal northern France attempt to make it into Britain, hiding in trucks that cross the English Channel. France and Britain signed an agreement in July to crack down on illegal immigration, including dispersing the migrants at the Jungle. British Home Secretary Alan Johnson said he was ""delighted"" to hear that France was honoring the agreement. ""The measures that we have put in place are not only there to prevent illegal immigration but also to stop people trafficking,"" he said. ""We are working with the French not only to strengthen our shared border but that of Europe as a whole."" Johnson said both nations were committed ""to helping individuals who are genuine refugees."" Others who don't need protection were expected to return home, he said. The Jungle -- shanties cobbled from cardboard, plastic tarpaulins and scraps of wood -- housed as many as 1,000 men from nations such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran and Somalia. Camp resident Mohammed Bashir escaped the Taliban in Afghanistan and made a new home in a tent here, among the heaps of garbage, sand and bramble on the outskirts of the French port city of Calais. Sometimes, eight men shared the tent. ""I never lived in such a condition like this back home, but right now we don't have any other choice,"" said Bashir, 24, who left behind his family. ""It's very difficult, very hard for a person who has children and parents."" Desperation filled the air in the Jungle. Many residents survived arduous and illegal treks from their homelands. Some held ambitions to keep going another 20 miles, across the water to Britain. Others hoped to realize refugee status in France.  See a map of the region » . But Tuesday, they were forced to put their plans on hold as they were evicted from the Jungle. Refugee advocates circled the migrants and scuffled with police to keep them at bay. But eventually, the protests were broken up, the migrants were taken away and the shanties started coming down. The French government's decision drew criticism from humanitarian workers who don't think that demolishing the camp will help resolve illegal immigration issues. They say moving the migrants is simply displacing the problem. ""We don't know where they're going to go,"" said Matthieu Tardis, an advocate for asylum seekers. ""We don't know what the government plans to do. We are not respecting human rights here, for sure."" The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees sent staff to Calais earlier in the summer to counsel people about asylum procedures in France and Britain. According to the U.N. agency, most of the illegal migrants enter Europe through Greece and often fall victim to smugglers who turn a profit by helping migrants reach their destinations. The camp residents who fled Afghanistan told CNN they had paid smugglers large sums. They were promised much more than the filthy camp, they said. Bashir said he had no choice but to flee his home after Taliban militants accused him of spying. ""When they don't need you, they just slaughter you,"" he said. ""They threatened me that [I would] be slaughtered."" Bashir's future remains uncertain as ever. He is sure only of one thing: He cannot go home.","French police arrest 276 migrants at ""Jungle"" camp, 125 were minors .

"NAIROBI, Kenya (CNN) -- More than $150 million has been paid to pirates around the Horn of Africa over the past 12 months, Kenya's foreign minister said Friday. The supertanker Sirius Star is the biggest vessel seized by pirates this year. The money is encouraging them to continue and become more brazen in their attacks, Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula told a news conference in the Kenyan capital. ""That is why they are becoming more and more audacious in their activities,"" Wetangula said. Pirate activity off the coastline of east Africa is a cause of growing international concern. Last weekend pirates, who mostly operate from lawless Somalia, seized a Saudi-owned supertanker Sirius Star, the largest vessel captured to date. Another seized vessel, the Ukrainian MV Faina, was carrying a cargo of military supplies and T-72 tanks. They currently hold 17 vessels and are estimated to have attacked more than 90 ships in the region so far this year, according to the International Maritime Bureau's Piracy Reporting Center, which monitors piracy around the world. The attacks have increased in recent weeks, the PRC says. The ransoms being paid to the pirates are also increasing, maritime security experts say. The method of paying the ransoms is changing, too, and has become one of the most complicated and dangerous sticking points in negotiations with pirates, the experts say. Only months ago, pirates preferred to be paid through a complicated web of bank transfers using offshore jurisdictions, according to a maritime security source now involved with ransom negotiations with hijacked ships. Now, however, pirates are demanding cash upfront, the expert says. Paying by cash can involve many middlemen who in the past have been killed delivering ransom.  Watch how ship owners are left with little choice but to pay » . The money is also funneled through international crime syndicates who take their cut, give the rest to the pirates, and use their profit to bankroll even larger attacks with bigger ransoms. ""What other alternative does a shipowner have?"" said Peter Hinchcliffe, marine director of the London-based International Chamber of Shipping. ""It is an appalling situation paying money, knowing that that will further enhance the capability of the criminals ashore."" On shore, Somali pirates are increasingly influential, well armed, and even celebrated. iReport.com: Take a walking tour of pirates' town . ""It's become a very lucrative revenue stream for them, and I think they'll be very reluctant to see it disappear,"" said Chris Austen, chief executive of Maritime and Underwater Security Consultants, which consults with companies around the world on security issues. The Gulf of Aden is a key route for ships passing from the Arabian Sea and Indian Oceans to the southern Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea by the Suez Canal.  See where pirates are operating » . A NATO-led international naval fleet has attempted to crack down on the attacks. An Indian frigate battled a pirate ship in the Gulf of Aden on Tuesday, leaving the ship ablaze and likely sunk, the country's defense ministry reported. Warships have also encouraged shipping to stay within patrolled corridors. On Thursday Russia said it would send more ships to the region to join the frigate Neustrashimy, already taking part in anti-piracy operations. ""After Neustrashimy, Russia will be sending warships from other fleets to this region,"" Adm. Vladimir Vysotsky told the official news agency Ria Novosti. No additional details were provided. Red Sea nations in the Arab League also agreed Thursday to coordinate a common strategy against piracy. The Egyptian government hosted the meeting, which was attended by representatives of Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, Jordan, and Djibouti. A Somali transitional government official was also there. The group issued a communique condemning all acts of piracy. The communique said Arab nations around the Red Sea were principally responsible for security there and recommended establishing joint mechanisms between those countries to ensure the safety of shipping. The group welcomed international and regional support in fighting piracy, and stressed the importance of coordination between the Red Sea Arab nations and regional and international bodies.  Watch more about the pirates' tactics » . It also said Arab countries in that region should be open to having dialogues with other parties about the fight against piracy. ""We did not touch upon the military aspect, but we touched upon aspects related to promoting coordination, consultation and exchange of information, as well as focusing on the importance of regional arrangements, with particular reference to the establishment of the regional maritime center in Yemen,"" said Ali al-Ayashi, Yemeni deputy foreign minister. The communique emphasized the importance of strengthening Arab and African cooperation to fight piracy and noted the respect the group has for the sovereignty, unity and independence of Somalia. Wafaa Bassem, Egyptian deputy foreign minister and chair of the conference, said ""the international community in the short term should help and support the transitional government of Somalia and the Somali people with humanitarian, economical and political support to be able to prevent piracy acts in this region."" Egypt has a lucrative industry from the shipping traffic in the Suez Canal, but it is concerned about shipping firms pursuing other routes to avoid the Gulf of Aden. One Norwegian shipping firm, Odfjell SE, has ordered its vessels to avoid the waters off the Horn of Africa.  Watch Maersk CEO describe risks to shipping » . That decision means that Odfjell SE's 90-plus ships will take the additional time and expense to sail around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Suez Canal, a shortcut for mariners for nearly a century and a half.

"(CNN) -- Librarians across the United States are making noise about new federal restrictions on lead that could take books out of the hands of children. Children's books are covered by federal regulations on lead in items made for children. The Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvement Act requires all products, including books intended for children younger than 12, to meet new standards calling for lower lead content. Commission regulations, written in response to the law, take effect February 10. Even stricter limits will become effective in August. Paper, ink, covers and glues would need to pass lead content standards. ""While we understand the process the CPSC must carry out in order to ensure this law is properly enforced and that the safety of our nation's children is protected, we believe the commission is wasting time and resources by zeroing in on book publishers and libraries,"" said Emily Sheketoff, executive director of the American Library Association Washington office. ""It is our hope that this matter will be resolved soon, so that libraries can continue their efforts to serve children without the threat of closing their doors."" The CPSC is expected to issue guidance early next week, said Lisa Ackerman, spokeswoman for Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, who sponsored the legislation in the Senate last year. The bill, sponsored in the House by Rep. Bobby L. Rush, D-Illinois, was prompted by a rash of recalls of lead- and phthalate-tainted products, many of which were manufactured in China. Long-term exposure to lead can cause nervous system and kidney damage; speech, language, hearing and behavioral problems; and learning difficulties, according to the Mayo Clinic's Web site. Pryor is frustrated with the product safety commission. ""The new law is not and was not intended to be a one-size-fits-all mandate,"" he said in an earlier statement. ""There is simply no excuse for the CPSC's slow action on these rulemakings."" A consumer advocate concurred with Pryor. ""I don't think the law needs to be adjusted,"" said David Arkush, director of Public Citizen's Congress Watch division. ""The law provides means for the CPSC to evaluate and decide whether exemptions should be granted for certain types of products."" CPSC spokeswoman Arlene Flecha said the agency would comment on the issue later Friday. Ordinary books that aren't made to be playthings (such as vinyl bathtub books) and that don't have baubles or other materials on their covers have always been exempt from regulations on lead in paint. But the new regulations on lead in children's products do cover all kinds of books, according to a December 23 letter from the CPSC's office of general counsel to the Association of American Publishers. Librarians say there's no way they can verify the lead content of all the books on their children's department shelves. ""The cost would be unbelievably high for them to test all these books so we could keep them in the library, and how long would we go without them if every library in New England sends them to the same lab,"" Donna Rasche, librarian at the Brewer, Maine, Public Library, told CNN affiliate WCSH-TV . Arkush is unmoved by such arguments. ""If libraries can provide evidence that broad classes of books don't pose a risk of harm to the public health, then they can be granted an exemption from the testing requirements,"" he said. ""If they can't prove that and if the books actually do pose a safety problem, then they shouldn't be sent home with kids."" Publishers -- which will have to prove the safety of new books anyway -- and groups such as the American Library Association could foot the bill for testing older books, he said. ""They don't have to test every book, obviously,"" Arkush said. ""They don't even have to test anywhere near every title. I think they really have to test a reasonable sample size of different classes of books -- different types of binding, different types of materials used."" A coalition of consumer advocacy groups continues to support the law but issued a statement Friday that criticized the CPSC's implementation of it. ""While we have urged the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promptly address reasonable concerns that have been raised regarding compliance, and provide better information about the new law, our organizations all agree that the law is fundamentally sound and essential to ensuring a safer marketplace,"" the statement read. It was signed by Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Union of Concerned Scientists, Kids in Danger, U.S. Public Interest Research Group and Public Citizen. The commission earlier this month clarified the regulations to let resale and thrift shops off the hook for testing the used clothing and other items they sell. Those outlets still are expected to watch out for items that have been recalled or banned, the CPSC said.","NEW: Consumer advocate says law is needed to protect public health .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives approved $600 million in emergency funding Tuesday to help secure the U.S.-Mexico border. The measure, which passed in a voice vote, still needs Senate approval before being signed into law by President Barack Obama. Senators passed a similar plan last week, but must vote again on the House measure that includes the language on border funding. A top aide to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that the chamber could be recalled from its August recess to take up the House-approved measure. ""In light of the voice vote in the House, it is our hope that we can do this by consent by the end of the week,"" said Reid's spokesman, Jim Manley. ""The question is whether Republicans want to try and make this an issue or whether they will allow us to get it done quickly."" Manley said Reid was waiting for word from Senate Republicans on whether they would object to approval by unanimous consent, which could be done without the return of the entire chamber. Otherwise, Reid could still bring back the full Senate for a formal vote. A Republican leadership source said Tuesday night that Republicans were likely to go along with passing the measure by unanimous consent. Among other things, the bill provides for roughly 1,500 new law enforcement agents, new unmanned aerial vehicles, new forwarding operating bases and $14 million in new communications equipment. The measure has attracted strong Democratic and Republican support. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano praised the plan last week, saying it would ""add important, permanent resources to continue bolstering security on our Southwest border."" ""These assets are critical to bringing additional capabilities to crack down on transnational criminal organizations and reduce the illicit trafficking of people, drugs, currency and weapons,"" she said. The bill is funded in part by imposing higher fees on personnel companies that bring foreign workers into the United States.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Four New Orleans police officers accused of killing two men after Hurricane Katrina are scheduled to appear in federal courtrooms Friday. The officers are charged with multiple counts of conspiracy, weapons and civil rights violations in connection with the well-publicized 2005 shootings in the infamous Danziger Bridge incident. The hearings Friday will determine whether the officers will be held in jail until the trial, according to court documents. Three of the officers -- Kenneth Bowen, Robert Gisevius and Anthony Villavaso -- are scheduled to have their morning hearings in a federal court in New Orleans. The fourth officer, Robert Faulcon, is scheduled to have his afternoon hearing in a Houston, Texas, courtroom. The shootings occurred at the bridge on September 4, 2005, six days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast. An indictment alleges that two separate shootings at the bridge resulted in the deaths of a teenager and a 40-year-old disabled man. The indictment contends the four officers opened fire, killing 19-year-old James Brissette. Minutes later, Faulcon allegedly shot and killed 40-year-old Ronald Madison. The indictment also says police supervisors Arthur Kaufman and Gerard Dugue helped the other officers to obstruct justice during the subsequent investigations. An earlier investigation launched by the local district attorney resulted in charges but no convictions. Federal prosecutors then moved in and launched a new investigation. The officers could face the death penalty if convicted, but prosecutors have said in the past that they have not decided whether to seek the death penalty.","The four officers face charges in post-Katrina shootings .

"(CNN) -- An explosion of an apparent land mine that drifted from North Korea killed one fisherman and injured another, police said Sunday. The injured man is still hospitalized with serious injuries to his arms and hands, Yeoncheon County Police told CNN. Investigators have found 19 wooden box land mines washed up on the riverside so far, police said. Heavy downpours in North Korea may have washed the land mines ashore, the South Korean state-run Yonhap news agency reported, citing the South Korean Army. The military is searching all streams that connect with North Korea, Yonhap said, and has issued warnings to people in the area after investigators found ""scores"" of the mines, designed to go off when opened. The explosion occurred just before 11:00 p.m. Saturday (10:00 a.m. ET) in a border city 60 kilometers (37 miles) northeast of Seoul. State media reported Saturday that South Korean investigators had found eight land mines made by North Korea near the border between the two countries. A fisherman on Jumun Island alerted authorities after stumbling upon a landmine in a wooden box, Yonhap said, citing a spokesman for South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. Searchers found seven other mines on Jumum and two other islands in the Yellow Sea, as well as three empty wooden boxes, Yonhap said. It was unclear how the land mines were identified. According to Yonhap, military officials said the mines may have drifted away from North Korea. Jumun Island is just below the sea border between the two countries, Yonhap said.

"(CNN) -- The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said. Juarez Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz says street level drug dealers are responsible for most recent violence there. Turf battles between rival drug cartels, and between authorities and cartels, have made Juarez one of the world's most dangerous cities. There were 305 drug-related killings in August, making it the deadliest month yet, according to the mayor's office. Most of the recent violence has been committed by young street-level drug dealers who work for the Sinaloa or Juarez cartels, Reyes Ferriz said. Adding deportees from the United States, some with criminal records, worsens the situation, the mayor said. In the past 45 days, 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years, Reyes Ferriz said. ""We don't have the statistics to know if they were criminals from the United States or not,"" he told CNN's Rick Sanchez this week. ""We know they were deported from the U.S. Most of them come from U.S. jails. They end up in the city of Juarez, and that's a problem generated for us, but also for the United States."" Most deportees are simply Mexicans who crossed the border illegally, but some hardened criminals get involved with the gangs, which have networks in the United States, Reyes Ferriz said. But according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. agency that oversees deportations, the number of criminal deportees entering Juarez from El Paso, Texas, is not high. ""El Paso had the fewest removals among the other border areas"" in fiscal 2008, ICE spokeswoman Leticia Zamarripa said. About 85,400 ""criminal aliens"" were deported from the United States to their homelands in 2008, according to ICE. Of those deported through El Paso, about 6,800 were criminal aliens, Zamarripa said. The term refers to noncitizens who have been convicted of a crime in the United States. Illegal immigrants whose only violation is entering illegally are not classified as criminal aliens, Zamarripa said. Not all were Mexican, so not all left the United States by crossing into Juarez, she added. By comparison, 11,400 criminal aliens were processed through San Antonio, Texas, via the nearby Laredo international bridges, and 11,000 criminal aliens were deported through San Diego, California. The location of the deportation proceedings ""depends on bed space and operational availability,"" Zamarripa said. Reyes Ferriz wants deportees to be repatriated to the interior of Mexico instead of his city. The Department of Homeland Security is running such a program, involving deportees from Phoenix, Arizona. The deportation flights from Arizona to Mexico are happening because it is a high-traffic area for illegal immigrants, and because that's where the government of Mexico agreed to the program. In a recent conversation, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the United States would work to give Juarez more details about who is being dropped off on its doorstep, Reyes Ferriz said. The 2009 death toll in Juarez was 1,421 as of Monday, the mayor's office said, on pace to beat last year's 1,600 killings. According to a report released last week by a Mexican watchdog group, Juarez, population 1.5 million, was the homicide capital of the world. It had an estimated rate of 130 killings per 100,000 people. By comparison, the homicide rate in New Orleans, Louisiana, by far the deadliest city in the United States in 2008, was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents, based on preliminary FBI figures. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","Some deportees get involved with gangs in Juarez, Jose Reyes Ferriz says .

"(CNN) -- More and more mothers, clutching their rail-thin, malnourished children, are arriving at the packed waiting rooms of the Doctor Without Borders clinics in central Somalia, the aid group said. In fact, the group said it is treating 1,300 children in north and south Galcayo, which is almost half the number of children treated for malnutrition in the area all of last year. ""The situation is alarming,"" said Karin Fischer Liddle, head of the organization's mission in Somalia. ""Our staff is stretched. This is the highest number of malnourished children MSF has ever treated in the area."" Doctors Without Borders -- widely known by its French name, Medecins Sans Frontieres -- said the brutal mix of a lengthy drought, high food prices and insecurity from violence has caused a spike in malnutrition cases. Rain has come to the area in recent weeks, Fischer Liddle said, but it has caused more children to fall ill, leading to more malnutrition cases. In the long run, the rains may help the organization's overburdened clinics in the area. ""Hopefully, the rains all over Somalia will cause food prices to drop and help some of these families,"" Fischer Liddle said. She talked about a woman named Ubah who is at one of the nutrition centers that operate in hospitals in Galcayo. The woman went to the nutrition center after her daughter contracted measles, lost her sight and was unconscious for a week. After more two weeks, Ubah said, she saw improvement in her daughter, though she had not regained her sight. ""They gave her fluid, vitamins and therapeutic food. Now her body is better, unlike when I first brought her here. Now she looks more like other babies,"" Ubah said.","Group says it's treating 1,300 malnourished children in Galcayo in Somalia .

"Norfolk, Virginia (CNN) -- An Iraqi detainee said he was kicked and punched while his hands were tied behind his back in a recording played Tuesday in the trial of a Navy SEAL accused of assaulting the detainee. Petty Officer 2nd Class Matthew McCabe has pleaded not guilty to punching Ahmed Hashim Abed in the stomach, dereliction of duty and lying to investigators. Wearing Navy dress whites, McCabe spoke his first words -- ""Yes, Ma'am"" -- when greeted by the military judge, Navy Capt. Moira Modzelewski. The prosecution and defense teams presented opening statements Tuesday after Modzelewski seated a military jury of four Navy officers and three enlisted personnel. ""It's a story you don't want to hear,"" said Navy Lt. Commander Nicholas Kadlec, the prosecutor. ""And as the evidence unfolds, it becomes a story you just have to believe."" McCabe stared straight ahead as Kadlec told the jury that McCabe failed to live up to Navy standards when he struck a detainee in the abdomen and walked away while the prisoner lay on the floor bleeding. ""By the way, the entire time, the detainee had his hands tied behind his back,"" Kadlec said, urging the jury to muster the ""moral courage"" to convict McCabe. ""It's about doing the right thing, and holding the accused accountable,"" he said. McCabe's civilian defense attorney, Neal Puckett, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, said in his opening statement that McCabe was doing his job. ""The SEALs did what they were trained to do,"" he said to the jury ""They were serving an Iraqi arrest warrant."" Puckett said the evidence will show that the detainee's mouth injury started as a canker sore and that the bleeding was self-inflicted -- not induced by McCabe. ""Not only [will] you not be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt, but you will believe he is innocent, because he is innocent,"" said Puckett. McCabe is the last of three SEALs accused of abusing Abed, who was arrested in Iraq and charged with masterminding the 2004 slayings of four U.S. contractors in Falluja. The killings were widely covered by news organizations when the burned bodies of two contractors were paraded through Fallluja's streets and hanged from a bridge as their captors cheered. In the recording of his three-hour deposition, Abed denied involvement with al-Qaeda or Hamas and said that U.S. and Iraqi forces raided his home and took him to a U.S. base, where he was attacked for five minutes. Abed said he was standing with his hands tied behind his back when he was hit in the stomach. He described falling down from the force of the punch, hitting his face on the floor. He said he felt ""pain in my face"" and later tasted blood in his mouth. While on the floor, Abed described being kicked several times with a boot-covered foot in his shoulder and back. He said that although blindfolded, once he fell on the floor he was able see enough from beneath his eye-cover to determine that his attacker was bare-legged and wearing shorts. He did not identify McCabe as his assailant. The two other SEALs in the case were acquitted in April in Iraq on charges of dereliction of duty and impeding an investigation. McCabe is the only one charged with abusing the detainee.","Matthew McCabe has pleaded not guilty to punching Iraqi detainee, dereliction of duty .

"Mike Galanos hosts ""Prime News"" from 5 to 7 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays on HLN. ""Prime News"" uses the day's most powerful headlines as a starting point for diverse perspectives, spirited debate and your points of view. Mike Galanos says coaches need to be smart and know when to alter practices because of hot weather. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- We love our football in this country, don't we? Whether it's watching the pee-wees or the pros, there's nothing like taking in a game on a crisp fall afternoon. You see your breath as you stand and cheer the pop of the pads or the last-minute touchdown. I love this game so much, I cried when I knew I wasn't big enough or fast enough to play anymore. Many of us share that same passion. And we should share in the grief when a 15-year-old boy dies because of a football practice. We have to learn from the death of Max Gilpin so something like this never happens again -- because it could happen to any of our kids. It was a hot, humid day in August 2008 in Louisville, Kentucky. Max and his Pleasure Ridge Park High School teammates were wrapping up the second of two practices that day. They finished with a grueling round of ""gassers,"" or sprints. Max's body was breaking down, and he didn't even know it. The sophomore collapsed. His body temperature had reached 107 degrees. He died three days later. So who is to blame for this needless tragedy? Was the coach irresponsible in pushing his players so hard on such a hot day? Prosecutors thought that was the case. So for the first time, a football coach faced criminal charges and had to go to trial for the death of one of his players. David Stinson was charged with reckless homicide and wanton endangerment. The state accused the coach of denying players water and even forcing them to run extra sprints as punishment on that hot August day. The coach's defense presented witnesses who said Max complained of not feeling well before practice even began and others who said the fact that he was on Adderall contributed to his high body temperature. In the end, a jury acquitted Stinson of any charges related to Max's death. From the moment I heard about this case, I never thought Stinson would be convicted. The charges were too harsh, and no jury would believe that he knowingly and maliciously put a player in a position that would lead to his death. But I think it is a good thing that this trial took place, and I hope coaches across the country now think twice about how they run their practices and whether they are putting our kids in danger. Sadly, Max is not the first such tragic case. According to the Annual Survey of Football Injury Research, 39 football players have died from heat stroke since 1995; 29 of them were playing for high school teams (the others were college and professional players and one sandlot incident). The first thing we need to do to reduce the risk of any more heat-related deaths is to make sure a doctor gives our kids a full physical examination before they take the field. That means we go beyond listening to the high school freshman's heart and making him turn and cough. One doctor on my show, ""Prime News,"" said we should give them an EKG, and I agree. An electrocardiogram isn't expensive, and having one before a high school player's first season would help doctors diagnose pre-existing conditions. Second, every coach should monitor how hot it is before and during practice. A heat index monitor costs less than $150, and that is a small price to pay for safety. Let's look at what Stinson was dealing with in Kentucky. The Kentucky High School Athletic Association guidelines say that if the heat index is above 95, practice is altered. The heat index the day of Max's death was one degree away, at 94. Two questions off that: Should the temperature be lowered to 92 or 90? And what happens when we alter practice? It should mean that helmets and shoulder pads come off, unless players are tackling. Regardless of the answers, put the rules in place so all coaches know and are on the same playing field. Another thing to consider is how many times a team should practice during the scorching hot dog days of August. There is usually a ""hell"" week in there, when a team practices two times per day. I have no problem with that as long as a coach is smart about how hot it is out there. Six years ago, the National Collegiate Athletic Association forced college football teams to cut back two-a-day practices, especially at the start of the season, so players could become acclimatized to hot and humid weather. Going along with that, the National Athletic Trainers' Association advocates starting off with one-a-day practices and then two-a-days with a one-a-day in between. The last thing, and this could be the most important, is to never deny a player water. According to the Centers for Disease Control, one of the best ways to prevent a heat-related illness is through proper hydration. So if a player is asking for a drink, give it to him. The goal in all this is not to restrict coaches or how we practice football but to make sure we never have another story like Max Gilpin's. The sadness of seeing his mom sobbing in a courtroom as she had to relive her son's death was just heartbreaking. We don't want another coach on trial. Stinson has said Max's death is a burden he will live with for the rest of his life, and I hope his story, and Max's tragic death, bring about needed changes to the game we love. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mike Galanos.","Thirty-nine football players have died from heat stroke since 1995 .

"London, England -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II withdrew the invitation of a far-right politician to her garden party Thursday after he ""blatantly politicized"" it, Buckingham Palace said. Nick Griffin, the controversial leader of the British National Party, was among thousands of guests due to attend one of the queen's three annual summer garden parties at Buckingham Palace. He was invited because he is an elected member of the European Parliament -- and disinvited because his politicizing the invitation ""increased the security threat and the potential discomfort"" to other guests, Buckingham Palace said. The palace said Griffin ""overtly used his personal invitation for party political purposes through the media."" The BNP leader called the withdrawal of the invitation an ""attack on democracy, the media, freedom of speech and one million British patriots."" He said the reason given for the reversal was ""invented nonsense"" and that citing ""natural media interest"" in him to cancel the invitation was ""a disgusting disregard for democracy in Britain."" And he warned that ""blatant attempts at gagging the BNP always backfires (sic)."" Griffin posted the statement on the BNP website and e-mailed it to supporters as a fundraising solicitation. He had said a day earlier that he would be attending the party ""for the 1 million British patriots who now vote for this party despite all the hate from the media liars, the old parties and their thuggish far-left allies."" He asked readers of the BNP website for their suggestions about what he should say to the Queen ""if -- presumably due to some ghastly blunder by a courtier -- I actually meet her?"" Griffin was elected to the European Parliament last year along with another BNP member. It was the first time members of the far-right party had won European elections. He campaigned for a seat in Britain's parliament earlier this year -- hoping to become the first British National Party member of Parliament -- but he came in third in his constituency. The possibility that Griffin would attend a royal garden party last year caused outrage. Another BNP member who had been invited said he would bring Griffin as a guest, but Griffin said he would not attend following the outcry. Griffin was convicted of inciting racial hatred in 1998, a London court official said. He was ordered to serve nine months in prison, a sentence that was suspended for two years, the court official added. He was elected leader of the BNP the following year and re-elected in 2007, according to the party. Queen Elizabeth hosts at least three garden parties every summer at Buckingham Palace as a way to reward and recognize public service. About 8,000 people attend each one, the palace says. People are invited on the recommendation of local and national organizations, which are given a quota of tickets, the palace explained. CNN's Lianne Turner and Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","NEW: Nick Griffin calls the ban an attack on democracy and uses it for fundraising .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China ranks second only to the United States in the number of billionaires, according to an annual report of the 1,000 richest people in the country. The Hurun Rich List counted 130 billionaires in China this year, up from 101 a year ago and none in 2003. An additional 825,000 people had personal wealth of more than $1.5 million, said Rupert Hoogewerf, an accountant who has compiled the list since 1998. ""You can double the real number of billionaires in China to 260,"" said Hoogewerf in a statement. ""There are still a large number of billionaires off the radar screens."" Often, wealthy people in China try to avoid the scrutiny of tax authorities by keeping their finances private. The man who topped the list last year, for example, is under arrest for alleged financial irregularities. The most prominent dropout from the list is injured Houston Rockets basketball player Yao Ming, whose fortune was valued at $100 million last year. The list indicates that China's wealthy have been buffered from the global financial meltdown, which has tycoons in other countries reeling. A separate list, released in June by Capgemeni SA and Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, found that China's economy grew by 9 percent last year, even as the United States and Europe slipped into recession. That list found that the combined riches of China's millionaires surpassed that of the United Kingdom's. Most business owners who made the Hurun list -- both as billionaires and millionaires -- made their fortune in real estate and related industries as China has undergone dizzying urbanization. The construction ministry estimates that the country's urban population will increase by 300 million people by 2025. Few of those making the list relied on exports to Western economies. But the richest man in China this year, Wang Chuanfu, jumped 102 places to the top after billionaire U.S. investor Warren Buffett agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in his company. Buffett's announcement sent shares in Wang's company, BYD, surging 387 percent this year. The company initially made its name with rechargeable cell phone batteries, but this year launched mass production of a plug-in hybrid electric car. Other highlights from the list: . • Less than 1 percent on the list inherited their wealth, compared with 25 percent in the United Kingdom and 35 percent in the United States. • The typical rich list member is a 50-year-old self-made man who started out 16 years ago and has made his money from property development. • 102 women were among China's 1,000 richest. Chinese women make up more than half the world's richest self-made women. • The top three hobbies of wealthy Chinese are travel, swimming and golf. The United States, Australia and France are their preferred destinations. Though the list mentions China as second to the United States in the number of billionaires, it did not specify how many the latter produced. A Forbes magazine tally of the world's richest people, released in March, counted 359 billionaires in America.","Number of billionaires in China grows to 130, according to report .

"MONTE CARLO, Monaco  -- Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva has broken her own world record in the women's pole vault with a leap of 5.04 meters as she warmed up for her Olympic defense. Isinbayeva broke her own women's pole vault world record on her third attempt in Monaco. The record came at the Monaco Grand Prix on Tuesday on her third and final attempt at the height. Her previous record of 5.03 meters was set in Rome on July 11. Isinbayeva is the reigning Olympic and world champion. Asafa Powell claimed his third 100 meters success inside a week when he raced clear in his season-best time of 9.82 seconds. Powell shaved 0.06sec off his previous season-best of 9.88, set last Tuesday in Stockholm, where he saw off fellow Jamaican and world record holder Usain Bolt. On Tuesday Powell was too hot for Davis Patton of the U.S. (9.98) and Nesta Carter of Jamaica (10.02), the fourth best time of the season all the more impressive given the calm conditions. ""I am very happy,"" said Powell. ""I feel great, very fresh. I've got a world record in my legs. I am very confident. My goal is to be consistent."" A tough headwind had compromised Powell's attempts to have a tilt at Bolt's mark although he still cruised to a weekend victory at the London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace in 9.94sec. Other Tuesday highlights saw Jamaica's Melaine Walker set a year mark in the women's 400m hurdles in clocking 53.48 sec. Walker, who shattered her own personal best of 54.14 in the process, will hope her performance augurs well for the Beijing Games, where Aussie two-time world champion Jana Rawlinson will not be competing owing to a toe injury. Kenyan Daniel Kipchirchir Komen also set a year best mark in the 1500m, crossing the line in 3 min 31.49sec to take 0.08sec off compatriot Augustine Kiprono Choge's June 1 showing in Berlin. The 23-year-old's win tempered the disappointment of missing out on an Olympic berth. Britain's Martyn Rooney also improved his personal best in the 400 meters for the second successive race, following up his win in the London Grand Prix with victory in 44.72 seconds. The Monaco Grand Prix was the last major international track and field meeting before the Beijing Olympics which start on August 8.","Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva breaks her own women's world pole vault record .

"(CNN) -- The federal government's oil spill response director says testing has revealed that there is a ""detected seep a distance from the well"" and has ordered BP to quickly notify the government if other leaks are found. ""When seeps are detected, you are directed to marshal resources, quickly investigate, and report findings to the government in no more than four hours,"" retired Adm. Thad Allen said in a letter to BP Chief Managing Director Bob Dudley. ""I direct you to provide me a written procedure for opening the choke valve as quickly as possible without damaging the well should hydrocarbon seepage near the well head be confirmed."" BP spokesman Mark Salt said Sunday night that he had no information about the leak mentioned in Allen's letter. The letter does not provide further details about where the leak was spotted or how big it is. It was unclear from Allen's letter, released Sunday evening, whether testing on the well had been extended. It was scheduled to last at least until 4 p.m. Sunday. Earlier in the day Allen said officials could decide to extend it in 24-hour increments. ""We've not been told it's stopping,"" Salt said. In his letter Sunday, Allen asked BP to provide its ""latest containment plan and schedule in the event that the Well Integrity Test is suspended"" within 24 hours and said the company should be prepared to discuss its efforts to detect leaks during a regular conference call between BP and government scientists that was scheduled for 9 p.m. ET. Earlier Sunday BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles said a variety of tests showed oil and gas were not escaping from the well, noting that the recently recapped oil well in the Gulf of Mexico could remain closed until the relief well is drilled if tests remained favorable. ""No one associated with this whole activity wants to see any more oil flow into the Gulf of Mexico,"" Suttles told reporters Sunday morning. ""We will continue integrity tests all the way until we get the well killed. There is no target to return the well to flow."" Allen said earlier Sunday that testing would determine whether keeping the well capped was the right solution. Pressure testing results in the well have been lower than expected, he said, which means oil could be leaking out from below. ""While we are pleased that no oil is currently being released into the Gulf of Mexico and want to take all appropriate action to keep it that way, it is important that all decisions are driven by the science,"" he said. ""Ultimately, we must insure no irreversible damage is done which could cause uncontrolled leakage from numerous points on the sea floor."" Rep. Ed Markey, who has been a vocal critic of BP's response to the gusher, said Sunday that the company could have another motivation for wanting to keep the well capped. ""If the well remains fully shut in until the relief well is completed, we may never have a fully accurate determination of the flow rate from this well. If so, BP -- which has consistently underestimated the flow rate -- might evade billions of dollars of fines,"" Markey said in a letter to Allen released Sunday. Using ships on the surface to collect 100 percent of the gushing oil would allow scientists to calculate the flow rate -- a figure that the government would use to determine how much to fine BP, Markey said. On Saturday, Allen said that once testing is eventually stopped ""we will immediately return to containment, using the new, tighter sealing cap with both the [vessels] Helix Producer and the Q4000."" BP is conducting regular seismic runs, monitoring sonar, visual and acoustic activity and the data has been ""encouraging,"" showing no problems. However if tests show problems, BP officials said they are prepared to remove the tightly fitting containment cap and reassess. ""We're just taking this day by day,"" Suttles said Sunday. ""Nobody wants to see any more oil go into the gulf, but clearly we have to make sure we don't make the situation worse."" No oil has gushed out since Thursday when BP closed all the valves in a new custom-made cap that was lowered into place earlier in the week. The undersea video images of a quiet ocean inspired cautious optimism in the hearts of Gulf . Coast residents devastated by three months of disaster. Meanwhile, BP has restarted work on drilling two relief wells. Wells said that the first relief well is now about five feet away from the ruptured Macondo well and an intersection could occur by the end of July. BP then plans to pump mud and cement down to kill the ruptured well. Leaving the well capped Sunday past the 24 hours of testing is a new development. On Saturday, it was expected the testing would extend only into Sunday afternoon. Engineers and scientists have intensified monitoring of the well, pouring over images and data collected by robots, sonar scans and seismic and acoustic examinations. A government ship is in the area, fitted with equipment for detecting methane gas, which would be an indication of a leak. The well integrity test began Thursday after two days of delays, first as government scientists scrutinized testing procedures and then as BP replaced a leaking piece of equipment known as a choke line. Since there's less oil on the surface, BP officials said Sunday that the nearly 50 skimmers deployed at the well site collected nearly half the amount they had the day before. They only conducted one controlled burn, and Suttles said there have been numerous days in a row with no new shoreline impacts. In the coming weeks, BP also plans to bring in two more oil collection ships in addition to the two already in the Gulf, bringing containment capacity to 80,000 barrels (about 3.4 million gallons) of oil a day, more than high-end estimates of how much oil had been leaking.","NEW: Allen says a leak was detected ""a distance from the well""

"Washington (CNN) -- -- The head of the company that operates the Trans-Alaska Pipeline announced his retirement Wednesday after criticism by a congressional committee and the internal watchdog unit of majority owner BP. Kevin Hostler will step down as CEO of Alyeska, the BP-dominated consortium that operates the 800-mile pipeline, on September 30, the company announced. ""Retiring at the end of September is good for the pipeline, and it allows enough time for a proper transition,"" Hostler said. ""Our executive team and other Alyeska leaders have worked toward developing leadership skills so that any transition in the organization is seamless."" The company said Hostler had previously discussed plans to retire by the end of the year. But a senior federal government source and another source with knowledge of the matter described his departure as a resignation, while the chairman of a congressional investigative subcommittee described Hostler's move as ""early retirement."" ""In our committee staff's meeting with Mr. Hostler last week, we expressed serious concerns about a recent internal report showing significant issues with the management culture at Alyeska,"" Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, said in a statement following the news. ""That report found widespread dissatisfaction among employees of Alyeska regarding decisions made by management and the management style within the company. Mr. Hostler's early retirement does not come as a surprise, and I wish him the best in his retirement."" Stupak said the report found ""significant issues"" regarding safety and morale among workers on the pipeline, which stretches from Alaska's North Slope to the southern port of Valdez. He called on BP and the four other companies involved in Alyeska to take those findings ""very seriously"" and replace Hostler with ""someone with the character and management style to move the company forward."" Stupak leads the investigative subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The panel has been examining allegations by several pipeline managers that stringent cost-cutting measures have put the integrity of the pipeline at risk, government sources told CNN's Special Investigations Unit. And some BP managers have criticized Hostler's cost-cutting efforts, alleging they have resulted in a large backlog of deferred work projects on the pipeline, sources at BP's internal watchdog agency said. In addition, Hostler moved more than two dozen BP managers from Fairbanks, which is more convenient to pipeline operations, to offices in Anchorage. A source at BP's Ombudsman Unit says that move alone was expected to save Alyeska about $4 million in real estate costs in Fairbanks. Hostler has ""been under a lot of scrutiny,"" said one source. Hostler spent 27 years with BP prior to being named CEO of the pipeline, most recently as the company's senior vice president of global human resources. He became Alyeska's CEO in 2005, and the company said its injury rate has gone down and its safety performance has gone up on his watch. BP owns 80 percent of the pipeline. The company has been under fire since one of its deepwater wells in the Gulf of Mexico exploded and sank in April, uncapping a gusher a mile underwater that has become the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The disaster has put new scrutiny on the company's safety and environmental record, which includes a 2006 Alaska pipeline spill that dumped 200,000 gallons of crude onto the tundra. Federal investigators found the company ignored warning signs before the spill, the largest ever on the North Slope. The company pleaded guilty in 2007 to one count of criminally negligent discharge of oil, a misdemeanor, and paid $20 million in penalties and restitution. The Justice Department also filed a civil complaint in 2009 that accused the company of violating clean air and water laws in Alaska.","NEW: Pipeline company says CEO is retiring in September .

"(WIRED)  -- Along with the figure skating, ice hockey and snowboarding, another event will compete for attention at the Winter Olympics in Canada this month. A Canadian company has created what it calls the ""largest thought-controlled computing installation."" It's an experiment that lets visitors to the Olympics use their brainwaves to control the lights at three major landmarks in Canada, including Niagara Falls. ""When people put on the headsets and find themselves increasing the brightness of the lights by just thinking about it, you can almost see their brains explode,"" says Trevor Coleman, chief operating officer for InteraXon, the company that has created this installation. As consumers get more comfortable with going beyond the keyboard and the mouse to interact with their computers, companies are looking for alternate ways to make the experience better. Already, touch and voice recognition have become a major part of the user interface in smartphones, and harnessing brainwaves or other biological data is slowly emerging as a third option, especially in gaming. Companies such as NeuroSky offer headphones that promise to translate the gamer's brainwaves into action on screen. A biometrics company called Innerscope is helping Wired host a geeked-out Super Bowl party. And even Microsoft is working on alternate forms of input; its Project Natal promises to add gesture recognition to Xbox 360 games later this year. InteraXon's installation is spread across three sites: Toronto's CN Tower, Ottawa's Parliament Buildings and Niagara Falls. All three locations have two chairs set up, each with its own headset. The headsets have an external probe that touches the wearer's forehead to measure the baseline brain activity. The chairs are rigged to offer tactile feedback as users enter the desired brain state. The headset measures the brain's electrical output and reacts to alpha waves, associated with relaxation, and beta waves, which indicate concentration. As users relax or focus their thoughts, the computer sends a message to the site they are viewing. InteraXon's software translates users' thoughts to commands that will change the lighting display. For instance, by concentrating, users can make the lights at the CN Tower spin faster or change the brightness of the lights at Niagara Falls. It's easy enough once users get started, says Coleman. ""To achieve the beta state we ask users to focus on things like an object ahead and its details, while for an alpha response we ask them to take a deep breath and relax to let their mind go,"" he says. ""But after a minute or two of trying it, we found most users no longer require the physical cues,"" says Coleman. Over the two weeks that the exhibit will be open, InteraXon expects more than 2,000 visitors to try it out. Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

"(CNN) -- Elected with the largest margin of victory in the history of Taiwan's presidential elections, President Ma Ying-jeou is aiming to bring the good times back to Taiwan while looking to a friendlier future with China. Smiling through it: President Ma Ying-jeou has some tough challenges ahead. Winning 58 percent of the vote, Ma was swept to victory on the promise of economic growth but through the more controversial method of building closer ties with China. With the backdrop of economic depression Ma's calls to reinvigorate the economy by freer trade and improved relations with China proved stronger than the fears that those ties could lead to a loss in independence. Nevertheless, with a message of rapprochement, the charismatic former mayor of Taipei has a tough job on his hands in his first presidency. Born in Hong Kong in 1950, Ma studied at Harvard Law School and worked as a lawyer in New York in 1981 before returning Taiwan. He held a number of posts in government ministries from 1988, including Minister for Justice for three years from 1993. However, it was not until he was elected mayor of Taipei in 1998 that he emerged as a potential future president, and he was elected as chairman of the Kuomintang, Taiwan's Nationalist party, in July 2005. Yet having built up a solid reputation in Taiwan's notoriously volatile political culture, his image was tarnished by allegations of corruption while mayor of Taipei in 2006. It was alleged that he had misappropriated around $340,000, and after resigning his position as head of the Kuomintang to fight the charges, he was finally cleared of all allegations in 2007. With a clear mandate and popular support he occupies a unique position in Asian politics; TIME Magazine has said he is in the rare position of being a politician who has the ""opportunity to shape the destiny not only of their own nation but also of an entire region."" Moving swiftly to build stronger links, the first regular direct flights for nearly 60 years between China and Taipei resumed on July 4. Ma's administration hopes that Chinese tourists from the mainland will boost the sluggish tourism industry and talks are already underway to increase the number of weekly flights. In a further signal of détente, Guangdong province in China has offered the Taiwanese port city of Kaohsiung two white tigers as a symbol of improved relations. Allaying fears, breaking down generations of mistrust and making Taiwan's economy roar again will be the considerable challenges of Ma's administration; the former barrister will have to use all his negotiating skills to try and fulfill his ambitions.","Taiwan's premier, Ma Ying-jeou, elected by biggest margin in history .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Few sports can compare to football in terms of its global popularity and the area of land devoted to its playing fields across the planet; consequently, few sports have a larger carbon footprint than the ""beautiful game."" Artificial pitches can save 20,000 liters of water a day. Football stadiums have a huge environmental impact. Just keeping a pitch in top condition requires regular watering, under-pitch heating to prevent freezing in the winter, and even the use of high-power lighting rigs to promote grass growth. Floodlights, scoreboards and video screens have large electricity demands, while thousands of fans traveling to and from the match emit vast quantities of carbon dioxide while generating huge amounts of garbage. But there are signs that football teams are starting to get wise to environmental issues with clubs around the world starting to make efforts to become more eco-friendly. A 2008 survey by ""Ethical Consumer"" looked at the eco-credentials of clubs in the English Premier League and found that Manchester City was the greenest. Among its achievements, the team says it has reduced landfill by 85 percent, moved to electric vehicles at the ground, and used eco-friendly paper for match-day programs. By promoting safe walking routes, the club says it has managed to get 71 percent of its fans to walk to the stadium. The club even came up with an ambitious plan to generate its own electricity by installing a wind turbine at the stadium, but the scheme was eventually put on hold because of fears that ice could fall from the turbine blades and injure spectators. Funded by the oil wealth of the Abu Dhabi United Group, Manchester City have the cash to introduce far-reaching green schemes, but at the other end of the financial spectrum, English non-league club Dartford FC has shown the big teams aren't the only ones that can afford to be eco-friendly. Dartford's Princes Park stadium, opened in 2006, has a capacity of just over 4,000, but it manages to incorporate some neat features. The stadium is covered with a ""living roof"" of plants that provide a natural air filtration system, gray water is supplied from two huge ponds near the stadium and solar panels are used to heat water for the toilets. Dartford's efforts show that it's possible for small clubs to do their bit, but their use of solar panels pales in comparison to the Stade de Suisse Wankdorf in Berne, Switzerland. Home of BSC Young Boys football team, the Stade de Suisse won the 2005 European Solar Prize for its use of photovoltaic panels installed in its roof. The stadium roof now has more than 10,000 solar panels. Under peak sunlight conditions the panels can produce one million kWh of energy a year, saving 630 tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. A simpler way for football teams to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is simply to cut down on waste. Last year, Norway's most successful team, Rosenborg BK, invested around $40,000 in energy-saving measures. It is not a huge investment, but it is enough to make a difference, and the club say the scheme will pay for itself by reducing energy expenditure. Arne Melan, a member of the club's technical staff, told CNN that Rosenborg have introduced a number of energy-efficiency measures, including a computer system that ensures their automated floodlights are turned off when no one is training and that controls their heating and ventilation systems so that they are only on during office hours. Melan says another aspect of the club's green ethos is sponsoring a scheme to provide the city of Trondheim with hot water produced by processing municipal waste. When it comes to waste, it is the seemingly innocuous football pitch that is the worst offender. ""Ethical Consumer"" estimates that it takes an astonishing 20,000 liters of water per day to maintain a football pitch in the English Premier League, and at Camp Nou, home of Champions League winners Barcelona, up to 54,000 liters of water are needed to irrigate the pitch on a hot day. But some teams are starting to reduce water consumption. German club Nuremberg has a cistern that can hold 1,000 cubic meters of water at its home ground. The cistern stores rainwater that can be used to irrigate the pitch, but compared to most clubs' water consumption, it is just a drop in the ocean. In countries with drier climates even more water is needed to irrigate football pitches, but in these countries water is often too scarce to be used to maintain a lush playing surface. FIFA is helping address this problem with its ""Win in Africa, With Africa"" initiative. Among its aims is a plan to build an international-standard artificial pitch in every African country outside of South Africa. Football will probably have to wait until the next generation of stadiums are built for features like solar panels, wind turbines and rainwater cisterns to become commonplace. Perhaps then the pitch won't be the greenest thing in football.","Football is played all over the planet, meaning it has a huge carbon footprint .

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States will not return North Korea to its list of state sponsors of terrorism despite its alleged role in the sinking of a South Korea naval ship in contested waters off the peninsula's coast. ""In our view, it was a provocative action but one taken by the military or the state against the military of another state,"" U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Philip Crowley said Monday in his explanation of why the sinking didn't constitute an act of international terrorism. When asked if the sinking was an ""act of war,"" Crowley called it a ""violation of the existing armistice between North and South,"" adding the United States continuously evaluates information that may affect the status of nations on the terror list. Crowley's remarks came ahead of Tuesday's scheduled meetings between Wi Sung-lac, South Korea's representative to six-party nuclear talks with North Korea, and State Department officials. North Korea last year cut off the talks involving the United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia over international criticism of its nuclear and missile tests. Why are the two Koreas so hostile? North Korea has vehemently denied charges it fired a torpedo that sank the navy ship Cheonan and has accused the United States of ""persistently antagonizing"" it. In a final statement issued Saturday, Group of Eight leaders condemned North Korea's government for its alleged role in the March 26 sinking of the Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors, and expressed grave concerns over its nuclear ambitions. The G8 nations include United States, Canada, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Japan and Russia. Two weeks ago, U.N. Security Council President Claude Heller said the U.N. body was ""gravely concerned"" about tensions between the Koreas after the ship sinking. Friday marked the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty.","North Korea won't make terror list for alleged sinking of South Korean naval ship .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama met Wednesday with Haitian President Rene Preval to discuss relief, recovery and reconstruction efforts in Haiti. The two leaders pledged to continue working for a more coordinated, sustained global relief effort to help Haiti recover from a massive 7.0-magnitude earthquake that struck January 12. Much of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, was destroyed, and more than 217,000 people were killed, according to the latest figures from international relief organizations. The situation on the ground in Haiti ""remains dire,"" Obama said at the White House. A continuing desperate need for food, medicine and shelter will be exacerbated by the onset of Haiti's spring rain season, he said.

"(CNN) -- Tropical Storm Ester continued to intensify after sweeping across the Philippines over the weekend, leaving at least one person dead and 15 others missing, authorities said. A 17-member crew on board a freighter was hit by the storm -- also known as Typhoon Dianmu -- and 14 of the members were still missing Monday, according to the Phillippines National Disaster Coordinating Council. Three of the 17 were located -- one dead, and two others alive. A 13-year-old boy was also reported missing after being swept away by a strong current while swimming in the Santa Clara River, the disaster council said. More than 200 families from a community in the northern province of Bulacan were evacuated Sunday, and nearly 150 of them were still housed in shelters Monday, the council said. The storm was expected to strengthen as it headed to China and complicate the response to flooding cause by heavy rains in recent weeks, according to the country's national meteorological agency. Ester was expected to approach the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday before making it's way to northeast China, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the meteorological agency.","Ester grows in strength after hitting the Philippines .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich playmaker Franck Ribery will miss the Champions League final against Inter Milan this month after failing in his appeal against suspension on Wednesday. The France international was handed a three-match ban by European football's governing body UEFA for his sending-off in the first leg of the semifinal against Lyon last month. He was initially given an automatic one-game suspension for the straight red card, which came for a challenge on the French club's Argentine forward Lisandro Lopez in Munich on April 21. That was extended by another two games by UEFA's control and disciplinary panel on April 28, meaning the 27-year-old had to miss the final as well as the second leg, plus the first Champions League match of next season. Ribery's German employers announced after Wednesday's announcement in Nyon, Switzerland, that they would take the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the UK Press Association reported. PA said Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge had told reporters outside UEFA headquarters that the club would go to CAS in order to have Ribery available for the final in Madrid on May 22. ""Franck Ribery, as well as our in-house counsel Dr Gerlinger, have in my view put an impressive case to the court that we are not dealing with violent conduct but merely a foul,"" Rummenigge said in a statement. ""The committee rated this case as a borderline case. Nevertheless the three-person committee unfortunately did not follow FC Bayern's plea. We are very disappointed by this judgment and still cannot comprehend that this foul was judged as violent conduct. ""We told UEFA immediately after the verdict that we will also appeal against this judgment. We will continue to fight for justice so that Franck Ribery, despite the confirmation of the ban, can still play in the Champions League final."" Coach Louis Van Gaal's Bayern players are seeking to win three trophies this season, leading the domestic Bundesliga title race by three points going into Saturday's final match at bottom club Hertha Berlin and having also qualified for the German Cup final.","European football's governing body UEFA dismisses Franck Ribery's appeal .

"Jarkarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian police have arrested pop star Nazril ""Ariel"" Ilham for his involvement in sex videos that allegedly feature himself and two other top Indonesian celebrities. The singer was named a suspect after the police questioned the three celebrities and expert witnesses over the last two weeks. ""We have determine that Ariel is a suspect in the sex video case, we charged him with the pornography law and with the 2008 electronic information and transaction law,"" said Marwoto Sutowijoyo, from national police public information. Ariel will be the first high-profile offender of the controversial pornography law that carries a maximum penalty of 12 years. ""We will keep investigating the case and we will arrest the perpetrators once we have enough evidence,"" Marwoto added. Alleged celebrity sex tape shocks modest Indonesia . The law and the incident has also revived the government's nationwide censorship plan to filter offensive content on the internet. ""The Ministry of Communication have long been proposing a decree on multimedia content, this is to prevent this kind of things from happening,"" said Gatot Dewa Broto, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Communications. If passed, the ministry will create a special unit that will monitor the content in online media and will have the authority to censor anything without consulting any other bodies, he explains. The first video, allegedly featuring Ariel and his current girlfriend Luna Maya, surfaced on several websites and went viral through social networking sites Facebook and Twitter. On Tuesday, after the release of the second video allegedly featuring Ariel and Tari, the term ""Ariel Peterporn,"" a spin on the singer's name and his band, became a top trending topic on Twitter. The videos have sparked protests by conservative Islamic groups and others around the country condemning the celebrities in recent weeks. Meanwhile, raids on internet cafes and the search of student cellphones at schools -- both confirmed by police -- have raised fears among defenders of free speech.","Indonesian pop star arrested for sex tape .

"(CNN) -- In a move that is antagonizing North Korea and irking China, South Korea commenced a major naval exercise in the Yellow Sea Thursday, the largest since 46 South Korean sailors died in March in the sinking of a warship. The five-day exercise involves some 4,500 personnel and all four branches of the military, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. Seoul, which oversaw an international investigation into the March sinking of the Cheonan, claims a North Korean submarine sank the corvette and is demanding an apology. A multinational investigation also found North Korea responsible. Pyongyang has vehemently denied the accusation. Prior to the Cheonan's sinking, the South Korean navy had largely discounted the threat of submarines in the Yellow Sea, due to the shallow waters in the area. North Korea said via state media that it would undertake ""strong physical retaliation"" and warned fishermen to stay clear of the Northern Limit Line, the disputed maritime border between the Koreas. The drills amount to an ""undisguised military intrusion,"" Pyongyang has said. ""The army and people of the DPRK are closely watching every move of [South Korean President] Lee Myung-bak's group of traitors. And if the puppet warmongers dare ignite a war, they will mercilessly destroy the provokers and their stronghold by mobilizing most powerful war tactics and offensive means beyond imagination,"" the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said, according to North Korea's state-run news agency KCNA. ""Raising issue with the legitimate, defensive exercise is a provocation in itself,"" South Korean Rear Adm. Kim Kyung-sik retorted Wednesday, speaking to local reporters. Meanwhile, China, which has refused to condemn North Korea over the alleged torpedo attack and which remains Pyongyang's closest strategic ally, is reportedly carrying out air defense drills on its Yellow Sea coast across from the Korean peninsula. Given North Korea's decrepit military, experts say the chances of a naval attack on well-prepared South Korean forces are small. ""The North Koreans have to rely on asymmetric capabilities,"" said Dan Pinkston, who heads the international Crisis Group's Seoul offices. ""In a straight-up fight they are not that capable."" Deadly North Korean strikes in past years -- a commando raid on the South Korean presidential mansion in 1968; terrorist bombings in 1983 and 1987; and naval clashes in 1999 and 2002 -- all used the element of surprise, an element that would be difficult to spring on the large, alert force South Korea is fielding for the maneuvers. If North Korea retaliates, it will likely be with a weapons test rather than a direct confrontation, said one expert. ""They do not do eye-for-eye, tit-for-tat responses,"" said Choi Jin-wook of the Korea Institute of National Unification. ""Shooting a missile or testing a weapon or some kind of diplomatic action are possible, but I don't think there will be a military reaction."" The exercise does not include any U.S. assets, leading some commentators to wonder whether Washington is wary of angering Beijing in the Yellow Sea. South Korean and U.S. forces conducted exercises together in the Sea of Japan last month. Those exercises included an anti-sub infiltration component -- intended to thwart a submarine attack on a ship. If the joint exercises continue, such a move could be part of a gradual build-up of American pressure on China. ""The U.S. is slowly containing China in other places, and they could exercise in the East Sea in the future,"" said the Korea Institute of National Unification's Choi. ""I think the U.S. is very deliberately pressuring China."" The warship sinking has heightened tensions between the two neighbors who fought a war from 1950 to 1953. The war ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty, meaning the two nations are still technically at war. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea. CNN's Andrew Salmon contributed to this report.","NEW: Experts say the chances of a North Korean naval attack are slim .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Dozens of police officers were involved in a gunbattle with rebel Maoists in the rain-drenched forests of eastern India Wednesday, police reported. Security forces had been tracking the insurgents when a shootout erupted in Chhattisgarh state's Dantewada region, police spokesman Rajesh Mishra told CNN. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but reinforcements were rushed to the scene, Mishra added. India regards Maoist rebels as its gravest internal security threat. Until June this year, authorities blamed 1,103 violent attacks in the country on left-wing extremists. More than 200 officers and 97 rebels were killed during that period, federal home minister P. Chidambaram said last month. Police have also arrested at least 1,341 suspected Maoists. ""These figures underscore the gravity of the challenge posed by left-wing extremism,"" Chidambaram said. In April, more than 70 officers were killed in Dantewada in an ambush -- one of the deadliest attacks on Indian security forces by suspected guerrillas. Officials say Maoists aim to seize political power through what they call a protracted people's war. On their part, the insurgents have claimed since the 1960s to be fighting for the dispossessed. Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh conceded last year that the nation's fight with the rebels had fallen short of objectives. Maoists enjoy support not only in the poorest areas and in tribal communities but also among youth and the intelligentsia, officials suspect. ""We have not achieved as much success as we would have liked in containing this menace,"" Singh said last September. In addition to targeting police, alleged police informers and people they call ""class enemies,"" the rebels are also believed to be attacking infrastructure such as roads, bridges, railways, and power and telecommunication networks. India says it has adopted a two-pronged strategy -- involving development and police action in Maoist strongholds -- to deal with the problem. Yet, Chidambaram in his statement in July this year accepted the planning has delivered mixed results. While forces stopped many attacks and apprehended key Maoist leaders, the guerrillas too have been successful in carrying out serious assaults in several instances, he noted.","Fight is in the same area were dozens of police were killed in April .

But more than 300 people could be dead as rescuers have struggled to locate many who were missing in remote mountainous areas of southern Taiwan. Ma said he will evaluate the rescue process and may punish some government officials by early September. Ma apologized last week for the rescue effort as he traveled around the typhoon-battered island. He said heavy rain grounded rescue helicopters in the first few days after the storm hit, delaying relief efforts.

"(CNN) -- David Bill isn't annoyed when Twitter gets so bogged down with traffic that he can't post a message. Twitter's ""fail whale,"" which appears when the site is overrun, is so popular it's on T-shirts and even tattoos. That's because in the moment when frustration would hit, he's greeted on the popular Web site by a cartoonish image he loves: a giant whale being lifted out of an ocean by a small flock of tweeting birds. The icon -- which Twitter users call it the ""fail whale"" because the creature appears only when the site has failed to load -- has gained a cult following as the social media site grows at breakneck pace. The conversational Web site, which lets users post 140-character microblogs, saw a 1,374 percent jump in unique visitors between February 2008 and February this year, up to 7 million from only 475,000, according to Nielsen NetView. By comparison, Facebook grew 228 percent, to 65.7 million users, during the same period. With all of those new Twitterers, fail whale sightings and site crashes seem more frequent. Bill (mr_bill on Twitter) and other fail-whale followers aren't bothered, though. The 36-year-old San Franciscan has organized parties in honor of the whale. The most recent, held in California in February, was attended by more than 300 people, including Yiying Lu, the artist in Australia who created the image. Bill says the whale represents a contrarian philosophy. ""It's sort of an adorable whale but also this thing that represents the Herculean tasks that we sometimes go about from day to day,"" he said. ""We're all trying to do a lot of things that seem pretty impossible,"" Bill said. ""It's nice to identify something positive with those failures."" Not every Twitterer is sympathetic to the site's troubles, though. Some users say Twitter has outgrown its core audience and is irrelevant to the technophiles who made it popular in the first place. Others are annoyed by the flood of spammers and profiteers who now use the site's popularity to make a buck. Celebrities and members of Congress have been jumping onto the site in recent months, adding to the site's mainstream popularity and, some users say, causing glitches in the system. ""I keep getting the fail whale. Twitter got too popular too quickly. I blame Shaq,"" wrote Jessica Roy, a 21-year-old New York University student who goes by suchamessica on Twitter. Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, or THE_REAL_SHAQ, has more than 470,000 followers on the site. Nova Spivack, a blogger whose article ""Can Twitter Survive What is About to Happen to It?"" has been passed around the site, said a rift is developing between Twitter's original ""in crowd"" and its newer, more mainstream users. Early adopters find many of the new users annoying, he said. ""A lot of people come in, and they take that 'What are you doing?' question literally, and so they put very inane things on Twitter,"" he said. iReport.com: How do you feel about tweets and status updates? The site used to feel ""insulated"" from the mainstream, and now it doesn't, he said. But for all the complaints, there seem to be just as many people who are almost excited about Twitter's growing pains. It is inevitable that a Web site seeing Twitter-style growth would face some glitches and a backlash from early adopters, said Laura Fitton, a consultant and co-author of the book ""Twitter for Dummies."" ""There's going to be all kinds of people using it all kinds of different ways,"" she said. ""The purists can go pound rocks."" Major news such as the Mumbai terrorist attacks and the Hudson River plane landing has broken over Twitter, and that's added to the site's popularity, she said. Amy Gahran, who writes on social media at contentious.com, said the backlash against Twitter stems from the fact that people are uncomfortable with change. Early users see new people coming to the site, and that creeps them out, but it shouldn't, she said. ""Change is freaking good,"" she said. ""Roll with it."" As the site gets filled with fresh users, people are creating pieces of software to help Twitterers sort through the noise, Gahran said. She said Twitter is popular because it mimics real-life conversation and because it's easy to use. She also expects Twitter to expand, especially as people in developing countries use cell-phone text messages to communicate through the site. ""People talk. That's what we do,"" she said. ""We're social creatures. We're kind of wired for this."" Twitter says it is addressing breakdowns in that wired communication. ""We have made amazing progress from a technical perspective as far as accommodating this rapid growth goes and will continue to improve system and subsystem performance moving forward,"" Twitter co-founder Biz Stone wrote in a statement to CNN. Critter Gewlas of Cary, North Carolina, believes so much in the site's ability to overcome adversity that he recently got a tattoo of the fail whale on his leg. ""The site itself has suffered a few scrapes and bumps along the way, but for the most part, I definitely think it's a good thing,"" said the 36-year-old. The fail whale's account on Twitter has more than 2,265 followers. A Facebook group dedicated to the whale has more than 4,400 members. The whale has spawned art and merchandise, from coffee mugs to baby clothes. A Current.com parody of the whale has spun around the Internet, too. Bill, whose fail whale parties have featured an aquamarine martini in honor of the icon's color, said the whale's popularity comes from the idea that failures are worth celebrating and learning from. Twitter will use that philosophy to continue to grow, he said. ""Twitter is a powerful enough thing that it should succeed in a broad way, and I would like it to succeed in a broad way,"" he said.","Twitter saw growth of more than 1,300 percent in the year up to February .

"London, England (CNN) -- Britain's financial regulator said Wednesday it has banned an oil trader after he made huge trades while drunk last year, causing global prices of Brent crude to jump to abnormally high levels. Steven Noel Perkins, a former oil futures broker in the London office of PVM Oil Futures, was also fined £72,000 ($108,400) for market abuse, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) said. He is now banned from working in the financial services industry on the grounds that he is ""not a fit and proper person,"" the FSA said. Perkins' job was to trade orders on an execution-only basis in Brent crude futures contracts on the ICE Futures Europe (ICE) exchange for his firm's clients, the FSA said. Early in the morning of Tuesday, June 30, 2009, Perkins traded on the ICE without any client authorization. He traded an extremely high volume and thus accumulated a long outright position on Brent. The price of Brent increased significantly as a direct result of his trades, the FSA said. His trading pushed the price up to $73.50 a barrel, the highest level it had hit so far that year, according to Reuters. The FSA said the trading seems to have been a result of ""extremely heavy drinking"" resulting from Perkins' alcoholism, which he now acknowledges. He had drunk ""excessively"" over the weekend of June 27-28 and throughout the following Monday before making the trades, the FSA said. ""The FSA views market manipulation extremely seriously,"" said Alexander Justham, director of markets at the FSA. ""Perkins' trading caused disruption to the market and has been met with both a fine and prohibition. This reinforces the fact that a severe sanction will apply in cases of market manipulation, even where no profit is made. ""Perkins' drunkenness does not excuse his market abuse. Perkins has been banned because he is not a fit and proper person to be involved in regulated activities and his behavior posed a risk to the proper functioning of the market."" In sanctioning Perkins, the FSA said it also took into account the fact that Perkins initially lied repeatedly to his employer to try to cover up his unauthorized trading. Perkins joined a rehabilitation program for alcoholics immediately after the incident and has now stopped drinking, the FSA said. ""The FSA considers that it is possible that Perkins may be rehabilitated over time and may be fit and proper again in the future,"" it said in a statement. ""The ban has therefore been limited to a minimum term of 5 years."" The penalty for Perkins' behavior merits a fine of £150,000 ($225,900), but the FSA said it reduced that to £90,000 ($135,500) because the higher figure would cause him serious financial hardship. Because Perkins agreed to settle the case, the fine was reduced by a further 20 percent, the FSA said.","Steven Noel Perkins traded Brent crude futures contracts without client authorization .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Wednesday it is changing its ways after an audit showed that the agency was losing guns and laptops, often through carelessness. ATF Director Michael Sullivan says the agency is revising its procedures on lost weapons and laptops. According to a Justice Department audit released Wednesday, the inspector general reported the ATF was unable to account for 76 weapons and 418 laptops over the past five years. The report said the rate of loss had tripled since the last audit was conducted by the ATF's then-parent agency, the Treasury Department. ""It is especially troubling that ATF's rate of loss for weapons was nearly double that of the FBI and DEA,"" the report said. ATF Director Michael Sullivan said he agreed with most of the report's findings. ""We are revising our procedures of reporting losses of weapons or laptops,"" Sullivan said. Of the 76 missing weapons, 35 were stolen from agents' homes, hotel rooms or vehicles, the report said.  Some of the others were left in public places or lost in shipping -- or their losses were still unexplained. Two of the stolen guns were used to commit crimes, the report said.  One was used to shoot through the window of a residence, and the other was recovered from suspects arrested on burglary charges. The inspector general determined that 53 percent of the weapon losses were the result of employees' carelessness or failure to follow ATF policies. Of the 418 laptops, 50 were reported stolen. The report said that in most cases, it was not clear whether the missing laptops contained sensitive or classified information.  Seven did; 13 did not. ""ATF could not provide adequate information"" about the contents of the other 398, the report said, and therefore, ""ATF could not assess what damage these losses could have had on ATF's operations or national security."" Few, if any, of the missing laptops had the data encrypted, according to the report. The ATF has nearly 5,000 agents, more than 7,500 laptops and more than 22,000 weapons, the report said. CNN's Terry Frieden contributed to this report.","Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives lost 76 weapons, report says .

"CISHAN, Taiwan (CNN) -- Taiwan's leader Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday he accepts responsibility for the government's slow response after Typhoon Morakot slammed into the island killing at more than 120 people and unleashing floods, mudslides and misery. Mourners kneel and pray to the dead as they face the devastated valley of Shiao Lin. Ma, who has faced heavy criticism from victims of the disaster, ruled out resignation, insisting his government did its best in the face of difficulties, however he pledged an investigation into any irregularities. ""Certainly, I will take full responsibility whatever the blame is because, after all, I am the president of this country,"" Ma told CNN, saying heavy rains grounded rescue helicopters in the first few days after the storm hit, delaying relief. ""Once the weather was good -- that is the 14th of August -- we were able to evacuate 2,518 people. It's a record,"" he said. Hundreds of people still await rescue in remote areas of Taiwan, where torrential downpours, dense fog, rugged terrain and raging rivers have hampered relief efforts. Washed-out roads and collapsed bridges have made some rescue operations impossible . Touring disaster areas, Ma has been confronted by angry survivors, and even provoked a scuffle when he opened a weekend baseball game as protesters demanded he step down.

Before it roared on to mainland China on Sunday, the storm killed at least 123 people in Taiwan. The death toll could climb to more than 300 after more villagers buried by mudslides and floodwaters are found, Taiwan officials have said. Southern and central Taiwan were hardest hit by the storm. Mudslides inundated some places in the south, including the village of Shiao Lin, where 160 homes were lost. Authorities believe hundreds of people could be trapped under five stories of mud in the village. International aid efforts were mobilizing on Sunday, however these were complicated by diplomatic pitfalls in the face of China's territorial claims over Taiwan, which it considers a renegade province awaiting reunification. The U.S. military has begun a ""modest"" humanitarian aid mission to Taiwan with the dispatch of a Marine Corps C-130 cargo plane carrying plastic tarpaulins for shelter, U.S. defense officials said. Also Sunday, the USS Denver was en route to the Taiwanese coast with additional humanitarian aid and water purification capabilities, the officials said. The Navy ship is expected to arrive Monday, but officials could not say when it will launch its heavy-lift helicopters to drop the aid. Sources in Washington have said in providing aid to Taiwan, the United States must be sensitive to its territorial relationship with China.

"(CNN) -- South African animal welfare inspectors say they seized an exotic snake that a traditional healer was using to try to influence World Cup matches. Investigators found the 9-foot, female Burmese python in ""dire condition"" last week in a shack where the healer had set up shop in Cape Town, said Sarah Scarth, a spokeswoman for the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""He'd been ostensibly taking money, and apparently using (the snake) as a medium to speak to the ancestors and appeal to them,"" she told CNN Tuesday. Local authorities tipped off the SPCA, Scarth said. The python was suffering from pneumonia, mouth rot and dehydration when inspectors found him. ""It had no access to any food or water,"" she said. The snake's condition has improved under a veterinarian's care, she said. She said the SPCA would not be pursuing animal cruelty charges in the case because the sangoma, or healer, signed over ownership of the snake to the SPCA after meeting with officials. Last week's seizure was not the first animal-related incident during the World Cup, Scarth said. In one of the early games, security officials confiscated a rooster that a French fan had brought into the stadium, she said.","Animal welfare organization says 9-foot Burmese python was in ""dire condition""

"(CNN) -- Ten years after 113 people died when a Concorde jet crashed into a hotel outside Paris, local officials say the country's government has not done enough to protect people living near the airport. ""Seventy-five percent of air accidents have happened in taking off or landing in densely populated areas,"" Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy said in a statement. The town of Gonesse, located north of Paris, was scheduled to hold a memorial service Sunday to honor the 113 victims who died when the Concorde jet crashed there on July 25, 2000. A court is expected to rule in a manslaughter case related to the crash in December, a statement from Gonesse's government said.

"(CNN) -- With nearly 86,000 people evacuated from fire-ravaged regions, Russian authorities said Sunday that firefighters were gaining control over blazes sweeping across thousands of acres in western Russia. ""Despite complicated weather conditions, the situation is under control thanks to preventive measures and efforts taken by the Russian Emergencies Ministry,"" a spokesman for the ministry told the Itar-Tass news agency. At least 28 people have been killed and thousands left homeless by the wildfires, which are among the worst ever to hit western Russia. No fire-related deaths were reported since Friday, officials said Sunday. Two firefighters were among the dead, Itar-Tass reported, citing the Emergency Ministry. Latest figures from the ministry showed that 128,500 hectares (317,530 acres) were burned or had burned, and 774 ""hotbeds of wildfire"" were counted as of 6 a.m. Sunday. About half the fires had either been extinguished or contained, the ministry spokesman said. ""The most difficult situation with wildfires remains in the Nizhny Novgorod, Vladimir and Voronezh regions and the Republic of Mordovia, where fires threaten several populated settlements,"" the ministry's information department said. A hot, dry summer has been a key factor in the fires, drying out large parts of land and igniting the peat bogs that lie all over central Russia. Moscow, Russia, hit a temperature of 39 Celsius (102 Fahrenheit) on Thursday, the highest temperature since records began in 1879. The fires have destroyed more than 1,200 homes, the ministry said, and nearly 5,000 people have been left homeless. CNN's Matthew Chance reported from the village of Maslovka, Russia, near Voronezh, that almost every house in the village of 500 people had burned to the ground. All the residents of Maslovka had been evacuated to nearby hotels. A resident of Maslovka named Nina told Chance she had returned to the village after the fire to sift through the rubble of the house where she was born. For 50 years, she said, she lived under the same roof. A few days ago, the wildfires were swept by high winds to the village and quickly engulfed her house. Now there was nothing left. Even the clothes she was wearing were not hers -- they had been given to her by a neighbor. As Nina told her story, an elderly woman walked from behind a broken wall, wailing with tears. Nina said the woman was her mother, devastated she had lost the home where she raised her family. Russia's government has vowed to compensate the more than 1,870 families whose houses have been burned down. Amid complaints, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has ordered regional governors to speed up the compensation process. The Kremlin has called the wildfires a natural disaster of the kind that appear every 30 or 40 years. Critics, meanwhile, accuse local authorities of mismanaging the response. Desperate to control the blazes, Russia says its deployed nearly a quarter of a million people to fight the fires. But around Voronezh, many of the firefighters that Chance saw were just volunteers with buckets.","About half of the hundreds of wildfires in Russia are extinguished or contained .

"(CNN) -- Swedish golfer Richard S. Johnson claimed his second European Tour title after sinking a monster putt to avoid a playoff at his home Scandinavian Masters on Sunday. The U.S.-based 33-year-old drained a 30-foot birdie effort at the final hole to end the hopes of Argentina's Rafa Echenique and follow up his 2002 victory in a co-sanctioned Australian event. Johnson went into the tournament without his regular caddy Lance Ten Broeck, who played in the British Senior Open instead, so his friend Anders Timmell -- a Stockholm radio DJ -- carried his bags instead. While Ten Broeck missed the cut at Carnoustie in Scotland, Johnson carded a final-round one-under-par 71 to finish on 11-under 277 at Bro Hof Slott. ""It's one of the sweetest things I've ever done. Just to come up the 17th and 18th is magical,"" the world No. 329 told the European Tour website. ""This is a huge tournament to win for a Swede and I'm speechless right now. It's epic."" World No. 371 Echenique closed with a 69 to be one shot back, while Italy's Edoardo Molinari claimed third place with the same score after a 20-foot closing putt lifted him above a group on 280 which included British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen. Joint first-round leader Oosthuizen tied with Australia's Brett Rumford (69) and New Zealander Mark Brown (71) following his 73. ""I didn't play well. I didn't drive well and it put everything under pressure. I had to push it at the end, but Richard played brilliantly,"" the South African said. ""I'm a bit disappointed, but after last week I was hoping to make the cut and I finished fourth, so I'm happy."" Johnson went into the final round sharing the lead with K.J. Choi, but the veteran Korean collapsed with a 78 to finish back in 13th on 284. Meanwhile, Germany's Bernhard Langer claimed his first major title on the seniors circuit with a one-shot victory at the British Open on Sunday. The 52-year-old finished one shot clear of U.S. Ryder Cup captain Corey Pavin after his closing one-over 72 gave him a total of five-under 279. Pavin, 50, playing in his first seniors major, shot 70 as he was unable to peg back the former European Ryder Cup leader's three-shot overnight lead. At the women's Evian Masters event in France, world No. 4 Jiyai Shin snatched a one-shot victory with a birdie at the final hole. The 22-year-old is expected to return to the top of the rankings after her closing five-under 67 made her the first South Korean to win the tournament, which is sanctioned by both the European and LPGA Tours. She finished on 14-under 274 ahead of fellow Korean Na Yeon Choi (66), overnight leader Morgan Pressel (70), and another American Alexis Thompson (67). Shin recently returned to action following an emergency appendectomy six weeks ago. At the Canadian Open in Toronto, Dean Wilson took a four-shot lead into Sunday's final round of the PGA Tour event after shooting his third successive five-under 65. The 40-year-old, playing on a sponsor's exemption, will be chased by the second-placed group of Carl Pettersson, Tim Clark and Bob Estes. Sweden's Pettersson earlier broke the tournament record with a 10-under 60 at St. George's as he just missed out on the magical 59 mark when his final putt from 30 feet went just wide of the hole.","Richard S.

"Washington (CNN) -- Where did Arizona's new immigration enforcement statute Senate Bill 1070 come from, and where is this fast-developing trend of state activism in immigration law enforcement headed now? The law has gone viral in the public mind over the past couple of weeks. Elites and special interests are in an uproar, but some polls show that ordinary citizens and voters support local and state enforcement initiatives by wide margins. SB 1070 was intended by its creators, myself among them, to provoke sustainable immigration reform. To understand how and why requires an insight into the history of the modern immigration control movement. In 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act (Ted Kennedy shepherded the bill in the Senate), destroying the national quota-based system that had, among other things, restricted immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe and Asian countries and kept immigration at sustainable levels since the end of World War I. The 1965 law created ""chain migration,"" which allowed the most recently arrived immigrants to set U.S. immigration flow by sponsoring family members, and stoked an insatiable demand to immigrate among billions of impoverished foreigners worldwide. The old scourge of cheap labor exploitation, which had been disappearing for a generation, re-emerged in the midst of millions of illegal migrants, primarily from Mexico. SB 1070 happened because neither political party has been willing to close the floodgate inadvertently opened in 1965. In 1986, President Reagan and Congress tried amnesty, with disastrous results. The newly legalized immigrants used chain migration to choke the system with new applications for relatives, and illegal immigration swelled to historic levels by the mid-1990s. Massive immigration began to distort every aspect of American life, from crime to higher education. In Congress, the cheap labor and ethnic voter interests could never agree on who got to exploit the new arrivals first but did find common ground in eviscerating attempts to control unauthorized employment. Dismayed at the effects of federal gridlock on their once Golden State, in 1994, California voters enacted Proposition 187, still America's ""toughest"" immigration control law. A truly grass-roots effort, it was attacked by immigration lawyers on grounds that it pre-empted the federal government's power to regulate immigration, and it was nullified by a federal judge. Then-Gov. Gray Davis scuttled an appeal to the federal 9th Circuit. The American Civil Liberties Union spread the message that states and cities could do nothing.  In public policy circles, the belief that citizenship itself is a discriminatory anachonism, destined for the ash heap of progressive history, became influential. And the influx only grew, as did public anxiety and rage. Fears of immigrant terrorism after September 11 blocked other attempts at amnesty. Chicano militants and the Mexican foreign ministry have intervened directly in U.S. domestic affairs, distributing consular ID cards to illegal immigrants and lobbying local governments to enact defiant sanctuary laws. In many ways, Arizona became ""ground zero"" for this xenocentric chaos. The public watched these trends with growing alarm. But a small collective of lawyers from the national restrictionist groups began to study the strategies of the immigrant rights lawyers. Starting with drivers licenses and public welfare benefits, they worked to mirror federal verification and control laws at the state level. From the conservatives, they adapted federalist doctrines to make state and local police participation a force multiplier for immigration law enforcement. The turning point was Proposition 200, a 2004 Arizona ballot initiative called Protect Arizona Now. Ballot committee leaders included Russell Pearce, the state legislator who became the sponsor of SB 1070 and other ground-breaking local enforcement legislation. Proposition 200 required proof of lawful presence for voter registration and state-funded public benefits. It was opposed by virtually every organized interest in the state. Yet it passed overwhelmingly in every demographic sector, including a plurality of Americans of Hispanic descent. Frustrated citizens and legislators throughout the 50 states saw Proposition 200 as a green light allowing them to stand in the gap that had been abandoned for 30 years by Congress and presidents alike. By 2008, an astonishing 1,500 state immigration-related bills were introduced annually, in more than 40 states. SB 1070 is the first in a third generation of omnibus state immigration enforcement laws. Lawyers from the Federation for American Immigration Reform and other groups were worried about attacks on these new state measures from hostile elites, in particular the from the bar and the bench. To help the nascent movement survive, they developed a lean cooperative enforcement doctrine, grounded in constitutional protections for citizens, to fight off anti-majoritarian challenges by the ACLU and their immigrant-lobby allies. Key high court decisions, for example, endorsed police inquiries into immigration status, held that the failure of immigrants to carry federal documents was a crime, allowed states to cut public services to illegal immigrants and shifted the burden of proof that local enforcement programs are improper away from cities and onto the immigrants' rights lobby. Dozens of elected officials are now calling for passage of omnibus enforcement laws in their states. Sink or swim, these new laws are forcing Congress to confront the need for enforcement-based reform. State enactments like SB 1070 will continue to offer Congress models for national legislation and serve as legal antibodies against the fallacy of amnesty.

"(CNN) -- The deadly flash floods that swept through remote Arkansas valleys, killing some campers and leaving many others missing, are a grim reminder of the sudden nature of flash floods and the importance of being prepared for emergencies. Emergency preparedness is important at any time, as emergencies are more common than people may think. However, being prepared for emergency situations is even more critical when people are out in the wilderness and further away from phones or cell phone access, hospitals and emergency help. More than 40 percent of Americans plan to go hiking or camping this summer, second in popularity only to swimming as a summer activity, according to a recent Red Cross survey. However, the survey also found that less than two-thirds of Americans feel prepared to respond to a serious outdoor emergency such as broken bones, animal bites or heat stroke. Flash floods are a serious threat to summer campers and hikers, especially in narrow valleys where heavy rains can cause water to rise quickly. Media reports from Arkansas say that after more than a half foot of rain, water in the Caddo and Little Missouri rivers rose quickly overnight -- at times faster than 8 feet per hour -- inundating campgrounds in remote valleys and catching many campers asleep. The American Red Cross has a series of preparedness tips that people should follow: . • Share your travel plans with a family member, neighbor or friend . • Listen to area radio and television stations and a NOAA Weather Radio for possible flood warnings and reports of flooding in progress or other critical information from the National Weather Service. • Be prepared to evacuate at a moment's notice. • When a flood or flash flood warning is issued for your area, head for higher ground and stay there. • Stay away from floodwaters. If you come upon a flowing stream where water is above your ankles, stop, turn around and go another way -- 6 inches of swiftly moving water can sweep you off of your feet. • If you come upon a flooded road while driving, turn around and go another way. • If you are caught on a flooded road and waters are rising rapidly around you, get out of the car quickly and move to higher ground. Most cars can be swept away by less than 2 feet of moving water. • Keep children out of the water, as their curiosity could cause them to get too close to fast-moving flood waters. • Be especially cautious at night when it is harder to recognize flood danger. Download our Flood Safety checklist, visit redcross.org or contact your local Red Cross for additional information on how to prepare for emergencies and to get trained. Recognizing the importance of preparedness for people who are hiking or camping, the Red Cross this year began offering a new Wilderness and Remote First Aid course designed to teach people how to respond to an emergency in a setting where emergency help is more than one hour away -- from treating severe wounds and broken bones to dealing with animal bites, bee stings, plant poisoning and weather emergencies. The course includes recommendations for the contents of wilderness and remote area first aid kits, and offers training on what to do in emergencies that include allergic reactions, altitude sickness, sprains, fractures, burns, heat-related illness, hypothermia, lightning strikes, heart attacks, drowning, wound treatment and snakebite. With summer starting and more people getting outside, it is important that families include emergency preparedness in the summer planning. Sadly, severe weather and summer are inseparable. Preparedness is especially important for people who will be hiking or camping in remote areas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Inga Jelescheff.","Floods are grim reminder of danger in wilderness, says Inga Jelescheff .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father wants a judge to order the pop star's estate to pay him a monthly allowance, according to papers filed in court Friday. Joe Jackson, the 80-year-old Jackson family patriarch, was not named in Michael Jackson's 2002 will, which left his wealth to his mother, Katherine Jackson, his three children and undisclosed charities. Brian Oxman, Joe Jackson's lawyer, filed the petition Friday asking for him to be included in the family allowance. The matter will be considered Tuesday when Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff convenes the next hearing on matters related to the probate of Jackson's will, Oxman said. The filing does not publicly specify how much Jackson's father is requesting. Howard Weitzman, one of the lawyers for the estate's special administrators, said Joe Jackson's request ""will be considered as are all requests for money from Michael's estate."" ""It was quite surprising to learn of the request,"" Weitzman said. Michael Jackson's mother and his three children receive a court-ordered allowance from the estate totaling more than $86,000 a month, according to court documents. The money is in addition to the maintenance of the home -- which is owned by the estate -- in Encino, California, where Katherine Jackson lives with her grandchildren, the papers said. Although Joe and Katherine Jackson are still married, Joe Jackson lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. Joe Jackson is credited with launching and guiding his family's show business success, but Michael Jackson had publicly criticized his father's parenting skills. Tuesday's hearing could also see a new challenge by the Jackson family of the 2002 will. Michael Jackson died June 25, but the probate of his will has been slowed by a series of court squabbles between Katherine Jackson's lawyers and the two men now in control of the estate. John Branca and John McClain, who are named as executors in the will, were appointed temporary special administrators to run the estate until the process is completed. Katherine Jackson replaced the lawyers representing her in the estate case last month with attorney Adam Streisand. Another Jackson family lawyer said the change was made because the case was about to take a ""new direction"" based on ""new evidence"" uncovered by the family. Attorney Londell McMillan pointed to questions about the authenticity of the signature on Michael Jackson's will. Tuesday's estate hearing will be Streisand's first appearance in the case. A trial has been tentatively set for December to decide any challenge of the will, although Streisand said last month he expected it to be set for early next year. The A&E network announced Friday that ""The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty"" television series will launch with two hours of programming on Sunday night, December 13. Four of Michael Jackson's brothers -- all except Randy Jackson -- are involved in the show ""as they prepare for a Jackson Five reunion, while also coming to terms with Michael's tragic loss,"" the network said. An A&E programming executive said the ""deeply intimate portrait will provide viewers with a raw and honest look inside a musical dynasty.""","Joe Jackson, who was left out of will, wants judge to give him allowance .

"Warsaw, Poland (CNN) -- With their fine shirts, ­their initials embroidered on them,­ their cufflinks and custom made jackets, the Modrzejewski twins ­Jan and Pawel ­seem the prototype of the London banker. Their hairstyle, their clothes, their gestures, everything is almost identical. Both were indeed bankers in London¹s financial district, but nowadays you are likely to find them at baby fairs in Poland, Germany, and other European countries promoting their new line of baby wear called ""Mon Petit Bebe."" ""We always wanted to start our own business,"" Jan says. ""The work is very different from what we used to do, but at least you [are] building something that is your own,"" Pawel completes the sentence as seamlessly as only identical twins can. The work certainly looks very different from banking. The twins patiently explain their new products to inquisitive mothers as babies hover around the stand at the baby fair -- sometimes falling over, sometimes crying after falling to the floor. It is loud, hectic and very hot, but Jan and Pawel know this is the best way to reach their potential customers. Their company offers something they say is new on the Polish market: Fully organic baby clothes, made from 100 per cent organic cotton and sewed by hand in small factories in Poland. ""Basically, we saw that the trend towards eco-friendly garments was slowly coming to Poland,"" Jan says. ""The market here is not as big as in the UK, but we believe it will certainly pick up,"" Pawel again chimes in and completes the thought. Jan and Pawel Modrzejewski's move back to Poland is more than a homecoming -- it is also a vote of confidence in the Polish economy. After years that saw the country's best and brightest leave Poland to get an education and work experience elsewhere, more and more Poles are returning as their economy has shown itself robust during the international crisis while countries like the UK have faced a much deeper recession. ""We see the potential in Poland,"" Pawel says as he folds some baby shirts from the new collection. Experts have yet to put numbers on the new trend of returning to Poland, ­a process labeled ""brain gain"" by some, ­but former expats say they know of many people who are coming back to try their luck in their home country. Still, employment agencies warn that a lack of skilled labor could hamper Poland¹s further economic development. ""We see a lack -- especially of project managers on construction sites,"" says the Manpower agency, one of the biggest in the world, ""but there is also big demand for plumbers, carpenters and of course in the service sector."" Poles who are returning know they are heading into an adventure. Claudia Loretti used to work in marketing in London but recently returned to Warsaw to help her parents run three clothing stores. She says in the beginning the times were hard, but now things are getting better. ""The skills I learned abroad are certainly helping me here,"" she says as she folds some designer shorts. ""Having operated in London it is possible to succeed almost everywhere in the world and I want to put the skills I have acquired to good use in my country.""

Nadal quickly followed as he went down in straight sets 7-6 6-4 to his fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez in their quarterfinal clash. Nadal, fresh from his French Open triumph, was looking for valuable match practice on grass, but a mistake putting away a simple overhead put him under pressure in the first set tiebreak. Lopez took advantage of the second of two set points and a single break was enough to give him victory in the second set. Lopez, who was beating Nadal for the second time in seven matches, netted on his first match point but wrapped it up on the next. Nadal had been the last remaining leading name in the pre-Wimbledon grasscourt tournament, which has seen the top five seeds go out. Four-time Queen's champion Andy Roddick and Novak Djokovic were casualties on Thursday and Murray came close to joining them as he trailed 3-0 in the deciding set to Fish before recovering to tie it up at 3-3. Angry exchanges followed as Fish walked off claiming the light was too poor to continue, while Murray, with momentum behind him, wanted to continue. When they resumed on Friday, both men easily held their services as the match went into a deciding tiebreak at 6-6. Murray gained the early mini-break with a superb forehand passing shot, but then Fish, coming to the net whenever possible, took command. He quickly set up four match points and claimed victory and a place in the quarterfinals as Murray hit a backhand long. Fish later beat Michael Llodra of France 6-4 6-4 in their quarterfinal match to reach the last four. Dudi Sela's run came to an end as the 14th-seeded Israeli, who had beaten Roddick on Thursday, lost 7-5 6-4 to Rainer Schuettler of Germany. Sam Querrey of the United States continued his impressive passage by beating Belgian Xavier Malisse 6-3 7-5. Meanwhile, Roger Federer stepped up his bid for a sixth title in Halle, Germany with a 7-5 6-3 quarterfinal win over home hope Philipp Kohlschreiber. Former world number one Lleyton Hewitt also went through with a victory over  Andreas Beck of Germany 7-6 6-1. He will play Benjamin Becker in the semis with Federer taking on Philipp Petzschner.","World number one Rafael Nadal beaten in quarterfinals of Queen's Club tournament .

"Haddonfield, New Jersey (CNN) -- Like any doting mother, Michelle Stilts wants her son, Dalton, to go to college, get married and start a family. But today, all the 15-year-old can think about is playing football. This weekend, he joins his teammates in Nebraska to play flag football at the 2010 Special Olympics USA National Games. ""When you think of sports, you think of Dalton,"" Michelle Stilts said. ""He was probably born with a ball in his hand ... he loves any kind of sport."" Stilts suffered a brain injury after his family was in a car accident when he was only 21 months old. Unable to talk and paralyzed on his left side, he had to relearn everything. Throughout Dalton's early years, his parents struggled coping with his new behavior. He had difficulty with his speech, trouble with paying attention, and he would often wander off in public. Accommodating his needs wasn't an easy task with two other children, Shelby and Logan, at home in addition to Dalton, said Michelle Stilts. When it came time to attend school, mainstream public school classrooms weren't a good fit for his disability. The Stilts' needed an alternative, so the search for a new school began. At age 7, he was enrolled at Bancroft, a school for children and adults with special needs located in Haddonfield, just outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""I know he's loved here, you know, he's really given a chance to be a normal child, which is great for me, that's all I really wanted for him,"" Michelle said.  ""I always wanted him to be respected, and accepted."" Tuition at the school can range from $38,000 to $42,000 a year depending on the needs of the student. However, in New Jersey, if a school district cannot appropriately educate a student with a disability, it can find a placement at a private school like Bancroft. That district then pays for the education of the child. That financial assistance has been a huge relief for the Stilts. ""We wouldn't be able to afford the care he gets here,"" Michelle said. Football has played an important part in Dalton's growth. Playing sports allows Dalton to come out of his shell and be a team player, skills that will one day help him transition into society. While Bancroft doesn't have a football team, Dalton plays with other Special Olympic athletes from the area and works with Steve Paul, the Special Olympics coordinator at Bancroft. ""He's all energy, he's a great player, he works hard at practice, he always wants be a part of sports,"" Paul said. ""It's everything that I remember about loving sports when I was younger, that is what Dalton is."" Dalton is one of 2,800 athletes who were selected from 600,000 from across the United States to compete in the Special Olympics. The family leaves Saturday to join Dalton at the National Games. Opening ceremonies will be broadcast live on Sunday, and the events will take place all next week in Lincoln, Nebraska. Dalton says he is ready to win gold. ""I like to play football because I like to be quarterback and running back, because I am the fastest on the team,"" he said. ""I want to win."" His hard work at practice, and in the classroom, has paid off. He no longer needs speech classes and he is making progress with his attention issues and is a member of the student council. ""He's always out to help students who maybe don't get it as quickly as he does, and I think we all can learn a lesson from that,"" said Bancroft's principal, Bob Lenherr. ""Dalton is a very special young man.""","Dalton Stilts is competing in flag football in the 2010 Special Olympics .

"(CNN) -- Brazil ""will not bend"" to U.S. pressure to seek sanctions against Iran, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Brasilia. The United States was seeking support for sanctions against Iran, which it accuses of harboring a non-peaceful nuclear program. Brazil shares the table with the United States on the United Nations Security Council, where it holds a non-veto seat. ""We think with our own mind. We want a world without nuclear arms, certainly without proliferation,"" Amorim said at a news conference with Clinton on Wednesday, according to the official Agencia Brasil news agency. ""It is not about simply bending to an opinion that may not be true. We can't simply be taken along. We have to think with our own head."" During her remarks, Clinton reiterated the case for new sanctions, saying that Iran is not likely to engage in negotiations over its nuclear program until after sanctions are in place. Clinton said Iran is trying to stall the international community. Amorim countered that there is still time for negotiations, and that a uranium swap deal remains a possibility. The United States is proposing tough new sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council in an effort to persuade Iran to stop uranium enrichment and negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program, senior U.S. officials and Security Council diplomats said. The United States and its allies are discussing the measures as part of a possible fourth Security Council resolution against Iran over its nuclear program. The sanctions focus on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has vast business interests in the country. The sanctions would center around the banking, shipping and insurance sectors of the Iranian economy, broadening the scope of the sanctions in the three previous U.N. security resolutions. While existing sanctions call on U.N. members to exercise ""vigilance"" or ""restraint"" on trade, the sources said the proposed new sanctions call for an outright ban on certain transactions with Iran. The proposed measures expand existing areas of sanctions, adding new companies and additional individuals facing a travel ban and assets freeze for their work on Iran's nuclear program. The United States wants to gain the support of Russia and China to negotiate the proposed sanctions draft. The United States and its allies hope that China will voice its support in talks with Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg in Beijing this week. CNN's Elise Labott and Adam Levine contributed to this report.","United States is proposing tough new sanctions on Iran .

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is VICE's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- VICE visited Iran to document the country's prestigious, internationally recognized film culture. It was April 2009, just a few months ahead of the national elections that sent the country into a series of bloody revolts, clearly the calm before the storm. There were no signs that national discontent was brewing. Instead, there was the sense that the country was ready to dispense with its own personal George Bush -- Mahmoud Ahmadinejad -- through free and fair elections. People would politely smile and shrug when we mentioned his name. It was the spring, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs had just released their new album that month, and I had ""Zero"" in heavy rotation on my iPod. Things were so calm and nonchalant that I even contemplated shooting a music video for the song on the streets of Tehran. The idea was to get some local girls to push regular gestures like waving and walking to the point of dance, to see how far we could push dance out into a public sphere, where it would clearly be frowned upon, if not worse. Pretty cool concept, right? It wasn't until a few months later, after seeing bloody young Iranian protesters in those same streets, that I realized how risky that music video would have been. See the rest of Inside Iranian Cinema at VBS.TV . Modern Iran is a place of many, many rules. Dancing in the streets in the Islamic Republic of Iran is not something I would recommend. Lots of things are taboo in Iran. It's a nation of laws. Lots and lots of written, otherwise stated, largely assumed, often implied, always religiously motivated laws. The country is a curious confluence of laws, divine and terrestrial. The country is caught in the grip of a clerical elite that takes its cues as much from the pages of an Orwellian dystopia as it does from the pages of any sacred text. This is what makes Iranian film so amazing. It is an industry and a culture that thrives to international acclaim and prestige in the face of all of those rules and laws (or maybe because of them). The Iranian filmmakers we met on our trip were working under conditions that we simply can't really appreciate in our free and freely decadent West. One of the most vivid memories of the trip was a visit to an acting school where young Iranians learned the very idiosyncratic style of acting for the Iranian screen. Men and woman shouldn't touch each other in suggestive ways, like hugging or dancing cheek to cheek, and of course onscreen kissing is strictly forbidden. There hasn't been a filmed kiss in Iran since the Revolution. But the actors in this acting class were incredibly expressive, huffing, puffing, crying on cue and expressing pain and love and happiness through the cracks in the code. Watching them, I felt like I was like watching silent film actors of a hundred years ago. And I really couldn't help but think, what do they think of Lady Gaga?","Iran producing critically acclaimed work amid renewed passion for film .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League side Liverpool are waiting to find out the extent of the injury suffered by Spain striker Fernando Torres during the closing stages of the World Cup final. The 26-year-old, a late substitute in Spain's 1-0 extra-time victory over the Netherlands, pulled up as he chased a long ball, before collapsing to the ground and thumping his fist on the ground. He recovered enough to play a part in Spain's celebrations and returned to Madrid on Monday with his victorious team-mates. A statement on Liverpool's website confirmed the injury as a left adductor problem, although the severity is not yet known. Torres endured an injury-disrupted season with Liverpool, and came into the World Cup after a six week layoff following his second knee operation. He has been linked with a big-money move away from the Reds, who slumped to a disappointing seventh-place finish last season. But in a separate item, Liverpool's website featured pictures of Torres holding the World Cup while wearing the team's scarf, an image that may reassure fans desperate to keep hold of one of their prize assets. Meanwhile, Manchester United departed for their pre-season tour of the United States without a number of their best-known players. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Nemanja Vidic have all been left at home to recover from the World Cup, while Gary Neville, Michael Owen, Antonio Valencia, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves are all recovering from injuries. However, new signings Chris Smalling and Javier Hernandez are making the trip. Elsewhere, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce says he wants to sign defender Sol Campbell from Arsenal, and Portsmouth manager Steve Cotterill has revealed that Nigeria striker John Utaka is set to leave the club following their relegation to the Championship.","Liverpool wait to find out extent of injury to star striker Fernando Torres .

"(CNN)  -- Barcelona president Sandro Rosell has admitted that the proposed transfer of Spanish midfielder Cesc Fabregas from Arsenal is now in doubt. Premier League Arsenal are desperate to retain the services of Fabregas and have placed a big price tag on their talisman which may make the Catalan giants think twice about signing him. ""The transfer of Cesc is becoming more complicated because there are a lot of expectations on the side of the sellers and that is not good news for Barcelona,"" AFP quoted Rosell from Catalian radio station RAC1 on Tuesday. The Spanish champions have just splashed out nearly $50 million for Valencia's star striker David Villa and Rosell told the club's official website that the club's finances needed to be reviewed. He unveiled a $184 million syndicated credit deal to help cut their debts and also admitted that they were still chasing money owed by their TV rights holders Mediapro, which has gone receivership. Barcelona have also been forced to recoup $18.4 million by the sale of Ukrainian defender Dmytro Chygrynskiy to his old club Shakhtar Donetsk. It is $12.29 million less than Shakhtar received from Barca when he was transferred last year. Chygrynskiy, who has 24 caps for Ukraine, joined Barca on a five-year contract but did not impress and played just 14 times. Barcelona have already banked nearly $30 million from the sale last week of Ivorian midfielder Yaya Toure to English Premier League side Manchester City. Rosell told the website that the club's fans should not be concerned by the situation. ""The club isn't bankrupt,"" he said. ""This week we'll have everything in place to impose a policy of austerity to be able to make savings in unnecessary areas and meet very important commitments such as paying the wages of our players, coaches and employees.""

"(CNN) -- Michelle Lehmann wakes up at 4 a.m. Her husband, Jim, gets their eight children out of bed as she picks out their outfits, makes breakfast and packs lunches. She fixes the younger children's hair while her husband ties their shoes. After a quick check of school bags, everyone is out the door at 8. The Lehmanns, left to right: Front row: Paige, 3; Emma, 6; Becca, 2; Monty, 5; Linus, 8. Second row: Raif, 10; Violet, 1; Michelle, 37. Back row: Jim, 38; Tess, 12. Sure, having such a large family is sometimes wearing on Lehmann. But wearing on the Earth? She doesn't think so. She says her family leads a frugal life, but the criticism still pours in. ""People will say you are selfish; you are killing the planet,"" said Lehmann, 37, who started a Web site where large families can find support. The criticism comes from those who say the Earth -- with its 6.6 billion people -- is exceeding its carrying capacity. Most estimates range from 1 billion to 1 trillion. ""Those are the people that want us to believe that there are way too many people already and we should do something about it -- preferably drastically and soon,"" said Joel Cohen, a professor of population at both the Rockefeller University and Columbia University. ""And then there are the people who say, 'Oh, we could support very nicely 15 billion or 20 billion or 70 billion.' "" Les U. Knight falls into the first category. He's the spokesman for The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT). The group's motto: May we live long and die out. Knight says the population is far more than Earth can handle. Letting humans gradually -- and voluntarily -- die out is the best thing we can do for the biosphere, his group believes. He says it doesn't matter whether a family has its eight kids or one -- the last has the same impact as the first. ""I don't think the intentional creation of one more by anyone anywhere can be justified today,"" he said. ""An ideal number [of people] would be zero, because as long as there is one breeding couple, we could be right back where we are again in 10,000 years."" Those ideas are absurd and ignorant, said Sheldon Richman, editor of The Freeman, a journal published by The Foundation for Economic Education. The concept of carrying capacity applies to the animal kingdom but not humans, he said, because humans are active agents in the environment and can change their behaviors. ""People do control their reproductive activities. ... Animals don't say, 'Well, we better not have another litter because how are we going to pay to send all those pups to college,' "" he said. A controversial concept . This whole idea of carrying capacity is heavily debated, said Gerhard K. Heilig, chief of the United Nations' Population Estimates and Projections Section. The original idea behind the concept was that natural resources and land would limit population growth, thus slowing down a population increase. That's clearly not the case, he said, because population growth is slowing down in areas that don't have strains on the environment. Romania, for instance, has a declining population, but the population density is low. ""[Changes in population] have to do with social change, they have to do with political change, they have to do with economic situation -- they have to do with all kinds of other things, but certainly not with people reaching our biological limit,"" Heilig said. Hunter-gatherer societies illustrate how social organization and technology affect the number of people an area can sustain, he said. An area where people hunted and gathered for a living might have supported 1,000 people. ""If you have a modern society with high technology, you can maybe support 5 to 10 million in the same area,"" he said. The United Nations projects that population growth will continue to decline and will level off at about 10 billion around 2060.  Click here for a look at world growth rates and population projections » . The number sounds scary for those who say the planet is already too crowded. ""The more of us there are, the fewer resources there are. The less room, the less space. Will it be better when there are more of us? I doubt anyone of us is going to say yes,"" Knight said. ""I think that we are engineering our own involuntary extinction and taking a lot of species with us,"" he said. But Richman points out that the entire population could fit into Jacksonville, Florida, which is about 840 square miles. Give each person 1,000 square feet, and the world's human population would easily fit inside Texas. Lehmann's family lives in an 1,800-square-foot, four-bedroom house in Blue Island, Illinois, a Chicago suburb. They put a divider in the dining room to create two additional rooms. She says that for her family of 10, being resourceful isn't just about being Earth-friendly -- it's a necessity. Because of this, she maintains, her family makes no more of an impact than those with huge houses and lots of cars. ""We learn to use less because we have to stretch it out,"" she said. ""If someone works very hard to obtain a lifestyle -- they want to get lots of cars, they want a very big house -- then people think that is a positive thing. And yet if someone wants to work and the thing they desire is a large family and they are willing to work just as hard, that's criticized."" Values can't be overlooked when trying to determine the Earth's carrying capacity, Cohen said. ""Do we want to have parking lots or parks? Do we want to have Jaguars with a capital J or jaguars with a little j?"" he said. To understand the human situation and its impact on Earth, you have to consider several factors -- population, economics, environment and culture, Cohen said. ""If a person thinks that population is the cause alone of whatever problem they are discussing, then they are missing a very important part of the picture."" And Richman says one of those eight children in the Lehmanns' suburban Chicago home may be the answer to any of the problems the Earth faces. ""In that group, there may be the next great musician, great poet, great novelist, who the heck knows?"" he said. ""People are not a problem. People solve problems.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The super-yachts of the super-rich could soon become super-green. The solar sail: super-yachts could cut fuel consumption and emissions by using a sail similar to this. Sydney-based technology company Solar Sailor is working on a ""solar sail"" which could act as both a sail and a solar power source to all sorts of large vessels. Super-yachts owned by billionaires like Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen are currently among the biggest fuel guzzlers on the planet. Some of the ocean-going beasts like Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's ""Dubai,"" the biggest private super-yacht in the world, are over 150 meters long and contain amenities like aircraft hangars, movie theaters, Jacuzzis, and swimming pools. All of these features sap incredible amounts of energy. Fuel consumption estimates on super-yachts have ranged up to one liter of fuel per second when traveling at high power. • See a photo gallery of the world's best super-yachts . Solar Sailor's CEO Robert Dane told CNN the technology could work perfectly with super-yachts. He said the solar sails had the ability to significantly reduce the boats' fuel consumption and greenhouse-gas emissions. ""We think it would enable people to have their super-yacht but make little or no carbon footprint, which is the big problem with these vessels,"" he said. Dane said the technology worked by using a wing that is a solar panel or a sail, pivotally mounted to a vessel so it can be angled to the sun or the wind. The ""sails"" are controlled by a computer which takes into account the direction and strength of sun and wind to optimize energy collection. A design project is currently underway in the United Kingdom to create a solar sail for the super-yachts, he said. Dane said the company was working with Chinese shipping company COSCO to get solar sails on some of its fleet. ""Our aim is for a trail of retrofitted sails to one bulker and one tanker in 2010. Based on the results of this, then we would design 'new-build' vessels,"" he said. Dane estimated the sail could save about 5 percent in fuel consumption from the solar power and another 20 to 40 percent from wind power when the vessel is traveling at 18 knots. ""This might add up to a 10 percent saving overall in the whole journey,"" Dane said. He said there were further hopes that the technology could be improved by developing systems to raise and lower sails with fewer moving parts and store energy more efficiently.","Solar sails are large solar-paneled wings which can harness sun or wind power .

"London, England (CNN) -- Manchester City completed the transfer of midfielder Yaya Toure from Barcelona Friday, the English Premier League club confirmed. The Ivory Coast international, who returned from South Africa this week after his country was knocked out of the World Cup, will join his elder brother and club captain, Kolo, at Eastlands. During his three-year spell at the Camp Nou, the 28-year-old was a regular starter for the Catalan giants as they won back to back Spanish league titles and the Champions League. A fee has not yet been confirmed by the club but reports earlier this week suggested the deal could be worth £28million ($42.7 million), Britain's Press Association said.

"(CNN)  -- Cesc Fabregas' return to Barcelona could be delayed by a further season after the president of the Catalan giants Sandro Rosell said they will not ""go mad"" in their attempt to sign the Spanish international midfielder. Fabregas had been expected to leave Arsenal during the close season transfer window, but the Premier League club have placed a big price tag on their star asset and are refusing to budge. Rosell told Catalan TV3 that Arsenal ""don't want to listen to offers to sell and they are not putting the player on the market."" Arsenal have reportedly turned back one £30 million ($45.89m) offer for Fabregas from the Spanish champions, who have been forced to take out a €155 million ($200.58m) loan to ease their financial problems. And Rosell said they would not break the bank to land the 23-year-old, particularly as he believes there is ill-feeling between his club and Arsene Wenger's Arsenal. ""There was a strong dispute a few months ago and they have not forgotten it. Nor will we be going mad trying to sign him,"" he added. Barcelona's Spanish World Cup teammates of Fabregas embarrassingly forced him to wear their shirt as they celebrated their triumph, but it remains to be seen if a deal can still be thrashed out. Barcelona have already completed the big-money purchase of Spain World Cup hero David Villa from Valencia this summer and on Friday sealed the signing of Brazilian utility player Adriano from Sevilla. The 25-year-old, who can play at full-back or as a wide midfielder, will cost an initial fee of €9.5 million ($12.29m) with an additional fee payable depending on appearances and performances.

"(CNN) -- Nigeria has until Monday to overturn the decision to ban the national soccer team from all competitions for two years, the sport's governing body FIFA said on Friday. Failure to do so will result in the Nigerian Football Federation being suspended from all FIFA-related actitives, FIFA's communications director Nicolas Maingot told a news conference. ""FIFA will today send a letter to the Nigerian football federation indicating that the government of Nigeria has until Monday 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) to cancel its decision to withdraw Nigeria's participation in all FIFA and CAF organized football competitions,"" Maingot told a news briefing on Friday. Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan suspended the ""Super Eagles"" from international competition on Wednesday after their first round exit at the World Cup in South Africa. The team finished bottom of Group B after failing to win a single game. Jonathan's government also announced the expulsion of the Nigerian Football Federation, with an interim board put in place. Nigeria's Sports Minister Ibrahim Isa Bio confirmed Jonathan's decision in an interview with CNN. ""The government has taken a decision we believe is in the interests of Nigeria that we should for now, withdraw from international competition because our football since 1996 seems not to be growing,"" he said. ""The president Goodluck Jonathan has endorsed this decision and the Nigerian people are excited about it."" However, FIFA rules prevent governments from interfering in the running of national football federations. Should Nigeria fail to resolve the situation, the country will be banned from competitive games including African competitions, and will also lose vital financial help from FIFA. ""A suspension goes beyond the suspension of the national team, it also involves the freezing of the financial help and no referees can participate in international competition,"" said Maingot. FIFA President Sepp Blatter had earlier warned France that they would face a possible suspension following a similar issue involving an investigation by French President Nicolas Sarkozy into the national team's infamous World Cup exit. Jerome Valcke, FIFA's general secretary, said Jonathan's decision puts soccer's world governing body into jeopardy. ""You can't allow a government to say all national teams can't play anymore in any international tournaments,"" Valcke told South African radio station 702. ""Why should we be so strong on France when they did what they did and we say nothing about Nigeria. ""We have 208 members ... if you have one country going against our statute, going against the football system, the pyramid of football ... all is destroyed.""","FIFA has given Nigeria until Monday to overturn the ban imposed on the soccer team .

"(CNN) -- Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon will be sidelined for three months following successful back surgery in Milan. The Juventus player underwent the operation on Sunday to repair a herniated disc in his back, and said afterwards he is in no hurry to return to action. ""I feel relieved now,"" Buffon told Juventus' official website. ""The intervention went well and this gives me faith and serenity. I must not hurry. ""I need to take the due time to come back with no trouble and no risk of recurrence."" The 32-year-old suffered the injury in Italy's opening World Cup match against Paraguay in Group F, which forced him to miss the rest of the tournament in South Africa. The world champions suffered without Buffon, finishing bottom of the group as they failed to make it past the first round of the competition. Buffon, who has won the Serie A Goalkeeper of the Year award a record nine times, is looking forward to working with new Italy manager Cesare Prandelli, who replaces the departed Marcello Lippi. ""Considering my role, I think my career is still a long one and without the hernia I would have been able to lengthen it further,"" Buffon told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. ""My future with the national team? I believe I deserve my place. ""I've had Prandelli as a rival coach since my youth years and I knew back then that he has an exceptional rapport with his players. He is part of the group and I think that is very important."" Buffon, who has 102 caps, will replace Fabio Cannavaro as Italy's captain once he is fit again following the defender's retirement from international duty after the World Cup exit. He was previously national skipper at Euro 2008 when Cannavaro was ruled out by injury. Meanwhile, Juventus announced the season-long loan signing of Udinese defender Marco Motta on Monday. The 24-year-old, who spent last season at Roma as part of a co-ownership agreement, has been training with his new teammates in Pinzolo since Saturday ahead of the move.

"The accused in the Madrid train bombing are scheduled to hear the verdicts and sentencing on Wednesday morning. All of the 28 defendants are men except for one Spanish woman. All the defendants have pleaded not guilty during the trial. Defendants in the Madrid 2004 train bomb trial pictured earlier during proceedings. There are eight prime defendants who face sentences of about 39,000 years each if convicted on all counts, but the maximum time that could be served under Spanish law is 40 years. Spain has no death penalty and no life-in-prison sentence. Among the 28 are 14 Moroccans, nine Spaniards (accused of passing explosives to the suspected Islamic terrorists), two Syrians, one Algerian, one Egyptian, and one Lebanese. Spanish prosecutors issued a document with their revised charges last June after hearing much testimony and evidence during the trial. CNN viewed a copy, which lists the charges below. The trial started with 29 defendants, but during the proceedings, prosecutors dropped all charges against Brahim Moussaten, a 23-year-old Moroccan. He initially had faced six years in jail if convicted of collaborating with a terrorist group. Alleged bombers Jamal Zougam, Moroccan, age 34, faces a 38,960-year sentence if convicted of mass murder of 191 people (at 30 years each) and attempted murder of 1,841 people injured (at 18 years each), causing terrorist damage to four trains (20 years for each of 4 trains) and membership in a terrorist group (12 years). Abdelmajid Bouchar, Moroccan, age 24, faces a 38,960 years if convicted on all charges of mass murder, attempted mass murder, terrorist damage to trains and membership in a terrorist group. He fled after the attacks but was arrested in Serbia in July 2005 and returned to Spain. Alleged ideologues Youssef Belhadj Moroccan, age 31, faces 38,962 years if convicted of mass murder and attempted mass murder charges, terrorist damage to trains and membership in a terrorist group. Arrested in Belgium in 2005 and sent to Spain in 2005. Hassan El Haski, Moroccan, age 44, faces 38,962 years if convicted of mass murder and attempted mass murder charges, terrorist damage to trains and membership in a terrorist group. Rabei Osman El Sayed Ahmed, Egyptian, age 36, faces 38,962 years if convicted of mass murder and attempted mass murder charges, terrorist damage to trains and membership in a terrorist group. He is serving a 10-year sentence in Italy on a separate terrorism conviction and will view the Madrid verdict on Wednesday via videophone, a court spokeswoman told CNN. He was present in Madrid during the trial through an agreement with Italian authorities. Wiretapped by Italian authorities in June 2004, he allegedly said, ""the entire Madrid operation was mine,"" but in testimony, during the trial, he denied involvement and also challenged the wiretaps. Alleged ""necessary cooperators"" Prosecutors argued the attacks could not have occurred without the involvement and active cooperation of the following three defendants. Jose Emilio Suarez Trashorras, Spaniard, age 30, faces 38,976 years if convicted of mass murder and attempted mass murder, terrorist damage to trains, collaborating with a terrorist group, illicit association, supplying and transporting explosives, falsifying license plates and vehicle theft. Prosecutors say he was the leader of a group of Spaniards who obtained explosives and provided them to the alleged Islamic terrorists. Rafa Zouhier, Moroccan, age 28, faces 38,968 years if convicted of mass murder and attempted mass murder charges, terrorist damage to trains, collaborating with a terrorist group and supplying explosives. Prosecutors allege he was a key link between the Islamic suspects and the Spaniards who allegedly provided the explosives. Charges sharply increased against him last June; until then he had faced just 20 years in prison if convicted. Othman El Gnaoui, Moroccan, age 32, faces 38,972 years if convicted of mass murder and attempted mass murder charges, terrorist damage to trains, membership in a terrorist group, supplying explosives and document forgery. Charges sharply increased against him last June; until then he had faced just 24 years in prison if convicted. Islamic suspects charged with terrorist group membership Mohamed Larbi Ben Sellam, Moroccan, age 30, faces 27 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group and conspiracy to commit terrorist assassination. Rachid Aglif, Moroccan, age 27, faces 21 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group and supplying explosives. Basel Ghalyoun, Syrian, age 27, faces 12 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group. Charges sharply reduced against him last June. Until then, he faced some 38,000 years if convicted as a suspected bomber, accused of mass murder. But during the trial, prosecutors did not find evidence and reduced the charges. Mouhannah Almallah Dabas, Syrian, age 43, faces 12 years if convicted of membership in a terrorist group. Mohamed Bouharrat, Moroccan, age 28, faces 12 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group. Abdelilah El Fadual El Akil, Moroccan, age 38, faces 12 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group. Saed El Harrak, Moroccan, age 34, faces 12 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group. Fouad El Morabit El Amgar, Moroccan, age 34, faces 12 years if convicted of belonging to a terrorist group. Other Islamic suspects charged with collaboration with a terrorist group Hamid Ahmidan, Moroccan, age 29, faces 23.5 years if convicted of collaborating with a terrorist group and drug trafficking. Mahmoud Slimane Aoun, Lebanese, age 47, faces 13 years if convicted of collaborating with a terrorist group and document forgery. Nasreddine Bousbaa, Algerian, age 46, faces 11 years if convicted of collaborating with a terrorist group and document forgery. Mohamed Moussaten, Moroccan, age 23, faces six years if convicted of collaborating with a terrorist group. Other Spanish suspects in the alleged explosives trafficking ring Raul Gonzalez Pelaez, Spaniard, age 28, faces eight years if convicted of illicit association and supplying explosives. Antonio Toro Castro, Spaniard, age 30, faces 23 years if convicted of collaborating with a terrorist group, supplying explosives and illicit association. Sergio Alvarez Sanchez, Spaniard, age 26, faces four years if convicted of supplying explosives and illicit association. Ivan Granados Pena, Spaniard, age 25, faces four years if convicted of supplying explosives and illicit association. Javier Gonzalez Diaz, Spaniard, age 55. State prosecutors last June cleared him of all charges, but he earlier faced eight years if convicted of supplying explosives and illicit association. A private party plaintiff to the case, representing bomb victims, has maintained charges against him, approximately those that the prosecutors earlier had, so he has not yet been fully cleared. Emilio Llano Alvarez, Spaniard, age 46, faces five years if convicted of supplying explosives. Antonio Ivan Reis Palacio, Spaniard, age 25, faces four years if convicted of supplying explosives and illicit association. Carmen Toro Castro, Spaniard, age 26, the only female defendant, faces six years if convicted of supplying explosives and illicit association. Deceased suspects In addition to the 28 defendants, prosecutors say seven prime suspects blew themselves up three weeks after the train bombings in 2004 as police closed in on their hideout in the Madrid suburb of Leganes. One police officer died in the assault. Those seven suspects were Moroccans Jamal Ahmidan, Abdennabi Kounjaa, Mohamed Oulad Akcha and his brother, Rachid Oulad Akcha, and Rifaat Anouar Asrih; Tunisian Serhane Ben Abdelmajid Fakhet and Algerian Allekema Lamari, prosecutors said.

"(CNN) -- Nigeria's president has backed down on his decision to suspend the national soccer team, according to the African country's football federation. The announcement came just before Monday's deadline set by world governing body FIFA, which had threatened to expel Nigeria completely if the ruling was not overturned and also withhold $8 million due for participating at the World Cup. Nigerian leader Goodluck Jonathan was so angry with the Super Eagles' poor performance in South Africa that he decided to suspend the national team at all levels for two years. ""The President and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, on Monday graciously rescinded last Wednesday's decision to withdraw Nigerian national football teams from FIFA/CAF football competitions,"" the federation said in a statement. ""The decision was made known at the presidential villa on Monday evening as President Jonathan hearkened to the passionate appeals of top officials of the National Sports Commission, the Nigeria Football Federation, other concerned organs of government and well-meaning Nigerians on the matter."" Nigerian leader's 'Obama moment' Nine members of the NFF's executive committee had earlier been dismissed, including president Sani Lulu and vice-president Amanze Uchegbulam, the UK Press Association reported on Monday. After hearing of Jonathan's June 30 decision, FIFA wrote to the NFF on Friday warning it of the possible ramifications if the Monday deadline was not met. Two-time African champions Nigeria finished bottom of Group B at the World Cup after one draw and two defeats. The Super Eagles brought in former Sweden coach Lars Lagerback after finishing third at the Africa Cup of Nations in January, but he was unable to lift the team's fortunes in matches against Argentina, Greece and South Korea.","Ban on Nigeria's national football team is rescinded by African country's president .

"(CNN) -- David Villa came to Spain's rescue again to put the European champions into the World Cup semifinals for the first time with a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Paraguay in Johannesburg on Saturday night as both teams missed a penalty. The striker, who scored the only goal in the second-round victory over Portugal, netted the winner with eight minutes to play to become the leading scorer at the South African tournament with five. Spain will now play Germany in Durban on Wednesday for a place in final after the 2006 hosts thrashed Argentina 4-0 earlier on Saturday. It will be a rematch of the Euro 2008 final, which Spain won 1-0. ""We didn't play well mainly because we didn't get enough of the ball,"" Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque told reporters. ""We are now among the four best teams in the world. Our next opponents are Germany, who are the best team at the moment."" Paraguay, playing in the last eight for the first time, had a goal disallowed in the first half and should have taken the lead in the 59th minute but Oscar Cardozo's penalty was saved by Spain captain Iker Casillas. Xabi Alonso then had the chance to put the Spaniards ahead soon after but was also denied from the spot after having to retake his successful first attempt. Paraguay, whose coach Gerardo Martino made six changes after the penalty shootout win over Japan in the previous round, easily contained Spain's renowned attacking prowess in a disappointing first half. ""We had chances but didn't take them. But never mind. I congratulate my players for their progress at the World Cup,"" Martino told reporters. The South Americans felt aggrieved to have a 41st-minute strike by Nelson Valdez ruled out after Cardozo strayed into a marginally offside position, but wasted a glorious chance to go ahead after Spain defender Gerard Pique was booked for dragging on the arm of Cardozo. But the Benfica player, who scored the winner against Japan, saw his shot saved by Casillas -- and then at the other end Villa was hauled down when clear on goal by Antolin Alcaraz, who was lucky not to be sent off. Alonso coolly sent goalkeeper Justo Villar the wrong way, but the Paraguay captain was more successful the second time after Guatemalan referee Carlos Batres ruled that players had encroached into the penalty area before the initial kick was taken. Villar was lucky not to concede another penalty as he clattered into Cesc Fabregas while trying to gather the rebound, but was helpless when Spain finally made the breakthrough. Substitute Pedro fired a low shot onto the base of the woodwork, and Villa followed up with a strike that hit one post and bounced into the net off the other one. Paraguay substitutes Lucas Barrios and Roque Santa Cruz had late efforts blocked in quick succession by Casillas, while Villa was denied a second by Villar. It was another disappointing night for Villa's strike partner Fernando Torres, who was replaced by Fabregas with 20 minutes to play as he again looked well short of his usual high standards. Paraguay's defeat leaves neighbors Uruguay as South America's only representative in the last four, facing the Netherlands on Tuesday.","Spain will play Germany in the World Cup semifinals after beating Paraguay 1-0 .

"(CNN) -- A convicted sex offender who was sentenced to death for killing a 9-year-old Idaho boy is scheduled to be arraigned Monday on charges related to the killing of a 10-year-old California boy. Joseph Edward Duncan III will answer charges in the 1997 abduction and murder of Anthony Martinez. Joseph Edward Duncan III is expected to appear in court in Riverside County, California, to answer to charges in the 1997 abduction and murder of Anthony Martinez, said a spokesman for the Riverside County District Attorney's office. Investigators have charged Duncan with murder in Anthony's death. Law-enforcement officials also are investigating whether Duncan, who committed his first sexual offense at the age of 12, can be tied to other crimes, according to CNN affiliate KTLA in Los Angeles, California. Martinez was kidnapped on April 4, 1997 from an alley near his home in the city of Beaumont, the station reported; the boy's naked body was discovered a little over two weeks later. Duncan has confessed to killing Martinez and crushing the boy's head with a rock, KTLA reported, citing court documents. Authorities reportedly discovered the boy's body by following vultures to a remote section of a nearby canyon. The body was partially buried under a pile of rocks and bound with duct tape, according to KTLA. Duncan, a high school dropout and drifter, was sentenced to death last August for the torture and murder of Dylan Groene, a 9-year-old Idaho boy. He was convicted of kidnapping Dylan and his then 8-year-old sister before torturing them at a remote campsite and fatally bludgeoning members of their family. In 2007, Duncan pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping counts in state court for the hammer-attack murders of three other Groene family members. If convicted of murdering Martinez, Duncan can be sentenced to death again.","Joseph Duncan committed his first sexual offense at the age of 12 .

"(CNN) -- Germany coach Joachim Low has tried to lift the burden of expectation off his young team by claiming that Wednesday's semifinal opponents Spain are favorites to win the World Cup. The Germans, who came into the tournament missing several key injured players, have been tipped to win a fourth title in South Africa after demolishing Argentina 4-0 in the quarterfinals and successfully shackling the attacking talents of Lionel Messi. But Low, whose team were beaten by the Spaniards in the final of Euro 2008, believes that the last-four clash in Durban will be a more difficult proposition. ""Spain remain the natural World Cup favorites. They not only have one Messi, but they have several Messis,"" he told reporters. ""They have a whole range of players that can win a game, so we will have to be very watchful against them. They are a team that make very few mistakes. We have to force them into making mistakes."" The Germans are the top scorers in this year's tournament, having racked up 13 goals in five games after putting four past Australia, England and Argentina. Defeat in the second group game against Serbia has been the only lapse, as Bastian Schweinsteiger has reveled in his new central midfield role in the absence of injured captain Michael Ballack, while four-goal Thomas Muller and playmaker Mezut Ozil have also been inspirational. Muller will miss the Spain game due to suspension but Low has another potent goal threat in striker Miroslav Klose, who needs one more to join Brazil legend Ronaldo on the all-time record of 15. ""In 2008, there is no doubt that Spain were the best team at the tournament. They have shown great consistency and always played at the highest possible level. So they have been impressive,"" Low said. ""But now the situation is different. We too have a good team and we have every reason to believe that we can succeed."" Spain reached the World Cup semifinals for the first time with a 1-0 victory over Paraguay thanks to a late winner from striker David Villa, the tournament's top scorer on five goals. Defender Gerard Pique has backed his team to take the next step up. ""I think when you are at the semifinal stage, there are no favorites,"" he told reporters. ""We never have any doubts about ourselves. We always play the same way, the results are good and we have to be confident with our play. ""Germany and Spain both have new players in the team and it will be a different game to two years ago. We will always keep going. That is the sort of team we are."" Pique's defensive partner Carles Puyol has been cleared to play after suffering blurred vision when he was hit in the face by the ball against Paraguay, while midfielder Cesc Fabregas will also be available despite falling heavily on his shoulder. Coach Vicente del Bosque has been under pressure from Spanish media to drop striker Fernando Torres, who has failed to impress after having a pre-tournament knee operation. Torres, who scored the winner in the final of Euro 2008, has been substituted in each of the past four matches after starting the shock defeat by Switzerland on the bench.","Germany coach Joachim Low claims Spain are favorites to win the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Philip McClary was grilling out at his home in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, on Sunday night when he heard hometown brewer Anheuser-Busch would be bought by the Belgian company InBev. ""I was actually drinking a Bud Light when I heard, and I couldn't even finish it. That's the honest-to-God truth,"" he said Monday. ""I was proud to drink Budweiser, not any more,"" said P.J. Champion, a student at the University of Mississippi who said the brew is ""a great piece of American history."" McClary put Champion's thoughts to music, posting his song ""Kiss Our Glass"" on YouTube and on a Web site that tried to stop the sale, SaveBudweiser.com.  Watch McClary sing 'Kiss our Glass' » . ""America is not for sale, and neither is her beer,"" McClary sings. ""All you hard-working Americans stand up and show some class,"" the song continues, ""Have a drink with Mother Freedom, and tell InBev to kiss your glass."" Such outrage is to be expected, says Matt Simpson, who bills himself as The Beer Sommelier and teaches Beer Education 101 at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. But he said the protests will soon fade. ""Unless it affects [Americans] in the product or the pocketbook, they're likely to forget about it,"" Simpson says. And he doesn't think InBev will change its iconic product. ""You don't mess with a good thing,"" he says. ""It really isn't about nationalism, it's about money."" Even McClary agrees. ""I think there will be somewhat of a backlash; I would anticipate initially that people will be furious and stop drinking it. Maybe after six months, though, they'll switch back."" Simpson says that if American beer drinkers turn away from Budweiser and other Anheuser-Busch brands, it will be because they are turning to microbrews. ""They are heading the pack in popularity and business success these days,"" he says of the small breweries. ""Today, taste is king. You really don't get from the macro beer producers.""  See other American icons owned by foreign companies » . But he doesn't expect Budweiser to go away, either. ""There's nothing inherently wrong with the taste of Budweiser. It's a light American lager. There will always be some sort of market for that,"" he says. For McClary, taste was never an issue. ""I've drank tons of different beers, different brands; but Bud Light has always been the one to me that was the easiest to go down and had the smoothest taste."" But he says he's quaffed his last Bud Light, and the issue is larger than beer. ""We've kind of lost a part of our history here and all across the United States,"" he said. InBev says it won't be changing Budweiser or Bud Light, which it says are the best-selling beers in the world. ""Budweiser will be brewed in the same breweries ... by the same people, according to the same recipe,"" said Carlos Brito, InBev's chief executive officer. But iReporter Adam Williams, who lives across the street from Anheuser-Busch's St. Louis brewery, doesn't share that feeling of a continued tradition. Things will change, Williams says, right down to the company's mascot Dalmatians that have been a constant commotion in the neighborhood. ""I will miss the nuisance that ... the Budweiser Dalmatians have meant around our neighborhood,"" he writes. ""They may still exist over there for some time to come, but their kingdom's significance has severely diminished. ""What is the mascot of InBev, anyway?""

"(CNN)  -- Football legend Franz Beckenbauer has begun the mind games ahead of Germany's World Cup semifinal against Spain on Wednesday, describing his compatriots as ""the perfect team"" and calling them favorites to reach the final. Beckenbauer, who led Germany to twin World Cup triumphs as both a player and coach, showered praise on the current crop after the 4-0 quarterfinal rout of Argentina. ""This team, it's the masterpiece of Joachim Low. He has placed his mark on its make-up and created a perfect team,"" the 64-year-old told the German Football Federation's official website. ""I have rarely seen such mastery of the game from a German team. Perhaps only in the 1970s and the World Cup-winning team of 1990."" Saturday's win over Argentina was the third time in South Africa that Germany had scored four goals or more in a match and followed hard on the heels of the 4-1 rout of arch-rivals England. ""In the past, we would say that you had to leave the beautiful game in the dressing room, but this team shows that it is not a contradiction and that you can play well and win."" Beckenbauer has no doubt who will win when Germany faces European champions Spain in the semifinals in Durban. ""Germany have an advantage over Spain, who haven't yet shown the form that they did when winning the Euro 2008 title,"" he said. ""They haven't yet looked very convincing and struggled to snatch victory in the quarterfinals against Paraguay."" It is not the first time at these World Cup finals that Beckenbauer has spoken his mind. He was forced to apologize after claiming that England played ""kick and rush"" football and had ""gone backwards"" under coach Fabio Capello. But on reflection, his pre-match comments may have been prophetic as England disappointed hugely against the talented young German team and were well beaten.","Franz Beckenbauer lavishes praise on German team ahead of semifinal .

"(CNN)  -- Brazil coach Dunga has been sacked after their shock World Cup quarterfinal exit to the Netherlands. His side were beaten 2-1 on Friday after taking a first half lead and looking set to secure a place in the last four. ""The cycle of work started in 2006 and which culminated with the elimination of Brazil in the World Cup in South Africa is finished,"" said a statement on the official website of Brazilian football Confederation (CBF). ""The CBF announces the dismissal of the technical commission of the Brazilian team. The new commission will be announced at the end of July."" Dunga, 46, who skippered Brazil to the 1994 World Cup, had been national team coach since 2006 and led them to a Copa America triumph the following year. Despite his successful record, they also topped South American qualifying for the World Cup, Dunga had come under criticism at home for his side's alleged lack of attacking flair. And after the Port Elizabeth defeat to the Dutch, he indicated he would be standing down. However, on his arrival home on Sunday, Dunga did not rule out staying in the job. ""I am going to rest before meeting, in one or two weeks' time, the president of the CBF, Ricardo Teixeira to talk about it (extending his stay in charge),"" Dunga told a news conference, but his optimism was misplaced. With Brazil hosting the World Cup in 2014, Dunga's successor is obviously key and local media have already made Luiz Felipe Scolari the favorite. Scolari guided Brazil to their fifth World Cup triumph in 2002, but was less successful in his spell with English Premier League Chelsea where he was sacked. He is currently coaching at Brazilian club side Palmeiras. The Brazilian team received a hostile reception on their return home, with much of the fans' anger directed at Felipe Melo, who scored an own goal against the Dutch and was also sent off.","Brazil coach Dunga sacked after their World Cup exit to Netherlands .

"(CNN) -- France defender William Gallas has attacked former national coach Raymond Domenech, blaming him for the team's disastrous performance at the World Cup in South Africa. In an interview with French weekly culture magazine Les Inrockuptibles on Wednesday, Gallas became the first French player to speak about the disastrous World Cup campaign, saying that ""the real problem is the coach."" ""Les Bleus"" crashed out of the tournament in the first round after two draws and a defeat left them at the bottom of Group A with just one point. Forward Nicolas Anelka was sent home from the tournament after an argument with Domenech, causing the rest of the French side to strike from training. Domenech, as was decided before the competition began, has now been replaced by former World Cup winner Laurent Blanc. ""We all wanted to protest against the decision taken by the coach. Everyone was in agreement to boycott training,"" the 34-year-old Gallas said. He also hinted that Anelka's row with Domenech may not have been a one-off, as a lot of players found it difficult to build a relationship with the coach. ""Domenech wasn't open. Lots of players could not talk to him. He said that he listened to us, but at the end of the day he took decisions alone,"" said Gallas, who was given extra time to recover from injury by Domenech before being named in the 23-man squad for the finals. ""What we said didn't have any influence, so I no longer said anything. I listened and I did what he told me."" Gallas is still unhappy that he was overlooked by Domenech when Patrice Evra was named captain of France. ""The hardest thing was the way that it happened. Domenech never told me,"" said Gallas, who was vice-captain under former skipper Thierry Henry. ""I learnt by accident before the match against Costa Rica that the captain was Evra. I saw that the armband was on his shirt."" Gallas is searching for a club now that his contract with English Premier League side Arsenal has expired. On Wednesday, Arsenal signed French defender Laurent Koscielny from Lorient on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee. ""He has shown he is mentally strong, he's a fighter and a very strong competitor. Koscielny is a great addition to our squad,"" manager Arsene Wenger said in a statement on the club's official website. Meanwhile, 1998 World Cup winner Patrick Vieira has confirmed that he no longer wants to play for France. The midfielder will instead concentrate on his career at English club Manchester City. ""My target in the next few years is City. I want to do my best for the club,"" Vieira told the club's official website on Wednesday. The 34-year-old made his first appearance for Les Bleus 13 years ago and has more than 100 caps, but was controversially left out of France's World Cup squad by Domenech.","Gallas pins blame for disastrous French World Cup campaign on former coach Domenech .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of family members, friends and neighbors of four of the eight victims of a workplace shooting rampage gathered at funeral services around Manchester, Connecticut, on Saturday to share tears and memories. The four men who were laid to rest had each worked at Hartford Distributors for around 30 years before Omar Thornton's shooting spree Tuesday, which ended when he took his own life.

Jodi Rell has called for Monday to be a day of remembrance for the victims, asking state residents to observe a moment of silence at 9:15 a.m. On Friday, police arrested a woman they said had accepted stolen beer from a delivery truck driven by Thornton. Hartford Distributors said it had asked Thornton to resign after it found him stealing and selling alcoholic beverages. Thornton's girlfriend told CNN he was being racially harassed at work, but Hartford Distributors' president said Thursday that there were no grievances filed with the company or with Thornton's union.","The four men had worked for Hartford Distributors for around 30 years .

"(CNN) -- Two people aboard a twin-engine airplane were killed Saturday when it crashed into a house in western Pennsylvania, sending the homeowner fleeing with his dog, officials said. Westmoreland County Public Safety spokesman Dan Stevens said skies were clear when the aircraft ""just spun in its own axis"" and hit the Saltsburg area house, sparking a fire that consumed the plane and the house. The plane took off from Arnold Palmer Regional Airport outside Latrobe, about 50 miles from the crash scene, Stevens said. The Beechcraft Baron BE58 crashed 11 minutes later at 9:19 a.m., FAA spokesman Jim Peters said. The six-seat plane landed next to a man who was sleeping on a couch with his dog in the home, Stevens said. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette identified him as Steve Yanko. ""There was somebody on his shoulder this morning,"" Stevens said of Yanko, who told him he was only about 15 feet away from the plane's impact. Yanko's wife was not at home at the time, Stevens said. The county coroner will identify the two victims and their names will be released after next of kin are formally notified, officials said. Stevens said the experienced pilot of the plane had recently purchased the aircraft and was at the controls. The other individual was an instructor who was flying along to ensure the owner was comfortable with the twin-engine plane, he said. The FAA's Peters said he could not confirm the role of the two people onboard. The FAA was on scene Saturday. Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board will arrive Sunday. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.","NEW: Plane narrowly misses sleeping homeowner .

"Washington (CNN) -- What may be the most contentious Pentagon contract is the focus of yet another fight, with this round centered on whether a bid for a $35 billion contract should be thrown out because it arrived five minutes late. For about a decade the Air Force has been trying to replace its fleet of KC-135 air refueling tankers, the big jets that act as flying gas stations for warplanes. In the latest attempt, three companies wanted to submit bids to build the KC-X, the next generation of tankers; Boeing, EADS and US Aerospace. Each company's bid was required to be submitted to an office at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, by 2 p.m. July 9. Boeing and EADS got their bids into the office with time to spare. US Aerospace said its bid arrived at Wright-Patterson half an hour before the deadline. The Defense Department said it was five minutes late. US Aerospace is a new company that is in partnership with Antonov, a state-owned Ukrainian aircraft manufacturer that used to build planes for the Soviet Union's military and now specializes in building very large aircraft. Because of the late arrival of the bid, the Defense Department will not consider US Aerospace's proposal, according to Pentagon chief spokesman Geoff Morrell. ""We are not allowed by law to even review their proposal. It did not arrive in time. So we cannot consider it. We cannot review it,"" Morrell said. A spokesman for US Aerospace, Chuck Arnold, said the Defence Department ""still feel[s] the cold war is on"" and doesn't want US Aerospace to succeed in the bid. Morrell said the rules are clear. ""This is a $30 billion to $40 billion contract. That is not a high school homework assignment, OK? These deadlines count, and any professional contractor understands that,"" he said. Chuck Arnold, a spokesman for US Aerospace, said the bid proposal was on time. ""We have documented evidence that the messenger [who was carrying the bid] was there at 1:30."" But Wright-Patterson is a huge facility and the company said the messenger was held up at the gate, then got lost driving to the building where the bid needed to be. When the messenger and the bid proposal finally arrived at the proper location, the bid was marked as having arrived at 2:05. The company was told the bid would not be considered. US Aerospace is fighting that decision and asking that its bid proposal, which it said will save U.S. taxpayers millions of dollars and produce a better tanker plane, be considered. That might mean further delay in a process that began in 2002 and has been stopped and restarted twice. Morrell said he is confident that the dispute with US Aerospace will not slow the process again. ""Are we concerned about their protest that it might lead to a delay in the awarding of this contract? I don't believe so,"" Morrell said. ""This is going on. We will -- we will award this contract in the fall, as we always said we would.""","Contact to build air refueling tankers is worth $30-40 billion .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Senate failed Thursday to approve nearly $5 billion for a settlement between the Agriculture Department and minority farmers reached more than a decade ago, prompting finger pointing by members of both parties and outrage among many black farmers. ""We are very, very, very disappointed that we are just caught up in such a larger political fight in the Senate, where it's just partisan division,"" said John Boyd, founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association. ""It seems like for the trains leaving the station in the Senate, they manage not to have the black farmers on them,"" Boyd said, calling on President Barack Obama to help break the logjam. The 1997 Pigford v. Glickman case against the U.S. Agriculture Department was settled out of court 11 years ago. Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. In July, the House approved a war supplemental bill that included money to pay for the settlement. The attempt to approve the funds Thursday failed in the Senate after Republicans rejected a Democratic unanimous consent agreement to approve the money, with the GOP complaining about how the Democrats planned to pay for the settlement. It was the seventh attempt by the Senate to approve the funds in recent weeks, Boyd said. Prominent members of both parties have voiced support for paying out the settlements. ""Everyone that steps to the microphone says they support the black farmers,"" said Boyd. ""But they can't put aside their political bickering so the black farmers can get on with their lives."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid blamed Republicans for the impasse. ""Securing justice for those have been wronged should never be a partisan issue,"" he said in a Thursday statement. ""But that's exactly what Republicans have made it."" ""If Republicans cannot put aside their obstructionist tactics so that we can settle a non-controversial, non-partisan issue like this,"" Reid said, ""on what will they agree to work with Democrats?"" Boyd declined to lay blame at the feet of Republicans alone. ""I think one party is just as responsible as the other,"" he said.","The Senate failed to approve nearly $5 billion for a settlement with minority farmers .

"(CNN) -- As you sift through your pockets Friday looking for change to pay the parking meter, stop and take a moment to wish it a happy birthday. It was on this day 75 years ago that the first parking meter was installed. And 75 long years later, these coin-gulping contraptions remain as despised as they were when the first 150 of them were put in place in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on July 16, 1935. Concerned that parked cars -- that sometimes never moved for weeks -- were hurting downtown businesses, city officials were eager for a solution, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society. Enter Carl Magee. It's not surprising that one of the most hated urban fixtures was designed by someone who practiced not one, but two, of -- what polls have consistently found to be -- America's most despised professions: law and journalism. As soon as the meters went up that humid day in July, incensed residents gave them the thumbs down. A case contesting the legality of meters was quickly settled in the city's favor, wrote Michael Dean of the Oklahoma Historical Society. Stores on city blocks with meters saw an increase in business and profit. And soon every block wanted some. By 1941, 140,000 were in use, the Smithsonian Magazine wrote. Today, the number is in the millions in the United States alone. Magee left his job as editor of a daily newspaper and started a parking meter company. The design of the device has remained largely unchanged over time. So, happy 75th anniversary, parking meter. One can only assume that the 75th anniversary of the first parking ticket is just days away.","First parking meters were installed in Oklahoma City on July 16, 1935 .

"(CNN) -- Bill Haslam, the mayor of Knoxville and considered a moderate Republican, easily won the Tennessee GOP primary for governor Thursday, the Associated Press projected. With 76 percent of the state's precincts in, AP reported Haslam had 48.2 percent of the vote as he defeated Congressman Zach Wamp and Lt. Gov. Ron Ramsey. Halsam, who helped fund some of his own campaign, will now face Mike McWherter, a Democratic businessman and son of a former governor. The race is to succeed Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, who is prevented by term limits from running for a third term. Political handicappers think Republicans have a good shot at winning back the governor's office. Republican Governors Association spokesman Tim Murtaugh in a statement: ""Bill Haslam emerges as a strong candidate headed toward November, having beaten a pair of qualified office holders in a spirited primary. As Tennessee faces great economic challenges, Bill Haslam will be a strong voice for job creation, fiscal restraint and individual freedom. ""A successful mayor and businessman, he has the leadership experience necessary to create jobs and grow the economy. We look forward to seeing him elected the next governor of Tennessee."" Democratic Governors Association executive director Nathan Daschle said, ""Mike McWherter has spent his career growing jobs and strengthening the economy. The only thing Bill Haslam has increased in his career is Knoxville's taxes and unemployment rate."" ""Voters are looking for someone with the know-how to move the state in the right direction, and that candidate is Mike McWherter,"" Daschle added. The race grabbed national attention last month because of controversial comments by two of the challengers. Wamp appeared to suggest that Tennessee should consider secession in light of mandates forced on the states by the Obama administration's health care bill. The eight-term congressman later stepped back from those comments. Ramsey also drew attention to himself last month after he was seen in a YouTube video questioning whether Islam is a religion. He was expressing his opposition to the expansion of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, which has become a hot-button issue in the city about 35 miles southeast of Nashville. Ramsey, who has been endorsed by 20 Tea Party organizations, said he is a supporter of religious freedoms, but such protections may not extend to bringing ""Shariah [Islamic] law into the state of Tennessee ... into the United States."" ""Now, you could even argue whether being a Muslim is actually a religion, or is it a nationality, way of life, a cult, whatever you want to call it,"" he continued. ""But certainly we do protect our religions, but at the same time, this is something we are going to have to face."" Following criticism, Ramsey defended his comments, saying, ""My concern is that far too much of Islam has come to resemble a violent political philosophy more than peace-loving religion."" In a high-profile Congressional primary, AP projected two-term Democratic Rep. Steve Cohen overwhelmingly defeated former Memphis Mayor Willie Herenton. The campaign in the 9th District, which covers Memphis and has a large African-American population, was dominated by race. With 78 percent of precincts in, AP says Cohen had 79.4 percent of the vote to Herenton's 20.6 percent. Herenton has been urging voters to elect him as the only African-American member of the state's congressional delegation, saying, ""It is as if only white people live in the great state of Tennessee. No African-Americans. I believe that it is very clear to the majority of the citizens of this community that we lack representation."" Cohen, who served as a state lawmaker in the area before being elected to Congress, has campaigned on what he's done for education and health care in the area. ""I represent everybody and I work hard for people to get them opportunities. And I just think that race should not be an issue in 2010,"" he said. President Barack Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus backed Cohen. AP projected Stephen Fincher the winner in the 8th District Republican primary. Finch has 50 percent of the vote over Ron Kirkland at 24.6 percent and George Flinn at 22.2 percent. The race, for Rep. John Tanner's seat, is noteworthy because the Center for Responsible Politics has called it the most expensive House primary in the country, . Finch will face Roy Herron, the projected winner of the Democratic primary, in November AP projects him the winner in the Democratic 8th District Primary.","NEW: Cohen is projected winner of GOP 9th district primary .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuba's Fidel Castro on Tuesday said he would publish a new book in August on the fighting more than 50 years ago between his ragtag rebels and the 10,000-strong army under former dictator Fulgencio Batista. In an essay published Tuesday on the state-run website, www.cubadebate.cu, Castro said the book will be called ""The Strategic Victory."" ""I didn't know whether to call it 'Batista's Last Offensive' or 'How 300 Defeated 10,000,' which would sound like a science fiction story,"" he said. Castro said the 25 chapters contain photos, maps and illustrations of the weapons used during a series of battles that lasted 74 days in 1958 and paved the way for his bearded revolutionaries to declare victory on January 1, 1959. ""The enemy suffered more than 1,000 losses, more than 300 of them deaths and 443 taken prisoner,"" he wrote. Castro went on to rule Cuba for 47 years until he was sidelined by illness in 2006. He has spent most of the last four years in seclusion, writing frequent essays called ""Reflections of Comrade Fidel"" for state-run media. In recent weeks, he has re-emerged on the public stage, making seven public appearances. On Monday, Cuba celebrated the 57th anniversary of the launching of Castro's Revolution. He failed to appear at that event in central Cuba despite high expectations, but he paid tribute at a small ceremony in Havana to the rebels who were killed. Castro also held lengthy talks with a group of artists. Both events were later broadcast on state TV. Castro said he would now start work on a book covering the second half of the fighting, called ""The Final Strategic Counteroffensive.""","Fidel Castro says he has a new book, titled ""The Strategic Victory""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Government Accountability Office Wednesday released the results of its undercover investigation looking at deceptive and questionable marketing practices at 15 for-profit colleges in six states and Washington, D.C. The written report was presented at a hearing Wednesday of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee, and was accompanied by video of the undercover applicants interacting with recruiters from the various educational institutions. In his opening statement, committee chairman Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said that the evidence points to a systemic problem within the for-profit education system. ""Are students -- and U.S. taxpayers -- getting good value for the billions of dollars they are investing in these schools?"" he asked, according to his prepared remarks. According to the report, all 15 schools were guilty of some sort of dodgy statements in information about ""the college's accreditation, graduation rates and its student's prospective employment and salary qualifications, duration and cost of the program, or financial aid"" that they passed on to the GAO undercover applicants. At one college, school officials told the GAO applicant that after completing an associate's degree in criminal justice, the applicant could try to go to work for the FBI or the CIA. In fact, a bachelor's degree is the minimum requirement for positions like FBI special agent or CIA clandestine officer, although there are other lower-level positions for which an applicant could apply. At a small beauty college, the undercover applicant was told that barbers can earn $150,000-$200,000 per year. Although this is possible, 90 percent of barbers make less than $43,000 per year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Obama administration has proposed rules to limit federal student aid funds to for-profit career colleges that do not prepare students for ""gainful employment"" in recognized occupations. ""While career colleges play a vital role in training our workforce to be globally competitive, some of them are saddling students with debt they cannot afford in exchange for degrees and certificates they cannot use,"" according to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. The proposed law uses two criteria for judging the for-profit career colleges: the relationship between the debt that students incur verses their income potential, and the rate at which the students repay their college loans. According to the GAO, ""enrollment in for-profit colleges has grown from about 365,000 students to almost 1.8 million in the last several years. ""These colleges offer degrees and certifications in programs ranging from business administration to cosmetology. In 2009, students at for-profit colleges received more than $4 billion in Pell Grants and more than $20 billion in federal loans provided by the Department of Education,"" the agency's summary said. The GAO report also found that many programs at the for-profit colleges studied cost ""substantially more for associate's degrees and certificates than comparable degrees and certificates at public colleges nearby. ""A student interested in a massage therapy certificate costing $14,000 at a for-profit college was told that the program was a good value. However the same certificate from a local community college cost $520,"" a summary of the report on the GAO website said. Alan Collinge, founder of the group Student Loan Justice, thinks the federal government should broaden its research. ""The problem goes well beyond the for-profit sector; it permeates academia generally, including community colleges and four year universities,"" he said. Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyoming, also suggested looking beyond the current probe. ""In focusing on for-profits, we are not being objective, and we are ignoring the bigger picture of what is happening across all of higher education,"" he said at the hearing.","GAO report found many for-profit colleges used deceptive and questionable marketing practices .

"Oxford, England (CNN) -- The first coffeehouse to open in England, a still-operating café on High Street in Oxford, is more than a place to get a beef and horseradish sandwich, according to author and blogger Steven Berlin Johnson. It represents a turning point in Western culture that helped usher in nearly 500 years of scientific and cultural progress. The reason: Until coffee and tea became popular, ""alcohol was the daytime drink of choice,"" he told the TED Global conference in Oxford on Tuesday. Water wasn't safe to drink, so wine, beer or gin was a better choice for breakfast, lunch and dinner. ""Until the rise of the coffeehouse, the entire population was effectively drunk all day,"" Johnson said in a talk aimed at explaining how ideas get started. ""If you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life, you would have better ideas."" Moreover, the setting of a coffeehouse, which encourages the mixing of people from different backgrounds, is perfect for sharing and crafting innovative thoughts. ""An astonishing number of innovations have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story,"" he said. Great ideas often don't result from a single ""eureka"" moment, but instead come from what Johnson called ""the slow hunch,"" as they evolve and interact with other ideas. He traced the development of GPS technology, starting in the 1950s with efforts by Western scientists to track the Russian Sputnik spacecraft. And that same GPS technology now can help you find a nearby coffeehouse that will serve you a soy latte, Johnson joked. Mixing and sharing ideas was one of the themes of the opening speakers at TED Global, where the theme is ""And Now the Good News."" Matt Ridley, author of ""The Rational Optimist,"" says the sharing of ideas -- or in his phrase, ""ideas having sex with each other"" -- is a tremendously powerful force driving human progress. Watch Matt Ridley's talk at TED.com . Exchanging ideas allows tremendous specialization of labor, to the point where no single person can fully understand what it takes to create an object as complex as a computer mouse, which relies on the efforts of millions in industries as diverse as the oil industry that creates the plastics to the coffeehouse that supplies a drink to the product's designer. ""We've created something called the collective brain,"" Ridley said. ""We're just the nodes, the neurons in the brain ... "" ""As we go forward, we will of course experience terrible things. There will be wars, there will be natural disasters ... but because of the connections people are making and the ability of ideas to meet and mate as never before, I'm also sure that living standards will advance ... we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation."" A tripling of the productivity of agricultural land in past decades has saved some of the tropical rainforest and Ridley predicted that rainforests could start increasing in the second half of the century as the human population peaks and starts to decline. Other ideas were mixing and mating in Oxford at the first day of TED Global, which is a product of the nonprofit TED, dedicated to ""ideas worth spreading."" It holds conferences and makes videos of its speakers available at http://www.ted.com/. [CNN partners with TED to present a TEDTalk every week, with added content, on CNN.com] . Among the ideas were these: . China's rise not a cause for fear . Joseph Nye of Harvard University, the influential thinker and former assistant defense secretary, cautioned against equating the rise of China and Asia with the decline of America and the West. He pointed to recurrent and groundless fears of U.S. decline over the past 50 years and noted that in the larger story of history, Asia is regaining influence that it had 200 years ago, before the Industrial Revolution. China's gain doesn't have to be the West's loss: ""If China develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with carbon emissions, that's good for us,"" Nye said. Cause of the 21st century: Ending oppression of women . Sheryl WuDunn, the author of ""Half the Sky"" with her husband, Nicholas Kristof, said the 19th century's central moral challenge was ending slavery, the 20th century's was ending totalitarianism and this century must be about freeing and empowering women. ""More girls have been discriminated to death"" in past decades, she said, than people killed on the battlefields of the 20th century. Educating girls and bringing them into the work force limits population growth, since educated women tend to have significantly fewer children. She told the story of an aid worker who saw horrible things happen in Darfur without breaking down. In the backyard of the woman's grandmother, back in the U.S., she saw a bird feeder and broke down in tears. ""We have the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted,"" she said, and we can feed and house ourselves and even put out food so wild birds won't starve in the winter. Americans and those in other Western countries ""have all won the lottery of life,"" and have an obligation to help people throughout the world. Strength of a nation isn't how much it can produce . Nic Marks, founder of the Center for Well-being at the New Economics Foundation in London, said all the daily measures people hear in the news relating to stock prices, exchange rates and gross domestic product emphasize greed without tapping into human happiness. ""Our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce,"" Marks said, quoting Robert Kennedy's famous statement that ""the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile."" ""How crazy is that?"" Marks said. Surveys show people want happiness, love and health more than they want wealth. ""These are natural human aspirations, why are statisticians not measuring that, instead of being fixated on how much stuff we have?"" The liberating power of cartoons . Patrick Chappatte, an editorial cartoonist based in Switzerland, picked up on the theme of questionable consumerism by showing a cartoon of Steve Jobs making a pitch for the iPhone: ""It'll simplify a lot of tasks you never had to do before."" A man sees a newspaper vendor's poster: ""Print media is dying,"" and says ""I already read that on the internet yesterday."" The punchline of another cartoon: ""The internet has changed music. Before we had to go to the store to steal it. And yet another, showing a confessional as someone behind a curtain says ""Father, I've sinned,"" and the priest, Googling the parishioner on a computer screen says, ""I know."" Cartoons are in the middle of a clash of civilizations, Chappatte said, as free expression collides with those who want to enforce religious orthodoxy around the world. For dictators around the world, he said, ""good news is when cartoonists, activists and journalists shut up."" And when their ideas stop having sex.","Speakers at TED Global conference in Oxford stress connections between ideas .
Matt Ridley: Ideas ""have sex,"" multiplying their value and driving up living standards .
Steven Berlin Johnson: Great ideas aren't born overnight but evolve over time .
Human happiness is not about producing and acquiring more things, they say ."
"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN)  -- A South African white supremacist group has retracted its statement vowing to avenge the killing of its leader, Eugene Terreblanche, a spokesman for the group said Monday. ""The statement was made by an emotional member of our organization,"" said Pieter Steyn, a spokesman for the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, also called the Afrikaner Resistance Movement or AWB. ""The person has been reprimanded. We want a homeland where we can govern ourselves, and violence is not going to do our cause any good."" Terreblanche was killed Saturday following an apparent dispute over wages with workers on his farm, according to South African police. Two of his farm workers ages 21 and 16 are scheduled to appear in court Tuesday after turning themselves in, police said. Police said the 69-year-old was bludgeoned and stabbed to death with clubs and a machete in an attack at his farm near the town of Ventersdorp in South Africa's North West Province. Steyn told CNN he is pleased with the work of the South African police, who said there would be a heavy police presence at Tuesday's court appearance. The AWB has blamed the killing on the singing of a controversial apartheid-era song, ""Shoot the Farmer."" The ruling African National Congress party's youth leader, Julius Malema, had sung the song in recent weeks until a court ruling barred him from doing so. Steyn called on South African President Jacob Zuma to act to ease tensions. ""He needs to address Julius Malema urgently,"" Steyn said. ""We are finding it difficult to keep our members calm under the current circumstances. If farm murders continue, we cannot guarantee that our members will continue refraining from retaliating."" Terreblanche's death comes amid a time of racial polarization in the country. Analysis: Terreblanche's death stokes racial tensions . Zuma on Sunday appealed for calm Sunday amid fears the killing of notorious white supremacist Eugene Terreblanche could stoke racial tensions in the country. In a statement on the South African presidency's Web site, Zuma said he had spoken to Terreblanche's daughter to express his ""sincere condolences."" ""I call upon our people, black and white to remain calm, and allow police and other organs of state to do their work,"" Zuma said. Terreblanche's AWB is best known for trying to block South Africa's effort to end apartheid. The group used terrorist tactics in a bid to stall the country's first all-race vote in 1994, killing more than 20 people in a wave of bombings on the eve of the elections. Terreblanche was convicted of the 1996 attempted murder of Paul Motshabi, a black man who worked as a security guard on Terreblanche's farm. He served about two-thirds of a five-year sentence. He was also convicted of setting his dog on a black man in an earlier incident. CNN's Robyn Curnow and Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report from Johannesburg.","AWB spokesman retracts vow to avenge leader's death .

"OXFORD, Iowa (CNN) -- Kathy Tandy was so big, she got weighed on the town's cattle scales. It was the only way she could get an accurate measurement of her weight. Kathy Tandy went from 432 pounds to 260 pounds by walking and watching what she eats. ""It was humiliating,"" she says. ""It was awful."" At her worst, the mother of four tipped the scales at 432 pounds. She couldn't go to the movies or fly on an airplane. The seats were too small. She was embarrassed to go to restaurants. People gawked. ""When you go to like a restaurant or to a park and have a picnic, you hear people say, 'Oh, that woman over there is eating a cheeseburger. She doesn't need to be eating a cheeseburger,' or 'Oh my God, she's going to break that chair,'"" she says.  Watch ""Don't let it get you down"" » . ""So I just kind of stayed away from everybody and didn't go out. I stayed home."" She became depressed and consumed herself in food, devouring 8,000 to 10,000 calories a day. ""Anything I could get my hands on,"" says Tandy, who makes doughnuts and other treats at the Depot convenience store in Oxford, Iowa, a town of about 700. She reached her lowest point just before Christmas in 1996. ""My kids wanted to buy me an outfit for Christmas and they couldn't find one big enough, and they had to tell me that,"" she says. ""So I thought it was time to do something about it. When my kids can't stand the way I look, I thought I better do something."" Tandy called her doctor just before New Year's Eve that year and was put on a calorie-counting regimen. Tandy first detailed her story for a book called ""The Oxford Project,"" which combines black-and-white photographs of the town's residents -- one from 1984, a second 20 years later -- with oral histories to give a portrait of small-town America.  Meet ""old hippie"" who parties hard, and other town residents » . ""Everyone in town has always known me as 'the Big Girl,' "" she said in the book. ""I couldn't take a bath, because I couldn't get out of the tub. The body odor problems were awful. You get up and walk to the other side of the room, and you break into a sweat."" CNN recently caught up with Tandy on a sunny Sunday in Oxford. Her doctor diagnosed her as a compulsive overeater. She began counting calories and cut back on food. A housewife at the time with a bakery in her home, Tandy also started walking. iReport.com: Share your weight-loss success story . ""My previous diet was, I got up in the morning and ate until I went to bed. Now, I watch what I eat. I portion,"" she said. She keeps two journals: one to track her food and the other to track her mood, ""because my emotions control my diet."" She begins her day about 4 every morning with a bowl of cereal before heading to work. She has a snack of fruit and toast by mid-morning. Lunch consists of salad or soup and a sandwich. She has a healthy snack in the afternoon, followed by a closely calorie-watched supper. She tried an array of diets over the years, from Atkins to South Beach, before settling into just eating sensibly. The 5-foot-8-inch woman went from her peak weight of 432 pounds to 220 pounds four years ago, shedding nearly half her weight. Tandy had a heart attack and other health issues around that time. She now weighs 260 pounds and is hoping to get back down to 220. Is she enjoying life more? ""Oh, heavens, yes,"" she says. She has five grandchildren, and thanks to her weight loss, she can ""get down and play with them."" ""I can run with them, and I can do things that I thought I could never do."" Traveling is one of those things. She's flown to Europe four times. Before the weight loss, she says, ""I couldn't get onto an airplane. The seats weren't wide enough. I would have to go first-class and I couldn't afford that, and they couldn't guarantee I could fit on the seats. I couldn't walk on the plane. They had to take me on by wheelchair."" Her message to others in a similar situation is simple: ""It can depress you, but don't let it get you down. If it does, call your doctor. That's what those doctors are for. They're there to help get you through the rough times. And look for a good support system."" Luckily, she says, she's had a tremendous support group in her family and the residents of Oxford, who rooted her on to weight-loss success. ""Some people don't have that, but there are groups out there, whether it's just a group to go talk to once a week or somebody to get on the telephone,"" Tandy says. ""You're going to fall off the wagon. Just get back up and go again. Everybody does that.""","Kathy Tandy went from 432 pounds to 260 pounds by eating sensibly .

"(CNN) -- California Rep. Maxine Waters is pressing the House ethics panel to set her trial date before the midterm elections in November. ""I have made a very public request to come out with the formalized charges and to set up a meeting to hear them,"" she said Thursday in an interview with KCRW, a public radio station in Santa Monica, California. ""Let's hope that they do it,"" she said. The 10-term congresswoman is accused of violating House rules by seeking federal assistance for a bank with financial ties to her husband. According to a House ethics committee report, Waters helped arrange a meeting in September 2008 between Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank and Treasury Department officials. OneUnited Bank ultimately received $12 million in bailout funds. Waters is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. According to Waters' 2008 financial disclosure statement -- as mentioned in the report -- her husband had two investments in OneUnited at the time of the meeting. They were valued between $500,000 and $1 million. ""There is substantial reason to believe that Rep. Waters' conduct may have violated"" House rules, the report concludes. Waters, who represents the Watts section of Los Angeles, insists she did nothing wrong. ""I have not violated any House rules,"" she said in a statement Monday. ""I simply will not be forced to admit to something I did not do."" Waters asserted that ""the record will clearly show that in advocating on behalf of minority banks neither my office nor I benefited in any way, engaged in improper action or influenced anyone. ... The case against me has no merit."" Waters has asked The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct to make public the formal charges against her. ""All I know is that I have not been charged, that there has been a report that was released that said further investigation,"" Waters said. ""Most people don't have a clue about what these charges are supposed to be and we're eager to get the information out."" The announcement this week by the ethics committee means Waters, 71, may now face a trial by committee members tasked with determining whether there is ""clear and convincing evidence"" she broke congressional rules. Rep. Charlie Rangel, D-New York, is also facing a possible ethics committee trial. Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has been accused of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. Both trials could take place in September, only a few weeks before the midterm elections. The prospect of inquiries into two high-profile Democrats has compounded the fears of congressional Democrats nervous about their prospects in November. ""I think that there should be a process that works for everybody. It should be fair,"" Waters said. ""People's due process should not be trampled on. I think it's unfortunate that these cases have been handled the way they've been handled."" The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation. Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America.","California Rep.

"Krobo, Ghana (CNN) -- A new generation of Ghanaians are rediscovering their heritage -- and rediscovering the appeal of traditional beads. Many Ghanaians used to associate beads with an old-fashioned coming-of-age ritual for girls. But not anymore. Tairee, a student at the University of Ghana, is proud to wear traditional beads. ""It's coming back into fashion,"" she told CNN. ""People can actually wear them on their necks and as parts of their clothing. I don't think they are old fashioned. It's coming back."" But it's not just women who are fans. Masoom, another University of Ghana student, said he thought women looked good in beads. ""It's attractive,"" he told CNN. ""They [women] are more African when they wear their beads than usual. Especially when they wear it around their waist; it brings out the shape of their waist, and it's real attractive."" Rwanda lives rugby dream in Hong Kong . According to a local market trader, the bead revival is a sign that young Ghanaians are experiencing what she called ""sankofa."" ""There's a culture of 'sankofa:' Go back and retrieve what you've left behind,"" said bead-shop owner Ernestina Anafu. ""There was a period when they [young people] shunned beads; they said it was archaic, it was no longer fashionable. Since this period of 'sankofa' people are going traditional again."" Beads have a long history in Ghana. They were once the king's currency, according to E.B.T. Sikapa, an organizer for the first Ghana International Beads Festival. He told CNN that beads were once exchanged for slaves, alcoholic drinks, and textiles. Central African Gorillas may become extinct . While beads are no longer used as currency, they are still valuable to Ghana. The Ghanaian government has recognized the potential of the bead industry as a tourist attraction and in foreign trade. Kati Torda, owner of Sun Trade Beads, has seen her exports -- mostly to Europe -- increase from five-percent of her revenue eight years ago, to 50 percent last year. Now she's looking to grow her business even more as she expands her product lines. ""Because of that new potential, we don't just produce necklaces and bracelets, we produce home decoration,"" Torda told CNN. ""Of course, the potential is endless."" At a local market, some of the beads on sale are over 100 years old, recovered from burial grounds. But there are other, less ghoulish, forms of recycling being used, with some beads produced from recycled materials such as glass bottles. ""Ghana can teach a thing or two to the world about recycling,"" said Torda. But the new-found popularity of beads isn't just about giving old materials a new lease of life -- it's about breathing new life into traditional ideas. ""They [the beads] mean so much to me,"" Tairee told CNN. ""It's not just colors. Where I'm from, if you wear something like blue it's purity, white is fertility, gold is wealth. I know what it means, so its so precious to me."" CNN's Richard Lui and Mark Tutton contributed to this report .","Young Ghanaians are rediscovering traditional beads .

"(CNN)  -- Ida has been downgraded from a tropical storm to a tropical depression as it lost momentum during its approach to the U.S. Gulf Coast early Tuesday. But the storm is still spreading plenty of rain across the Southeast, generally 3 to 6 inches with isolated maximum storm totals of 8 inches. This could continue through Wednesday evening from the eastern Gulf Coast into the Southern Mid-Atlantic states. ""Ida has lost tropical characteristics and its winds are expected to slowly diminish during the next day or so,"" according to a 10 a.m. ET advisory from the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. Ida made its initial landfall at 6:40 a.m. ET at Dauphin Island, Alabama, which is located five miles off the Alabama coast, the center said. Ida made another landfall around 8 a.m. ET just northwest of Bon Secour, Alabama, an advisory said. Maximum sustained winds have decreased to near 35 mph with higher gusts, the center said. Ida is moving toward the northeast near 9 mph. Track the path of Tropical Storm Ida . The storm was about 30 miles east-southeast of Mobile, Alabama, and about 25 miles west-northwest of Pensacola, Florida, the latest advisory said. The hurricane center said the tropical depression advisory is the last one they will issue on the storm system.

"(CNN) -- Seven-time champion Lance Armstrong reflected ruefully on Monday's incident-packed second stage of the Tour de France, which saw Sylvain Chavanel claim the first yellow jersey of his career following a spate of crashes. The Frenchman moved almost three minutes ahead of previous leader Fabian Cancellara with his victory on the 201-kilometer leg from Brussels to Spa in Belgium. The Quick Step rider was the last remaining member of an eight-man breakaway that he led at the 10-kilometer mark, with the 123-strong peloton coming home together after refusing to race further following another day of crashes in difficult conditions. Saxo Bank's brothers Andy and Franck Schleck both went down on the Stockeu climb -- also part of the Liege classic where Chavanel cracked his skull in April. Armstrong and titleholder Alberto Contador also lost time following spills, and the three main groups closed ranks to negotiate the slippery descents. American Armstrong dropped one place to fifth, being 3:19 off the leader in what is the 38-year-old's final attempt at winning the race. ""It was a rough day. I've got a couple of good abrasions -- one on the hip, one on the elbow,"" Armstrong told the Team RadioShack website. ""Coming down the descent of the Stockeu, it was as if someone had put something on the road, it was so surreal. There was no way to stay on your bike, there were people everywhere. ""As we got back on our bikes and started to re-descend, we just kept coming across more and more crashes... motorbikes, TV cameras -- it was just bad luck."" Chavanel came home almost four minutes clear of the bunch to take a lead of two minutes and 57 seconds into Tuesday's third stage from Wanze across the border to Arenberg Porte du Hainaut in France. Prologue winner Cancellara, who negotiated the pact between the riders, will start the day in second place ahead of Columbia's young German Tony Martin and Garmin's British rider David Millar. Spain's Contador was seventh behind Team Sky's Geraint Thomas, while Armstrong's RadioShack teammate Levi Leipheimer was eighth -- 3:25 behind Chavanel. Columbia's sprint specialist Mark Cavendish, who won six stages last year and four in 2008, fell almost 10 minutes off the pace as he finished back in 148th. Italian rider Alessandro Petacchi, who won a similarly crash-hit stage one on Sunday, was 13:37 adrift of Chavanel after finishing 157th.","Crashes mar the second stage of the Tour de France, won by Sylvain Chavanel .

"(CNN Student News) -- March is Women's History Month, a federally recognized, nationwide celebration that encourages all Americans to reflect on the ways in which women have shaped U.S. history. But how did this celebration come to be, and why is it held in March? ""I long to hear that you have declared an independency, and by the way, in the new code of laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies..."" Abigail Adams, March 31, 1776 . Almost two hundred years after Abigail Adams made this request to her husband, John, the passage of Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments meant no person could be denied the benefits of a federally funded educational program or activity on the basis of gender. In 1977, to help school principals comply with Title IX regulations, an education task force in Sonoma County, California recommended a ""Women's History Week"" celebration for 1978. The task force believed that school and community events highlighting and celebrating the contributions of American women would help provide a foundation and rationale for Title IX changes. The commission chose the week of March 8 to coincide with International Women's Day, which had been established in the early 1900s to honor the movement for women's rights. Within a few years, dozens of California schools were participating in Women's History Week. In 1979, representatives from the Sonoma County Women's History Week group shared their experiences with national leaders of women's organizations at a Women's History Institute at Sarah Lawrence College, and word of the Women's History Week celebrations spread. In March 1980, President Jimmy Carter issued a message encouraging Americans to recognize and celebrate women's historic accomplishments during the week of March 8th, Women's History Week. Later that year, Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and Maryland Representative Barbara Mikulski co-sponsored the first Joint Congressional Resolution declaring a ""National Women's History Week"" for the week of March 8, 1981. In 1987, Congress expanded the week to a month. Since 1992, every U.S. president has issued a proclamation declaring March to be Women's History Month. Facts and Figures on U.S. Women .

"Editor's note: This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming, six-hour television event, ""God's Warriors,"" hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Madeleine Albright: ""In order to effectively conduct foreign policy today, you have to understand the role of God and religion."" WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As U.S. secretary of state under former President Clinton, Madeleine Albright invested long hours in the Middle East peace process. She wrote about the relationship between politics and religion in her 2006 book, ""The Mighty and the Almighty."" CNN producer Jen Christensen recently spoke with Albright for ""God's Warriors."" Here is an edited portion of their conversation: . CNN: Growing up I was told that in polite conversation you never talk about two things: politics and religion; however, our documentary, ""God's Warriors,"" is going to do just that. Part of the problem though in looking at these issues is the loaded quality of the language. Even our starting point. We essentially had to create a term, ""God's Warriors,"" as the traditional term ""fundamentalism"" seemed problematic. Did you encounter the same problem when you were writing ""The Mighty and the Almighty""? Watch the making of the TV special ""God's Warriors"" » . Albright: Well, I think it's a very hard term, fundamentalism, as you're obviously finding. Historically, it's a term that described Christians who believed that everything that was in the Bible was exactly so. But now it's been used to describe everybody in the three Abrahamic religions who is conservative or reactionary. One of the things that I found in writing my book [was] that fundamentalism was a term that I was having trouble with. Because it has gotten ascribed to it a lot of negative associations. CNN: In your book, you argue for a better understanding of religion in the U.S. foreign policy arena. Isn't that a revolutionary idea for this generation of diplomats trained more in the realist school of foreign policy? Albright: As a practitioner of foreign policy, I certainly come from the generation of people who used to say, ""X problem is complicated enough. Let's not bring God and religion into it."" But through my being in office, and as I explored the subject much further in writing ""The Mighty and the Almighty,"" I really thought that the opposite is true. In order to effectively conduct foreign policy today, you have to understand the role of God and religion. ... My sense is that we don't fully understand, because one, it's pretty complicated, and two, everyone in the U.S. believes in a separation of church and state, so you think, ""Well, if we don't believe in the convergence of church and state, then perhaps we shouldn't worry about the role of religion."" I think we do that now at our own peril. Religion is instrumental in shaping ideas and policies. It's an essential part of everyday life in a whole host of countries. And obviously it plays a role in how these countries behave, so we need to know what the religious influence is. CNN: We interviewed a human rights lawyer in Jerusalem, Danny Seidemann, who has on occasion helped peace negotiators in Israel get ready for talks. He said one of the main problems with President Clinton's Camp David [talks] was that a lot of the preparation was done by ""yuppies in Ramallah, yuppies in Tel Aviv and yuppies in the Beltway."" And that they didn't really understand the religious people who in the end would have to buy into the results of the negotiations in order for them to succeed. He said without that understanding the agreement was doomed. Albright: Well, I can't say I fully agree with him. I've talked about what I think we did right and what we did wrong at Camp David. I think that there was a mistake made, which was not understanding how difficult the issue of Jerusalem and the holy places would be. If Jerusalem was just a real estate issue, we would have resolved it a long time ago. But because the parties believe that God gave them that piece of land, then obviously there's another presence in the room that we needed to take into account. I disagree with the statement because President Clinton knew a great deal about the religious background. I had the honor of working for two democratic presidents, President Carter and President Clinton, and they're both very religious and both very knowledgeable about the religious backgrounds of the Middle East. CNN: The fate of Jerusalem seems to be a particularly tricky issue. Albright: Anybody that can really solve that issue is a Solomon. With this being holy to all three of the Abrahamic religions, it's very difficult. And religion, rather than bringing people together on this, is driving them apart, which ... I don't think [is] what is intended. It's so interesting; we're talking about the whole issue of sovereignty here. Because the parties both believed that God gave them that little piece of land, we started playing with a term, which was that it belonged to God. Divine sovereignty. Anybody who's been to Jerusalem can see why it is so complicated. Physically, religious holy places are completely intertwined, one on top of the other. So in many ways, there's great appeal to saying it belongs to God, and then trying to figure out how it [is] administered, maybe through some international group of some kind. CNN: Is Jerusalem a place where we could have this kind of utopian area, where the three faiths could all live peacefully together? Albright: Well, ideally, though it certainly doesn't seem that way at this point. And while the United States or the [Mideast] Quartet needs to play a key role in what to do with Jerusalem, ultimately the parties there in Israel are the ones that have to make the hard decisions. If there ever is a will to do this, just think about the incredible opportunities here. People would be able to learn about all three of these great religions in the same place. They'd be able to see how they relate to each other. It does sound a little utopian, well, very utopian at this point, but Jerusalem is an incredible place. I found the first time I went to Jerusalem, my initial reaction was, people are arguing over all this all the time, it made me think, well, there can't be a God, why would God put up with this? And then I had the total opposite reaction. One that stays with me, which is that there are so many holy places and symbols there, and all anybody talks about is their relationship to those symbols and to God, and therefore the power of God must be so strong there. I just think that it would be much better if people could figure out ... how to agree about it. CNN: So, therefore, how to figure out the fate Jerusalem is the perfect example of why we need to include religious understanding in our foreign policy. Albright: Definitely. I am not a theologian, and I have not turned into a religious mystic, but I am a practical problem solver. So I'm looking at religion from the perspective of how knowledge about what people believe in can be useful in terms of trying to resolve the most serious disputes. I think one of the major problems is that here in the United States, particularly, there is very little understanding of Islam. We all act as if Islam is a monolithic religion and that all Muslims live in the Middle East. The bottom line is most Muslims in the world don't live in the Middle East. They live in Indonesia, or Malaysia, or India, um, Pakistan. Second, there are a number of different sects within Islam. Now I think more people understand the difference between Shia and Sunni, but that is just the beginning. We really do not know anything about it. I think it behooves our diplomats to be very knowledgeable about religion when they are sent to a country. They obviously learn the language and the history [and] culture; they also need to learn about the religion, too. CNN: What impact has the religious right had on politics? Albright: Everybody ... has [an] impact on politics, that's what democracy is about. I think they have more of an impact on domestic than foreign policy. CNN: But you mention in your book that some gave you a hard time when you were the U.S. representative to the U.N. Albright: Well, the extremists really are very nervous in terms of the question of sovereignty and the creation of an international organization, which they misinterpret to be world government, which it actually is not. And then there are the even more extreme views -- you know, some of them saw the secretary-general as the antichrist and that I was consorting with the devil. These are the people who are afraid of the U.N., because they think it has black helicopters that will swoop down and steal your lawn furniture. And then there are some people who don't like the U.N. because it's full of foreigners, which frankly can't be helped. So you have a wide range of critics there.

"(CNN) -- A Chicago, Illinois, couple, their real estate agent and a real estate broker face charges of violating the federal Fair Housing Act for refusing to sell a $1.8 million home to black radio personality and comedian George Willborn, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said. The five-bedroom, 8,000-square-foot home was listed for $1.799 million by owners Daniel and Adrienne Sabbia and their real estate agent, Jeffrey Lowe, the housing agency said in a statement Tuesday. The charge alleges the Sabbias and Lowe stalled negotiations and took the property off the market after receiving a $1.7 million offer from Willborn and his wife, Peytyn -- the highest offer the Sabbias had received in the two years the property was listed, according to HUD. The Sabbias accepted the offer, but refused to sign the sales contract, according to the HUD complaint. Six days after the offer was accepted, the Willborns' agent asked about the issue, and Lowe told her that the ""'reality"" of selling the house was 'just hitting'"" Adrienne Sabbia, the complaint said. The woman said she didn't believe that, since the house had been listed for two years, according to the complaint. Lowe sent the agent a text message the following day saying he did not believe it was about race, and believed it to be a ""seller vs. seller issue not a seller vs. buyer issue."" But the next day, Lowe told the Willborns' agent that the Sabbias were not signing the sales contract and taking the home off the market. ""Respondent Lowe gave complainants various reasons for why the Sabbias had decided not to sell,"" the complaint said, including that Adrienne Sabbia had changed her mind, that the Sabbias could not find another home, and they wanted to keep their children in their current schools. The Sabbias told HUD investigators they refused to sign the sales contract because Adrienne Sabbia wanted the full asking price for the home. Conrad Duncker, named as the Sabbias' attorney by the Chicago Sun-Times, did not return a call from CNN seeking comment Wednesday. The Willborns filed an initial HUD complaint in January, amending it in March and July. The couple learned that the Willborns had filed a HUD complaint on January 29, the complaint said, and a few days later told Lowe to offer the Willborns the opportunity to buy the home with all its furnishings for $1.799 million. ""When the Willborns learned that the Sabbias only offered to sell the subject property to them after receipt of the HUD complaint, they canceled a scheduled showing and declined the offer,"" according to the complaint. Lowe told investigators that while he was representing the Sabbias, Daniel Sabbia told him he would prefer not to sell the home to an African-American, but added ""if it was for the right price he did not care who bought the house,"" the complaint said. However, the agency ""has determined that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred in this case based on race and has authorized and directed the issuance of this charge of discrimination,"" according to the complaint. The charge will be heard by an administrative law judge unless a party elects to have it heard in federal district court, HUD said. If the judge finds discrimination occurred, damages may be awarded and fines may be levied. Punitive damages can also be awarded if the case is heard in district court. Besides the Sabbias, the Lowe Group Chicago Inc. and real estate broker Prudential Rubloff Properties are also named in the complaint. ""Racial fairness is important at all income levels. Civil rights enforcement must be the effective shield against housing discrimination that in this case wealth was not,"" stated John Trasvina, HUD assistant secretary for fair housing and equal opportunity. Willborn is a radio personality who co-hosts the syndicated ""Michael Baisden Show."" He also has appeared as a comedian on television and in films, the complaint said. CNN's attempts to reach Willborn were unsuccessful. ""I think it's unfortunate, sad and disgusting,"" Willborn told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""It jolts you to your core beliefs. . . . No one has the right to dictate the American dream."" ""Complainants George and Peytyn Willborn have suffered emotional distress due to respondents' discriminatory acts,"" the complaint says. Willborn has indicated he is less trusting of people and their actions, and ""he feels respondents have denied him the American dream he worked so hard to attain.

"(CNN) -- County coroner's officials in Los Angeles, California, hope to release results Thursday morning of their examination of skeletal remains found in a remote area of Malibu Canyon. The family of a woman, missing nearly a year, await word on any clues the bones will yield. Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter said that an anthropologist and pathologist were examining the remains, and an odontologist -- or dental expert -- will also help make a final identification. The remains, which included a human skull, were found Monday by park rangers searching the area for marijuana groves, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. ""It's incredibly treacherous terrain,"" Whitmore said of the remote site. ""There is no road, no trail even if you know exactly where you are going."" Whitmore said it appeared the remains had been in the area ""for quite awhile."" The family of missing Mitrice Richardson have been waiting to hear whether the remains are those of their loved one. Richardson, who would be 25 now, is a former beauty pageant contestant who was last seen leaving a Los Angeles County sheriff's station in Malibu during the early morning hours of September 17, 2009. She had been arrested the previous evening at an upscale restaurant for allegedly not paying for her meal, and patrons at the restaurant said she exhibited strange behavior. Her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues and should have been kept at the sheriff's station until a relative arrived to pick her up. The Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday that the remains are those of a woman and that ""women's clothing was also found near the scene."" The newspaper cited unidentified law enforcement sources. Winter would not confirm Wednesday the gender of the remains. He said clothing was found ""near the body,"" but declined to elaborate on what type, saying many people had been using the area where marijuana was known to be harvested. Latice Sutton, the mother of Richardson, held a news conference Tuesday night outside the coroner's office, saying she had been told that the clothing found was a pair of Levis, and appealed to officials to let her view the clothing. ""I do know that my daughter was wearing jeans that night,"" Sutton said. Mom furious about leaks to media . Michael Richardson, Mitrice's father, told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" on Wednesday that he isn't giving up the search for his daughter. ""I'm still remaining hopeful, positive, prayerful ... and until they can give me a definitive answer about it, Mitrice is still needing for us to search for her,"" he said. The family of Richardson was joined at the canyon site Monday by another woman who believed the remains could belong to her husband, Timothy. Pam Perryman said her husband went missing six years ago while hiking in the area. ""I've been praying that we would find him because it's our anniversary this Saturday,"" Perryman told CNN iReporter Julie Ellerton.

"Memphis, Tennessee (CNN) -- Forty-two years ago, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, while promoting the importance of the content of one's character. Today, an African-American candidate who marched with King is hoping the voters in a Democratic primary race will look at the color of his skin. Willie Herenton, who served as mayor of Memphis for almost two decades until he resigned in 2009, is making race a key part of his platform in his attempt to unseat incumbent Rep. Steve Cohen. Herenton's main campaign slogan on yard signs, flyers and T-shirts is the phrase ""Just One,"" a reference to his belief that there should be at least one African- American representing Tennessee in Congress. ""I believe that it is very clear to the majority of the citizens of this community that we lack representation. And all we are seeking is just one, well-qualified, African-American to serve in an 11-member Tennessee delegation that is currently all white,"" Herenton said. The August 5 primary in Memphis' heavily Democratic 9th Congressional District has attracted unprecedented attention from President Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus. Both are looking beyond race and backing Herenton's white, Jewish opponent. Cohen has the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, receiving endorsements from many of its members and a contribution from its political action committee. The president gave Cohen a rare, written endorsement in mid-July. ""Congressman Cohen is a proven leader in the United States Congress and a strong voice for Tennessee,"" the statement said. ""Together, we passed historic health care reform, and together we're continuing the fight to renew our economy and bring jobs back to the American people. I am proud to stand with Steve and support his re-election to Congress."" Herenton said that even though he respects Obama, he was upset with his decision to get involved. ""I'm disappointed that the president intervened. This is a local race, a local race that the citizens of this community should determine the individual that they want to represent them without the interference from the White House and the president,"" he said. In addition to downplaying the endorsements, Herenton says growing up in an impoverished part of Memphis and spending his career serving the people of the 9th District makes him more qualified for the job. He draws attention to Cohen's singing and dancing at campaign events, saying he is ""trying to act black."" ""It's patronizing, it's pandering, it's almost playing on the emotions of the people. And I, like many in my city am resentful of that type of behavior."" Herenton said. Cohen says he is bothered by that type of rhetoric and says his opponent is desperate and looking for a ticket to Washington. ""You know it's something he does, and I think it's grasping, because I'm not trying to be black. I understand the black community better than most Caucasians do because I have spent so much time working on issues,"" Cohen said. ""I represent everybody, and I work hard for people to get them opportunities. And I just think that race should not be an issue in 2010."" Four years ago, Cohen became the first white congressman since 1972 to win the district. Canvassing for votes this past weekend in Memphis' predominately African-American Whitehaven community, many of his constituents re-enforced his belief that his hard work on key issues such as education, health care and the economy resonated with voters more than skin-color. When he met resident Lillian Fisher and her children, she gave him a big hug for helping her oldest son find a job. ""If it wasn't for you and that education lottery, he now works with the Tennessee lottery in Nashville, thanks to you, so you keep up the good work,"" Fisher told him with a huge smile. Herenton has never lost a political election, even though he says he is always considered the underdog. ""According to our polls, we'll get about 80 percent of the African-American vote, and we feel comfortable with getting anywhere from 5 or 6 percent of the white vote. The way we calculate it, there is no way Cohen can win. This is a real uphill climb for him,"" he said. Cohen says he is not worried about the election at all and wishes Herenton stayed focused on the issues at hand instead of race. ""It does get to be a drag. The issues should have been addressed more fully. There are differences; the truth is I am a strong, hard-core Barack Obama Democrat,"" Cohen said. ""My district needs a liberal, because we need policies that work for people."" Herenton says he does not want his campaign reduced to just race and that voters should look at his unique qualifications as former mayor and school superintendent. But he says it would be wrong to just ignore the topic of race all together. ""This great nation is still in denial that race matters. In my view, race continues to permeate every facet of American lives. Especially white America is in a state of denial when it comes to race,"" Herenton said. Both candidates believe that MLK would be proud of their work. ""I think if Dr. King were alive today, he would support the proposition that the American democracy fosters inclusion, the American democracy respects representation of diverse people in his government, and he would be sympathetic and would be encouraging to a group of people that seek representation,"" Herenton said. And asked about what people will be saying on August 6, a day after the election, Cohen says he hopes people will see Memphis in a different light. ""I think they will be saying that citizens of the 9th District voted in a way that Dr. King will be smiling upon, voting on the content of their character and not the color of their skin.""","Willie Herenton hopes voters in Tennessee's 9th District will look at color of his skin .

"CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico (CNN) -- Jimena remained a tropical storm Thursday afternoon, but was losing its punch as it remained nearly stationary over Mexico's Baja California, the National Hurricane Center said. After making landfall on Baja California, Hurricane Jimena started weakening Wednesday night. All tropical storm warnings on the Baja California peninsula were discontinued, but a tropical storm warning remained in effect for northwestern mainland Mexico, from Huatabampito to Bahia Kino. A tropical storm warning means conditions including winds of at least 39 mph are expected within 24 hours. Jimena made landfall Wednesday afternoon as a Category 1 hurricane between Puerto San Andresito and San Juanico, Mexico, on the peninsula. At its peak, it was a Category 4 hurricane prior to making landfall. But as of 2 p.m., Jimena's center was located about 35 miles (55 km) north of Santa Rosalia, Mexico, forecasters said, and was ""moving very little during the past few hours."" The storm was expected to begin slowly traveling west or west-southwest later Thursday night, and forecast to be near or over central Baja California through Saturday. Jimena's maximum sustained winds were near 40 mph (65 kph) with higher gusts, forecasters said.

"(CNN) -- Police have forensic evidence linking a pair of escapees from an Arizona prison to the investigation of a couple found dead in New Mexico this week, an official with the New Mexico Department of Public Safety said Saturday. The fugitives, who escaped from prison eight days ago, are suspects in the investigation into two burned bodies found in a camper Wednesday in Santa Rosa, New Mexico, according to Peter Olson, communications director for New Mexico Public Safety. New Mexico police have yet to positively identify the burned bodies, but believe they are Linda and Gary Haas of Oklahoma, whose truck was found 100 miles away in Albuquerque, New Mexico, according to Olson. Forensic evidence found in that truck links John McCluskey and Tracy Province, the two escaped prisoners, to the investigation into the burned bodies, Olson told CNN. He would not elaborate on the nature of the evidence. Earlier Saturday, authorities arrested McCluskey's mother and charged her with aiding the escape. Claudia Washburn, 68, was arrested and charged with conspiracy to facilitate escape and hindering prosecution, Deputy U.S. Marshal Thomas Henman told CNN. The inmates, who authorities describe as armed and dangerous, have been at large since fleeing an Arizona prison on July 30. Washburn allegedly provided ""financial and other aid"" to her son and the second escapee and to a woman who was helping them, Henman said. Washburn was arrested in Jakes Corner, Arizona. A nationwide manhunt continues for McCluskey, 45, who was serving 15 years for attempted second-degree murder and other charges, and for Tracy Province, 42, who was serving a life sentence for murder and armed robbery. The two are believed to have left Arizona but to still be in the United States, Henman said. In an interview with CNN Arizona affiliate KTVK, Washburn's husband said that he'd shoot his stepson McCluskey if he saw him again. ""I told the U.S Marshals I haven't got that long to live,"" Jack Washburn said. ""[I'd] serve my time."" ""You think you're Bonnie and Clyde,"" he continued, referring to the two escapees. ""You're not. No comparison."" A female accomplice helped Province, McCluskey and a third inmate, Daniel Renwick, escape by throwing cutting tools over a prison fence, said Charles Ryan, director of Arizona's Department of Corrections. Authorities have identified the suspected accomplice as Casslyn Mae Welch, 43. Welch is Claudia Washburn's niece and is McCluskey's cousin and fiancée, KTVK reported. Renwick was captured Sunday in Colorado after getting in a shootout with authorities. After the break, the inmates and the accomplice abducted two truck drivers at gunpoint on Interstate 40 outside of Kingman, Arizona, and hijacked their 18-wheeler, according to the Mohave County sheriff's department in Kingman. The truck drivers and the rig were released five hours later in Flagstaff, about 135 miles to the east. The fugitives were later believed to be driving a 2002 silver Volkswagen Jetta purchased last Saturday in Phoenix. They were later spotted on a security camera in a bank inside a grocery store in Goodyear, Arizona, according to Barrett Marson, spokesman for the Arizona Department of Corrections.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Animal rights campaigners were holding a meeting Tuesday with Britain's Ministry of Defence to argue against the use of bearskin in the iconic furry headgear worn by royal guards at Buckingham Palace. A PETA activist in Sofia, Bulgaria earlier this year protests against UK troops wearing bearskin hats. Robbie LeBlanc, European director for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), was meeting with Ann Taylor, the minister for defense equipment and support, the defense ministry said. ""We are hoping that they will switch to a humane synthetic alternative,"" a PETA spokeswoman said. PETA has been campaigning for years against the use of bearskin in the headgear, a familiar symbol of London worn by the guards who keep watch over royal buildings like Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. The hats are part of the footguards' ceremonial dress, along with the bright red jackets. PETA says the bears used to produce the fur hats are killed cruelly and unnecessarily. ""It's an absolute moral disgrace,"" said Mike Hancock, a British lawmaker who has joined PETA's campaign against the bearskins. ""I don't think the British public or tourists will mind if it's synthetic fur, and I'm absolutely amazed in this day and age that we see beautiful animals skinned and killed"" to produce the hats. A spokesman for the National Army Museum in London, Julian Farrance, said the fur comes only from Canadian bears that have died naturally, and that no bears are killed for the hats. Campaigners say they still want the defense ministry to use a different material. ""It still promotes the usage of animal fur in areas where it's totally unnecessary, in my view, for fur to be used,"" said Glenda Jackson, another British lawmaker opposed to the use of the fur. The British Army's use of the bearskin hats dates back to the Battle of Waterloo on in 1815, when Wellington's army defeated the French Imperial Guard in a victory that marked Napoleon's downfall. The British soldiers captured the headgear from the defeated Imperial Guardsmen and have worn them ever since, although today the hats are only worn for ceremonial duties. Those British soldiers were renamed the Grenadier Guards to honor their defeat of the Grenadiers of the French Imperial Guards. The Grenadiers are now among five bearskin-wearing regiments that guard British royal buildings. But each bearskin hat is heavy and can prove very hot for the wearer. ""There have been occasions where soldiers have suffered from heatstroke, because obviously wearing that much fur on your head ... can get quite warm,"" Farrance said.","Animal rights campaigners oppose UK royal guards wearing furry headgear .

"Nowshera, Pakistan (CNN) -- The start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan coincided in Pakistan on Wednesday with the nation's worst natural disaster, the staggering scope of human suffering revealing itself in wretched ways. From the Swat Valley in the north to Sindh province in the south, as many as 15 million Pakistanis have been affected by torrential monsoon rains that have washed away villages and bloated rivers, authorities said Wednesday. Pakistan's representative to the United Nations said many people have not yet grasped the massive scale of Pakistan's suffering and warned it could still get worse because of ongoing rain. ""It is horrendous,"" said Abdullah Hussain Haroon. ""It is going to put us back so many years that we're not even starting on the infrastructure."" The Pakistan Disaster Authority confirmed 1,313 deaths Wednesday. It said 1,588 people have been injured and 352,291 people have been rescued. More than 722,000 houses have been damaged. Many Pakistanis now face severe food shortages, and aid agencies stepped up appeals for global assistance. The United Nations launched a flash appeal for $460 million in humanitarian assistance, and the United States pledged another $20 million on top of the $35 million already pledged. The Pakistani military has 55 helicopters and 621 boats taking part in aid and rescue efforts. For many parts of southern Pakistan, the worst is yet to come. The Indus River is expected to crest Thursday in parts of Sindh, according to the Pakistani Meteorological Department. And Pakistanis will be forced to endure the consequences of damaged infrastructure and crops lost to flooding for months. Nowshera's Khushal Pur market, once a vibrant place of 250 food stalls, stood covered in thick, foul-smelling sludge as tractors worked to remove the mud and debris. Among the muck were tons of rotting produce that shop keepers abandoned when they fled the flooding. Juma Gul surveyed the damage. His vegetable stall has been a family business for two decades. He said he has lost more than $1,000 in business, a huge amount in this town in northwestern Pakistan, where the CIA World Factbook estimated the average annual income at $2,600. Gul, who set up a temporary stall on the road, said prices of fresh produce, including tomatoes and cucumbers, have doubled. That made customer Niaz Ali anxious. He has already lost work and money is tight, but with the cost of food soaring, he said he and his family will simply have to eat less. Market manager Ikram Ullah said it would be particularly difficult during the month of Ramadan, when Muslims abstain from food and water during the day and break their fast with a feast at sunset. The back-breaking clean-up tasks will be hard, too, because of Ramadan fasting. The economic impact of the disaster is sure to be felt for a long time with crops sitting in soggy fields. ""The crop has been lost and it is a race against time to ensure the next sowing season can be met,"" said United Nations special envoy Jean-Maurice Ripert. John Holmes, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, said the disaster is ""one of the most challenging that any country has faced in recent years."" Although the death toll is lower, the 14 million people affected are more than those affected in the 2005 Pakistan earthquakes, the 2004 Indonesia tsunami and the January earthquake in Haiti combined. ""The death toll has so far been relatively low compared to other major natural disasters, but the numbers affected are extraordinarily high,"" Holmes said. ""If we don't act fast enough, many more people could die of diseases and food shortages."" Holmes said thousands of villages and at least 288,000 homes have been destroyed. ""Six thousand villages wiped out the face of the earth,"" Haroon said. ""From 5,000 to 50,000 per village, we have no way of counting. We have nothing operational as to how many of those have died and how many are alive."" Huge swaths of Pakistan remain without power, clean water or communication. Bridges and roads have been destroyed, and many regions are accessible only by air or water transport. Millions of hectares of crops have been washed away in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province (KPK), Punjab and Sindh, and seed stocks have been destroyed, ""severely compromising the possibility to plant staple food crops in September for hundreds of thousands of farmers,"" Holmes said. The floods, which started in Pakistan's northern regions, are traveling through the southern province of Sindh. ""Millions more are expected to suffer from the combined impact of continuing torrential rains and unprecedented water levels in the rivers,"" Holmes said. ""The monsoon could last for at least another month, worsening the flooding we have seen so far."" The money will enable U.N. organizations, international partners and NGOs to partner with the Pakistani government to address emergency needs of flood-affected families, Holmes says. The agencies will provide food, drinking water, tents and supplies in the seven hardest-hit areas: Balochistan, Punjab, the Federally Administered Tribal Area, Gilgit Baltistan, KPK, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir and Sindh. The U.N. reports $99.5 million has been pledged, and donors have committed or contributed $47.8 million to the U.N. emergency response in Pakistan, but $300 million more is needed. Individual countries have also gotten involved. U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates on Wednesday authorized 19 Marine and Navy heavy-lift helicopters to Pakistan to relieve six U.S. Army helicopters that have been taking part in flood relief since Saturday. The new group of helicopters will come from units on board the USS Peleliu which has been off the coast of western Pakistan in recent days in anticipation of orders to assist. Gates said the USS Kearsarge -- another helicopter landing ship -- is headed to Pakistan to relieve the Peleliu. Gates said the Pakistanis will decide the speed of distribution. ""We want to be as helpful as we can be,"" he said. ""We don't want to overstretch the capacity of the Pakistanis to absorb the help."" Also Wednesday, Germany said it was increasing aid for flood victims to about $12.8 million. In total, about $600 million in aid is heading to Pakistan -- the equivalent of about $40 for each of the nation's 15 million residents. Islamic militants, however, called on the Pakistani government to reject any aid provided by the United States for flood relief. ""For the sake of God, don't accept donations from the U.S. because they are our enemies,"" said Azem Tariq, spokesman for the Taliban in Pakistan.  ""Whatever amount the U.S. will give as donation, we will give the government of Pakistan more."" Many Pakistanis have not been happy with the government's response to the floods, calling it slow and ineffective.  The Taliban's offer of aid may be an attempt to win the hearts and minds of flood victims. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has taken much of the heat. He was in England for talks with British Prime Minister David Cameron during the worst of the crisis. CNN's Reza Sayah, Dan Rivers, Samson Desta, Brooke Elliott and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report.","The death toll now tops 1,313, Pakistani authorities say .

"New York (CNN) -- It's a beautiful August morning in Jersey City, New Jersey. I have just finished my regular jog around Liberty State Park. No matter how often I stand here at my favorite spot to stretch, I can only marvel that this is actually my neighborhood and my view. In front of me, the Hudson River lies at the feet of the New York skyline. To my right, the Statue of Liberty basks in the glory of a thousand gazes from the first tour boat of the day. I look over at the World Financial Center where I work and, as always, what strikes me isn't what I see, but what I don't see anymore. The ghosts of the Twin Towers never seem to fade from the skyline in my mind. I am a Muslim, born in England, raised in Pakistan, but every bit as American as any of my fellow joggers or co-workers across the river. Somehow, though, people expect me to react differently. I don't. The same ghosts haunt me. As I stretch my muscles, my mind unreels a troubling movie. The planes hit the buildings in horrifying slow motion. A nation mourns. Families grieve. Boom. Senseless killing in Iraq. Flash. Mangled bodies and torture in Abu Ghraib. Boom. Bombs hit mosques in Pakistan. Flash. School girls killed in Afghanistan. Even though it's my movie, it always ends the same way. I feel helpless, powerless and lost. It's a far cry from the way I felt 14 years ago when I first saw the view from Liberty State Park. In my 20s then, I had come over from London to New York on business. After a busy work week I left early on Friday to spend the weekend with my cousin in Jersey City. He parked the car on the waterfront. We got out, walked over the swell of a small hill and then it was like someone flipped a switch. There, suddenly, was the New York skyline, more massive and impressive than I ever could have imagined. My cousin looked at me and said, ""This is what keeps young men up at night in Pakistan."" What he meant was that they lie awake at night dreaming of a better life in America and hoping, yearning that one day they would see this skyline with their very own eyes. That was the moment I decided I would live in New York. When I first moved here, I felt welcomed. I was truly impressed by the fact that America gave me as an immigrant the same opportunities it did to its own citizens. Today, that is still largely the case, unless your name is Mohammad or if you choose to wear the hijab. Since 9/11, almost every Muslim in this country has a story. And it's no longer one of welcome. It's 6-month- old Muslim babies on the ""no fly"" list. It's searches and racial profiling at airport security. It's suspicious looks from neighbors. It's families being split apart by persecution during the immigration process. We experience this where we work and live. And then we turn on the nightly news and see more hatred. Like the church in Florida that's planning a Quran burning event on the anniversary of 9/11. Like the sad irony of the Anti-Defamation League (a group actually formed to ""secure justice and fair treatment for all against...hatred, prejudice and bigotry"") now speaking out against the Islamic center to promote interfaith dialogue and education being proposed for near the former World Trade Center site. Some people have clearly decided that 9/11 gives them the right to persecute Muslims. And as a result, we are all collectively paying for the sins of terrorists -- a radical, crazy few who just happen to share the same religious background. This change of behavior doesn't just hurt Muslims, it attacks the very fabric of what made America great. The very reason people all over the world lie awake in their beds dreaming of coming here is that they knew they would be treated fairly in this mythical ""land of opportunity."" America built that global brand with blood, sweat and sacrifices and it is being tarnished with every act of intolerance. President Obama and the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have shown that they not only understand, but are also willing to address the core issues and move United States foreign policy back toward balanced and fair ground. It won't be easy. It won't be quick to implement. But the basic truth is this: Killing people will not fix this problem. Building bridges of understanding, rebuilding shattered economies in Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan and educating citizens on both sides will. The day before the World Trade Center bombings, America was my home. The next day, I woke up a stranger in a strange land. I wish every American could understand that I am not the enemy. We want to be part of the solution. We want to build international bridges and help tolerance grow in America and around the world. After all, how can America hope to have its global vision accepted by the 1.5 billion Muslims around the world unless leaders can first sell it here at home to 6 million of their own citizens? The first step in achieving this is to get back to basics. America grew into a beacon of liberty and freedom because it gave every citizen the unalienable right to ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" It's time to give that back to everyone, regardless of religion. Most Muslim men do not have beards and most Muslim women do not wear the hijab. But, if you see one on the street who does, please change your reaction from suspicion to openness, from judgment to acceptance. Reach out to them. Ask them questions. Engage as human beings, not as stereotypes. Simple acts of goodwill would change far more hearts and minds than any gun-fueled campaign or international policy. Then someday, here at Liberty State Park, I might be able to stop running, admire the incredible view and rewrite the end of my movie. I very much want to replace ""powerless and lost"" with ""hopeful and optimistic."" I want the New York skyline to once more inspire dreams of the possible, not echoes of the past. I want to come home again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sharjeel Kashmir.","U.S. liberties are the dream of many in the Muslim world, Sharjeel Kashmir writes .

"(CNN) -- A tip led to Wednesday's arrest in Louisiana of a suspected serial bank robber dubbed the ""Granddad Bandit,"" federal authorities said. Michael Francis Mara, 52, was captured at his home in Baton Rouge, FBI Special Agent Sheila Thorne told CNN. The FBI went to the residence to execute an arrest warrant when Mara retreated into the house, she said. ""After six hours, he came out and was placed under arrest,"" she added. The ""Granddad Bandit"" is wanted in at least 25 bank heists in 13 states -- from Virginia to Texas to Kansas -- since 2008, the FBI said in a statement. He was given the name because he appeared elderly, Thorne told CNN. The bandit, described as balding, heavy and wearing glasses, captured the public's attention because of his non-threatening image and his nickname. But federal authorities said he was anything but harmless. He would point to his waistband and indicate he had a gun, but it was unclear if he actually had one. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, got a tip earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia said Wednesday. The tipster identified and provided photographs of Mara that were compared to surveillance footage, the office said in a statement. Investigators ""allegedly found consistent key identifiers between the surveillance images and the photographs of Mara, including a hat, eyeglasses and wrist watch that appear to be identical."" Mara has been charged with one count of bank robbery and is in custody, Thorne said. He could receive a 20-year sentence if convicted. Mara worked for a vehicle transportation company and traveled from state to state on business, the FBI said. In recent weeks, the FBI launched a billboard campaign featuring surveillance pictures of the robber hoping he would be identified. Authorities cited this and other publicity as being effective. An FBI affidavit released Wednesday gave some insight into how the ""Granddad Bandit"" did his business. ""[He] presents a demand note with a request for the specific dollar amount. The Subject does not appear to wear any disguises or concealment to hide his identity. The subject enters the bank calmly, oftentimes patiently waiting for his turn in line and then approaches the victim teller,"" the affidavit said. ""Once the Subject's demands are met, he retrieves the demand note and exits the bank quietly, not bringing attention to the crime he just committed."" . CNN's Gabriel Falcon and Carol Cratty contributed to this article.","NEW: Tip led to arrest of bank robbery suspect .

"(CNN) -- Former Illinois congressman Dan Rostenkowski, who rose through the ranks of Chicago's rough-and-tumble political scene to become one of the most powerful men on Capitol Hill, has died, according to the office of Chicago Alderman Richard Mell. He was 82. He died in Wisconsin after an extended illness, Mell's office said. Rostenkowski first entered Congress in 1959, during the second half of the Eisenhower administration. Known for his booming voice and reputation as a power broker, he became chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee in 1981. During his tenure as chairman, the powerful Democrat played a key role in passing major reforms of both Social Security and the tax code, among other things. Read more about Rostenkowski's life and career . In 1988, Rostenkowski helped pass a controversial expansion of Medicare designed to protect seniors against catastrophic medical expenses. Senior citizens became livid over the higher monthly premiums and surtax tied to the bill. The measure was repealed a year later. Rostenkowski was defeated in the Republican landslide of 1994, however, after becoming mired in scandal. Among other things, prosecutors alleged he used public funds for personal matters and to pay employees who did little actual work. Rostenkowski pleaded guilty to corruption charges in April 1996, and ultimately served over a year in federal prison. He was pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2000.

"London (CNN) -- On a recent visit to India, British Prime Minister David Cameron had this to say about Pakistan, historically a close friend of the West's: ""We cannot tolerate in any sense the idea that this country is allowed to look both ways and is able, in any way, to promote the export of terror, whether to India or whether to Afghanistan or anywhere else in the world."" Seen by the Pakistani government as a slap in the face, Cameron's remarks almost caused a diplomatic breach in relations between the two countries. His remarks followed the leaking of U.S. documents on the WikiLeaks website in which Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency was accused of secretly aiding and inflaming the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan, and they engendered a heated debate in Western capitals on whether Pakistan is a friend or a foe. The dominant narrative in the West now is that Pakistan is a foe, playing a double game, guiding the Afghan insurgency with a hidden hand even as it receives more than $1 billion a year from Washington for its help in combating al Qaeda and like-minded groups. ""The burden of proof is on the government of Pakistan and the ISI to show they don't have ongoing contacts"" with the militants, said U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat on the powerful Armed Services Committee who visited Pakistan this month. During a July visit to Pakistan, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly aired Washington's suspicion and mistrust of its ally by stating that she believed that someone in the Pakistan government knew where al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden was hiding in the country's tribal regions along the border with Afghanistan. Clinton's statement was an implicit indictment of Pakistan's double game; it was met with angry denials by Pakistani leaders, who said the U.S. undervalued their support and sacrifice in battling al Qaeda. What this simplistic argument neglects is that Pakistan serves its own vital national interests and cooperates with the West only to advance those interests. An underlying premise in inter-state relations is that nations have only interests and no permanent friends. That is the game nations have played since the establishment of the state system in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Pakistan's foreign policy is a case in point. Throughout the Cold War rivalry between the U.S.-led Western alliance and the Soviet camp, Pakistan allied itself with the West and fought devastating wars against India, its strategic rival and a close friend of communist China and Russia. The Pakistan leadership leveraged the Cold War to extract military and technical aid from the United States and the Western powers. When Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan, Pakistan acted as America's spearhead in the fight against the ""evil empire,"" and its Inter-Services Intelligence agency was in charge of the CIA's expansive campaign to train, arm and guide the Afghan mujahedeen, including the bin Laden contingent of the Afghan Arabs. More than any other power, Pakistan played a key role in the armed resistance that turned Afghanistan into Russia's Vietnam. In return, Pakistan's security forces received logistical and financial aid from the U.S., but more important, Pakistan gained the upper hand in Afghanistan, becoming a paramount arbiter of its neighbor's internal affairs. After the Soviet forces retreated in defeat in 1989 and Afghanistan plunged into all-out civil war, Pakistani leaders felt deserted by the U.S. and had to pick up the shattered pieces and bring about a measure of stability to the war-torn country. Once the Soviet Union collapsed, the U.S. had no interest in either Afghanistan or Pakistan, relics of the Cold War. Pakistan relied on the Taliban, a student-led Islamic-based social movement that burst into the scene and imposed a draconian order wrapped in an Islamic emirate in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency nourished a close connection with the Taliban and consolidated its hegemony over the broken country. Although Pakistan was a close friend of the U.S.'s from the 1950s until 1989, the 1990s marked the beginning of suspicion and distrust between the two countries. The Pakistani leadership, particularly the security apparatus, felt scorned and abandoned by its former superpower patron, which cut Pakistan off from military aid because of its nuclear weapons program and threatened to impose sanctions on it. There is more to the relationship between Pakistan and the West than the simple dichotomy of ""either/or."" For example, since last year, U.S. officials say the Pakistani military has launched a powerful offensive against the Pakistan Taliban, who are allied with the Afghan Taliban, because the former began to threaten the current Pakistani government. (The Pakistani military has suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary citizens have been displaced.) The Pakistani military insists that it is waging all-out war against both al Qaeda and its extremist allies -- the Pakistan Taliban -- and U.S. officials concur that they have seen a shift in the country's attitudes toward the Taliban in the past 18 months. On the other hand, the Pakistan military appears to be reluctant to attack the Afghan Taliban, as the West demands, because it wants to leverage the Taliban in any future settlement in Afghanistan. For the Pakistani leadership, the Afghan Taliban are an important bargaining card, a strategic reserve on which they could rely when Western troops exit the war-torn country. Like their Western nemesis, the Afghan Taliban bitterly complain that the Pakistanis are playing a ""double game"" with them and say that they ""feed us with one hand and arrest and kill us with the other."" There is no love lost between Pakistan and the Taliban, a relationship based on self-interests and political considerations. Pakistan's strategic rivalry with India outweighs any pressure exerted by the West on Islamabad to end support for the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan's conduct via Afghanistan is driven by geostrategic concerns and fear of Indian influence in its backyard, not by intrinsic hostility or friendship toward the West or the Afghan Taliban. If the Western powers want to drive a wedge between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban, they must address Pakistan's geostrategic concerns and interests via India. An effective settlement of the Afghan-Pakistan conflict must be region-wide and involve India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and China, an almost impossible mission.

"RICHMOND, Virginia (CNN) -- A co-defendant in the federal dogfighting case against Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty Monday morning. Tony Taylor walks into the federal courthouse in Richmond, Virginia, to enter his guilty plea. Tony Taylor has also agreed to cooperate fully with the government. He will be sentenced on December 14 and could be sentenced to up to five years in prison, fined $250,000 and put on three years supervised release, according to court documents filed Monday in Richmond. Taylor, 34, of Hampton, Virginia, Vick and two other co-defendants -- Purnell Peace, 35, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Quanis Phillips, 28, of Atlanta, Georgia, were charged on July 17 with conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities, and conspiring to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture. In entering the guilty plea, Taylor, who remains free on bond, waived all his rights, including his right to appeal. He told U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson that he understood he is now a convicted felon. ""You're pleading guilty and taking your chances, right?"" Hudson asked Taylor. He responded, ""Yes."" Taylor had the same answer when Hudson asked: ""You have agreed to cooperate fully with the United States, is that right?"" It has been widely speculated that Taylor's plea, which had been expected, and his future cooperation with the prosecution could hurt Vick by helping the government prove its case against the high-profile football player. Taylor said the government did not promise him any sentencing deal in exchange for his cooperation. According to the summary of facts filed with the court on Monday, Taylor said that he and the other three co-defendants, including Vick, decided to start a dogfighting venture in early 2001 and that Vick paid for the property in Smithfield, Virginia, used for the operations. The four launched the venture, Bad Newz Kennels, in early 2002, Taylor said. In the court documents, Taylor says that he, Phillips and Peace ""executed"" dogs that did not ""perform well in 'testing' "" sessions, but does not mention Vick as having participated in the executions. He does, however, say that Vick accompanied the other three co-defendants to dogfights in other states on at least four occasions, and that the quarterback sponsored dogs in fights at his property on several other occasions, all between 2002 and 2004. Taylor said he left the dogfighting operation in September 2004 ""following a disagreement with Phillips."" The trial for the three remaining defendants has been set for November 26. A federal grand jury charged the men with organizing bloody and vicious dogfights on a piece of property that Vick bought in 2001. They also are accused of transporting and delivering dogs across state lines. Taylor discovered the site that became the Bad Newz Kennels -- the staging area for housing and training the pit bulls and hosting dog fights, the indictment said. On Friday, more than 50 supporters of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had gathered outside the National Football League's headquarters in Manhattan demanding Vick's suspension. PETA had sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, Vick's corporate sponsors and the Atlanta Falcons condemning dogfighting as ignorant and cruel. The letter did not directly presume Vick's guilt, nor did it directly ask the NFL to suspend Vick. The letter was backed by civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, hip-hop mogul and vegan Russell Simmons, and the president of PETA. In his first public comment since the indictment, Vick called his legal predicament ""a crazy situation"" and said he hopes to return soon to the gridiron, wearing a Falcons jersey. But he acknowledged in a phone interview Monday with Atlanta radio station V-103, ""There are a lot of things that needed to be worked out."" ""I've been [in Atlanta] for the last seven years of my life. I would love to come back,"" Vick told radio personality Porsche Foxx. ""But it remains to be seen."" The president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP criticized the prosecution of Vick at a news conference Monday morning. Dr. R.L. White Jr. accused the government of ""piling on."" ""There's a penalty in football for piling on,"" White told reporters. ""After a player has been tackled and somebody piles on, they're penalized for unnecessary roughness.

"Editor's note: Dr. Victor Dzau, a physician, is chancellor for health affairs at Duke University and chief executive of the Duke University Health System. Dr. Victor Dzau says workplace wellness programs could play a key role in health care reform. DURHAM, North Carolina (CNN) -- At the World Economic Forum earlier this year, a group of corporate executives engaged in a thought-provoking discussion on a variety of health care topics, including workplace wellness programs. These CEOs, representing some of the top companies in the world, shared some of the specifics of their programs, which are taking a variety of approaches to enhance wellness in the workplace, including ways to make such things as regular exercise and healthy eating appealing to employees. However, when asked, they agreed that they don't have any evidence that these programs are having the intended impact on improving health or preventing disease. The discussion made me wonder about how powerful these programs could be if they were linked to research-driven targets for behaviors such as weight-loss or monitoring and management of hypertension. If done right, couldn't these well-meaning -- but currently unmeasured -- programs figure prominently into the health care reform movement and become an effective and economical way to improve the health of Americans? There has been a lot of talk about good health promotion and disease prevention in early discussions of health care reform, but how and whether we achieve these aims will make or break the success of health care reform in whatever form it eventually takes. Many ideas have been bandied about. Public education and community programs are important but insufficient since they are difficult to implement broadly and effectively. There is a viable mechanism -- already in place -- through which significant improvements in our nation's health can be made. By taking a more organized, standardized and evidence-based approach to employer-sponsored workplace wellness programs, we can create a more effective marriage between public health and prevention. It's a fact -- most Americans spend the majority of their waking hours at work. The impact of employee health on productivity and cost of health insurance is well documented. In response, many medium and large employers have instituted a variety of workplace wellness programs. Thus, companies are spending money with good intentions. Unfortunately, there are no national standards or guidelines by which these programs are objectively conducted and measured, making it impossible to know if the various initiatives and their investments are achieving the intended goals. Meanwhile, reports suggest that 75 percent of our health care costs are spent on chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes, which are largely preventable. Let's empower the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the agency charged with keeping tabs on the public's health -- with identifying specific evidence-based wellness and disease prevention activities, as well as corresponding metrics, to be used as the basis for all workplace wellness programs in the United States. In exchange for adopting these uniform activities, goals and health metrics, companies and organizations would be eligible to receive meaningful tax credits each year based on their individual performance in meeting these objectives. For creative companies and institutions, passing along a financial incentive -- based on tax credits received -- to employees to achieve their wellness objectives could drive a greater commitment to healthy activities. And, perhaps an annual ranking of company, or organizational, performance against these national workplace goals and health metrics would foster a healthy competition in the same way that other industry performances are now ranked by national media. Ultimately, the goal is to have all workplaces conform to national standards and achieve measurable health status of employees just as OSHA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, measures and enforces standards for workplace safety. A program such as the one I'm suggesting should be relatively easy to implement. CDC should have access to the data necessary to begin formulating a list of activities and performance metrics. Most would agree that coming up with such a list would be largely intuitive as the risks associated with high blood pressure, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, to name a few, are well known, but it must also include flu shots, cancer screening and other evidence-based programs. In working to ensure that President Obama's $634 billion health care ""downpayment"" is spent effectively, we must remember that because companies are already shouldering the cost of these wellness programs, relatively little new money is needed to make them more effective and provide performance incentives. Such an approach would also, for the first time, provide companies and organizations with an objective basis for making investments in workplace wellness. I, for one, would be thrilled to know that our institution's annual workplace wellness commitment could be effectively measured and a return on investment understood and calculated. The most recent figures from the U.S. Census Bureau suggest that about 64 percent of working Americans are employed by companies with 100 or more employees, many of which likely already have some kind of workplace wellness program in place. This represents more than 73 million people out of a total workforce of almost 120 million people. Obviously this idea misses those Americans who are uninsured, work in small businesses without workplace wellness programs, or have lost their jobs in the recent economic downturn, and would require some further creative thinking about the implementation of meaningful wellness options that would reach everybody. But we must start somewhere. Tackling health care reform is going to be a long, arduous, necessary and overdue process. But, I think it would be a mistake to delay taking meaningful actions to improve the nation's health as we wait for a solution to the overall health care challenge that could take years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Victor Dzau.","Victor Dzau: Companies offer programs to improve health of their workforce .
He says programs should be based on national standards to ensure they work .

"Like other branches of science, nutrition is constantly evolving. As researchers learn more about vitamins and minerals, for example, dietary advice changes. Coffee is the top source of antioxidants in an American diet. Take vitamin D, the ""sunshine"" vitamin, so named because it is produced primarily in the skin through a chemical reaction that requires ultraviolet light. Increasingly, nutritionists recommend that you boost your daily intake because of vitamin D's potential to help fight certain types of cancer. In fact, many expect the next version of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, due in 2010, to raise the amount currently recommended from 200 International Units (IU) for adults to 400 or more. But any advice that encourages exposure to sunlight concerns dermatologists, since rates of basal cell carcinoma, the most common type of skin cancer, have tripled in the past 30 years. So . . . to D or not to D? We went to the experts for help in sorting out what the science really says about vitamin D and three other nutritional riddles, and more importantly, what that means for you. Vitamin D . The good news: A short stroll in the sun supplies enough vitamin D to maintain healthy bones; emerging research points to strong anti-cancer benefits, too. The potential risk: Exposure to sunlight causes skin cancer. What the research says: Vitamin D tells the body to absorb more bone-building calcium from foods. ""Vitamin D is most known for its beneficial effects on the skeleton, but, to me, its effects on cancer are much more significant,"" says Bruce W. Hollis, Ph.D., professor of pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. In a study of 47,800 men, scientists at the Harvard School of Public Health reported that 1,500 IU daily of vitamin D reduced the risk of cancers of the digestive system by 43 percent. Another study from the University of California at San Diego of 1,760 women suggests that 2,700 IU daily may reduce the risk of breast cancer by 50 percent. CookingLight.com: Power up your plate . Reaching the amount of D currently recommended --200 IU per day for adults ages 19 to 50 and 400 IU per day for those ages 51 to 70 -- through diet is difficult, Hollis says. Food sources of vitamin D are scarce; salmon, mackerel, and sardines are the top sources, containing 250 to 360 IU per 3-ounce serving. Milk comes next, but the levels of vitamin D with which it is fortified varies. When researchers from Boston University analyzed 79 milk samples, they found that 37 percent contained less than 5 percent of the 100 IU vitamin D per cup promised. What you should do: ""The most powerful source of vitamin D is the sun,"" Hollis says. Make the most of it. Protect your face, ears, neck, and the backs of hands each day with a moisturizer that contains a sun-protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher. These spots are where skin cancers usually develop first. But on days when you aren't going to spend much time in the sun, leave spf off legs and arms to let them manufacture vitamin D. In just 10 minutes, a light-skinned person produces 10,000 to 20,000 IU vitamin D. Because skin pigments can interfere with vitamin D synthesis, darker-skinned people produce it more slowly. If you have dark skin or live or work where you are seldom exposed to sunlight, talk to your doctor about supplementing your intake of vitamin D. Hollis recommends choosing a supplement that contains vitamin D3, also known as cholecalciferol; it's the vitamin's most readily absorbable form. Coffee . The good news: Caffeine, obtained most frequently from coffee in a typical American diet, may reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. An antioxidant in coffee may also help protect against diabetes. The potential risk: Caffeine may cause bone loss, which increases the risk for osteoporosis. What the research says: In trying to solve this nutritional conundrum, it helps to put study findings in their proper context, says Tara Coghlin-Dickson, M.S., R.D., a clinical dietitian at Stanford University Hospital in Stanford, California. A widely reported 2001 study of 489 postmenopausal women found that caffeine intakes higher than 300 milligrams (mg) per day -- roughly the amount in two cups of coffee -- accelerated bone loss in women. However, the study reveals an important qualifier: The women's average calcium intake was 725mg per day, 475mg short of the Daily Recommended Intake. ""Caffeine can act as a calcium thief, but the real risk for osteoporosis is chronic low calcium,"" Coghlin-Dickson says. It's well known that caffeine -- a stimulant -- can improve focus and concentration. Recent research also has linked caffeine to a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease. When scientists at Harvard University tracked rates of Parkinson's in more than 135,000 men and women for 12 years, they found that men who consumed four to five cups of coffee daily and women who consumed one to three cups daily were half as likely to develop the disease as those who didn't consume coffee. CookingLight.com: Healthy chocolate? Researchers aren't yet sure why coffee has a protective effect but suggest the benefit could be linked to caffeine's ability to accelerate neurotransmissions in the brain. Coffee's connection to diabetes prevention appears clearer. In a 10-year trial of  88,000 women, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, Massachusetts found that women who drank two or more cups of coffee per day were 47 percent less likely to develop type 2 diabetes, the adult-onset variety of the disease. In this study, the benefits of the brew weren't directly associated with caffeine; decaffeinated coffee provided similar results. More likely, chlorogenic acid, an antioxidant abundant in coffee, is responsible for the effect, says Frank Hu, M.D., Ph.D., lead author of the study and associate professor of nutrition and epidemiology. What you should do: ""Considering all of the evidence we've accumulated in the last 10 years, coffee is more healthful than harmful,"" Hu says. Like all things, caffeine -- and coffee --are probably best in moderation; have one cup, maybe two per day. You may also benefit from the brew's antioxidants; coffee is the top source of antioxidants in an American diet. Omega-3s . The good news: Eating fish rich in omega-3s may improve your heart health. The potential risk: Some types of fish contain high levels of mercury, a toxin. What the research says: In 2004 the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency issued an advisory recommending that pregnant or nursing women and young children avoid intake of high-mercury fish species, such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark because mercury can cause developmental defects in children. The threat is real, but the response isn't. Two-thirds of Americans believe the risk applies to everyone, not just expectant mothers and young children, according to a survey by the Center for Food, Nutrition, and Agriculture Policy. ""People think, 'If it's not good for babies, then it's probably not good for me,' "" says Joshua Cohen, Ph.D., a lecturer at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. ""But men and postmenopausal women should focus on the fact that eating fish can help reduce their risk of stroke and heart attack."" CookingLight.com: Clearly healthy oils . When Cohen correlated data about fish consumption to annual rates of heart disease in a report published last year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, he determined that if all American adults -- including women of childbearing age -- consumed 8 ounces of a low-mercury fish each week, the annual number of coronary deaths in the United States would drop by 20,000. Omega-3 fats, which are provided by certain fish, help make ""bad"" LDL cholesterol less likely to stick to artery walls and may relieve arterial inflammation. What you should do: If you're not a woman of childbearing age, consume two 6-ounce servings of fatty fish per week. ""To sacrifice the benefits for a risk that doesn't pertain to you is cheating yourself,"" Cohen says. Stick with species that are low in mercury but high in omega-3s -- salmon, canned light tuna, pollock, flounder, sole, herring, shrimp, and sardines. E-mail to a friend .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- In a few short days, JetBlue flight attendant Steven Slater has achieved folk-hero status. He's the man who allegedly cursed out a disruptive passenger over the on-board public address system, then opened an aircraft door, inflating the emergency chute in the process. He grabbed a beer from a service cart and slid down, effectively saying ""Ba-bye"" to his 20-year flying career. Slater's exit created a danger to ramp workers and could earn him a prison stay. Nevertheless, his actions call attention to escalating tensions between flight attendants and the passengers they serve. They also highlight a little known issue that's a big problem for flight attendants. For the last 25 years, I've worked as a flight attendant for a large U.S. carrier. Many times I've been in Slater's position: A passenger opens the overhead bin to retrieve a carry-on bag before the captain says the plane has safely reached the gate. (For safety reasons, attendants are trained to make sure passengers stay in their seats, overhead bins remain closed and carry-on bags are properly stowed ""until the aircraft reaches the gate and the captain turns off the fasten seat belt sign."") Most offenders are simply eager to get off a cramped airplane and willingly sit down when asked. But occasionally -- as was possibly the case with the passenger Slater responded to -- some passengers think the rules don't apply to them. I've been glared at, verbally abused, threatened with lawsuits and recriminations from God simply because I asked a passenger to comply with the rules. Herein lies the problem. What exactly are the rules? Why do they seem different from one flight to the next? And what authority do flight attendants have when it comes to enforcing them? The answer to that last and most compelling question is ""zero."" Contrary to what you may think, flight attendants have absolutely no authority aboard an aircraft. We are not police officers or security personnel. We are not empowered by law to enforce airline policy, FAA regulation or criminal mischief. We can't force noncompliant passengers to buckle their seat belts, stow their tray tables, turn off cell phones, put away pornographic magazines (yes, it happens) or stay in their seats until the plane docks. All we can do is approach the passenger, explain ""the rules"" and hope they comply. Failing that, the only recourse is to call the captain, who, depending on his or her disposition, may not address the problem adequately. Consequently, flight attendants often find themselves between a rock and a hard place. It's frustrating when your employer demands that you impose policy without giving you the means to do so. Perhaps this is why Slater snapped. While I disagree with the manner in which he vented, like Chris Rock says, ""I understand."" As far as carry-on bags are concerned, the rules, which are seemingly clear but not uniformly enforced, are a major point of contention between passengers and crew. Most carriers limit each passenger to one carry-on bag and one personal item (i.e. laptop bag, small backpack, etc.). But does a woman's large purse qualify as personal item? Is she therefore allowed three items when a man is only allowed two? Are passengers allowed more carry-ons on half-empty flights? This seems reasonable, given the abundance of space in which to stow bags, which is why some attendants and gate agents turn a blind eye to a passenger with too many bags on an empty flight. But when that same passenger tries to board a full connecting flight with four bags and is forced to check two in the cargo hold, he may protest vehemently. ""Hey, they let me bring these on my last flight, why won't you? I'm never flying this #&*@!$* airline again!"" I've heard this so often and so loudly I've become numb to the allegation. The only way to mitigate passenger-employee conflict and ensure smooth flying is to impose a uniform airline code that begins at the check-in desk and ends at the luggage carousel. Passengers should be allowed no more than two carry-on bags on every flight; ticket agents should check ALL other bags. If your tweezers are allowed through security at O'Hare, those same tweezers should be allowed through security on your way home from JFK. Disruptive passengers should be blacklisted and banned from future flying. And any flight attendant who takes it upon himself to open an emergency exit and slide down the chute because a foul-mouthed passenger won't follow the rules, well ... he might find that behavior is not much better in a prison cell.","Elliot Hester says he gets why Slater blew up, made dangerous emergency chute exit .
He says he's faced similar situations with passengers who think rules don't apply to them .
But airline rules are uneven, he says, and attendants have no power to enforce them .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraq's main Shiite parties Monday announced the formation of a new alliance that excludes the prime minister -- at least for now. Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari announces the new Iraqi National Alliance in Baghdad. The coalition, named the Iraqi National Alliance, was formed to compete in the country's national elections in January. It includes top Shiite parties, but not Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's Dawa party. Senior political leaders who announced the alliance in a televised meeting said they still are holding talks with Dawa and other parties. The coalition replaces the powerful Iranian-backed Shiite United Iraqi Alliance -- of which Dawa was a part -- that swept the country's 2005 polls but later disintegrated. The new coalition was being presented as a nonsectarian one that includes a broader representation. ""This Iraqi National Alliance is a coalition of political forces from all aspects of Iraqi society,"" Ahmed al-Chalabi, the head of the Iraqi National Congress, which is part of this alliance, said on Monday. ""It is not an Islamic alliance like the previous one. It includes liberal groups, it aims to be nonsectarian, it has many representatives of other communities of Iraq in it."" For now, the alliance is mainly made of top Shiite parties with a few small secular, Sunni and other parties. The announcement came after months of intense negotiations between the country's Shiite parties and recent reports of disagreements between al-Maliki's Dawa and other Shiite parties on who would lead the alliance. The alliance includes the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, followers of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, former Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, Fadhila party and others. Shiite Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, addressing the meeting, said he wished the Dawa party had been present at Monday's announcement, but negotiations will continue. Jalal al-Deen al-Sagheer, a senior Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq member, said al-Maliki was at talks held Sunday and that the prime minister congratulated participants, promising to have another meeting in the coming weeks. Hasan al-Sneid, a spokesman for al-Maliki's State of Law Coalition, also confirmed that negotiations are continuing. In a news conference later Monday, al-Sneid said there was no ""strategic disagreement,"" but rather disagreements over ""mechanisms of participation"" and wanting wider representation in the alliance. He denied this has to do with al-Maliki going for a second term or leadership of the alliance. The prime minister's State of Law Coalition, which mainly includes members of his Dawa party, won control of most of the country's provincial councils in January's elections, turning back mainly Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq opposition. Al-Maliki, whose campaigning in the last elections trumpeted recent security gains and a drastic drop in violence, has been affected by a series of deadly attacks in Baghdad and in northern Iraq. Absent from Monday's major announcement were two of the most influential Shiite leaders, al-Sadr and Abdul Aziz al-Hakim. Al-Sadr, who fled to Iran in 2007, is continuing religious studies there. Al-Hakim, the former head of the United Iraqi Alliance who has been receiving cancer treatment in Iran, has been hospitalized there after his health deteriorated, his party announced Sunday.","New coalition includes top Shiite parties and a few non-Shiite parties .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Kirsten Ott walked down the aisle in a white strapless gown with an embroidered bodice and cascading ruffles. Maria Palladino, dressed in a white suit, waited for her at the end of the aisle with a minister. Surrounded by their family and close friends, the women committed to each other for the rest of their lives. A beautiful reception followed. It had all the makings of a traditional wedding, but instead of calling themselves bride and groom, the couple used the terms bride and ""broom."" ""Broom is a combination of bride and groom,"" said Kirsten, who took Maria's last name when they wed. The ""broom's"" cake was a giant crab, Maria's favorite sea animal. ""It was gorgeous and realistic,"" Kirsten said. ""It actually stole the show from the wedding cake itself."" Both were relieved the special day they had planned for so long finally arrived. Organizing a wedding can be challenging, what with finding the right photographer, the perfect cake, the prettiest flowers and, most importantly, the venue. It was even harder for Kirsten, because she had to find vendors who accepted same-sex marriage in Atlanta, Georgia, where the union isn't legally recognized. ""Our biggest obstacle was our fear, not knowing how we would be received by an industry so focused on heterosexuals getting married, "" Kirsten said. ""We e-mailed a lot of vendors instead of calling them, because we didn't want to get our feelings hurt. There were a few that didn't write back."" Kirsten and Maria turned to wedding magazines for inspiration while planning their 2008 wedding. But Kirsten said something important was missing. ""There are tons of wedding magazines when you go into a wedding section at a bookstore, but we weren't in any of them. Not one single gay couple. It was disheartening."" Over time, the couple found vendors, like a photographer who had worked for a transgender couple and a gay-friendly wedding venue. Ironically, it was the Mary Gay House in Decatur, Georgia. ""We did a lot of research before we contacted most of our vendors, reached out to ... we knew about more of the gay-friendly companies in town or we would ask around."" Planning their wedding inspired the newlyweds to start their own wedding magazine geared toward engaged same-sex couples. Kirsten, a journalist, and Maria, a graphic designer, used their career backgrounds and personal experience to launch the online magazine Equally Wed. ""We do the work for you, call or visit these locations and talk to the owners about how open they are to same-sex couples, no rejection."" The Palladinos discovered that more wedding vendors across the United States are now offering their services for two brides or two grooms. The magazine has a staff that spans the country. Employees find companies that cater to same-sex weddings and welcome couples to their honeymoon destinations. They list gay-friendly vendors that will make the cake, design the flowers or take pictures of the ceremony. Jeweler Rony Tennenbaum in New York designs wedding rings for same-sex couples. ""Most of the time they are opposite in the likes and tastes. One might be aggressive, rugged and one wants classier,"" Tennenbaum said. Tennenbaum also said it's important to break same-sex wedding stereotypes. ""It's important not to make rings that a straight person might think a gay couple wants. Gay couples don't need to wear triangles ... it's not about symbols, it's about signifying love."" Le Tux Shop in Atlanta tailors suits for women. Other shops design clothing for bridal parties made up of women who want to wear dresses or pants. ""That's kind of why we wanted to do Equally Wed. [It] was to showcase normal gay weddings for anybody that's planning their own. It helps to have a model to look at, [to] help you feel like what you're doing is OK,"" Kirsten said. Maria said most gay weddings are similar to straight weddings, but there might be a question about which bride will walk down the aisle or which groom will propose. ""Just some of the little things that come out in the details of planning."" Same-sex marriage is currently legal in five U.S. states -- Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, Iowa and New Hampshire -- and in the District of Columbia, while civil unions are permitted in New Jersey. Maria said, ""For us it doesn't matter if we were doing it in Alabama or doing it in Massachusetts, we're providing the fine details of a wedding day."" Kirsten said she believes even though same-sex marriage isn't recognized in most states, that doesn't mean couples can't have a wedding. ""It's a ceremony in front of your friends and family, committing to this other person for the rest of your life ... it doesn't matter what sex you are or who, the sex or gender of the person you're marrying.""","Couple worried about vendors' reactions while planning their wedding .

"(CNN) -- You know you've reached a special level of fame when you're known by just your first name. For R&B superstar Usher (full name Usher Raymond), achieving his place among the entertainment industry's first-namers has come with the sale of tens of millions of records and multiple Grammy Awards. ""I'm definitely living my dream to the fullest... What I do is very positive and an indication that if you simply believe in your dreams, you can make it,"" he told CNN. When not performing the man who recently visited the gambling city of Macau during his first tour of China is a more modest character. ""I would definitely say there is a difference between the Usher that's on stage and the Usher who balances the regular life of being an entertainer,"" he said. With a new album out entitled ""Raymond vs. Raymond"" -- ""It probably would have been easier if I'd just named it 'Usher vs. Usher' but then people would have thought I was like a schizo"" -- balance has become a recent theme in his life and work. ""I experienced an incredible amount of depth in these last two to three years of my life in terms of entertainment, places I've gone, the things that I want to do... and the balance between my personal life and my entertainment is what this album was all about,"" he said. The death of Michael Jackson, an inspirational figure to Usher both in his early career and later when the two became friends, affected him. But talking about it to CNN, he looks back only on the positives from their relationship and the good advice he was given. ""The one thing that he always said to me was, 'Be mindful of history. Be conscious of history. Don't get caught up in just the moment. Understand that each moment is a piece of history and you should approach it that way.'"" Passing on the wisdom from the ""King of Pop"" and guiding new stars like Canadian protégé Justin Bieber is part of Usher's plans for the future. ""I look at him like a son, like a little brother. They even call me or consider me a mentor sometimes. Whatever it takes, to be helpful. As I said, when I was first his manager, I felt like I could make a meaningful contribution to his career, and thus far it's looking that way. So I'm really happy.""

"Paris, France (CNN) -- The body of a retired restaurateur who's been missing for two years has been found in a freezer in the French city of Lyon, police there told CNN Wednesday. The corpse of Jean-Francois Poinard, 71, was discovered Tuesday in the apartment he had shared with a girlfriend in Lyon, regarded as the culinary capital of France. Police said an autopsy will be conducted. The French newspaper Le Monde cited a police source as saying the man's girlfriend, 51, has been taken into custody in connection with the case. Police said the body was found after a tip from a close family member of Poinard, who was considered one of Lyon's top chefs in the 1970s and 80s.

"(CNN) -- There's still time to charge that laptop and brew some coffee before the Perseid meteor shower peaks predawn Friday. OK, it's easy to understand why the coffee will come in handy during the long watch overnight. But the laptop? Meteor gazers can join a NASA live chat with astronomer Bill Cooke. The Marshall Space Flight Center astronomer will answer questions beginning around 11 p.m. Eastern Time Thursday. NASA also is broadcasting live the hums of the meteors as they whiz by. With a waxing crescent moon expected to set beforehand, and hence less moonlight in the way, forecasters are expecting one of the best celestial shows of the year, weather in your neighborhood permitting. With good viewing conditions, stargazers might be able to catch at least 40 meteors per hour, Space.com said. ""The August Perseids are among the strongest of the readily observed annual meteor showers, and at maximum activity nominally yields 90 to 100 meteors per hour,"" Space.com columnist Joe Rao said in his column. ""Anyone in a city or near bright suburban lights will see far fewer."" NASA advises viewers that ""the Perseids shower will begin around 10 p.m. YOUR local time. However, the best times to view are after midnight and before dawn, with the best activity around 3 a.m. to 4 a.m. local time. Best conditions are a clear, dark sky away from city lights. Go outside and look straight up at the sky."" The Perseids can be seen all over the sky, but the best viewing opportunities will be across the Northern Hemisphere. Those with sharp eyes will see that the meteors radiate from the direction of the constellation Perseus. The Perseids have been observed for at least 2,000 years and are associated with the comet Swift-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every 133 years, NASA says. Each year in August, the Earth passes through a cloud of the comet's debris. These bits of ice and dust burn up in the Earth's atmosphere to create one of the best meteor showers of the year.","Perseid meteor shower peaks early Friday morning .

"(CNN)  -- Every time I think the Republican Party cannot get any more tone-deaf on issues involving race and equal rights, someone in leadership proves me wrong. In case you missed it, a group of Republican senators -- Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Jefferson ""Jeff Davis"" Sessions of Alabama and Jon Kyl of Arizona -- have decided that we might need to revisit the 14th Amendment's provision granting citizenship to people born in the United States. This development, in response to illegal immigrants whose children are born in the United States, is simply stunning and reckless. Can anyone seriously argue that the Republican Party has not been hijacked by extremists? Even once-sensible conservatives like Graham have drifted to a hard-right ideology so extreme that people of color, in this case Hispanics, will be hard-pressed to find a home in the GOP. These calls to revisit and possibly repeal the 14th Amendment's naturalization clause is a very bad sign of things to come on the immigration front, and we should all pay close attention as we head into the 2010 election cycle. Ironically, if you look at the RNC website ""GOP.com,"" a timeline shows that the party founded in part by Abraham Lincoln was once very progressive. It points out  that  a Republican Congress drafted and passed the 14th Amendment without a single Democratic vote. The lead sponsor was a GOP congressman from Ohio. Boy, have times changed. The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, granted citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States,"" including recently freed slaves. The 14th Amendment intended to ensure civil rights to ex-slaves, or as we like to say, ""equal protection,"" to those slaves under the laws. According to the Department of Homeland Security, about 10.8 million illegal immigrants were living in the United States in January 2009. The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that in 2008, 3.8 million illegal immigrants had children who were U.S. citizens. From the viewpoint of these conservative senators, repealing the citizenship clause could put a very swift end to the practice of people illegally crossing our borders to give birth so their children will be legal citizens of the United States. But here is what troubles me most as an African-American: Once again, the GOP is clueless to the ramifications of its public policy stances. Even Sen. John McCain, who is in a tough primary fight, has said we should look into the citizenship-by-birth provision. Tinkering with the 14th Amendment opens the door to further tinkering with the Constitution -- and when it comes to that, we should all take a hard pause. Like many Americans, I am concerned about the immigration challenge confronting our nation. But revisiting or reviewing the 14th Amendment is the wrong answer. To the Republican leadership I would simply ask: What are you thinking? How in the world can you believe that this latest stunt will help you broaden your outreach to Hispanics and blacks? How in the world can a party that did so many things right during its early days in the 19th century -- ended slavery, championed the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments, started Reconstruction -- end up so lost and monolithic in the 21st? I would respectfully suggest that leaders in the Republican Party, who want to achieve a governing majority once again in this century, had better get under control, or better yet oust, those members who are playing to the worst of racial fears this fall. Immigration is a serious problem indeed, but it is not one that will be solved by stripping away the rights of citizenship to those born in the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sophia Nelson.","Sophia Nelson: GOP, once progressive, now tone-deaf on race and ethnicity .

"London, England (CNN) -- Avoid saying ""thank you"" to a Chinese compliment, and don't ask a Brazilian personal questions. Those are among the tips in a new etiquette guide designed to help create a warm welcome for visitors ahead of the 2012 London Olympics. The list was compiled by VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, and is geared to help everyone from hoteliers to taxi drivers be culturally sensitive. ""Overseas visitors spend more than £16 billion ($25 billion) a year in Britain, contributing massively to our economy and supporting jobs across the country,"" said Sandie Dawe, chief executive of VisitBritain. ""So giving our foreign visitors a friendly welcome is absolutely vital to our economy. With hundreds of thousands of people thinking of coming to Britain in the run-up to the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012, this new advice is just one of the ways that VisitBritain is helping the tourism industry care for their customers, wherever they come from."" VisitBritain staff who are natives of the countries featured wrote the list, which will now be included in an online database available to those in the tourism industry. A sampling of their suggestions: . -- A smiling Japanese person is not necessarily happy. (They tend to smile when angry, embarrassed, sad, or disappointed.) Also avoid talking to them with your hands in your pockets, staring, being late, and blowing your nose in front of someone. While sitting, try not to show the bottom of your shoes. -- Pouring wine backwards into a glass indicates hostility to an Argentinian. Also, don't be offended by Argentinian humor, which may mildly attack your clothing or weight. -- Avoid winking at someone from Hong Kong, because it's considered rude. When pointing, use your hand, not your index finger. Avoid mentioning failure, poverty, or death, as this risks offense. -- Visitors from the United Arab Emirates can take great offense if you appear bossy. They appreciate being looked after by staff trained to understand Arab culture. -- Do not be alarmed if South Africans say they were held up by robots, which is their term for traffic lights. ""Howzit"" is an informal way for them to say hello. Do not place your thumb between your forefinger and middle finger, as it is an obscene gesture. -- With Brazilians, steer clear of personal questions, especially on such issues as age or salary. -- When meeting Mexicans, it is best not to discuss poverty, illegal aliens, earthquakes, or their 1845-46 war with America. When demonstrating height, be aware that holding the palm face down is reserved for animals. -- Never call a Canadian an American. Some Canadians take offense at being mistaken for U.S. citizens. -- Avoid saying ""thank you"" to a Chinese compliment. Instead, politely deny the compliment to show humility. -- Don't snap your fingers if you are with a Belgian, as it may be interpreted as impolite. Also avoid discussing linguistic and political divisions within Belgium between Dutch and French speakers. -- Avoid physical contact when first meeting someone from India. Being touched or approached too closely in initial meetings can be considered offensive, even if the intention is entirely innocent or friendly. -- Never imply that people from Poland drink excessively. Despite stereotypes, Poles are not large consumers of alcohol and excessive drinking is frowned upon.","VisitBritain launches a new etiquette guide ahead of the 2012 Olympics .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- A man accused of entering New York's LaGuardia Airport with a bag containing wires and batteries has been indicted on terror-related charges. Scott McGann, 32, faces an August 18 arraignment after he undergoes a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation. Scott McGann, 32, was indicted Wednesday on charges of placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in the first degree; placing a false bomb or hazardous substance in a transportation facility; and making terrorist threats, according to Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. If convicted, McGann faces up to seven years in prison, Brown's office said Friday. McGann initially appeared in court Saturday, but his arraignment was postponed until August 18 pending a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Brown's office said. McGann is being held at the Bellevue Hospital prison ward, according to the New York City Department of Correction. Authorities said McGann walked into LaGuardia's central terminal on Saturday morning with what was determined to be a fake bomb. The terminal was shut down, then evacuated, but it reopened after several hours. ""The defendant is clearly a very troubled young man,"" Brown said. ""As a result, the court has directed that he be examined to determine whether he has the capacity to understand the proceedings against him and assist in his defense."" McGann allegedly arrived at a checkpoint in the terminal at about 4:50 a.m. ET Saturday, carrying a backpack and refusing to answer security questions. Authorities said the officer at the checkpoint was informed that a suspicious package was attached to the bottom of McGann's backpack and that McGann allegedly grabbed what appeared to be a trigger device with a red button connected to the backpack. McGann allegedly pressed the button several times before an officer with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey grabbed the trigger and the package away from him. The package turned out to be a device consisting of batteries, cylinders and electronic components that could have been used to make a bomb, Brown said, but the bomb squad found that it didn't not contain any explosives. McGann had a ticket on a United Airlines flight to Chicago, Illinois, and a seat on two other connecting flights with his final destination, Oakland, California, according to a law enforcement official close to the investigation. McGann has three earlier arrests in the New York area, the source said. The most recent involved charges in June of tampering with evidence and resisting arrest. He also was arrested twice in 2008, the source said. Port Authority spokesman John Kelly said McGann was ""just acting crazy."" The arresting officers described McGann as ""extremely disheveled and dirty"" and in a ""near catatonic state"" and ""staring off into space,"" Kelly said. McGann had been homeless for at least a year. Authorities evacuated the terminal after 5:20 a.m. but allowed passengers back in to all areas except Concourse C by midmorning, Kelly said. The concourse was reopened shortly before 11 a.m. Saturday, according to Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Holly Baker. Authorities had stopped flights from taking off or landing at the airport, but flights resumed shortly after 9 a.m., Baker said. The incident disrupted travel plans for many passengers and caused American Airlines to cancel 16 flights, said an airline representative. American Eagle, Continental Airlines and Southwest also reported delays. CNN's Chuck Johnston, Aspen Steib, Ross Levitt, Laurie Segall, Kristen Hamill and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Scott McGann carried fake bomb into LaGuardia Airport terminal, authorities say .

"(CNN) -- The mother of a missing California woman is suing the county of Los Angeles and several sheriff's officials for wrongful death and negligence in her daughter's 2009 disappearance, court documents say. Mitrice Richardson, a 24-year-old former beauty pageant contestant, was last seen leaving a Malibu, California, sheriff's station in the early morning hours of September 17. Richardson had been arrested hours earlier after employees at Geoffrey's, an upscale Malibu restaurant, told police she refused to pay her $89 bill. At the restaurant, witnesses said Richardson was exhibiting strange behavior including ""sitting down with strangers and speaking in gibberish,"" according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court by Richardson's mother, Latice Sutton. A court has declared Richardson dead, although no body has been found. Jeff Peterson, the owner of the restaurant, told CNN in September that he called police because he feared for her safety. ""It was not just the money,"" Peterson said. ""Something was wrong with her. And it wasn't the alcohol, and we didn't know what to do and we didn't want to put her in a vehicle."" Her family has said the college honors graduate suffered from mental health issues. ""It was clearly evident that from the time [Richardson] arrived at Geoffrey's to the time of her arrest, she was not in her correct mental state,"" the lawsuit says. According to the documents, video footage from inside the sheriff's station shows Richardson ""clutching the screen of the holding pen and rocking from side to side"" and ""pulling at her hair and trying to get into the fetal position face down on a concrete bench."" Sutton alleges that she made numerous calls to the sheriff's station that night to find out when her daughter would be released so Sutton could pick her up. However, she never received notice of the release, the lawsuit says. Sutton argues in the lawsuit that the sheriff's department failure to administer psychiatric or medical evaluations and the fact that Richardson was released ""alone in an unfamiliar area without money, a cellular phone or means of transportation amounts to negligence."" The lawsuit seeks unspecified monetary damages. Sutton told HLN's ""Issues with Jane Velez-Mitchell"" Wednesday night that her purpose for filing the suit ""is to be able to obtain more information about what really happened to Mitrice on that night,"" saying authorities have not been forthcoming with information because of the possibility of a lawsuit. ""I feel I have no other alternative,"" Sutton said. ""The sheriff's department has forced me to take this action."" A spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told ""Issues"" that ""all indications that night were that Mitrice was doing OK. She took sobriety tests, signed documents, talked to the jailer. She was not in mental distress when we were with her."" CNN's Sarah Aarthun and Gabriel Falcon contributed to this report.","Mitrice Richardson disappeared September 17 after release from sheriff's station .

"(CNN) -- A woman facing possible stoning and one of her lawyers argue that Iran is mischaracterizing the status of adultery and murder charges against her. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani and attorney Hootan Kian say even though Ashtiani was cleared of her husband's murder five years ago, Iran continues to insist she was found guilty. ""They're lying,"" Ashtiani told the Guardian newspaper through an intermediary Friday. ""They are embarrassed by the international attention on my case and they are desperately trying to distract attention and confuse the media so that they can kill me in secret."" Iran suspended the death by stoning after there was international outcry over the sentence, but may reinstate it in coming days. ""I was found guilty of adultery [in 2006] and was acquitted of murder, but the man who actually killed my husband was identified and imprisoned but he is not sentenced to death,"" Ashtiani said. She insists Iran wants her stoned because she is a woman. In a letter written to the International Committee against Stoning and sent Saturday to CNN, Kian argued the Iranian judicial system has mishandled Ashtiani's case. ""If murder was proven, my client would have been executed and there would have been no need to stone her to death,"" Kian wrote. ""Based on Islamic Penal Code, the punishments for murder and adultery should have been combined in one case and sentence and handled by Branch 12 of the Tabriz Province Court. Whereas this was not the case. The branch has no records of sentencing my client to murder."" Last month, Malek Ajdar Sharifi, who is the head of the judiciary of East Azerbaijan province, said Ashtiani's crimes were ""numerous"" and said she was ""convicted of adultery and murder and was sentenced to death,"" according to the official news agency IRNA. ""Because of morality and ethics, I cannot go into the details of the crimes, but if the public knew, they would understand the criminal nature of them,"" he said, according to IRNA. ""But she killed her husband, brutally and gruesomely, and the detective on the scene said that if she had beheaded her husband it would have been better than what they actually saw."" Ashtiani, 43, a mother of two, is being held in a Tabriz prison. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups. Mina Ahadi, spokeswoman for the International Committee against Stoning, said if Ashtiani is executed, ""it is entirely political. It has nothing to do with the case itself."" ""Now that Iran is under this international pressure, they have brought the case up that convicts her of the murder of her husband,"" Ahadi said Saturday. Kian's letter said the man actually convicted in the death of Ashtiani's husband, ""admitted in the branch that he administered the electrifying of Mr. [Ebrahim] Ghaderzadeh himself with his own hands three times and each time the deceased received electrical shock."" The lawyer also challenged the adultery conviction. ""It completely violated the spirit of the laws of the Islamic Republic,"" Kian writes. Ashtiani's other lawyer, Mohammad Mostafaei, is being protected by European diplomats after he fled to Turkey from Iran. Mostafaei claims Iranian authorities tried to arrest him without cause. CNN's Mitra Mobasherat contributed to this report.","Iranian woman may be executed by stoning .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Saying ""the time has come,"" Gov. David Paterson announced Thursday he will introduce a bill in the state legislature to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. Gov. David Paterson said it's time to to legalize same-sex marriage in New York. ""The time has come to act. The time has come for leadership. The time has come to bring marriage equality to the state of New York,"" he said in a morning news conference. The proposed legislation would allow same-sex couples in the state to enter into civil marriages and enjoy the same rights afforded to heterosexual married couples. He defined the issue as one that would affect families and not just those ""walking down the aisle."" ""Too many loving families right here in New York state have not received legal recognition they actually deserve,"" Paterson said. ""We have an honor and we have a duty to make sure equality exists for everyone."" The legislation would give same-sex couples 1,300 to 1,400 rights that don't exist unless a couple is married, he said. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and several federal, state and local lawmakers were present to show their support for both the governor and the proposed legislation. ""New Yorkers pride themselves on their ability to practice their individual freedoms,"" Bloomberg said, ""and that includes the right to say what you believe, to practice your own faith and to love whomever you want, and it's time for this state to take the next step and ensure the rights of same-sex couples to marry whom they want."" State Sen. Thomas Duane, who will sponsor the bill in the state Senate, added, ""I know that Gov. Paterson is going to roll up his sleeves, and he's going to get this done, and we're going to make same-sex marriage a reality in this state."" Paterson's announcement comes when his disapproval ratings are at a new high. In a recent survey by Quinnipiac University, 60 percent of New York state voters said they disapproved of Paterson's job as governor, while only 20 percent approved. Regardless, many in the state are backing the effort to provide legal equality for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in New York. If the legislation passes, New York would be the fifth state in which same-sex marriages are legal, joining Connecticut, Vermont, Massachusetts and Iowa. Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer introduced the same bill in 2007. It passed in the state Assembly 85-61 but died in the Senate. Passage in the Assembly is again expected, while it remains to be seen whether the bill will get the 32 votes it needs to pass in the Senate. Among the bill's opponents is the Roman Catholic Church. Just hours after his installation Wednesday as the archbishop of New York, the Most Rev. Timothy Dolan said in his first news conference that he wouldn't shy away from the controversy. Many of its supporters, however, are confident. ""I absolutely look forward to standing with you, governor, when you sign this wonderful piece of legislation into law,"" Duane said Thursday morning. And for many, Paterson's announcement represents a hopeful future. David Kilmnick, CEO of Long Island Gay and Lesbian Youth, was present at the announcement. He said he hopes to marry his partner of eight years, ""maybe this year."" ""It felt like today, for one of the first times, I really mattered, my life really mattered, my family mattered,"" he said. ""I was proud to be a New Yorker today -- to be standing and watching our governor stand up on the side of equality.""","David Paterson: ""Too long we have pretended"" that gay people have equal rights .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A second wave of floodwater is expected to wash through southern Pakistan this weekend, adding hundreds of thousands of people to the number already stranded by a first wave earlier this month, Pakistani officials said. At least 1,384 people have died and another 1,630 have been injured by flooding that has damaged or destroyed 8,300 Pakistani villages so far, according to National Disaster Management Authority spokesman Ahmed Kamal. The United Nations said it was racing against time to reach the suffering. ""Relief supplies must reach women, men and children as soon as possible, in order to avoid further death caused by waterborne diseases and food shortages,"" said Martin Mogwanja, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for Pakistan. ""The death toll has so far been relatively low compared to other major natural disasters, and we want to keep it that way,"" he said. Two of 19 military helicopters pledged by the United States arrived in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Thursday to help in the humanitarian relief efforts, a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. These aircraft replace six U.S. Army helicopters that will return to duty in Afghanistan, the embassy spokesman said. The Army helicopters rescued more than 3,000 people and delivered relief supplies since arriving in Pakistan on August 5, the spokesman said. Farther north, more than 100 U.S. troops are on the ground in the volatile Swat valley, helping the Pakistani government deliver supplies and rescue people from flood-ravaged areas. None have yet encountered Taliban fighters. ""Obviously there's a militant threat in this region, but the Pakistani military has done an incredibly committed job -- providing us multiple layers of security around our units,"" said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Michael Nagata in a conference call from Pakistan. ""All our activities and helicopters are completely safe."" The bigger problem, said Nagata, is the weather. In the last two weeks, air crews have only been able to fly five days because of the relentless monsoon rains. The initial wave of the flooding came after torrential rains two weeks ago filled rivers in northern Pakistan that swept southward. Weather experts said a year's worth of rain fell in a day at the peak of the relentless downpours. A second wave of floodwater from rain that fell in northern and central Pakistan the next week is now reaching the Sindh province in southern Pakistan, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. An apparent bottleneck of water from the first flood wave at the Sukkar dam could be overtaken by the second wave, Miller said. ""This could lead to a situation where the two flood waves could build upon each other and lead to even more catastrophic flooding,"" Miller said. Pakistan emergency officials predicted the second wave could reach Sukkar on Saturday evening. Hundreds of thousands of people living along the Indus River in northern Sindh could be stranded along with the tens of thousands stranded by the first wave, said Pakistani Navy Lt. Commander Jawad Khawaja. Many residents have ignored government warnings to evacuate the area, causing a big concern, Khawaja said. More than 14 million Pakistanis are affected, with 400,000 rescued from floodwaters, the government said. It estimated that 723,950 homes have been damaged or destroyed. In  the mountainous north, water funneled down treacherous slopes, quickly engulfing the roads below. It surged down the Indus River, spreading economic, political and social woes through the heart of Pakistan. The smell of bodies filled the air in many places, where mere seconds of unstoppable water ended lives. Many witnesses, even those who thought they had seen everything in this land marred by crisis and killing, said they were stunned by the suffering wrought by the monsoons. U.S. President Barack Obama, in a statement marking the 63rd anniversary of Pakistan's independence on Friday, said, ""We will remain committed to helping Pakistan and will work side by side with you and the international community toward a recovery that brings back the dynamic vitality of your nation.""

"(CNN) -- The FBI and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division are investigating possible civil rights violations in the case of a  sheriff's deputy who was captured on video beating a handcuffed inmate with a baton. The Kershaw County Sheriff's deputy was fired after an August 5 surveillance video  showed him hitting the inmate dozens of times with a baton,  authorities said Monday. The  video shows the deputy leading the handcuffed man from a van  toward the jail. The deputy then pulls out his baton and begins  swinging it repeatedly at the man's legs, bashing him until he falls to  the ground. Once the man is on the ground, the deputy continues to hit him  as at least two other deputies look on. The deputy helps the man up at  one point only to slam his face against the hood of the van, the video  footage shows. The man was hit 27 times, CNN-affiliate WIS reported. The beating broke the man's left leg just above the ankle and put a gash in the man's other leg that required stitches, the affiliate reported. The state police agency released a statement from Kershaw County Sheriff Steve McCaskill. ""As  soon as we were made aware of this situation, we contacted SLED and  requested that they investigate. This employee has been terminated,""  McCaskill said in the statement. The inmate was identified as Charles Shelley, and he was arrested on charges of open container,  possession of marijuana, a suspended license and giving false information to  police, the affiliate reported. The deputy said he was angered because Shelley had threatened him and his family when he was driving the man to the jail, the affiliate reported. Two other police brutality cases under investigation by the state police agency and the FBI, but not related are: . -- The July  arrest of a Sumter  City police officer accused  of assaulting a suspect during a traffic stop. The Sumter City Police Department  has fired the officer. -- The July  arrest of two Department of Juvenile Justice correctional officers accused  of assaulting a juvenile arrestee. Both of the employees have been fired. Civil rights investigations also include whether law enforcement officers who were present were required to render aid, Lloyd said in a news conference Tuesday. ""We don't think it is typical behavior in South Carolina, but it's disturbing behavior,"" Lloyd said. He added that standard police training does not include the method shown in the video. ""You probably shouldn't be hitting anybody with a ... baton while they're handcuffed."" ""My personal reaction was like any other person who viewed it,"" he said, adding that  the deputy is presumed innocent. ""But you can't watch the video without having some serious concern for what went wrong there."" Lloyd noted that ""these allegations do not reflect the professional work of  thousands  of  South  Carolina law enforcement officers each and every day.  All   subjects of these investigations are presumed innocent of these charges   at  this time.""","NEW: FBI and state police agency to look at civil rights violations in beating case .

"(CNN) -- The state of Alabama has filed suit against BP, Transocean and others in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, according to Alabama Attorney General Troy King. In a statement announcing the lawsuit filed Thursday, King said, ""Some will, no doubt, sound the alarm that the lawsuit is premature. As Alabama's lawyer, I say that if, anything, based on BP's broken promises, their history of saying one thing and doing another, and now, new information that they have been secretly working to gain a legal advantage, further delay can only further damage our people."" King said thousands of Gulf Coast residents are waiting while their claims languish in the legal system. BP told CNN Friday it doesn't comment on litigation and possible litigation. A spokesman said he had seen a statement about the suit, but there weren't many details in it, and BP wouldn't comment anyway. Attorney General King pointed out BP is spending millions on public relations and advertising, and is hiring ""all the best expert witnesses, not because they need their services, but so the experts will be unable to testify against BP."" King says BP is selling off assets -- perhaps, to prevent courts from being able to use the assets to satisfy a judgment. King also alleges BP is preparing a report to argue it was not grossly negligent, which would limit its liability. ""Obviously, BP's ads are working. They have persuaded some newspapers and politicians to call for more delays. Shame on BP for running them, and shame on us if we believe them,"" King said. He added the lawsuit can always be settled if BP should suddenly ""do right"" by Alabama and its citizens. ""BP is now on notice. Alabama intends to hold you good to your word and to make you put our state back the way you found it,"" King said.","Alabama attorney general files suit against BP and Transocean .

"(CNET) -- Yahoo's Victor Tsaran knows how much time Web designers spend agonizing over color and font-width choices when laying out an application. So when he started Yahoo's accessibility push two years ago, he had a tough time arousing sympathy for engineers grousing about how much extra time was needed to create accessibility features. Fortunately for Tsaran, Yahoo's accessibility manager, he's running into that problem less and less. Web designers are starting to take accessibility as seriously as button placement or heading layout when they develop their products, improving the Web experience not only for people like Tsaran -- who lost his sight at the age of five -- but for Web users in general. ""We're seeing a lot more awareness and involvement in Web accessibility than we did a few years ago, particularly among big companies,"" said Judy Brewer, director of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) at the World Wide Web Consortium. ""It's becoming a solid business expectation that Web sites need to meet the needs of all users."" At the two biggest Internet companies in the world, accessibility is seen as an increasingly important part of what they do. Yahoo requires every new hire to receive accessibility training from Tsaran and Alan Brightman, senior policy director of special communities. And it books engineering teams for tours of their Accessibility Lab. Google recently rolled out a service that will let YouTube users add captions to their videos, and believes that as the Web moves more from an era of presentation to an era of two-way ""data-driven"" communication, accessibility becomes even more important, said Jonas Klink, accessibility program manager. Web accessibility has come a long way in the decade since many of these proposals were first floated. It's still a challenge, however, for the Web community to remember that as it pushes forward with exciting new technologies like HTML5 that could reinvent the Internet experience, it must keep in mind the needs of those who can't type 60 words per minute, operate a mouse like a scalpel, or see the unobtrusive pop-up windows that point to the next destination on the page. ""As the Web gets more and more dynamic, the accessibility requirements get more and more interesting, and sometimes challenging, to implement,"" Brewer said. The challenges . There are about 60 million people in the U.S. who can't use a computer to get on the Internet in the normal fashion, said Yahoo's Brightman. For those people, a mix of screen reader software, keyboards with special buttons, and even motion-sensing Web cameras must take the place of the mouse and QWERTY keyboard. That can cause problems for Web designers who rely too heavily on mouse navigation, or who design pages with special multimedia whiz-bang effects that look cool only to the people that can see them. ""There can be an assumption of homogeneity on the Web,"" said Naomi Bilodeau, technical program manager for Google. Users of screen readers -- software that essentially reads out loud a description of text, links, and buttons on a page -- are confounded the most by Captchas and Flash Web pages, according to a recent survey of screen-reader users conducted by WebAIM. But simple things like photos or images can also create problems if the Web publisher doesn't add alt text to those photos, or relies primarily on images as a way of explaining what is happening on the page. And as Web designers push forward with Javascript and AJAX-based technologies that overlay Web content over the primary Web page, there's great potential to confuse screen readers. The good news is that most of these problems aren't as much technology issues as design issues; content created with things like Flash can be made accessible if designers start off with that principle in mind. ""There are a bunch of things (in Web design) that are not features,"" said Nicholas Zakas, principal front-end engineer for Yahoo's home page, meaning that while you can jazz up a page all you like with additional features, there are certain things that should be standard fare. ""Performance is not a feature, internationalization is not a feature, and accessibility is not a feature."" However, features can make the Web more accessible. As mentioned, Google recently rolled out automatic captioning software for YouTube videos, making it much easier for deaf people to enjoy the world's largest collection of cute cat videos. The automatic captioning technology is being rolled out first on YouTube's Educational channel, allowing deaf or hearing-impaired people to take advantage of distance learning programs or other educational systems. It's most definitely a work in progress, but with refinement could really add to the amount of knowledge that can be consumed by disabled people. ""I wanted this so badly (that) it's good enough, I don't care if there are some bad captions,"" said Google's Ken Harrenstien, a deaf software engineer who played an instrumental role in bringing the project to life. The reasons . There are no explicit laws that companies design Web sites to be accessible to the disabled, but many disability experts and Web companies believe that portions of the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 do apply to the Internet, despite having been written several years before the Web emerged as a mainstream phenomenon. And in order to do business with the U.S. government, companies must comply with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, which insists that electronic and information technology products sold to government agencies be designed with disabled employees in mind, and that government services produced by contractors consider disabled citizens in equal measure. But these are businesses, after all: Yahoo's Brightman estimated that there's about $220 billion in discretionary spending available to disabled people. Making a Web site accessible to as many people as possible isn't just the right thing to do, it also makes business sense, he said. Also, with a rapidly aging population in many parts of the world -- notably the U.S. -- accessibility requirements will become useful for today's crop of baby boomers as they grow older. People over 65 are increasing their use of the Internet, according to Nielsen, and features designed for accessibility could aid those who aren't technically disabled but wouldn't mind a little extra help. The future . The immediate challenge for those working on Web accessibility is to ensure that accessibility standards are not trampled in the rush to finalize the HTML5 collection of standards that Google and other Web browser companies are currently debating. Brewer said it's ""extremely important to be sure that HTML5 can support accessibility fully,"" and her group is working closely with the other parts of the W3C to realize that goal. But beyond that goal, Web accessibility advocates have reason to feel optimistic about their cause. Long-awaited technologies like sophisticated speech recognition are finally coming to fruition after decades of joking about how such capabilities were just two years away. And 46 percent of respondents to the WebAIM survey reported that Web content has become more accessible in recent years. ""Anybody should be able to use anything on this page,"" said Yahoo's Zakas, keeper of the all-important Yahoo.com page. ""If anybody can't use it, it shouldn't be there."" © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. CNET, CNET.com and the CNET logo are registered trademarks of CBS Interactive Inc.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations is trying to put sexual violence on the international policy map, telling political and military leaders that wartime mass rape ""is no more inevitable than, or acceptable than, mass murder."" Rape is being used by armed groups to reignite flames of conflict and to terrorize and humiliate communities in Africa, according to Letitia Anderson, women's rights specialist with the U.N.'s Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict initiative. The U.N. is monitoring five countries closely because of sexual violence in conflicts. The five are the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), Liberia, the Darfur region in Sudan, Chad and Cote d'Ivoire (formerly Ivory Coast). But it's not just Africa at which the U.N. is looking; it's cross-regional, Anderson told CNN. She said armed groups are branding the bodies of women and children with signature patterns, as cattle are branded, in places such as Congo, leaving scars so that their families and community members know they are victims of aggravated sexual violence. U.N. officials cite not just the mass scale of such crimes, but the horrific nature of the crimes as well. ""Many are child soldiers, and they maybe have to rape their mother or their siblings and then kill them afterwards,"" said Margot Wallstrom, the U.N. secretary-general's special representative on sexual violence in conflict. There have been no reparations for survivors in Africa because of the complete collapse of the legal system during conflicts, Anderson said. Wartime rape ""is one of the great peace and security challenges of our time,"" she said, but added it ""has been the least condemned and most silenced war crime."" Wallstrom told reporters recently that in modern war, ""rape is not a side effect, but it is actually a new frontline."" U.N. action on that frontline has included a 2008 Security Council unanimous adoption of a resolution acknowledging rape as a tactic of war and an impediment to peace. With the U.N.'s Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict initiative, U.N. representatives have tried to put sexual violence in the spotlight. In May, Wallstrom took the U.N.'s message to the Democratic Republic of Congo where, she said, more than 200,000 women have been raped in the past 12 years of conflict . She visited Liberia in June and learned rape is still the No. 1 reported crime. One government survey in a Liberian county in 2005-2006 found that 92 percent of 1,600 women interviewed reported that they had experienced some form of sexual violence, including rape. Tackling stereotypes about the crime of rape will help ease the shame many societies attach to rape, and initiating discourse is the first step ""to break the silence,"" she said, repeating a well-known phrase among anti-rape advocates worldwide. Her message is motivated by the women and children she's met, Wallstrom said, adding, ""Survivors are their own best advocates."" ""The word 'woman' is not synonymous with 'victim' or 'vulnerable,' "" Wallstrom added. ""The women that I've met in the DRC, in Liberia, are agents of recovery and change."" As the U.N. initiative works to fight against wartime rape and to protect victims of that crime, Wallstrom sees her own U.N. role in a highly personal perspective. ""I'm responsible not only to the secretary-general and Security Council,"" she said, ""but above all, to the survivors of this soul-shattering crime.""","Wartime rape is ""the least condemned and most silenced war crime,"" U.N. official says .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the father of suspected terrorist Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab visited the U.S. embassy in Nigeria in November, he told officials he believed his son was under the influence of religious extremists and had traveled from London, England, to Yemen, a senior administration official said Monday. Revealing new details, the official also denied the father told officials his son might be on a suicide mission: . ""There was no suggestion he was about to carry out a terrorist act,"" the official said. A suspect in the foiled Christmas Day terror attack, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, is being held for allegedly trying to blow up a flight carrying 300 passengers that was about to land in the United States. This official says the father, Umaru AbdulMutallab, came to the embassy in Abuja, Nigeria, on November 19. ""He was concerned about his son's safety and whereabouts and wondered if the U.S. government could help,"" the official said. ""The father said he was in Yemen,"" this official said. ""His son had gone from London to Yemen."" The official noted that this information was based on what the father said but has not been corroborated. The next day, November 20, the U.S. embassy in Abuja sent what is called a ""Visas Viper cable"" to the State Department detailing the father's concerns, according to an official account by State Department spokesman Ian Kelley. That information was passed on to the National Counter-Terrorism Center in Washington, which ruled that the information in the cable was ""insufficient for this interagency review process to make a determination that this individual's visa should be revoked."" The secretary of state can unilaterally revoke a visa but usually does that for foreign policy and diplomatic, not national security, reasons, Kelley said. ""This has to be done in consultation with other agencies,"" Kelley said. State Department spokesman Ian Kelley provided further details Monday. AbdulMutallab was studying in London, Kelly said. He applied for a multiple-entry U.S. visa on June 12, 2008, and received it June 16, 2008. The visa was a standard multiple-entry tourist visa good for two years. ""At the time, there was nothing in his application, nor in any data base at the time, that would warrant that he should not receive a visa. He was a student at a reputable school, he had plenty of financial resources. ... There was no derogatory information about him last year that would have indicated that he should not get a visa,"" Kelley said. The suspect traveled previously to the U.S. on another visa, Kelley said. Kelley said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will ask the department's consular division to review all processes connected with issuing visas.","In November, suspect's father told officials at U.S. Embassy in Nigeria that son went to Yemen .

"(CNN) -- Health care reform is proceeding toward the president's desk, likely to become law in the new year. Supporters promise the bill will cut costs and extend coverage. But here's the real test: What will the trillion-dollar expense of this bill actually buy? Will it improve America's health? My guess: No. For all the money Americans spend on health care (60 percent more per person than any other advanced country), Americans are not an especially healthy people. Life expectancy at 50 in the U.S. ranks 29th in the world, three years behind world leader Japan, one and a half years behind Canada. Other indicators -- infant mortality, life expectancy at birth -- look even worse. This poor performance is often blamed on the fact that millions of Americans lack health insurance. But as a recent paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research found, the U.S. -- despite its kludgy health insurance system -- does a remarkably good job of extending disease-fighting treatment to all. Authors Samuel Preston and Jessica Ho observe: . • The U.S. screens a higher percentage of women for cervical cancer than any other country in a sample of 15 advanced countries. • Americans have the highest survival rates for breast, lung, colon or rectal cancer in a sample of 20 advanced countries. • Compared with Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Great Britain, the U.S. had the third-lowest fatality rate for male heart attack victims ages 40-64, the second-lowest for men ages 85-89 and the best for women aged 85-89. • Americans 50 and older with heart disease are more likely to receive medication than similarly aged Europeans. Ditto stroke. Ditto high cholesterol. Cancer and heart disease are not any old ailments. These are the leading causes of death for people 50 and older. So if the U.S. health system does such a good job saving its middle-aged and elderly sick, why do Americans die comparatively young? Answer: because Americans are much more likely to get sick in the first place. And that likelihood owes very little to the health care system and a great deal to the bad choices American individuals make. If you eat too much, exercise too little, drink too much, smoke, take drugs, fail to wear a seat belt or ignore gun safety, there is only so much a doctor or hospital can do for you. And Americans do all those things, more than other people. One-third of Americans are overweight. That one single fact accounts for almost 10 percent of all health care spending. At any given moment, one out of six motorists is unbelted. American children are nine times more likely to be injured in a gun accident than children in other developed countries. If all Americans quit smoking, if everybody wore a seat belt, if gun owners consistently secured their weapons, if we all drank in moderation and abjured illegal drugs and if the one-third of the country that is overweight would drop the extra pounds, those individual actions would do more to improve health and extend lives than any contemplated by Congress or the president. Acting on this information won't be easy: It violates too many taboos. Americans understandably treasure their right to make their own choices, including the choice to super-size it. And many are uncomfortably aware that self-destructive behavior is most often found among the poor and among minorities: Black women are more than three times as likely as white women to be severely obese. In the near term, public policy can achieve only a limited impact against these problems. There is evidence that youth obesity can be reduced by zoning rules that forbid fast-food restaurants to be sited within 200 yards of a school. More and better gym classes, better cafeteria menus and a ban on soda in schools would all help too. Over the longer term, we will have to rethink the deeper structure of American food policy: subsidies to corn and soybean growers, the paving over of exurban land that might provide nearby cities with less expensive fruits and vegetables. Ultimately, though, these are decisions that individuals must make for themselves. In this respect, the present concept of medicalized health care sends some unwelcome messages. By ""outsourcing"" the concept of health as something that doctors, hospitals and now government do for you -- rather than something that depends considerably on your own choices and efforts -- we ask the medical system to do more than any medical system can do. As you consider your new year's resolutions, remember: better habits will benefit not only your family and yourself -- but all your neighbors and countrymen as well. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Frum.","Americans' poor health, relative to other countries, is cited as a reason for health reform .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed to a Los Angeles, California, hospital Friday because of ""complications"" relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, her publicist said. Her husband called an ambulance to their Bel Air home to take the actress to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center on Friday afternoon, spokesman John Blanchette said. Gabor, 93, had returned home on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed. Gabor has been frail and ""pretty much confined to a wheelchair"" since a 2002 car accident, said her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt.  The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""The Story of Three Loves"" in 1953, ""The Girl in the Kremlin"" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ""Touch of Evil.""","Gabor suffered ""complications"" from hip surgery .

"(CNN) -- Two of the four survivors of this week's crash on an Alaska mountainside were well enough to talk with government officials looking into the cause of the crash, National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Chairwoman Deborah Hersman told reporters on Friday. Both survivors recalled the pilot giving a safety briefing before the flight, she said. The survivor who sat in the front seat reported falling asleep almost immediately after the plane took off and waking up after the crash. The other survivor told investigators ""they were flying along and then just stopped flying,"" according to Hersman, who did not say which of the four survivors investigators spoke with. Five people died in the Monday night crash, including former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens. The family of experienced pilot Terry Smith, who was killed in the accident, released a statement Friday saying, ""This is a time of great sorrow for our family. Our hearts and prayers go out to the survivors and the family and friends of all those affected by this tremendous loss."" Smith had been involved in a prior accident, in 1997, said Hersman. No one was injured in that accident, in which the plane nosed over during landing. The incident was chalked up to the pilot's failure to maintain control, she said. Those killed in the crash could not have been saved even if rescue teams had arrived at the site immediately, officials said. The autopsies found the deaths were the result of blunt force trauma, said Greg Wilkinson, an official at the Medical Examiner's office. He said the state medical examiner, Dr. Katherine Raven, found the injuries to be consistent with this type of crash. Raven also found that the injuries were not survivable, he said. Meanwhile, the condition of former NASA chief Sean O'Keefe has been upgraded from critical to serious, according to the Providence Alaska Medical Center. He was the most seriously injured of the four survivors. ""Sean is making significant improvements,"" an O'Keefe family spokesman said on Friday. ""... It does not appear that any of Sean's injuries require surgery. And we are encouraged by medical reports indicating that Sean's injuries are not life-threatening."" O'Keefe suffered a dislocated hip, which has been corrected, according to a statement by family spokesman Paul Pastorek. Despite initial reports, there was no serious trauma to O'Keefe's pelvis, the statement said. The condition of Sean O'Keefe's son, Kevin, has been upgraded from serious to fair, said Pastorek. ""Despite suffering serious injuries that have required surgery, Kevin is also showing dramatic improvement,"" the statement said. ""Even so, he is very much on the mend."" Survivor Jim Moorhard remained in fair condition, while William Phillips, whose father died in the crash, remained in good condition, said the Providence Alaska Medical Center. Federal officials are continuing to probe the cause of the crash, said NTSB's Hersman. They are waiting to speak with the remaining two survivors.

"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) -- By spending a few days here in America's fifth-largest city -- which also happens to be at the heart of the nation's immigration debate -- I had the chance to see this volatile issue from many different vantage points. But as far I know, I didn't see any terror babies. Regular viewers of CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" will recognize that term as referring to children born on U.S. soil to illegal immigrants. The children are automatically granted U.S. citizenship under the 14th Amendment and then are smuggled back to their home countries to be raised as pint-sized, America-hating terrorists. Then decades later, when the children have grown into adults, they could easily -- because of their U.S. citizenship -- re-enter the United States to attack it from within. So terror babies are sort of like a sleeper cell, one that has to be put down for a nap every few hours or it gets fussy. Is this a scary scenario? You bet. Is it anything close to reality? It doesn't look like it. In fact, what's really scary are opportunistic lawmakers out there who will sink to new depths to scare the Dickens out of people in order to drum up support for the radical idea of changing the 14th Amendment or scrapping it altogether. That's what this story is really about. It's an elaborate pitch to that constituency who believes that illegal immigrants are unfairly taking advantage of a constitutional provision that makes anyone born on U.S. soil an American citizen. The two Texas Republicans who are actively spinning this yarn -- State Representative Debbie Riddle and U.S. Congressman Louie Gohmert -- both appeared on Cooper's show this week, and neither could provide any evidence of the existence of these mythical terror babies. In fact, in the face of questioning by Cooper, both got extremely defensive. You might say these GOP fear mongers were acting in a way that could be accurately described as infantile. Riddle and Gohmert claimed they got the information from conversations with ""former FBI officials."" So Cooper interviewed CNN contributor Tom Fuentes, who served as the FBI's assistant director in the office of international operations from 2004 to 2008. ""The FBI has 75 offices overseas, including offices in Jordan, Turkey, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Pakistan,"" Fuentes said. ""There was never a credible report -- or any report, for that matter -- coming across through all the various mechanisms of communication to indicate that there was such a plan for these terror babies to be born."" The FBI has also done everything it can to knock down the story as simply not credible. Of course, this tall tale isn't credible; it's probably nothing more than a figment of politicians' imaginations. But it is valuable since it helps illustrate a disturbing phenomenon here in Arizona, where supporters of the state's new immigration law seem to feel as if they have to justify the measure not only by scaring people, but also by doing extreme makeovers. They take things that are familiar and try to make them sinister. Those aren't U.S. citizen babies, they say; they're future terrorists. Those aren't run-of-the-mill illegal immigrants who come to Arizona to work and feed their families; they're drug mules for the Mexican cartels, says Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. And those aren't coyotes, immigrant smugglers bringing people in the United States as they have for generations; they're drug cartels, which -- according to Brewer -- now control all the immigrant smuggling operations into the United States. The Border Patrol was just as quick to knockdown those stories as untrue as the FBI was in refuting the story about terror babies using the 14th Amendment to do us harm. I was glad to see that. There is already enough dishonesty in the immigration debate; we certainly don't need any more coming from the state of Arizona. Yet, there is a steady trickle of deceptions and half-truths. The three big fibs -- repeated by top Republican officials -- are that the federal government isn't doing its job to protect the borders, that the law is an attempt to crack down on drug cartels, and that race isn't part of the discussion. None of that is true. So why repeat it? Those who believe in the state's immigration law and consider it a good idea to empower local police and sheriff's deputies to enforce federal immigration law should stand by the legislation as it is written. They shouldn't have to try to create an alternate reality to win over more supporters. A prominent Mexican-American attorney, who has long been a visible and vocal member of Phoenix's Latino community, warned me against trying to make sense of the opposition. For instance, I asked him, how could people continue to argue that the Obama administration isn't doing enough to secure the border when all the evidence suggests otherwise? ""You'll never be able to convince people of that,"" he said. ""Because their motivation is political. It's not based in reality."" I'm afraid that's not good enough. If the supporters of SB1070 really believe in the merits of their cause, they should be able to win the argument on the natural, without relying on hocus-pocus or scare tactics or radical makeovers. And if they can't do that, if they have to portray babies as terrorists and immigrants as drug mules in order to win support for their side, then this should tell them loud and clear that they're on the wrong side of this issue -- not to mention, on the wrong side of history. No amount of spin can change that.

"Washington (CNN) -- Diversity is not a word that describes the Supreme Court's makeup over most of its existence. Only three women justices have served (the first in 1981), and only two African-Americans (the first in 1967). The first Hispanic was named last year, but no Native Americans or Asian-Americans have been named, nor have any openly homosexual or disabled justices. Only about 11 Catholics have served, and seven Jews. The expected elevation of Elena Kagan to the high court would represent both a step forward and a retreat of sorts, for bench diversity on the high-profile court, especially when compared to the man she would replace. Kagan is set to become the third woman on the current court, a move applauded by retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor and former first lady Laura Bush. The 50-year-old also has no judicial experience, unlike every current member of the court, who were previously federal appeals court judges. Justice Antonin Scalia, for one, likes that. ""Currently, there is nobody on the court who has not served as a judge -- indeed, as a federal judge -- all nine of us,"" he said last month in a speech. ""I am happy to see that this latest nominee is not a federal judge -- and not a judge at all."" She would be the third Jewish-American, joining Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. The other six members of the court are all Catholic: Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor. Retiring Justice John Paul Stevens is the current court's lone Protestant. That has prompted divergent views from the religious and political community on whether diversity of faith matters. His departure and replacement by Kagan also would represent a loss of diversity on two other fronts: geography and education. The Chicago native is a true Midwesterner in his friendly personality and his approach to deciding many legal issues. Kagan would help form an unusual majority: five natives of the New York City area. Scalia is from Queens, Ginsburg still retains her Brooklyn accent, Sotomayor grew up in the Bronx and loves the Yankees, and Alito called Newark, New Jersey, home. The nominee herself was raised in the upper west side of Manhattan. Only Staten Island among the boroughs would be unrepresented on the high court. And then there is the academic equation, with the new court to be composed entirely of Ivy League law graduates. Kagan went to Harvard Law School, just like Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy and Breyer. That's another majority Kagan can boast. Ginsburg also attended the Boston-area school, as well as Columbia. The three other justices went to Yale. Only Stevens -- again -- stayed out of those ivied schools, graduating from Northwestern University at the head of his class in 1947. Stevens' departure is a generational shift, too: he is the court's last military veteran who came of age during the Depression, served in the Navy during World War II, and began practicing law during the Cold War. With the advent in the 1920s of open Senate hearings of court nominees, public and press scrutiny of court diversity have become important talking points. At that time, tremendous social and political changes in the country were reflected in a slow push to diversify the court's makeup. Since then, seats unofficially have been set aside for individuals of certain backgrounds. The first Jewish justice was Louis Brandeis, whose bitter 1916 confirmation was marked by underlying anti-Semitism. When Benjamin Cardozo joined him in 1932, a so-called Jewish seat was established. Cardozo was replaced by Felix Frankfurter, who was replaced by Arthur Goldberg, who was replaced by Abe Fortas. Currently, two Jewish justices sit on the bench, Ginsburg and Breyer. A similar precedent was created when Thurgood Marshall became the first person of color to sit on the court. When he retired, Clarence Thomas took Marshall's seat, although President George H.W. Bush considered a wide variety of candidates before settling on the Georgia native. Thomas has acknowledged to colleagues that he benefited to some extent from having the right connections in his career. Many political and legal experts expected George W. Bush to make his first court pick a Hispanic, but his two picks were white males. Some court observers believe political pressure to choose a justice strictly on gender or race is no longer relevant. ""The whole commentary of the court has evolved away from that,"" said Pulitzer Prize winning author and court historian David Garrow. ""Our society has changed; the novelty no longer exists."" President Barack Obama's two high court choices have been applauded by many advocacy groups for the diversity they brought to the court, but criticism also has arisen on some fronts. Civil rights groups expressed disappointment the nation's first black president did not seriously consider naming any African-Americans to the court. ""The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups,"" wrote CNN Political Analyst Roland Martin in May. ""Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days."" Kagan in fact has been criticized for the lack of diversity she brought as Harvard's law dean from 2003-09. Guy-Uriel Charles, founding director of the Duke Center on Law, Race and Politics, looked at Kagan's hiring record, noting of the 29 positions she had a chance to fill, 28 were of those appointed were white and one was Asian-American. And of the group, only six were women -- five white and one Asian-American. ""These numbers on the surface are appalling, and would be ripped to shreds by those who value diversity,"" Martin said. Kagan's defenders say her hiring power was limited, but she did help bring a number of conservative professors to the faculty, earning praise from many on the right.","No Native Americans, Asian-Americans, homosexual or disabled justices named to high court .

"(CNN) -- The beauty of having your own radio or TV show or column is that you have a wonderful opportunity to address many of the significant issues of the day by using the enormous platform that has been bestowed upon you. That's why when I read, and then heard, the stunning, childish, and venomous discussion Dr. Laura Schlesinger had with one of her callers Tuesday, it was clear to me that the firebrand radio talk show host blew a perfect shot. She could have used the exchange around race to help a lot of people. Dr. Laura is getting ripped, rightfully so, for her repeated use of the N-word during the discussion with a black female caller. Instead of paying attention and listening to the woman's genuine concerns about the racist comments made by the friends and family members of her white husband, Dr. Laura made her out to be the villain. It was clear that Dr. Laura had a beef of her own when it comes to black folks being too sensitive about matters of race, and that's why she tried to use the example of black comedians using the N-word to buttress her position that the woman should really pipe down and not be so sensitive about such issues. She could have easily pivoted from the caller's question to explore this issue, but she didn't, choosing to dig herself deeper and deeper into the racial abyss. First, Dr. Laura needs to step back and realize that yes, black comedians use the N-word onstage, and it is something that I have protested and called for all African-Americans to stop using. But let's be honest, comedians of all ethnic groups do all kinds of crazy stuff on stage, dissing African-Americans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, whites, men, women, gays, Jews, the mentally challenged, you name it. So when the B-word, C-word, or F-word is used onstage, are we to say that is perfectly acceptable language offstage? Dr. Laura also would fail at political analysis in her assertion that a lot of black folks voted for President Obama because he's half-black. Should someone remind her that Obama got 95 percent of the black vote. Pretty pale Democrats like Al Gore and Bill Clinton got between 90 percent and 92 percent of the black vote. Dr. Laura, that's largely a Democratic thing; it's not necessarily a black thing. As I listened to the caller, and as Dr. Laura continued haranguing her, it was clear that the woman who has made millions dispensing advice on the radio for years needs to have someone sit her down and explain how she not only screwed up by tossing out the N-word repeatedly, she also squandered a chance to be a part of what many considered to be essential: a national discussion on race. The caller was disturbed about those in the inner circle of her husband driving their racial stereotypes and as making racial comments in front of her. When I keep hearing folks talk about the need for a national conversation about race, it's not all about Obama leading it. If we are to conquer our racial demons, it's necessary for the caller's white husband to be as willing to look his friends and family members in the eye and say, ""your comments are insulting to my wife and I want you to stop. Now!"" The real problem many of us have when confronting race matters is that we are too unwilling to challenge those closest to us. No child wants to enter into a verbal battle with his or her mother or father who may hold racist views, or willingly accept racial stereotypes. But none of us can be silent when that happens. It was the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. who said, ""In the end, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends."" Do you recall the restaurant scene in the movie, ""The Blind Side,"" where the ""friends"" of Sandra Bullock were making offhanded racial comments? When she had enough of their mess, she checked them and made clear she would be dining with others. She refused to allow their racial hang-ups to stain her. Bullock's character could have easily kept the friendship intact by saying nothing and moving on. But she chose a different path. Dr. Laura had the same opportunity. She could have heard the woman out and dispensed some genuine advice that could have helped the caller and her listening audience. Instead, she grabbed that chip on her should that revealed to us that she is clearly annoyed when some blacks complain about racism. She compounded that by telling the woman she should have never married outside of her race if she couldn't stand racial humor. Folks, that's not how to do it. Dr. Laura has apologized, but that hasn't stopped people like Marc Morial, CEO of the National Urban League, from calling on The Talk Network to drop her syndicated show. If we truly want folks to ""get over it"" (which is what Dr. Laura essentially told this black woman to do when it came to racism), it is going to take us reforming the bigots, and not admonishing the offended. I fundamentally believe we can get people to see their racial bigotry or insensitive views and offer them a pathway towards healing, but that can only happen when we're willing to challenge one another -- friend or foe -- and look into the mirror and confront our own deeply embedded views on race. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.","Laura Schlesinger repeatedly using the N-word in a radio show conversation .
She could have pivoted from the caller's question to explore racial issues, Roland Martin writes .

"New York (CNN) -- He didn't compete for the hot dog eating title this year, but he did cause a scene at the contest. Takeru Kobayashi was arrested at Coney Island after his rival, Joey Chestnut, won the annual Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest. The six-time champion of the contest was trying to make his way on stage after this year's event, according to a representative for Kobayashi and a New York police officer at the Brooklyn precinct booking desk. The incident was not a publicity stunt, Maggie James, Kobayashi's spokeswoman, said Sunday night. ""He got excited when people chanted his name after the contest .... so he jumped up on the stage because he wanted his fans to see him and (he thought) maybe they would chant, 'Let him eat,'"" James said, referring to a dispute that kept Kobayashi from the table this year. Kobayashi -- who took home the title every year from 2001 to 2006 -- did not compete because of a contract dispute with Major League Eating. He watched from the stands. Chestnut won by consuming 54 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes. The win -- Chestnut's fourth straight -- was short of his 68-hot dog record set last year. A statement from the New York Police Department's public affairs office following the arrest said Kobayashi was charged with two misdemeanors and one violation, with the violation considered a low-level charge similar to a traffic violation. The two misdemeanors were resisting arrest and obstructing government administration (specifically, interfering with police). The violation was trespassing. Kobayashi was being held at a police precinct in Brooklyn, and it was unclear whether he had a lawyer or when he might have bail set. His spokeswoman, James, said it appeared that he would spend the night in jail unless he could get a hearing -- unlikely on a Sunday night and also a holiday night. In the days leading up to the event, Kobayashi said he loves the contest and he wanted to participate, but that the contract was too restrictive. Speaking through a Japanese interpreter, he said that all his income is earned through competitive eating. He said the new contract required by the competition would bar him from competing elsewhere in the United States or Canada for a year. Both sides said contract negotiations went on until Saturday morning. MLE chairman George Shea called Kobayashi's arrest ""unfortunate."" ""It makes you wonder what his thinking was,"" Shea said. ""Major League Eating made an enormous effort to get him into the contest,"" he added. ""We wanted him there. Nathan's wanted him there. The fans wanted him there."" Hailing from Japan and weighing in at 160 pounds, Kobayashi, 31, rose to frank-feasting stardom in 2001 when he devoured 50 dogs, shattering the previously held record of 25 1/8. But in 2007, having entered the challenge with a jaw injury, Kobayashi met his match in Chestnut. Chestnut, the 230-pound contender from San Jose, California, downed 66 dogs to Kobayashi's 63 that year. Kobayashi has not won the competition since, and Chestnut is currently ranked No. 1 in competitive eating by the MLE. For a hot dog to be counted as finished, competitors must consume both the hot dog and the bun. Currently ranked third, Kobayashi still holds world records for eating cow brains (17.7 pounds in 15 minutes), lobster rolls (41 in 15 minutes) and rice balls (20 pounds in 30 minutes). ""This guy did great things for our sport,"" Shea said. ""He's a fearsome competitor."" CNN's Ross Levitt and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Kobayashi arrested after hot dog contest .

"(CNN) -- The mother of child murder suspect Casey Anthony affirms her belief in her daughter's innocence and expresses fear for her safety in letters released by court officials on Thursday. ""You stay strong Casey,"" Cindy Anthony tells her daughter in one letter from May. ""Many, many people believe in you and are trying to get to the truth. Not everyone has been brainwashed and not everyone is trying to cover his/her butt."" Casey Anthony is charged with capital murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter Caylee. The girl was reported missing in July 2008, and investigators found her body after five months of intense searches and speculation. In the May letter, Cindy Anthony writes that she ""freaked out"" when she saw her daughter being escorted into the courtroom by heavily armed deputies. ""I was worried that there's treats [sic] on your life and are finally being taken seriously,"" she wrote. ""I swear there are maniacs out there. I hope they step up security next year, for all of us. It's going to be nuts. Hopefully by then somebody will actually look at the evidence and clearly see that they need to be looking for the real person that took our Caylee."" In June, after Casey Anthony tripped on her way to a court appearance and showed up with a chipped tooth and cut lip, her mother said she had been ""worried that something was going to happen to you."" She thanks her daughter for trying to call on Mother's Day, and tells her, ""I had a dream the other night that you will be home."" ""I know you better than anyone,"" Cindy Anthony wrote. ""Even with unanswered questions I still know the person you are and love you have in your heart. Your problem is that you are too trusting like I was. Unfortunately, we both found out how ugly and mean people really are. There's very few people you can trust."" The letters were released as part of discovery in the case. In June, prosecutors released more than 5,000 pages of documents that ranged from marriage proposals from admirers to calls for Casey Anthony to be put to death. She has pleaded not guilty and has refused to see visitors, because the sessions would be videotaped and eventually released. In a July letter, her mother laments, ""I just wish we had the ability to speak to each other.""

"(CNN) -- Federal investigators, joined by local officials and others, spread across Alaska on Thursday seeking the cause of a plane crash that killed five people, including former U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens. Deborah Hersman, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters that the initial investigation of the crashed airplane was complete. The wreckage would be hauled to nearby Dillingham, Alaska, to be examined further, Hersman said. There was no new information on what caused the plane to crash Monday on a rugged mountainside in southwestern Alaska, killing Stevens and four others. Another four passengers survived, including former NASA head Sean O'Keefe. Stevens, who served in the U.S. Senate for 40 years, was 86. His funeral will be held next Wednesday at 2 p.m. (6 p.m. ET) at the Anchorage Baptist Temple in Anchorage, according to Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. O'Keefe remained in critical condition on Thursday, according to Kirsten Schultz, a spokeswoman for Providence Alaska Medical Center. The condition of O'Keefe's son, Kevin, was upgraded to fair from serious. Another survivor, lobbyist Jim Morhard of Alexandria, Virginia, was also upgraded to fair from serious. Thirteen year-old William Phillips, whose father died in the crash, remained in good condition, Schultz said. A CNN reporter who flew over the crash site Thursday said there was a wide, brown swath cut through the trees by the plane. The crash occurred about 1,000 feet up the 2,300-foot mountain in an area called Muklung Hills, about a 20-minute flight from Dillingham, the reporter said. Hersman said the de Havilland DHC-3 Otter involved in the crash was manufactured in 1957 and overhauled in 2005 from a piston to a turbine engine. She also confirmed the plane lacked either a Ground Proximity Warning System or an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System. The devices, which Hersman said are not required, help pilots determine how far they are above ground or terrain and can predict whether a plane is on a path toward an obstacle or mountains. Hersman said it was too soon to know whether any technological factor contributed to the crash. John Bouker, the commercial pilot who first spotted the crash site, told CNN Thursday that Stevens' plane ""was messed up but not beyond survivability."" ""It looked survivable,"" Bouker said, ""but it didn't look like it would be a very fun ride or anything. The wings were bent back. The nose section was messed up. It didn't look like a good situation to be in, that's for sure."" The aircraft, which was taking the group on a fishing trip, crashed in an area near the Bering Sea noted for its rugged terrain. Tom Tucker, a helicopter pilot who landed at the crash site, told CNN that when he first arrived, the survivors ""were coming in and out of consciousness. We put blankets over them to keep them warm."" The longest-serving Republican senator in U.S. history, Stevens lost his 2008 re-election bid to then-Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich after being convicted on charges of making false statements on financial disclosure forms. A federal judge later dismissed the conviction, citing prosecutorial misconduct. Stevens survived a plane crash that killed his wife in 1978; he later remarried.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Anna Nicole Smith's former bodyguard, who accused Howard K. Stern of injecting her with drugs, acknowledged he went public with the charge only after Stern called him a thief on CNN. Maurice ""Mo"" Brighthaupt, who testified Friday for the prosecution, was cross-examined Monday by defense lawyers for Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor. The three are on trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court on charges of conspiring to provide drugs to an addict and using false names on Smith's drug prescriptions. While Brighthaupt was harsh when speaking about Smith's lawyer/boyfriend, he had praise for Eroshevich, a psychologist who was also Smith's Studio City, California, neighbor. She flew to the Bahamas to be with Smith after her 20-year-old son, Daniel, died in Smith's hospital room just days after she gave birth to a daughter. Eroshevich was ""very soothing"" and ""talked to her like a mother,"" counseling Smith about how to deal with the grief, Brighthaupt said. The prosecution alleged both doctors gave the former Playboy model and reality-TV star a steady flow of dangerous painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs while knowing she was a drug addict. The charges cover the last three years of Smith's life, which ended in a Florida hotel room with her death caused by ""acute combined drug intoxication"" on February 8, 2007. The defense countered Smith was not an addict under the legal definition because her demand for drugs was fueled by chronic pain, anxiety and depression, especially after her son's death. ""She was a hurt woman,"" Brighthaupt said of Smith in the months after her son died. Although she was ""unbearably depressed,"" she would feel better for a while after taking the medications given to her by Eroshevich, he said. Eroshevich worked to keep Smith on a schedule with her medicines, resisting the actress' demands to take pills early. It was something Smith demanded ""all the time,"" he said. The doctor kept Smith on a regular eating and sleeping schedule, he said. Chloral Hydrate, a sleep medication prescribed by Eroshevich, ""appeared to be one medication that helped her sleep,"" he said. Eroshevich also helped Smith financially, he said, helping to pay some expenses when Smith had ""cash flow issues."" Smith would get upset when Eroshevich mentioned she would have to leave the Bahamas to attend to her practice in California, he said. ""She would do a lot of whining,"" which he said was one way Smith manipulated people to get her way. Brighthaupt said he never saw Smith abusing prescription drugs before her son's death. The times he saw her intoxicated was when someone would slip her Ecstasy or alcohol, he said. Stern's defense lawyer, Steve Sadow, grilled Brighthaupt for more than an hour Monday morning about his direct testimony in which he said he saw Stern inject Smith with drugs. Brighthaupt reluctantly acknowledged that the first time he related that story in public was just days after he saw Stern's interview with CNN's Larry King on October 10, 2007. Stern told King, ""I was a thief,"" he said. He denied Sadow's suggestion that Stern's interview angered him, insisting that he was only ""a little disappointed."" It was a week later, however, that Brighthaupt accepted $10,000 from entertainment news show ""Access Hollywood"" to license the use of some Smith photos and for an interview. He acknowledged that the interview was the first time he publicly said Stern injected Smith with drugs. Brighthaupt also related the story days later to a California drug investigator. The trial, which began last week, is expected to last up to three months.","Her bodyguard calls Anna Nicole's doctor ""very soothing""

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A quarter of Russian crops have been lost in the recent drought, leaving many farms on the brink of bankruptcy, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Thursday. The government should prevent increases in the price of grain and fodder, which will eventually affect the prices of food products like flour, bread, meat, and milk, Medvedev said at a government agriculture meeting in the southern Russian region of Rostov. ""Right now, everybody is of course thinking about it -- farmers as well as officials responsible for agriculture,"" Medvedev said in comments broadcast on Russian state television. ""But we also understand that regular people, too, are thinking about what will happen after this extremely tough summer, how it will affect the prices on staples food."" He said government authorities should closely monitor food prices on a daily basis, ""otherwise there will always be someone who would want to capitalize on this situation. There are such cases already."" Large parts of Russia have suffered this summer from excessive heat, drought, and a spate of wildfires that have also created stifling smoke and smog. Hundreds have died in the combined disasters. Alexander Frolov, who heads the Russian meteorological service Roshydromet, said this week that virtually no rain is forecast in Russia this month. The situation is so bad in some regions that there is ""no reason"" to start planting winter crops, Frolov said. Roshydromet forecasts a 30 percent drop in Russia's harvests due to the drought, he said. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has already announced a ban on grain exports that will begin August 15 and could last until December 31, based on uncertainty over this year's farm production. Some regions won't be sowing winter grain at all this year, he said. Thursday, Medvedev lifted the state of emergency in three of seven Russian regions most affected by wildfires. The Emergency Situations Ministry said the number of areas covered by the fires has decreased 25 percent in the past day. The fires burning in the remaining four regions of western and central Russia are still intense, however, with tens of thousands of firefighters deployed there. Medvedev ordered the Emergency Situations Ministry to take addition precautions to protect ""strategic sites"" from the fires. CNN's Maxim Tkachenko and Matthew Chance contributed to this report.","Medvedev says crop losses will eventually affect the prices of flour, meat, and milk .

"(CNN) -- A 7.2-magnitude earthquake has struck south of the Mariana Islands, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The Mariana Islands -- an archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean -- are made up of two U.S. territories, Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. The islands sit about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to the Philippines. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a tsunami warning after the quake, which struck at 7:19 a.m. Saturday (5:19 p.m. ET Friday). ""We wouldn't expect any kind of significant tsunami for this event,"" said the center's director, Charles McCreery, noting that the quake's magnitude was relatively low to provoke one. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage, emergency management officials said. The quake struck about 375 kilometers (233 miles) west-southwest of Hagatna, Guam, and 445 kilometers (276 miles) west-southwest of Rota, Northern Mariana Islands. It ran 4.7 kilometers (2.9 miles) deep. CNN's Dan Gilgoff and Talia Kayali contributed to this report.","NEW: No immediate reports of damage, casualties .

"(CNN) -- As many as four African migrants from Ethiopia and Eritrea trying to cross into Israel from Egypt's Sinai desert were shot dead by smugglers and 10 others were wounded, according to state media. The smugglers opened fire when the group refused to pay them, according to Egypt's official MENA news agency. Egypt's interior ministry confirmed that an investigation was under way into the incident, though its casualty figures differed. An official at the ministry told CNN that two Eritreans were killed on Egypt's border with Israel, and that three people were wounded. Fifteen others were arrested by Egyptian border police. In total, the group consisted of three-dozen African migrants attempting to flee into Israel, the official said.","Migrants trying to flee Egypt for Israel were killed by smugglers, official media says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A defiant Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, insisted Friday that neither she nor her staff broke any House rules. Waters also blasted the House ethics committee for failing to schedule a trial to resolve allegations she helped steer federal bailout money to Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank -- in which her husband had a financial stake. She repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and insisted she will not cut a deal with the committee. Given the fact that the committee's investigation has now lasted for over a year, ""such a delay is unacceptable,"" she told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference that lasted over an hour. ""This case is about fairness,"" she said. Due process has been denied, and ethics investigators have ignored ""key pieces of exculpatory evidence."" There was no special ""benefit, no improper action, (and) no failure to disclose,"" she declared. There is ""no case."" Waters, a 10-term Los Angeles congresswoman, insisted she was merely trying to arrange assistance for the National Bankers Association, an organization representing more than 100 minority-owned banks. Much of my work is based on expanding ""access for those who are (traditionally) not heard by the decision makers,"" she said. Waters, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, helped arrange a meeting in September 2008 between OneUnited and Treasury Department officials, according to ethics investigators. OneUnited Bank ultimately received $12 million in bailout funds. According to an ethics report, Waters' husband owned almost 4,000 shares of OneUnited stock at the time of the meeting. The shares had declined in value from more than $350,000 in June to $175,000 at the end of September -- the height of the Wall Street financial crisis. Waters, according to a separate preliminary report, called then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ""and requested that Treasury Department officials meet with representatives"" from the NBA. ""A meeting was in fact granted, however, the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- OneUnited. Rep. Waters' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and, at the time of the meeting, was a stock holder of the bank,"" the report said. Waters has repeatedly insisted the meeting was set up for NBA -- ""for all the minority bankers."" She noted Friday that some of the meeting's participants have asserted, contrary to the conclusion of the report, that between ""60 and 75 percent"" of the conversation focused on the needs of minority banks as a whole. The ethics report also states that Waters approached Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, to say that she was ""in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank, but 'OneUnited people' were coming to her for help."" Waters, ""according to [Frank] ... knew she should say no, but it bothered her. It was clear to [Frank] that this was a 'conflict of interest problem.'"" Frank's advice to Waters, the report states, was to 'stay out of it.'"" In an interview on the Tom Joyner Show Tuesday, Waters admitted she had spoken to Frank, but described the circumstances much differently than the report. ""I didn't go to him for advice. I went to him and told him, 'These are your constituents. They are headquartered in your district and they are now trying to find TARP. We're representing the National Bankers Association,'"" Waters said. ""So then I said, 'Perhaps you need to take a look at this' and he said, 'Fine. Don't worry. You don't have anything to do with this. I will take care of it.' And, as a result of that, he started to work on it."" she said. Waters insisted Friday she ""would never take extraordinary steps"" to save her husband's investment in OneUnited Bank. She also noted that the September meeting with Treasury officials happened before the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- the pool of bailout money from which OneUnited's $12 million was drawn -- became law. Ethics investigators have asserted that Waters ""agreed to refrain from advocating on behalf of OneUnited,"" but failed to instruct her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, from doing so. Following the September 9 meeting between Treasury and National Bankers Association officials, Moore ""was actively involved in assisting OneUnited representatives with their request for capital from Treasury and crafting legislation to authorize Treasury to grant the request"" for financial assistance, the ethics report said. ""Reasonable"" people could construe Moore's ""continued involvement in assisting OneUnited as the dispensing of special favors or privileges to OneUnited,"" the report concluded. Both Waters and Moore -- who also spoke at Friday's news conference -- have denied that allegation. ""If you're going to wrap this all around creating these violations because I failed to supervise my staff, it doesn't hold water, they don't have any proof of that and I maintain that I want to go to trial or whatever they want to call it -- adjudicatory hearing -- because I think I don't deserve this,"" Waters said Tuesday. Waters is the second high-ranking Democrat now facing a public ethics trial this fall. New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has been accused of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. The prospect of inquiries into the two high-profile Democrats has compounded the fears of congressional Democrats nervous about their prospects in mid-term elections in November. The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation. Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America.

"Calgary, Canada (CNN) -- Immediately before  9-11, al Qaeda was considered almost below most Americans' notice. One Washington Post/ABC News poll found that in early 2002, only 14 percent of Americans thought Islam encouraged violence. These days, the popular perception of Islam is dominated by al Qaeda and its radical agenda. Al Qaeda has grown into a monster that dominates the American psyche, and many non-Muslims fear that the majority of Muslims are bent on violent takeover. Throughout the last decade, the mainstream majority of Muslims have seemed almost silent, but today that all changes. As of this writing, 38 of the 50  Islamic scholars who make up Canada's Muslim mainstream leadership have signed the Canadian Council of Imams Declaration, released today. More names will follow. These signatories will lead Muslim communities onto a path of active engagement, taking back Islam and claiming it for multicultural peace. Here is why: . Muslims have been part of North American society for more than 100 years. There have been mosques in places such as Edmonton, Alberta; Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Cleveland, Ohio; and Buffalo, New York, since the 1930s. In Canada and the United States before 9-11, the growing Muslim minority was well-integrated, with higher-than-average educational attainments for both genders. Muslims in civic and business leadership positions went as unnoticed as members of any other successful community. And North America's Muslims were proud to be an integral part of North American society, because we knew it was the Muslim ideal as well. Radicals are working to destroy those relationships and are using the Quran to do it. Radicals regularly, ignorantly and blatantly abuse the Quran and the Sunnah (the acts of Mohammed that Muslims use to figure out what the revelations really mean) to promote the idea that Islam is a violent faith. For example, they cite a famous verse in the Quran that says, roughly, ""Fight the people of the book until they know themselves subdued,"" and use it to create fear or to support a violent agenda. However, here's what that verse really means. When Mohammed and his companions ""conquered"" the Middle East in the 7th century, the command to do so came in response to rumours of an army massing in the north that was planning to exterminate them. The Muslims expected a fight to the death but met people willing to live in peace, and they founded a society with rights, freedom, liberty and justice for all, regardless of race, creed or gender. God wasn't telling them when to fight, he was telling them when to stop. While the vast majority of imams today put this verse in historical perspective for their congregations, this declaration now serves to put those who would abuse it in perspective as well. Likewise, radicals claim Islam is anti-Semitic. And yet, when Jerusalem fell, Caliph Umar walked up to the gates and accepted the Catholic patriarch's demands for security, religious freedom and relative autonomy with one proviso: that those rights also be afforded to the 70 Jewish families who had been expelled by the Patriarch. Claims that Islam wants to destroy Christianity are answered by Caliph Umar's refusal of the patriarch's invitation to pray in the Christian cathedral, ""that later generations not declare it a mosque, so that it will remain a church forever."" In fact, equality before the courts in Mohammed's time was so profound that when Muslims extorted land from a Jewish citizen and built a mosque, the caliph had the mosque destroyed and the land returned. Muslims around the world offer thoughts on what Islam means today . Western ideals are Muslim ideals. When al Qaeda (whose leaders are described in Muslim prophecy as ""men with the hearts of demons"") launched its 9-11 attack, the primary objective was to alienate America's Muslims from the America they love. Al Qaeda hoped to turn both sides away from those ideals that made both civilizations great. And their success at this alienation has remained woefully unchallenged until now. That alienation drives Muslims to criminal acts here and abroad even though they should know better, and it is driving America and Canada into repudiating every good freedom we have attained. Violence and rivalries have no place in faith -- any faith. Many Christians think they've begun the first blows of Armageddon, even though Muslims believe we're the army of the returning Christ. I have Jewish friends in Canada who think Palestinians are descended from Amalekites (whom Jews are commanded to exterminate), even though Midianites, Ishmaelites and other Arab monotheist tribes populate the Old Testament. Moses and Jacob married proto-Palestinians. Our religions are actually designed to help us live in peace, if you read their stories looking for something other than war. For the sake of peace, Islam must be claimed back from Muslims and non-Muslims alike who seek conflict. The Canadian Council of Imams Declaration of religious freedom, gender equity, life's sanctity and individual freedom of choice, declared by the elite of Canada's scholarly and respected religious leadership on behalf of all of Canada's mainstream Muslim communities, denies the rights of radicals to define our religion. It empowers the voices of Muslims who love Islam and repudiates anyone who seeks to use Islam for any purpose but peace. Yes, it's a big thing, and it's happening today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Liepert.","Dr. David Liepert: Al Qaeda has come to dominate U.S., Canadian view of Islam .

"(Wired) -- Apple has announced that CEO Steve Jobs will be emceeing the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on June 7 in San Francisco. Continuing his trend of doing one-to-one e-mail marketing for his $43 billion (revenue) company, Jobs himself helped tout the conference with a personal e-mail to a customer over the weekend. The developer's conference attracts greater than usual attention because, for the past two years, Apple has used the venue to announce the latest version of its iPhone. Gizmodo may have spoiled the surprise this year by leaking what has been confirmed by Apple legal as a prototype of the fourth-generation iPhone. However, in an e-mail exchange with a customer over the weekend, Jobs said the event would still pack a punch. ""I hope you have some good WWDC announcements to blow [Google] out of the water,"" a customer wrote to Jobs on Saturday. ""You won't be disappointed,"" the CEO responded, according to a report published on MacRumors.com. As usual, the keynote address will be held in the Moscone West conference center to kick off the five-day WWDC conference, which includes hands-on sessions for software developers to become familiar with iPhone OS 4 and Mac OS X. In addition to new iPhone hardware, Apple is expected to give further details on its next-generation mobile operating system, iPhone OS 4. The company in March previewed iPhone OS 4, which introduces support for multitasking and the ability to group apps in folders, among other features. Apple's 5,000-seat WWDC 2010 event sold out in eight days. The conference is designed to recruit and educate developers supporting Apple's iPhone OS and Mac OS platforms. The importance of WWDC continues to increase as Apple's rivalry with Google becomes more fierce in the mobile space. Google last week held its sold-out Android developer conference, Google I/O, where executives spent a generous amount of time delivering potshots on Apple's iPhone platform. ""If Google didn't act, we face a draconian future. One man, one company, one device would control our future,"" Vic Gundotra, vice president of engineering of Google, told attendees at the conference.

"(CNN) -- BP officials have turned to a new source for help with their oil cleanup efforts: actor Kevin Costner. The oil giant announced Monday that it had ordered 32 machines from Costner's company, the actor told CNN in an exclusive interview on ""AC360."" The machines use a centrifuge mechanism to separate oil from water and recycle the crude at the same time, Costner said. ""This is the key, it's the linchpin to people going back to work. It's certainly a way to fight oil spills in the 21st century,"" he said. ""It creates an efficiency where there are no efficiencies out there, and it's been a long time coming."" Costner said he had been working on developing the machine since 1992 or 1993 with the help of his brother, a scientist. Each machine weighs about 4,000 pounds, he said, and will allow crews to collect more oil. ""Skimmers are picking up 90 percent water, 10 percent oil, and they throw it into a barge ... What this machine simply does, in that particular case, will give a pure payload. Suddenly a barge will be coming back to shore with 99 percent oil as opposed to the other way around,"" he said. Got an idea to fix the oil disaster? Share solutions and views . Costner described the machine to a congressional committee last week. ""It may seem an unlikely scenario that I'm the one delivering this technology at this moment in time, but from where I'm sitting, it is equally inconceivable that these machines are not already in place,"" he said.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A group of experts from around the world will Thursday hold a first of its kind conference on global catastrophic risks. Some experts say humans will merge with machines before the end of this century. They will discuss what should be done to prevent these risks from becoming realities that could lead to the end of human life on earth as we know it. Speakers at the four-day event at Oxford University in Britain will talk about topics including nuclear terrorism and what to do if a large asteroid were to be on a collision course with our planet. On the final day of the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference experts will focus on what could be the unintended consequences of new technologies, such as superintelligent machines that, if ill-conceived, might cause the demise of Homo sapiens. ""Any entity which is radically smarter than human beings would also be very powerful,"" said Dr. Nick Bostrom, director of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, host of the symposium. ""If we get something wrong, you could imagine the consequences would involve the extinction of the human species."" Bostrom is a philosopher and a leading thinker of transhumanism -- a movement that advocates not only the study of the potential threats and promises that future technologies could pose to human life but also the ways in which emergent technologies could be used to make the very act of living better. ""We want to preserve the best of what it is to be human and maybe even amplify that,"" Bostrom told CNN. Transhumanists, according to Bostrom, anticipate a coming era where biotechnology, molecular nanotechnologies, artificial intelligence and other new types of cognitive tools will be used to amplify our intellectual capacity, improve our physical capabilities and even enhance our emotional well-being. The end result would be a new form of ""posthuman"" life with beings that possess qualities and skills so exceedingly advanced they no longer can be classified simply as humans. ""We will begin to use science and technology not just to manage the world around us but to manage our own human biology as well,"" Bostrom told CNN. ""The changes will be faster and more profound than the very, very slow changes that would occur over tens of thousands of years as a result of natural selection and biological evolution."" Bostrom declined to try to predict an exact time frame when this revolutionary biotechnological metamorphosis might occur. ""Maybe it will take eight years or 200 years,"" he said. ""It is very hard to predict."" Other experts are already getting ready for what they say could be a radical transformation of the human race in as little as two decades. ""This will happen faster than people realize,"" said Dr. Ray Kurzweil, an inventor and futurist who calculates technology trends using what he calls the law of accelerating returns, a mathematical concept that measures the exponential growth of technological evolution. In the 1980s Kurzweil predicted that a tiny handheld device would be invented sometime early in the 21st century allowing blind people to read documents from anywhere at anytime -- earlier this year such a device was publicly unveiled. He also anticipated the explosive growth of the Internet in the 1990s. Now Kurzweil is predicting the impending arrival of something called the Singularity, which he defines in his book on the subject as ""the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots."" ""There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality,"" he writes. Singularity will approach at an accelerating rate as human-created technologies become exponentially smaller and increasingly powerful and as fields such as biology and medicine are understood more and more in terms of information processes that can be simulated with computers. By the 2030s, Kurzweil tells CNN, humans will become more non-biological than biological, capable of uploading our minds onto the Internet, living in various virtual worlds and even avoiding aging and evading death. In the 2040s, Kurzweil predicts non-biological intelligence will be billions of times better than the biological intelligence humans have today, possibly rendering our present brains as obsolete. ""Our brains are a million times slower than electronics,"" said Kurzweil. ""We will increasingly become software entities if you go out enough decades."" This movement towards the merger of man and machine, according to Kurzweil, is already starting to happen and is most visible in the field of biotechnology. As scientists gain deeper insights into the genetic processes that underlie life, they are able to effectively reprogram human biology through the development of new forms of gene therapies and medications capable of turning on or off enzymes and RNA interference, or gene silencing. ""Biology and health and medicine used to be hit or miss,"" said Kurzweil. ""It wasn't based on any coherent theory about how it works."" The emerging biotechnology revolution will lead to at least a thousand new drugs that could do anything from slow down the process of aging to reverse the onset of diseases, like heart disease and cancer, Kurzweil said. By 2020, Kurzweil predicts a second revolution in the area of nanotechnology. According to his calculations, it is already showing signs of exponential growth as scientists begin test first generation nanobots that can cure Type 1 diabetes in rats or heal spinal cord injuries in mice. One scientist is developing something called a respirocyte -- a robotic red blood cell that, if injected into the bloodstream, would allow humans to do an Olympic sprint for 15 minutes without taking a breath or sit at the bottom of a swimming pool for hours at a time. Other researchers are developing nanoparticles that can locate tumors and one day possibly even eradicate them. And some Parkinson's patients now have pea-sized computers implanted in their brains that replace neurons destroyed by the disease -- new software can be downloaded to the mini computers from outside the human body. ""Nanotechnology will not just be used to reprogram but to transcend biology and go beyond its limitations by merging with non-biological systems,"" Kurzweil told CNN. ""If we rebuild biological systems with nanotechnology, we can go beyond its limits."" The final revolution leading to the advent of Singularity will be the creation of artificial intelligence, or superintelligence, which, according to Kurzweil, could be capable of solving many of our biggest threats, like environmental destruction, poverty and disease. ""A more intelligent process will inherently outcompete one that is less intelligent, making intelligence the most powerful force in the universe,"" writes Kurzweil. Yet the invention of so many high-powered technologies and the possibility of merging these new technologies with humans may pose both peril and promise for the future of mankind. ""I think there are grave dangers,"" said Kurzweil. ""Technology has always been a double-edged sword."" ....................................................................................

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It is a familiar refrain to hear the earth and its resources being described as precious and that climate change is, and will, prove extremely costly. The Iwokrama Reserve covers 370,000 hectares of the Guiana Shield. It is one of the four remaining rainforest regions of the world. But historically, no one has attempted to put a market value on nature's eco-systems and the services they provide. Until now. Last month, a deal was struck between London-based venture capital company, Canopy Capital and the Iwokrama International Center for Rainforest Conservation and Development (IIC) in Guyana, South America. According to Canopy Capital this isn't a deal about buying up land. Neither has it anything to do with carbon trading. Andrew Mitchell, Director of the Global Canopy Program (GCP) and a partner in Canopy Capital, says the deal is about; ""creating a whole new paradigm for the way in which the world economy values the environment."" What Canopy Capital is saying is that the rainforests provide us with a service that benefits us all. Not only do rainforests naturally store carbon, they also provide the means for economic stability for the indigenous population, the surrounding regions and further afield. Like everything else, these natural services should and will, they hope, have a value. HRH The Prince of Wales, who is a patron of the IIC, has described the rainforests as: ""Giant global utilities providing an essential service to humanity on a vast scale."" He thinks that the value of the world's forests is not properly understood and therefore not paid for. Seen from this perspective, Canopy Capital's new investors might be on to a good thing. Founded in 1996, the IIC has historically been devoted to scientific research, pioneering the sustainable use of rainforests, as well as encouraging eco-tourism. The intention now is to create a new commercial business model marketing its assets which will preserve its long term future. The prize asset is the 370,000 hectares of the Iwokrama Reserve, which lies in the heart of the Guiana Shield -- a vast area of tropical forest which stretches over 2.5 million square kilometers across the north-east of South America, crossing six state borders. It was gifted to the Commonwealth for the purposes of research in 1989. Canopy Capital, who announced the deal at the world's first 'Biodiversity and Ecosystem Finance Conference' in New York, currently has a dozen investors who collectively hold an 80 percent stake in the company. The remaining 20 percent is held by the GCP. An alliance of 29 scientific institutions conducting research into forest canopy, the GCP has been evolving the concept of canopy eco-system services for the past eight years. Discussion started within the scientific community, then moved on to involve environmental economists. The final step was to approach the financial community to see if there was a market for eco-services. It was here that the idea took off. GCP Director Andrew Mitchell met up with Hylton Philipson -- a former investment banker. Philipson shared Mitchell's passion for rainforest conservation and set about trying to work out whether such a project would be economically viable. Before setting up Canopy Capital together, they worked on the Amazonas Initiative -- a project in Brazil's largest state to preserve the rainforests and their inhabitants. Mitchell, who combines his work at Canopy Capital and the GCP with research at Oxford University's Zoology Department, has been studying tropical forests -- in particular their canopy -- for 35 years. He believes that the new concept can capitalize on the growing fear in the financial markets that climate change is going to be far more costly in the future if we don't act now. ""Markets are driven by fear and greed,"" he told CNN, ""and the fear factor has become greater and greater as the science gets better and better."" He says that the rainforests are a global utility and should be treated as such. ""It's like a local power station. We don't really know how it works, but we all enjoy the electricity when we turn the lights on. But if you don't pay the bill you get cut off,"" he said. It might be easy to measure the output from a power station, but how do you define and measure the benefits of a rainforest? One way, Mitchell says, is to model what would happen if the remaining big rainforests utilities -- Guiana Shield, Amazonia, the Congo Basin and Indonesia -- weren't there. ""One of the scenarios produced by Ron Avissar of Duke University shows that if you remove the Amazonia, you see rainfall reductions in Mid-West America at different times of the year. If you remove them from the Congo Basin you see changes in rainfall reductions in Uzbekistan and parts of Russia. This would affect our ability to provide food."" Mitchell said. Reduced Amazon rainfall could also have devastating effects closer to home. Brazil is a nation highly dependent on hydro-power for electricity generation. In 2004, over 83 percent came from hydro-power. For them, less rain would literally mean less power. The destruction of rainforests pose a threat to energy and food security over a vast area, affecting millions of lives. ""Governments have a role to play,"" said Mitchell, ""but so do markets."" Canopy Capital is currently producing an audit of the Iwokrama rainforest. Mitchell estimates that the Reserve could be storing up to around 80 million tons of CO2, but he says it's difficult to work out exact values for rainforests right now. There are threats to the Iwokrama Reserve -- a road running through the Reserve is due to be widened -- but Mitchell thinks that overall, the dangers are relatively low. And with the President of Guyana, Bharrat Jagdeo, committed to the idea of the international community intervening in forest life, in return for environmental protection and aid, the prospects for Canopy Capital so far look good. ""We're going to have to invest in the earth's life support systems,"" Mitchell said. ""What's the point of making a machine to capture carbon out of the atmosphere when rainforests do it for free? It's cheaper to maintain that than to build a new one."" But Simon Counsell, Director of the UK charity The Rainforest Foundation sounded a note of caution about the proposal. ""We're fairly skeptical about these ideas of trading in eco-system services or in the carbon that is stored in rainforests as an effective way of protecting them,"" he told CNN. ""What we have found over the years is that the only effective way to protect the long term future of rainforests is to ensure that the people who live in and around the forest get some benefit in it staying. And it's not clear how the local people are going to benefit,"" Counsell said. Counsell pointed out that traditional carbon trading benefits tend to accrue to the traders, the middle-men, the investors and speculators. ""The hope is that there will be markets for these vaguely defined eco-services. Whether this is going to be the case with the Iwokrama project we just don't know yet, because there are no details of who is going to get what from it.""","New deal attempts to put a market value on nature's eco-systems and its services .

Lebanon's southern border with Israel (VBS.TV) -- Deposited along Lebanon's southern border with Israel are vast numbers of American-made cluster bombs buried beneath the grasses of the region's valleys. Originally used by the Israeli military to combat Hezbollah forces firing rockets across the border, the bombs impacted in the soil were being ferreted out by a small U.N. team from the French battalion. Eddy Moretti, VBS's creative director, and a small film crew donned camouflaged PPO -- protective personal equipment -- and tagged along on one of their minesweeping missions in October 2007. We were brought first to an abandoned soccer field. Yellow rope was strung around the field and the surrounding forest, indicating areas that had already been cleared. One soldier stood over a patch of grass and a small pile of scrap metal. ""This morning, we started here at 6:00. Two hours later,"" he said, pointing to a the yellow rope four feet farther into the forest, ""we are here."" The team estimates that it has scanned about 18 percent of the area that the Israeli army blanketed in cluster bombs during the conflicts with Hezbollah. Every time a single bomb is launched, it releases dozens of submunitions that fall across the landscape, many of which fail to detonate and now cover about 12,500 square meters of the region. By the time we met up with the team, it had retrieved 53 submunitions. They believe that approximately 1 million of the parent bombs are hidden in Lebanon's southern valleys alone. Procedurally, the task is daunting: Inch by inch, they push forward, chopping the long grasses with garden shears to increase ground visibility and then running over the area slowly with minesweepers. The minesweepers are handheld devices that look like typical metal detectors, emitting a variety of high-pitched whines that vary depending on the density of the ground. This day, the team pushed on together slowly, sensitive to each of the various frequencies and graciously telling us as soon as they found something. By the end of the afternoon, they had unearthed a single submunition -- not a bad haul by any stretch. It was a 155-millimeter explosive about the size of a fist. This represents just one of 88 submunitions that are held inside each American-made cluster bomb. The team detonated the explosive, surrounding it with sandbags and standing a safe distance away. After the explosion, Eddy surveyed a large hunk of detonated submunition: ""Two lives saved?"" The French U.N. team leader nodded. ""Yes, two lives. Or two legs.""

"""Pikachu, I choose you!"" With those words, 400 Pokémon players from 26 countries around the world will vie Saturday and Sunday for the title of World Champion in the 2010 Pokémon Video Game Championships in Kona, Hawaii. Kids and teens compete in two age groups by playing the ""Pokémon HeartGold"" and ""SoulSilver"" versions of the titles available on the Nintendo DS console. U.S. champions and qualifiers will do battle against winners from competitions in Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Spain. The U.S. competition started in May and lasted two months before crowning 11-year-old Wade Stanley of San Diego, California, and 16-year-old Wesley Morioka, of Chicago, Illinois, as champions in the Juniors and Seniors age groups. The Pokémon universe is made up of more than 490 creatures that players can find, capture, train, trade, collect and use in battle against their rivals in the quest to become Pokémon Trainers. Each Pokémon is classified by a specific type -- such as Fire, Water, Grass, Psychic, and Fighting -- and each has its own set of strengths and weaknesses to create a rock-paper-scissors-style balance. In the video games, players collect and befriend Pokémon from the wild and train them to battle each other. Pokémon are never seriously harmed in these battles; they merely faint, returning to their Poké Balls to rest and be fully healed at a later time. The Pokémon video game franchise has continued to enjoy great success since its inception in Japan in 1996 for the GameBoy handheld console. It arrived on the shores of the United States two years later and spawned a craze that created cartoons, card games, movies and more than 20 more video game titles. It is the second most successfulvideo game franchise of all time (Mario is first) with more than 207 million games sold worldwide. Their recent titles, ""HeartGold"" and ""SoulSilver,"" have sold 8.4 million copies worldwide, including 2.2 million in the U.S., since their release in March 2010. JC Smith, director of marketing for Pokémon, says the lasting draw of the game is its characters and storyline. ""The games provide a type of way to experience the world -- the story of adventure, training, being the best,"" Smith said. ""It is a compelling world that draws players in."" Smith said the franchise allows players to play seriously but still have fun. He said there are players who like the strategy and the competition of the battle as well as collectors who enjoy exploring the vast Pokémon world in an attempt to ""catch them all."" Junior Champ Wade Stanley said he just thought it was fun. ""I've been playing for about three years and I'm 11 years old now,"" Stanley said. ""It just looked good for my age at the time and I was just having fun."" Senior Champ Wesley Morioka ""blames"" his uncle and aunt for getting him hooked on Pokémon 11 years ago. ""I received my first GameBoy as a present from my uncle and aunt from Texas when we went down to visit them,"" Morioka said. ""As we started to play the games we got with it, we decided to stop at a store to buy other games and we saw Pokémon and decided to buy it."" Both Stanley and Morioka said they put a lot of thought into their Pokémon teams for the competitions and practice against older siblings because no one their own ages will play them. ""The only person who will battle is my sister, Tiffany,"" who is 17, Stanley said. ""Because everyone else is going to lose."" Morioka thinks he's put in about 2,000 to 3,000 hours of actual game play over the past 11 years, not counting time spent researching, planning and practicing. He said battling against unknown people makes the game fun for him. ""I love the whole anticipation for upcoming tournaments and to see how the training, time, and effort finish at the end of the day,"" he said. Smith said the competitions give the kids a sense of purpose for all the hours of play they put into Pokémon. At the events, the kids enjoy being around people who love the same thing they do. ""The depth of the game is unbelievable,"" Smith said. ""Side quests, collecting, there is just so much to keep you entertained and [make you] fall in love with the characters."" Last year, Jeremiah Fan of San Jose, California, defeated Japan's Santa Ito for first place in the Junior Division. In Senior Division, Japanese champion Kazuyuki Tsuji beat teammate Tasuku Mano for first place. Morioka was confident about bringing home the Senior Division trophy, but Stanley was a little less confident about his chances for the Juniors title. ""I feel like I'm going to get matched up against the Japanese who always do well,"" he said. ""But I'm going to prepare and I'm going to be ready.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Amid ominous economic forecasts and repeated bleak reports about America's financial future, messages of hope can be hard to come by. New billboards offer upbeat messages to get people to stay positive during the recession. One advertising campaign, dubbed ""Recession 101,"" has hit the nation's roadsides with an array of slogans aimed at getting people to think optimistically during the recession. The economic ""lessons,"" which include such catchphrases such as ""self worth beats net worth,"" and ""stop obsessing about the economy, you're scaring the children,"" started going up in May and now number around 2,000 postings across the country, according to Jeff Golimowski of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. Members of the OAAA donated printing, materials and billboard space, while a private anonymous donor paid for the campaign's design, Golimowski said. Recession 101 currently exists in more than 30 states, among them Michigan and Rhode Island, which have been hit particularly hard by the current economic downturn. The clever expressions, presented on backdrops meant to look like lined notepad paper, can be found on digital billboards, traditional billboards and posters. ""This will end long before those who started it are paroled,"" one billboard reads. Most of the mottos do not take a cynical view, though. ""Recession 101 isn't selling anything other than the American spirit,"" the campaign's Web site reads.","Recession billboards offer upbeat messages during rough economic times .

"(CNN) -- New Orleans architect Mark Ripple only plays the occasional game of poker, but he's willing to put all his chips on the table and risk at least $150,000 on somebody else's dream. That's the estimated value of in kind contributions that Ripple, his partners and consultants are donating to build what's been dubbed the 9th Ward Field of Dreams -- a community track and athletic field in part of the city hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina more than four years ago. When it's all said and done next summer, his firm Eskew+Dumez+Ripple will have given an estimated 500 man-hours toward a $2-million project that's become a symbol of community recovery. ""The hurricane was such a transformational experience,"" said Ripple, an architect for 30 years and a lifelong New Orleans resident. When Katrina flooded Ripple's family home under 8 feet of water, it changed him. When he found himself accepting help from friends who ripped out useless drywall, swept out mud and tossed ruined beds through the windows, it changed him. ""I went through this with my wife and kids in a house that I built and renovated with my own two hands,"" he said. Storm damage forced his firm to take up temporary offices in another city an hour away. ""When that routine is ripped away from you, you get a different appreciation for what it means in your life. You get a better understanding of how important that is to who you are and what you do. You can't really appreciate that until it's been taken from you."" Like many other residents, the pain gave way to a mission. Brian Bordainick, a 24-year-old athletic director at Carver High School in the 9th Ward, made his pitch to Ripple and his partners: Help build a new stadium for the neighborhood, and make a powerful statement about New Orleans' ability to overcome Katrina by working together as a community. ""The rebuilding of this broken city is a very emotional thing for me and I'm very passionate about it,"" said Ripple. ""So it was another way to recover our life and regain what we had prior to the storm."" The sports facilities at Carver -- once a perennial football powerhouse -- were devastated by Katrina. Like many of the city's schools, enrollment plummeted after the storm as residents fled and never returned. Students now attend classes in eight portable trailers. The football team practices in an abandoned lot. In late 2008, Bordainick went to work -- online and in New Orleans executive offices -- rallying support for a new neighborhood track and field facility paid for with thousands of individual and corporate donations of time, services, materials and cash. ""Those of us over 50 often become jaded,"" said Ripple. ""People say you can't do this and you can't do that -- it's just so refreshing to have somebody Brian's age step up and ask the basic question, 'Why the hell not?'"" ""It's really interesting to see why certain people come to the table,"" said Bordainick. ""Mark was one of those guys from the get-go who wanted to help out, and he just happened to be an architect. He was a guy first and foremost who believed what this could do for the city and he was like, 'Oh yeah, and I happen to have an architectural company that we can use to help further this goal.'"" By the time Ripple -- a former wrestler at Jesuit High School -- heard Bordainick's pitch, he was committed. Both of Ripple's older brothers were multisport athletes who played football in high school and college. ""Athletics can teach kids discipline, commitment, perseverance, goal-setting, and give kids a social outlet, a sense of belonging and improved self- esteem,"" Ripple said. A neighborhood sports facility would only do more to foster these values among 9th Ward kids, he said. According to Bordainick, Ripple's community status brought credibility to the project early on. At the same time, Bordainick said, Ripple has completely given himself over to the cause. ""If you talk to him about the project for 20 or 30 minutes, he's going to start to cry,"" said Bordainick, who came to New Orleans after Katrina as part of the nonprofit Teach for America program. ""He's that type of guy."" Big gamble . But as the clock ticks toward the disaster's fifth anniversary, it's apparent Ripple and his partners have invested in a big gamble. Although the school expects to kick off its opening football game at the new field on Katrina's August anniversary, the project remains about $700,000 short of its goal. And Bordainick insists construction will not begin as planned in March until 100 percent of the funds are raised. ""We don't want the project to stall after we break ground,"" said Bordainick. ""If we stall, we may lose momentum and the project never finishes."" Under a worst-case scenario, the hundreds of work hours, countless resources and materials donated by Ripple's firm could yield zero results unless all $2 million of the project's estimated price tag is raised by Valentine's Day. ""As far as I'm concerned, to use a poker analogy, we're all in,"" laughs Ripple. ""Sometimes what it takes is just perseverance and pushing and pushing, even when it gets fatiguing. It's worth the risk. We're gonna make it happen."" Long before the storm, Ripple and his partners had established their firm as a highly respected regional player in architecture and design -- jointly renovating and expanding the New Orleans Museum of Art, the Fair Grounds Race Course and the Aquarium of the Americas. Four years after Katrina , the business of architecture in New Orleans has taken on a different tone, said Ripple. ""Architects can be a catalyst for change in the community and they can make a difference. And I had never thought of architecture in those terms until after the storm."" In addition to the Field of Dreams, other Eskew+Dumez+Ripple projects are directly connected to erasing the results of Katrina's wrath. The firm is part of a joint venture to build a new federal Veterans Affairs hospital to replace one severely damaged in the storm. In another high-profile project, partner Allen Eskew plays a key role in the city's post-Katrina reconstruction planning. The storm has been a boon to the local construction and renovation industry, a sharp contrast to the national construction business as a whole, which has been slowed by economic recession. Ripple's grateful for the boom -- in part because it helps the firm offset pro-bono work. ""In that regard, the Field of Dreams project hasn't hurt us tremendously financially because we do have enough work volume to absorb that cost,"" Ripple said. Green designs . Over the summer, plans for the field have solidified, including design components that are environmentally friendly. If completed, the Field of Dreams would be among the greenest facilities of its kind in the nation, said Bordainick. Special drainage will help protect the area around the stadium from storm water runoff, said Ripple. Katrina illustrated all too well that New Orleans is susceptible to flooding. Actor Brad Pitt's New Orleans recovery group, Make It Right, has some experience with drainage issues, Ripple said, and Pitt's organization is consulting on the project with partner Steve Dumez. Stadium plans call for field lights which will be carbon-neutral and operate at half the cost of traditional lights. Outbuildings on the property will have vegetation on the roofs, helping keep the buildings cooler and reducing energy consumption. One especially innovative feature under consideration is a running track surface made from recycled athletic shoes. Nike, which has donated $100,000 toward construction of the field, has developed a synthetic material called Nike Grind consisting of ground-up rubber and polyurethane from discarded shoes. ""It's a very scary time for our project right now,"" said Bordainick. ""We have a lot of money left to raise and our timelines are real."" Describing the emotional pull that drew Ripple to make such a total commitment to Bordainick's dream, the architect said, ""There's a deeper meaning that projects take on when you feel like you're serving a larger purpose.""","Architect whose home was flooded by Katrina works pro-bono to build $2-million high school stadium .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Serial killing suspect Elias Abuelazam agreed in an Atlanta courtroom Friday to be sent back to Michigan to face charges. Abuelazam did not appear in court for a second hearing, which had been scheduled because his lawyer had not arrived in time to attend the first. His attorney, Edwar Zeineh, agreed to allow his client to return to Michigan, where the lawyer is based. ""We look forward at this point for the criminal justice process to commence ... and in the end provide a result,"" Zeineh told reporters outside the courthouse. Abuelazam is suspected of slashing 18 victims in three states, killing five. He is charged in Michigan with one count of assault with intent to commit murder, Zeineh said. Abuelazam agreed in Friday's first hearing to waive an extradition hearing, a court proceeding in which Michigan would have made its case on why he should be returned and Abuelazam could have argued why he should not. The towering suspect, dressed in a black jail jumpsuit, seemed confused in the morning session as to what the hearing was about and what his options were. At one point he asked Fulton County Superior Court Magistrate Judge Richard Hicks what extradition means. Michigan authorities will have 15 working days to pick him up and deliver him to the state. Tracy Flanagan, an official with the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, said the extradition paperwork on Abuelazam is complete. ""The suspect is ready for pickup by Michigan authorities and they have been notified. No word on when they're coming. This all depends on how quickly they can coordinate transport,"" Flanagan said. Abuelazam, an Israeli citizen living legally in the United States, was arrested Wednesday night at Hartsfield Jackson International Airport in Atlanta. He was trying to board a flight to Israel when he was taken into custody, police said. Police had Abuelazam in custody twice in the past month, both within hours of when stabbings were reported, but he was released. Police say he hadn't been linked to the bloody attacks at the time. He was arrested on August 5 after a traffic stop and on July 29 for giving alcohol to a minor, according to authorities and court documents. During the traffic stop in Arlington, Virginia, police arrested him after learning that he had an outstanding warrant for assault. They found a knife and hammer in his car -- both weapons authorities now think were used during a string of stabbings in Michigan, Virginia and Ohio. One of those attacks happened in Virginia just hours after Abuelazam was released. Police say he had not been linked at that time to the stabbings, which began in May and continued until last weekend. Family members of the victims told CNN they do not blame officials for not holding Abuelazam initially. Stephanie Ward, a sister of one of the victims in Flint, said she couldn't understand why someone would kill her brother, Arnold Minor. ""Why? That's what we all want to know. How could you do that?"" she asked. Most of the stabbing victims were black. Although federal officials said late on Thursday it was too soon to give a motive, Leesburg, Virginia, Police Chief Joseph Price said he believed the attacker was targeting African-Americans. ""For our community ... when you look at our demographics and you look at the victims here, my belief is he selected the victims in Leesburg based on the color of their skin,"" Price said. Abuelazam also was cited by police in Michigan. He was fined $125 for providing alcohol to a minor on July 29, the same day an early morning stabbing was reported in the area. A tip eventually led Michigan police this week to a market where the suspect worked, said prosecutor David S. Leyton of Genesee County, Michigan. After talking with employees, police watched surveillance video to determine whether he matched the physical description of the attacker. In Louisville, Kentucky, authorities learned Abuelazam had bought a $3,000 ticket from Atlanta to Tel Aviv, Israel, paid for by his uncle. The man was traveling on an expired Israeli passport but was in the United States legally, said a federal law enforcement official involved in the investigation. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials said they arrested Abuelazam at 10 p.m. as he attempted to board the Delta flight bound for Tel Aviv.  A homeland security official told CNN the National Targeting Center had found his name on the passenger list. Authorities have said the same person is responsible for three recent attacks in Leesburg, the stabbing deaths of five people and woundings of nine others in the Flint, Michigan, area, and a stabbing on Saturday that wounded a man in Toledo, Ohio. Most of the 14 victims in Michigan were African-American, police said. Flint is a majority African-American community. In majority-white Leesburg, two victims were black and one was Latino. Several of the victims were also developmentally disabled, police said. Abuelazam once worked at North Spring Behavioral Healthcare in Leesburg, the center said Friday. ""His employment at North Spring ended in 2008,"" Scott Zeiter, the center's chief executive, said in a statement. ""We understand that he may be a suspect in certain crimes committed in 2010. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their families."" The Michigan attacks took place from May 24 through August 2. The three attacks in Virginia occurred Tuesday, Thursday and Friday of last week. The Michigan victims ranged in age from 17 to 60, authorities said. All were men, and in two cases they were people with special needs. The suspect is said to have approached victims who were walking during the early morning hours, asking for directions or other assistance to lure them close to his car, police said. Sgt. Bill Wauford of the Toledo Police Department said the method of attack in the Ohio case matched that described in the Michigan incidents. The five Michigan fatalities have been identified as David Motley, Emmanuel Dent, Darwin Marshall, Frank Kellybrew and Arnold Minor. ""We ought to remember the victims in all of this,"" prosecutor Leyton said. ""You have real people who have died and real families who have been torn apart. Our heart goes out to them."" Investigators said more charges are expected. CNN's Susan Candiotti and Jeanne Meserve contributed to this report.","Elias Abuelazam declined to change his plea at a second hearing .

"(Mental Floss) -- There was a time when movie props were worthless. When a film wrapped, the studio would often recycle props and costumes for use in other films, or sometimes simply throw them away. But that's changed over the years, and now movie collectibles are a big business, with high-profile props going for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Unfortunately, when you start talking that kind of money, there are bound to be a few crooked characters who will do whatever it takes to get their hands on a piece of Hollywood history. 1. Has anyone questioned the flying monkeys? It's believed there were six or seven pairs of Dorothy's famous ruby red slippers made for the production of the 1939 film ""The Wizard of Oz"". Of those, the location of four pairs is currently known, including one that resides in the Smithsonian. The Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, had their own pair, until the shoes were stolen one night in August 2005. The case went cold until this past April, when police received a tip that a resident in Homer Glen, Illinois, had not only bragged about paying someone to steal the slippers, but openly displayed the shoes in a glass box. Police raided the alleged thief's house, but didn't find the ruby red shoes. For now, the case remains open, and the shoes are still at-large. 2. ""Easy Rider"" choppers chopped . There are few motorcycles more iconic than the ones ridden by Peter Fonda and the late, great Dennis Hopper in their counterculture classic, ""Easy Rider."" There were four custom motorcycles built for the film -- two copies of each bike, including the ""Captain America"" chopper ridden by Fonda, featuring a star-spangled fuel tank and an extra long fork for the front wheels. One of the Captain America bikes was destroyed during filming, while the other three motorcycles were stolen from a storage garage before the film was even in the can. Obviously the bikes weren't famous yet, so they were presumably stripped and sold for parts. The thieves left the damaged Captain America bike, which was later restored, and now resides at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa. Mental Floss: What 10 Movie Props Later Sold For . 3. The man without the golden gun . In the 1974 movie ""The Man with the Golden Gun,"" James Bond takes on Scaramanga, an expert assassin who charges $1 million per kill. The hitman's signature is a custom-made, solid gold gun that can be cleverly disassembled and disguised as everyday items like a cigarette case, a lighter, a pen, and a cuff link. There were three prop guns made for the film -- one that came apart, another that didn't come apart, and one that could fire a blank round. In October 2008, one of these props (it's unclear which one it was) was discovered missing from its display case at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England. Police still have no leads on the disappearance of the prop, worth an estimated £80,000 ($117,000) on the collector's black market. 4. The case of the missing ""Maltese Falcon"" There were a handful of falcon statues made for the 1941 noir classic, ""The Maltese Falcon"", starring Humphrey Bogart as Dashiell Hammett's famous private eye, Sam Spade. Over the years, nearly all original models of the bird have been lost, making the few remaining copies very valuable -- including one that sold for nearly $400,000 in 1994. For promotional purposes, plaster casts of the bird were made upon the film's release, and Elisha Cook, Jr., a character actor who played a henchman in the film, got his hands on one. His copy of the bird was later acquired by John's Grill in San Francisco, a restaurant dedicated to Hammett, who often wrote and ate there in the 1930s. The replica bird was on display for years, sitting on the second floor in a display case for all to see. That is, of course, until the day it disappeared in 2007. Mental Floss: Who Invented the Gatorade shower? After the falcon went missing, John's Grill offered a no-questions-asked reward of $25,000 to the person who brought it back, but no one came forward. The owner could have easily gotten a good replacement replica off eBay for a few hundred bucks, but he took a different approach instead. He put the $25,000 towards the creation of a new, original design of the Maltese Falcon that is a more stylized interpretation than the one used in the 1941 film. The new statue is five inches taller than the original and weighs around 150 pounds, three times heavier than the plaster replica that was stolen. To ensure this bird doesn't go missing, it's been bolted down and is monitored 24/7 by closed-circuit cameras. With that much security, the next time someone messes with this Maltese Falcon, it won't take Sam Spade to crack the case. 5. Well, that's one way to get an Oscar . In March 2000, a few guys got their hands on the ultimate movie collector's item when they stole 55 Oscars just days before the Academy Awards ceremony. Anthony Hart, a dock worker at delivery company Roadway Express, conspired with a fellow employee, truck driver Lawrence Ladent, to load 10 boxes of Oscars onto Ladent's truck. Ladent then took the statues to the home of accomplice John Harris for safekeeping until they could line up black market buyers. However, the men got spooked by the publicity surrounding the missing statues and dumped the boxes in an alleyway instead. Shortly after, Harris' half-brother, Willie Fulgear, found 52 of the Oscars while rummaging through the trash, looking for packing boxes to use during a move. After reporting his find to police, Fulgear collected a $50,000 reward from Roadway Express, but the other men didn't make out quite so well. Anthony Hart received the lightest sentence with three years probation. John Harris was sentenced to six months in jail, three years probation, and had to pay $921 to the Academy in restitution for the three missing statues. Lawrence Ledent was given six months in prison, five years probation, had to pay the Academy $1,050, and pay Roadway Express the full amount of the reward they offered to Fulgear. As for the three missing Oscars, one was found in 2003 during a Miami drug raid, but the other two are still out there somewhere. Mental Floss: Where 10 Oscar winners keep their statues . 6. Big bucks in spandex . Apparently no one's spider-sense was tingling when crooks made off with four hand-made superhero suits from the set of the first Spider-Man film. Each Spider-Man costume, valued at around $50,000 a piece, disappeared from a locked building on the Sony Pictures lot, leading authorities to believe it was an inside job. Police received a tip from the ex-wife of a former security guard at Sony, Jeffrey Gustafson, who said he might be involved in the theft. Police searched Gustafson's home and found records indicating that one costume was at a friend's house, two were traced to a collector in New York, and the last one was in the collection of a man in Japan. Adding to Gustafson's woes, police also found in his home a mannequin dressed in a $150,000 Batman costume that went missing from the Warner Bros. lot in 1996. Not coincidentally, Gustafson worked as a security guard at Warner Bros. at the time. For stealing the Spidey suits, Gustafson got 9 months in jail, 5 years probation, and had to pay $93,000 in restitution. Mental Floss: Strange robberies: Madonna's bustier . 7. Do collectors dream of rubber handguns? As he's hunting android replicants in a dystopian future, ""Blade Runner's"" Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, carries a strange-looking handgun that has captivated sci-fi fans for decades. The prop was custom-made using pieces from real firearms, including a bolt action from a rifle, two triggers, various knobs and dials, and even LED lights. To prevent their very expensive, one-of-a-kind prop from breaking, the producers made two solid rubber copies that were indistinguishable from the original at a distance, and could be knocked around during stunt scenes without getting damaged. But during the shoot, one of the dummy guns went missing and was never seen again. Oddly enough though, about a month after the film was released, highly accurate plastic replicas of Deckard's gun began appearing for sale on the collector's market. These knock-offs were so close to the ones used in the film that they must have been created using molds taken from the missing, now presumed stolen, dummy gun. While it's certain the thief made a pretty penny by selling the dummy gun, he would have surely been better off stealing the custom-made gun instead -- it sold at auction in 2009 for $270,000.

"(CNN) -- Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, who is under investigation by the House ethics committee, said Tuesday she has not been given due process and she ""will not be a sacrificial lamb for anyone."" The 10-term congresswoman is alleged to have helped steer federal bailout money to a bank in which her husband had a financial stake. In a radio interview with CNN contributor Roland S. Martin on the Tom Joyner Morning Show, Waters said she is ""not guilty of any violations"" and she ""want[s] to go to trial."" The House ethics committee released a report Monday detailing three counts against Waters and rejected her request for the charges to be dismissed. The 71-year-old Waters has been pushing the ethics panel to set a trial date before the midterm elections in November. But she told Martin Tuesday she doesn't expect that request to be granted. ""That's one of the issues of not having due process. When in the heck are you going to set up this hearing? We are on break and we don't think it's going to be before the November election,"" she said. Waters, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, helped arrange a meeting in September, 2008, between Massachusetts-based OneUnited Bank and Treasury Department officials, according to ethics investigators. OneUnited Bank ultimately received $12 million in bailout funds. According to the report, Waters' husband owned almost 4,000 shares of OneUnited stock at the time of the meeting. The shares had declined in value from more than $350,000 in June to $175,000 at the end of September -- the height of the Wall Street financial crisis. Waters, according to a separate preliminary report, called then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ""and requested that Treasury Department officials meet with representatives from the National Bankers Association,"" an organization representing more than 100 minority-owned banks. ""A meeting was in fact granted, however, the discussion at the meeting focused on a single bank -- OneUnited. Rep. Waters' husband had been a board member of the bank from 2004 to 2008 and, at the time of the meeting, was a stock holder of the bank,"" the report said. But Waters reiterated Tuesday that ""the meeting was set up for NBA -- for all the minority bankers. Just like you have a representative for the chamber of commerce or for the Realtors, etc., that's what the meeting was for."" She said Kevin Cohee, OneUnited's chairman and chief executive officer, spoke up at the meeting, ""and said, 'I'm an example of what's happening with minority banks' and went on to try and make his case for the fact that OneUnited was losing $50 million that they had invested in Fannie Mae."" ""It just so happens that some of the officers -- at least one of the officers of OneUnited Bank -- happens to be the chairman of the NBA (National Bankers Association),"" the congresswoman said. The report also states that Waters approached Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, D-Massachusetts, to say that she was ""in a predicament because her husband had been involved in the bank, but 'OneUnited people' were coming to her for help."" Waters, ""according to (Frank) ... knew she should say no, but it bothered her. It was clear to (Frank) that this was a 'conflict of interest problem.'"" Frank's advice to Waters, the report states, was to 'stay out of it.'"" In the Tom Joyner Show interview Tuesday, Waters admitted she had spoken to Frank, but described the circumstances much differently than the report. ""I didn't go to him for advice. I went to him and told him, 'These are your constituents. They are headquartered in your district and they are now trying to find TARP. We're representing the National Bankers Association,'"" Waters said. ""So then I said, 'Perhaps you need to take a look at this' and he said, 'Fine. Don't worry. You don't have anything to do with this. I will take care of it.' And, as a result of that, he started to work on it."" she said. The report released Monday stated that Waters ""agreed to refrain from advocating on behalf of OneUnited,"" but failed to instruct her chief of staff, Mikael Moore, from doing so. Following the September 9 meeting between Treasury and National Bankers Association officials, Moore ""was actively involved in assisting OneUnited representatives with their request for capital from Treasury and crafting legislation to authorize Treasury to grant the request"" for financial assistance, the report said. ""Reasonable"" people could construe Moore's ""continued involvement in assisting OneUnited as the dispensing of special favors or privileges to OneUnited,"" the report concluded. Waters refuted that allegation as well Tuesday. ""If you're going to wrap this all around creating these violations because I failed to supervise my staff, it doesn't hold water, they don't have any proof of that and I maintain that I want to go to trial or whatever they want to call it -- adjudicatory hearing -- because I think I don't deserve this,"" she said. Waters is the second high-ranking Democrat now facing a public ethics trial this fall. New York Rep. Charlie Rangel, the former chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, has been accused of 13 violations of House rules involving alleged financial wrongdoing and harming the credibility of Congress. The prospect of inquiries into the two high-profile Democrats has compounded the fears of congressional Democrats nervous about their prospects in mid-term elections in November. The growing likelihood of trials for Waters and Rangel also adds the explosive element of race to the political equation. Both representatives are leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus, and OneUnited Bank is one of the largest minority-owned banks in America. Waters alluded to race Tuesday on Joyner's show, which is broadcast over the Internet on BlackAmericaWeb.com. ""The OCE (Office of Congressional Ethics) is poorly constructed. You don't know who is charging you with what or brought a claim against you or who brought the information to the OCE... of all the information claimed or accusations brought to them, they think that African-Americans are the only ones who they move further with investigation on,"" she said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced some far-reaching proposals Monday for restructuring the massive budget at his agency, including getting rid of the U.S. Joint Forces Command. The cuts could mean a loss of thousands of jobs. The current Defense Department budget totals more than $530 billion a year, and defense officials believe they need increases of 2 to 3 percent a year to sustain the force structure and meet modernization needs. However, the recession caused the department to propose a 1 percent budget increase for next year, and the cuts announced Monday were intended to help hold down overall costs. ""We must be mindful of the difficult economic and fiscal situation facing our nation,"" Gates told reporters at the Pentagon. ""As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot expect America's elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job, indeed, everything possible to make every dollar count."" Gate's acknowledged the plan was ""politically fraught,"" and congressional criticism began even before Gates was finished announcing the moves. The proposal to eliminate the Joint Forces Command, which is based in Norfolk, Virginia, met with opposition from both the state's U.S. Democratic senators. Sen. Jim Webb released a statement saying getting rid of it ""would be a step backward and could be harmful"" to the military, while Sen. Mark Warner said: ""I can see no rational basis for dismantling"" the Joint Forces Command. The command, which has an annual budget of $240 million and 2,800 military and civilian employees, is one of the department's 10 ""combatant commands."" Unlike most of the others, it does not have a particular global region of responsibility, such as Central Command that is responsible for the Middle East. The command is made up of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who are trained and equipped to work together in response to the needs of other combatant commands. It grew out of the old Atlantic Command and became the Joint Forces Command in 1999. Gen. James Mattis had been commander until he was recently picked to become Centcom commander. Gen. Raymond Odierno, currently head of U.S. forces in Iraq, has been picked to run the Joint Forces Command. ""I told Ray that his assignment at JFCOM is essentially the same as his assignment in Iraq, and that is working himself out of a job."" Gates said. Eliminating the Joint Forces Command is just one of a wide-ranging series of proposals presented by Gates. Others include: . -- Eliminating some of the 65 military boards and commissions to cut the budget for them by 25 percent in fiscal year 2011; . -- A review of all Defense Department intelligence to eliminate needless duplication; . -- Eliminating the Defense Department's Business Transformation Agency, which has day-to-day oversight of acquisition programs that would be handled by others in the department; . -- Reducing funding for service support contractors by 10 percent a year for each of the next three years; . -- Freezing the number of jobs in the Officer of the Secretary of Defense, the Defense Agencies and Combatant Commands at current levels; . -- Seeking to stop ""brass creep,"" a term former Sen. John Glenn used for situations when higher-ranking officers were doing jobs that lower ranking officers could handle. To address that problem, Gates is ordering a freeze on the number of generals, admirals and senior civilian officials at current levels. Gates was adamant that the Pentagon must change its way of thinking about money. ""The culture of endless money that has taken hold must be replaced by a culture of savings and restraint,"" Gates said. ""Toward this end, I am directing that any new proposal or initiatives, large or small, be it policy, program or ceremony, come with a cost estimate. That price tag will help us determine whether what we are gaining or hope to gain is really worth the cost.""","Defense Department budget cuts could mean the loss of thousands of jobs .

"Washington (CNN) -- School bullying is the target of a two-day summit in Washington that kicked off Wednesday morning with Education Secretary Arne Duncan saying bullying undermines learning in schools. ""It is an absolute travesty of our educational system when students fear for their safety at school, worry about being bullied, or suffer discrimination, taunts, because of their ethnicity, their religion, sexual orientation, disability, or host of other reasons,"" said Duncan. Just under a third of students ages 12-18 reported that they had been bullied in school in a recent study by the National Center for Education statistics.  The study, done during the 2007-2008 school year, found that the harassment predominantly came in the form of ""being made fun of"" and ""being the subject of rumors."" Bullying differs from teasing, according to Kevin Jennings with the Education Department's Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, which is hosting the first-ever summit on bullying.  One reason is that bullying generally involves a power imbalance, he said.. ""The key thing that defines bullying versus teasing is that bullying has ... an impact on the student's ability to achieve and to want to be at school,"" Jennings said. ""Teasing sometimes is unpleasant but (if) it escalates to the point where you actually see students do worse in school or actually avoid areas in school or avoid coming to school, then it goes from teasing to bullying."" The bullying summit, which is being attended by government officials as well as superintendents, researchers, corporate leaders and  students, looks to come up with a national plan to reduce and end bullying. ""Part of the reason we are focusing on bullying is we want to intervene in this cycle early on, before it escalates to harassment and violence and we have horrible incidents like we've all seen on the evening news that terrifies every parent in America,"" Jennings said.","The Education Department is holding its first-ever summit on school bullying .

"(CNN) -- Authorities will resume their search Monday morning for the bodies of four men who are believed to have drowned in southeastern Idaho after one of them fell overboard and three others went missing trying to rescue him, the Power County Sheriff's Department said. ""It is not confirmed they are deceased at this time -- presumption that they are -- but we cannot confirm any deaths at this time or drowning,"" said Cpl. Leilani Morgan. The incident took place Sunday at the American Falls Reservoir, about 180 miles east-southeast of Boise. Five children -- all under the age of nine -- also were on the boat and have been rescued by authorities, according to the sheriff's department.

"(CNN) -- At least one member of the jury that sentenced Cameron Todd Willingham to death in the arson homicides of his three children says she is struggling with the idea that she might have convicted an innocent man. It has been 17 years since Willingham was convicted in Texas of setting a house fire that killed his children, a crime Willingham vehemently denied right up until his execution in 2004. Since that time, three investigations have concluded arson was not the likely cause of the 1991 fire, including one that arrived in Texas Gov. Rick Perry's office 88 minutes before the scheduled execution. Perry replaced four of nine members of the Texas Forensics Sciences Commission in recent weeks, just before the commission was to receive a report from the latest of the three investigations. The controversy has led juror Dorenda Brokofsky to think twice about the decision she made in a jury room in 1992. ""I don't sleep at night because of a lot of this,"" Brokofsky said. ""I have gone back and forth in my mind trying to think of anything that we missed. I don't like the fact that years later someone is saying maybe we made a mistake, that the facts aren't what they could've been."" Brokofsky spoke with CNN by phone from her Midwest home. She has long since moved away from tiny Corsicana, Texas, where the fire took place. ""I do have doubts now,"" she said. ""I mean, we can only go with what we knew at the time, but I don't like the fact now that maybe this man was executed by our word because of evidence that is not true. It may not be true now. And I don't like the fact that I may have to face my God and explain what I did."" ""When you're sitting there with all those facts, there was nothing else we could see,"" she said. ""Now I don't know. I can't tell you he's innocent, I can't say 100 percent he's guilty."" Brokofsky had another revelation. She said she thought she would be excluded from the jury because of her family's close relationship with key witness and then-Corsicana Assistant Fire Chief Douglas Fogg. Her father was also a fire marshal for eight years before the Willingham fire. ""I was raised with my father being a fire marshal,"" she said. ""He went around proving that stuff, so he wasn't here at that time. But I knew Doug Fogg, who was one of the witnesses. It was no secret, but I didn't think they would pick me as a juror because of it."" Critics say Perry's recent actions to shake up the commission were politically motivated, a charge he denies. Perry's office said it received a five-page fax on the day of the execution that contained an arson expert's findings that the fire was not deliberately set. It is unclear whether Perry read the fax. ""Given the brevity of the report and the general counsel's familiarity with all the other facts in the case, there was ample time for the general counsel to read and analyze the report and to brief the governor on its contents,"" Perry spokeswoman Allison Castle said. Willingham was executed less than two hours later. Death-penalty opponents say an impartial review of Willingham's case could lead to an unprecedented admission -- that the state executed an innocent man. The latest report concluded that the arson ruling at the heart of Willingham's conviction ""could not be sustained"" by modern science or the standards of the time. Perry said he remains confident Willingham was guilty, as do authorities in Corsicana, south of Dallas, who prosecuted Willingham. Willingham's wife's brother, Ronnie Kuykendall, said in a signed affidavit that Stacy Willingham told her family that Todd Willingham confessed to killing the children during her visit to him on death row a few days before the execution. But Stacy Willingham testified for her husband during his trial, while her family argued he was guilty. CNN could not reach her for comment. Even Willingham's defense attorney, David Martin, remains confident his client committed the crime. ""There was no question whatsoever that he was guilty,"" Martin said on CNN's ""AC360"" Thursday night. Martin slammed the most recent report on the Willing ham case, by Maryland arson expert Craig Beyler, as ""one of the least objective reports I've ever read."" On Thursday, Perry also lambasted the Beyler report as having ""a very politically driven agenda"" and being propaganda for the anti-death penalty movement. Beyler, asked about Perry's statements, said they were ""strange and clueless.""","Cameron Todd Willingham maintained his innocence up until his execution in 2004 .
